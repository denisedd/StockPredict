{"Headline": "Indonesia Is Pushed to Ban Alcohol for Health of Bodies, if Not Souls", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 I.B. Agung Partha foresees an apocalypse, as he put it, on the Indonesian resort island of Bali.The threat is not a plague of locusts, nor one of Bali\u2019s dormant volcanos springing to life. It is in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital several hundred miles away, where Parliament is debating legislation that would ban beer, wine and spirits across the thousands of islands that make up this country.For Bali, whose beaches, lush landscapes and cultural attractions drew four million visitors last year, the effect would be something like the end of the world, said Mr. Partha, the chairman of the Bali Tourism Board.\u201cHotels have bars, restaurants have bars, and they serve alcohol \u2014 this is just part of tourism,\u201d he said. \u201cThis bill is just no good.\u201dAlcohol bans have been proposed before in Indonesia, by the same Islamic political parties that are pushing the current bill. Their scripture-based arguments gained little traction in Indonesia\u2019s multifaith society, which is mostly Muslim but has a secular government.But this time, those parties have taken a new line: that alcohol should be banned for health reasons, not religious reasons. And a passive response to the legislation by Indonesia\u2019s dominant secular parties, which could have quashed it months ago, has some worried that it could become law.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s all about pluralism and human rights,\u201d said Rudolf Dethu, a leader of two groups opposing the legislation, one of which organizes social events to promote the culinary aspects of beer.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about alcohol \u2014 there\u2019s something bigger behind this,\u201d Mr. Dethu said. \u201cFirst it\u2019s drinking, and then rules on who you can date and what time you can go out at night, and it\u2019s not in the Indonesian culture to say no to authority.\u201dThere have long been fears about creeping Islamization in Indonesia, which is the world\u2019s most-populous Muslim-majority nation but has influential Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities. (The vast majority of Bali\u2019s residents are Hindu.)Political Islam has made gains here since Indonesia began moving toward democracy in 1998, after the ouster of its long-ruling authoritarian president, Suharto. In the past decade, autonomous regional governments have passed hundreds of local bylaws inspired by Islamic law, many of which enforce morality codes. The country\u2019s Constitutional Court is currently hearing a petition by an Islamist group demanding that gay sex be outlawed, and that an existing adultery law be expanded to include sex between unmarried persons.The bill before Parliament would ban the production, distribution, sale, consumption and possession of alcoholic beverages among Indonesians and foreign tourists alike. Violators could face up to 10 years in prison.Critics of the Islamic parties backing the bill \u2014 which have the support of hard-line Muslim groups that have sometimes engaged in violent intimidation \u2014 say their concern for drinkers\u2019 health is a cover for pushing Indonesia toward becoming an Islamic state under Shariah law.Mohammad Arwani Thomafi, a lawmaker from the Islam-based United Development Party and chairman of a special legislative committee debating the bill, said that his party was merely acting out of concern for public health.\u201cProhibition should be a legal requirement to protect the public,\u201d he said, citing \u201cdozens\u201d of deaths across Indonesia each year directly linked to drinking.But while that statistic is accurate, none of those deaths were connected with alcohol sold legally in stores, bars and restaurants \u2014 mostly to relatively affluent Indonesians and to foreigners. Rather, they were caused by illegally brewed spirits, an underground industry involving hundreds or perhaps thousands of producers, to which the Indonesian police have largely turned a blind eye.The Center for Indonesian Policy Studies in Jakarta, citing local media reports, said there had been 453 deaths and 373 injuries from drinking alcohol since 2012. All were from illegally distilled alcohol, locally known as \u201coplosan,\u201d which can contain a variety of substances including methanol, medicinal alcohol, fruit extract and toxic substances such as mosquito repellent.And 83 percent of those deaths occurred in autonomous districts with Shariah-inspired bans or restrictions on the sale of alcohol, said the center\u2019s executive director, Rainer Heufers.Such regulations \u201cdo not increase public morality and health,\u201d Mr. Heufers said. \u201cInstead, they push the consumption from legally produced and traded alcohol to illegally produced and traded alcohol, which leads to more deaths and injuries.\u201dPresident Joko Widodo\u2019s governing coalition, which plays a key role in drafting legislation and holds a majority in Parliament, is against the ban. His government has proposed increased regulation instead, including mandatory licensing for stores that sell alcohol and identification checks for buyers.But Indonesian parties have a history of breaking with their own coalitions on contentious legislation. (Two of the Islamic-based parties backing the bill are members of the governing coalition.) That has some opponents of the bill fearing that it could become law, given that previous attempts to ban alcohol have never gotten this far. The commission debating the legislation includes six large secular-nationalist parties, most of them also in the coalition, that could easily have stopped it but have not done so.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for parliamentarians to be against it, because they could easily be viewed as un-Islamic,\u201d Mr. Heufers said.\u201cThe Indonesian public does not consider this alcohol issue an urgent matter, but some of our politicians do,\u201d said David Christian, a researcher with the group.The bill\u2019s potential economic impact has been hotly debated. Last year, another study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that a total ban on alcohol would reduce Indonesia\u2019s gross domestic product by a mere 0.03 percent and eliminate 128,000 jobs, just 0.1 percent of the country\u2019s official labor force, figures that some found surprisingly low.Mr. Christian, the researcher, said that study only looked at the national economy, not at the presumably more severe effects a ban would have on places like Bali or Jakarta, which has hundreds of upscale hotels, restaurants, wine bars and pubs.Prohibition would also trigger the implosion of the $600 million local alcoholic beverages industry, shutting down Indonesian companies that produce spirits, beer and cider (and closing three wineries in Bali). The largest of these companies is Multi Bintang Indonesia, which brews Bintang, the national beer, and is also the local brewer of Heineken and Guinness.The company \u2014 which opened in 1931, when Indonesia was under Dutch rule \u2014 operates the first Heineken brewery opened outside of the Netherlands, had net sales of $220 million last year, and has a market capitalization of more than $1 billion. The company also invested $50 million during the past two years to upgrade and expand its operations, all of which could be lost, said Michael Chin, the company\u2019s president director.\u201cObviously I am concerned, but it does not stop us from engaging the government and Parliament on a regular basis\u201d about the proposed ban, Mr. Chin said. \u201cThere is no health crisis that is related to legitimate alcohol.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Labor Activists in China Get Suspended Prison Terms", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A court in southern China has sentenced three prominent labor organizers to suspended prison terms, human rights groups and a lawyer for one of them said on Monday, more than nine months after they were arrested amid a crackdown on civic organizations that work outside the Communist Party.The activists, who live in the southern province of Guangdong, could still be imprisoned if found guilty of any further offenses, the lawyer, Lai Shengqi, said by telephone.Mr. Lai\u2019s client, Zeng Feiyang, was charged with \u201cgathering a crowd to disturb social order\u201d and sentenced to three years with a four-year suspension. The two other organizers, Tang Jian and Zhu Xiaomei, were sentenced to one and a half years in prison with two-year suspensions, said William Nee, a China researcher in Hong Kong for Amnesty International.The sentences for Ms. Zhu and Mr. Tang, while relatively mild, were surprising, said Mr. Nee, because the two had already been released on bail, and judging by past practice in China, it was not expected that they would be tried at all.\u201cThings were never perfect \u2014 there was a labor crackdown in 2012 \u2014 but over all, there was a positive direction,\u201d Mr. Nee said by telephone.Pang Kun, a former lawyer for Ms. Zhu, expressed some relief after the suspended sentences were announced because they meant that the activists would not be immediately imprisoned. But, he said, the sentences were \u201cunacceptable\u201d because what Ms. Zhu did \u2014 organize and help workers \u2014 \u201cwas not a crime.\u201dThe suspended sentences will also mean that the activists will find it difficult to continue their work, Mr. Pang said by telephone from Shenzhen. No one answered the phone at the Panyu District Court in Guangzhou, where the sentences were announced.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the authorities want them to depend on the government and the system to deal with similar labor disputes,\u201d Mr. Pang said.Kiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looming Transition Ignites Deadly Clashes in Congo", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 The bodies were still smoking Tuesday morning, hours after the sun had risen and the killers had driven off.They were charred beyond recognition, arms held up in agony, every piece of skin burned away.\u201cIt was the government who did this,\u201d said F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, the son of one of Congo\u2019s most popular opposition figures. \u201cI have no doubt.\u201dAn expression gaining currency here is \u201cToyebi indako.\u201d In Lingala, Kinshasa\u2019s most widely spoken language, it means: I know your house.A crashing economy, Congo\u2019s history of brutality, inescapable poverty and a huge unemployed youth population are all fueling the unrest. As one Western diplomat said on Tuesday, there is a lot of tinder lying around.But the spark is relatively straightforward: a presidential election. Or more precisely, the absence of one.According to the Congolese constitution, President Joseph Kabila, who has been in power for the past 15 years, is required to step down in December.Is Mr. Kabila trying to delay the election as long as possible? Is he ever going to leave?On Monday, thousands of opposition supporters protested in a Kinshasa slum. The demonstration spun out of control when young men rampaged through different neighborhoods, burning down stores, ransacking banks and killing several police officers.The protesters seemed to reserve a special hatred for offices belonging to Mr. Kabila\u2019s political party. At one, they punched a 10-foot hole through a solid brick wall, set fire to a giant picture of Mr. Kabila\u2019s face and then helped themselves to desks, chairs, computers and flat-screen TVs.The revenge came about 18 hours later.According to witnesses, an army truck full of uniformed soldiers zoomed up to the headquarters of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, a leading opposition party. The soldiers fired rocket-propelled grenades into the building and sprayed it with gunfire.By Tuesday morning, the bodies of three men lay on doors that had been ripped off their hinges to serve as stretchers.The three worked as volunteer guards at the opposition headquarters and had been inside the building when it was hit by the grenades. Beyond them lay the other victims, face up, in the rubble.Two other opposition headquarters were attacked, and all witnesses accused the army, though Congo\u2019s government spokesman, Lambert Mende, vigorously denied its involvement.\u201cThe army\u2019s not stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are they going to do, kill people while they\u2019re wearing their uniforms?\u201dIn recent years, human rights groups have documented many instances of Congolese government soldiers killing and raping civilians.Mr. Mende said the government was committed to finding a solution to the election impasse and that it hoped a process called the \u201cdialogue\u201d \u2014 which opposition leaders called the \u201cmonologue\u201d \u2014 would produce a compromise.Mr. Mende said that Mr. Kabila did not intend to stay in power but that he could not simply come out and say that.\u201cWhen a president here in our country says \u2018I won\u2019t run again,\u2019 even if he will be there for three months or one year, it will be three months or one year of anarchy,\u201d Mr. Mende said. \u201cIt\u2019s our culture. We need to have a chief plainly in charge.\u201d\u00c9tienne Tshisekedi, who at 83 is considered the grandfather of the opposition, said he would agree to delay the election under one condition: Mr. Kabila leaves in December.\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will call on the people to take power themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Immigrants Aren\u2019t Taking Americans\u2019 Jobs, New Study Finds", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDo immigrants take jobs from Americans and lower their wages by working for less?The question is at the heart of the furious debate over immigration that has divided the country and polarized the presidential race. Many American workers, struggling to recover from the recession, have said they feel squeezed out by immigrants.Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, has called for a crackdown on illegal immigrants, saying they \u201ccompete directly against vulnerable American workers.\u201d He promises to cut back legal immigration with new controls he says would \u201cboost wages and ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.\u201dHillary Clinton, his Democratic rival, takes an upbeat view, saying immigrants contribute to the economy whether they are here legally or not, by providing labor for American employers and opening businesses that create jobs for Americans rather than taking them.\u2022 \u201cWe found little to no negative effects on overall wages and employment of native-born workers in the longer term,\u201d said Francine D. Blau, an economics professor at Cornell University who led the group that produced the 550-page report.\u2022 Some immigrants who arrived in earlier generations, but were still in the same low-wage labor markets as foreigners just coming to the country, earned less and had more trouble finding jobs because of the competition with newer arrivals.\u2022 Teenagers who did not finish high school also saw their hours of work reduced by immigrants, although not their ability to find jobs. Professor Blau said economists had found many reasons that young people who drop out of high school struggle to find work. \u201cThere is no indication immigration is the major factor,\u201d she said.\u2022 High-skilled immigrants, especially in technology and science, who have come in larger numbers in recent years, had a significant \u201cpositive impact\u201d on Americans with skills, and also on working-class Americans. They spurred innovation, helping to create jobs.\u201cThe prospects for long-run economic growth in the United States would be considerably dimmed without the contributions of high-skilled immigrants,\u201d the report said. It did not focus on American technology workers, many of whom have been displaced from their jobs in recent years by immigrants on temporary visas.The report asked another question Americans are debating: Do immigrants burden government budgets?That answer is \u201cmore mixed,\u201d Professor Blau said.\u2022 The first generation of newcomers generally cost governments more than they contribute in taxes, with most of the costs falling on state and local governments, mainly because of the expense of educating the children of immigrant families.For those governments, total annual costs for first-generation immigrants are about $57 billion. But by the second generation in those families, immigrants, with improved education and taxpaying ability, become a benefit to government coffers, adding about $30 billion a year. By the third generation, immigrant families contribute about $223 billion a year to government finances.\u2022 In the last two decades, the number of immigrants in the country increased 70 percent to about 43 million people; they are now 13 percent of the population. One in every four Americans is either an immigrant or the child of one. And since 2001, about one million immigrants have come legally to the United States each year.The report called immigration \u201cintegral to the nation\u2019s economic growth\u201d because immigrants bring new ideas and add to an American labor force that would be shrinking without them, helping ensure continued growth into the future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Downfall of ITT Technical Institutes Was a Long Time in the Making", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt some campuses, though, this was not the first time students and employees found themselves locked out. More than a decade ago, in 2004, federal agents, search warrants in hand, swooped into the company\u2019s offices in eight states, closing schools briefly as they hunted for evidence of fraud related to student recruitment, enrollment, dropout rates, grade inflation, loans, and reported job placements and salaries.Founded at the end of World War II as part of the original International Telephone & Telegraph, the career schools operation split off into an independent, publicly traded corporation in the mid-1990s. The switch came as liberals and conservatives began a wholehearted embrace of privatization on the theory that professionally managed, profit-oriented businesses could do a better job of delivering public services than nonprofits or the government.Investors, thinking that the for-profit education sector was the next big thing, swarmed.With transformations in the economy, more and more working adults were turning to training programs where factory hands could learn to use computers or home health care aides could earn a nursing degree. Providers like ITT Technical Institutes held out the promise, not just of a good job for eager young prospects, but of steady growth in enrollment and revenue as well.From 2000 to 2003, the sector outran every other on Wall Street. Publicly traded post-secondary-education shares climbed 460 percent, according to one analysis, compared with a 24 percent loss for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Some mutual fund managers boasted that the schools\u2019 owner, ITT, had been their most profitable stock.Yet even as business was booming, troubling accusations of abusive practices in the industry like the ones that resulted in the 2004 federal raid bubbled up. That investigation, brought initially by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Houston, was ultimately closed, but suspicions continued to trail ITT and other for-profit giants.A major grievance was that the industry was overselling programs that left enrollees with deep debt and degrees that had little value in the job market. Students weren\u2019t the only potential victims; so were taxpayers.The company said it was more concerned with the present than the past.\u201cWe\u2019re involved in the complicated and heart-wrenching process of closing our academic institutions after approximately 50 years of outstanding service to students and employers who hire them,\u201d said Nicole Elam, a spokeswoman for ITT Technical Institutes. \u201cWhen students have been abruptly forced into the streets and employees\u2019 livelihood ripped from them,\u201d she added, \u201cregurgitating unproven allegations as a means to justify this horrific end is shameless.\u201dFor ITT, the total haul in federal dollars that year equaled $1.1 billion. Absent that steady stream of public funds, these privately managed businesses would collapse.With Wall Street demanding steady growth, the pressure on the company\u2019s managers was relentless. The chain was adding eight to 10 new campuses a year, according to the Senate committee. Former employees said recruiters pushed to enroll more and more students \u2014 regardless of their preparation, chances of graduating or ability to repay their loans \u2014 even as the company pared instructional costs and raised tuition to increase profits.As employers shed workers, many more people returned to school, taking on enormous debts in the hope of bolstering their credentials and skills and improving their chances on the job market.Profits took off, but so did disenchantment with the industry. Aggrieved students, graduates who found their degrees of little value, even insiders who became whistle-blowers turned to online websites and watchdog groups. Many filed complaints with state prosecutors and regulators, the Education Department and lawmakers.They reported deceptive marketing; strong-arm recruitment tactics; misleading information about costs, courses, graduation and job placement rates; inflated enrollment numbers; bait-and-switch schemes; subpar instruction; and more.Ms. Wofford of Veterans Education Success said that every time the government tried to clamp down on an abuse, some for-profit colleges would come up with a scheme to circumvent the rule, like a private loan program set up by ITT to keep the pipeline of federal funds flowing.\u201cThere\u2019s a perniciousness that\u2019s disturbing,\u201d Ms. Wofford said.Some employees tried to change company practices. Rodney Lipscomb, the former dean of academic affairs at an ITT campus in Tallahassee, Fla., said he was on the job six months, \u201cwhen I really started to say something\u2019s not right.\u201dHired in the spring of 2011, he was disturbed by the aggressive recruitment, something he had never seen during his two decades at public educational institutions. Former students returned to the school, stunned by letters demanding payment for high-interest loans they knew nothing about. Worst of all, he said, staff members would then persuade those same students to re-enroll in unrelated programs and take on even more debt as a way of deferring the loans that were already due.He started filing reports, detailing his concerns.\u201cI really believed at that time, I could fix it if I got to the right folks,\u201d said Mr. Lipscomb, who now works for a community college in Texas. \u201cBut the higher I reported up the chain, the worse the environment got for me.\u201dFinally he was told a lawyer from the company\u2019s headquarters in Indiana and the district manager were coming to Florida to meet with him. \u201cI was very happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought they were going to take action.\u201dInstead, Mr. Lipscomb said, they told him that if he continued to report his complaints, he would be fired.In 2015, he was. He has since filed a whistle-blower suit against ITT Technical Institutes in federal court, accusing the company of defrauding the government of money and wrongful termination.Beyond the spate of private lawsuits, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and 19 states have either investigated or sued ITT. The Education Department actively monitored the company\u2019s finances starting in 2014. But it was last month\u2019s ban on enrolling new students with federal funds that delivered the death blow.Now many current as well as former students have been left stranded.\u201cThis has a huge impact on my life,\u201d said Chris Blank, a 31-year-old former Marine who was studying electrical engineering at an ITT campus in California. \u201cI relied on G.I. benefits. They are all basically wasted and I can\u2019t get any of those back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Resilience, Political Paralysis", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn the more than seven years since the Great Recession ended, the economy has never soared, but it would be fair to say it has been remarkably resilient.Just look at the multiple layers of damage it suffered and survived: The recession took a huge toll on household wealth and employment; Congress has inflicted further damage with tight budgets when more stimulus has been needed; and poor wage growth and widening income inequality, evident before the recession, re-emerged in the recovery and have become entrenched.And yet, the economy has notched sustained if unspectacular annual growth during the recovery, generally of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.What is important to note, however, is that even with those setbacks, monthly job growth has averaged 204,000 positions in the past 12 months and wages have gone up. In addition, employment has risen steadily for much of this year among those ages 25 to 34, a crucial car- and home-buying demographic. There is also a good chance, based on historical patterns, that job growth in August will be revised upward in subsequent reports, because back-to-school hiring often makes it hard to get an initially accurate reading.That is not to play down the economy\u2019s problems, but rather to stress that the economy still has momentum that could be \u2014 and should be \u2014 fostered. The Federal Reserve has done its part by keeping interest rates very low and, given the economy\u2019s low growth trajectory, it should continue to keep rates low.The economy has been showing signs of life. To take advantage of that, however, will require the political will to act that has long been lacking.Advertisement"}

At least four international galleries are investing in showpiece spaces in the capital.\u201cBrexit is a technicality,\u201d said Thaddaeus Ropac, a contemporary art dealer with galleries in Paris and Salzburg, who in June signed a 15-year lease on Ely House, a grand 18th-century mansion in Mayfair that had once housed the antique dealers Mallett.\u201cIt will be expensive and complicated,\u201d Mr. Ropac said, referring to the likelihood of additional paperwork and tariffs on art sales. \u201cBut London is London,\u201d he added. \u201cThe museums are here. The auction houses are here. The best galleries in the world are here. I do not see another city taking London\u2019s place. Madrid? Los Angeles? I just don\u2019t see it.\u201dGalerie Thaddaeus Ropac London, set to open next spring, will join the most comprehensive array of contemporary art galleries in any city in Europe. International names such as Gagosian, Pace, David Zwirner, Hauser & Wirth, Michael Werner, Dominique Levy, Skarstedt and Marian Goodman have all opened spaces in the West End since 2010, joining established British dealers such as White Cube, Sadie Coles and Timothy Taylor.With five floors spread over some 16,000 square feet, Mr. Ropac\u2019s gallery in the Palladian-style residence, once home to the Bishop of Ely, is one of the boldest interventions yet. The building, remodeled by the New York architect Annabelle Selldorf, will feature four contrasting gallery spaces \u2014 a sort of contemporary art \u201cmultiplex.\u201dMr. Ropac\u2019s Paris and Salzburg dealerships represent major international artists including Antony Gormley, Adrian Ghenie, Anselm Kiefer and Gilbert & George. He expects his Ely House branch to concentrate on historical shows by his gallery stable, artists\u2019 estates, \u201csecondary\u201d sales of works that have already appeared on the market and shows by artists who are not yet represented in the city. His inaugural show in the spring, for example, will feature new work by the young British sound sculptor Oliver Beer.\u201cWe have wanted to have a stronger secondary market for a while,\u201d Mr. Ropac said, adding that it was easier to sell such works in London than in Paris. \u201cThe art market is more strongly developed in London.\u201dIn 2015, Britain\u2019s auction houses and dealers generated 21 percent of the world\u2019s art and antiques sales, compared with 6 percent in France and 2 percent in Germany, according the 2016 Tefaf Art Market Report, published in March.\u201cI was surprised there was such a quick and good response to our Savile Row space,\u201d said Ms. Rech, who added that her London gallery had attracted at least 10 collectors whom she had never met before. \u201cBut I needed to present larger shows.\u201dHer inaugural exhibition at Grosvenor Hill, which opens on Oct. 4 during the week of the Frieze art fairs in London, is devoted to Jeff Koons, who is also represented by Gagosian. The show will include at least four new \u201cGazing Ball\u201d paintings and sculptures (the former inspired by old masters, the latter by Duchamp ready-mades) and at least one stainless steel \u201cBallerina\u201d sculpture. Prices range from about $1 million to about $8 million.Ms. Rech is optimistic about the prospects for London after Britain leaves the European Union. \u201cLondon has been the capital of European business and finance,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to give that up. I\u2019m sure they will find a solution.\u201dOthers, like Bona Montagu, the director of the London branch of the New York dealership Skarstedt, see an exit from the union as an opportunity for the art trade.Skarstedt, like Rech, is opening a plush new street-level gallery in London. Its 1,765-square-foot space, around the corner from the Ritz hotel, will open on Sept. 30 with a joint exhibition of Cindy Sherman \u201cHistory Portraits\u201d from 1988-90, and David Salle \u201cTapestry Paintings\u201d from 1989-91, priced at $500,000 to $1.2 million.The show will complement the gallery\u2019s booth at the Frieze Masters fair, opening the following week.Colnaghi merged last year with the 10-year-old Madrid dealership Coll & Cort\u00e8s, and the company\u2019s new partners, Jorge Coll and Nicolas Cort\u00e8s, who specialize in 17th-century Spanish painting and sculpture, have been the driving force behind a contemporary makeover of the space.

{"Headline": "In Australia, China\u2019s Appetite Shifts From Rocks to Real Estate", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "China\u2019s breakneck growth fueled an iron ore boom in Western Australia. Now, Chinese investors are fleeing a cooling economy by investing in Australian homes.Supported byPORT HEDLAND, Australia \u2014 A lanky, dark-haired surfer, Lee Meadowcroft modeled on the runways of London, Milan and Singapore, then followed his dream of going home to Australia to sell herbal medicines. His store failed \u2014 he had chosen the wrong street, he says \u2014 and he lost almost all his savings. By then, the fashion world had found fresher faces.So like tens of thousands of other Australians, Mr. Meadowcroft went to the mines.It was late 2004. He plowed his last $4,000 into a two-week course on how to operate a crane. He found companies so desperate for workers that they would send chauffeured cars to pick up prospective welders, electricians and crane operators and deliver them to the nearest airport for their flights to mining country, here on Australia\u2019s remote northwestern coast.China back then was growing at a breathtaking pace and needed all the Australian rocks it could get. Mine workers like Mr. Meadowcroft kept a punishing schedule: 13 consecutive days of 12-hour shifts, a day off, then another 13 consecutive days of 12-hour shifts. Mining fueled Australia\u2019s surging exports to China, which at their peak reached nearly $100 billion a year \u2014 a figure representing $4,300 for every man, woman and child in the country.Resource-rich places around the world prospered thanks to China, and Mr. Meadowcroft and his fellow Port Hedland equipment jockeys were no exception. By 2011 he was earning $250,000 a year. He watched idle miners sketch circles in the dust and place cockroaches inside, at times betting more than $100 on which one crawled out first. One welder bought a Ferrari 308 sports car, quickly tired of it and sold raffle tickets for $1,000 apiece to get rid of it.\u201cEveryone just went crazy,\u201d Mr. Meadowcroft said.The bust came just as hard and just as fast. China\u2019s economic slowdown left too many mines to feed too many dormant Chinese steel mills. Construction of new mines stopped. Port Hedland\u2019s economy slumped. Mr. Meadowcroft lost his job, then lost a second job. Like thousands of others, he went back home.Mr. Meadowcroft\u2019s tale could serve as yet another boom-and-bust cautionary tale of the limits of China\u2019s rise. From Russia to Brazil, and Nigeria to Venezuela, resource-rich countries that boomed during China\u2019s surge found their economies shaken when Chinese demand slowed.Except something unexpected has happened to Australia: It has withstood the global rout. Most mines \u2014 lower-cost compared with mines elsewhere \u2014 have stayed open. But Australia has also kept thriving, against all expectations, with a different kind of money flowing in from China.Attracted by clean air, a strong education system and worries about China\u2019s future, more Chinese are spending their money in Australia. Thousands of Chinese families have sent their children to study at costly Australian universities, and Australian food exports to China have boomed. Chinese investment in Australian real estate has increased at least tenfold since 2010; Chinese investors have purchased up to half the new apartments in downtown Melbourne and Sydney.But for people like Mr. Meadowcroft and others in Western Australia who were cut loose by the mining slump, Chinese money is a blessing. He now lives in the Western Australia capital city of Perth and works as an apprentice plumber in new housing developments aimed at Chinese buyers. He earns just $21,000 a year, but that could double or triple when he finishes his apprenticeship.When visitors from China enter his construction site, he knows they may be the eventual buyers. \u201cIf you see a group of Chinese people,\u201d he says, \u201cthey\u2019re the money.\u201dIn Port Hedland, the color of money is pinkish red.At the docks, the salmon-hued dust coats everything, from the yellow railings atop the cranes to the rims of the fast-moving conveyor belts that hurtle rocks toward the bellies of giant cargo vessels. When the mining boom started 50 years ago, it covered the streets, too.\u201cIt made all your clothes go pink,\u201d said Julie Arif, a city council member who was still a girl when workers began digging mines in the nearby Pilbara desert and hills. \u201cPilbara pink, we used to call it.\u201dBack then, local leaders did not mind. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about our dust when it clogs the cash registers,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor in the early 1970s, according to Ms. Arif, who also runs the town\u2019s small history museum.The pink dust comes from iron ore. And nobody sends more iron ore abroad than the state of Western Australia.Iron ore transformed Port Hedland. Named \u201cMarapikurrinya\u201d by the local Aboriginal people, it subsisted for years on wool exports and a few pearls gathered from oysters at low tide. Until the mining boom, its claim to fame was a late-1940s three-year strike by nearby ranch workers that became a pivotal moment in the assertion of Aboriginal rights in Australia.The iron ore deposits were far from Australia\u2019s steel industry on the country\u2019s southern coast. But the Australian government began allowing large-scale iron ore exports in the 1960s, opening up the region to buyers from Japan and Europe.As foreign money trickled in, Port Hedland remained rough around the edges. When Cyclone Joan flattened half of Port Hedland in 1975, the state government replaced the shattered hospital with a prefabricated structure propped up on the dirt with thin, foot-high steel poles. It stayed in use for nearly 40 years before it was abandoned, and now stands vacant on its oceanfront site.For entertainment, there were the \u201cskimpies\u201d \u2014 stripper shows by young women who barely complied with state regulations against full nudity at the start of each evening, and were even less likely to comply as the hour grew late.The ore is mined several hours\u2019 drive into the desert from Port Hedland. Workers use explosives to shatter the rock at open-cut mines, then scoop it up with huge bulldozers. The ore is crushed and sorted by machines bigger than a house, then hauled to Port Hedland either by train or by enormous trucks \u2014 so-called road trains \u2014 pulling three or sometimes four trailers.During a crimson Indian Ocean sunset at Port Hedland\u2019s Utah Point berth recently, a conveyor belt dumped iron ore into one of the seven large holds of a Chinese-owned freighter held in place by mechanical suction cups the size of minivans. A red gravel torrent rocketed downward at two tons a second, in a low, dull roar. Each hold was big enough for a capacious American home, with room to spare.The crane lurched to one side, stopped disgorging iron ore, rumbled sideways to a position over a different hold, near the middle of the vessel, and resumed pouring.Iron ore sometimes means dangerous work. Mr. Meadowcroft once saw a taut, inch-thick steel cable snap and sweep a man into a pile of steel pipes. Another time, he saw a 50-pound steel cable block fall on a worker, shearing off part of his face and shoulder and hurling him to the floor.\u201cIt bounced him off the ground like a basketball,\u201d Mr. Meadowcroft said. \u201cThere was a lot of blood.\u201dBut life was mostly quiet \u2014 and inexpensive. The town had eight amateur baseball teams, and many of the workers played after their shifts. Housing was affordable. Sharon Ramirez, 40, remembers that her parents had a chance in the late 1980s to buy the bungalow they were renting for $20,000, but decided not to.\u201cWe didn\u2019t jump at it,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it was a lot of money in those days.\u201dEveryone in Port Hedland has a story about a moment when the boom struck them.For Mrs. Ramirez, it was when that rental home sold to an out-of-town investor for $1 million. For Dave McGowan, it was when four of the eight baseball teams disbanded because workers were putting in 12-hour shifts instead of eight-hour shifts. For Daniel Connors, it was when a local garage, short on workers, told him that he had to make a reservation four months in advance to get the oil in his car changed.China was changing \u2014 and it changed Port Hedland.Three decades of economic reform in China, plus lower trade barriers after the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, lit a fire under the economy there. Skyscrapers blossomed by the hundreds in obscure cities. The nation has built 77,000 miles of expressway, almost all of it since 1997 and two-thirds more mileage than the Interstate highway system in the United States, on which China\u2019s network is modeled.All that construction meant China produced and consumed last year almost as much steel as the rest of the world combined.To supply its steel mills, China needed Australia\u2019s iron ore. Iron ore prices surged tenfold. Big companies like BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group rushed to build mines and add port berths as fast as possible.The boom was on.Little Port Hedland became one of the biggest ports in the world, handling a greater tonnage of freight each year than the ports of Los Angeles, Hong Kong or Antwerp, Belgium. Skilled welders and electricians earned as much as $350,000 a year, drawing workers from around the country. The town\u2019s population doubled, to a peak of about 30,000, and would have increased a lot more except that a dispute over Aboriginal claims to land on the city\u2019s outskirts blocked construction and resulted in a housing shortage.Much of the high pay came from overtime, or what became known as \u201cdivorce rosters\u201d or \u201csuicide rosters.\u201d Mining companies flew workers into remote camps to work 27 days with a single day off in the middle, then flew them home again. Welders in their \u201chigh-viz\u201d \u2014 reflective, high-visibility yellow mining shirts \u2014 spent months drenched in sweat as they labored outside through long summers in coastal desert heat reaching 110 degrees.All that overtime pay pushed prices to stratospheric levels. Port Hedland\u2019s bakery, butcher, newsstand, charter fishing operator and scuba-diving shop all closed, unable to cope with soaring rents and locals who would rather work for mining companies than the shops.Ray Sampson, the owner of a local diner, paid $1,600 a week to rent a small house for his out-of-town cooks and waitresses. With his diner packed daily, he then had to rent a second small house, for $1,800 a week, to house more workers, mostly hitchhikers who drifted through town for a few weeks and were the only people willing to accept jobs as cooks and waiters.Real estate prices and rents took off. Affluent families from elsewhere in Australia and from mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore heard about the profits from charging four-digit weekly rents and swooped in to invest.Lorren Murphy, a convenience store owner from Perth, flew up to Port Hedland four years ago and paid almost $2 million for a two-story house. He quickly signed a two-year lease with a tenant willing to pay $4,100 a week \u2014 nearly $18,000 a month.He was envious of others who had even more money to invest, because it seemed like a sure bet. \u201cI\u2019ve got a friend who dropped $6 million here,\u201d Mr. Murphy recalled.The town finally replaced its prefabricated hospital and added a swimming center, an air-conditioned basketball arena, a new courthouse, a skateboard park and more. Outside Port Hedland, the state government in Perth spent on hospitals, new power lines and water systems and a $1 billion Australian football stadium.But 4,000 miles away, trouble was brewing. China\u2019s debt-choked developers were starting fewer buildings. Steel use fell 3 percent in 2014 and an additional 5 percent in 2015, even as more steel mills were being built in anticipation of never-ending growth. Manufacturers were becoming more cautious about putting up more factories.\u201cThis is a bigger bust than anyone ever saw.\u201dNearly 200 miles south of Port Hedland, the Iron Valley iron ore mine squats in a red desert of drought-stunted eucalyptus trees and maroon cliffs.Kim Sheppard, the general manager until he moved to a different position last month, climbed the staircase of a three-story yellow apparatus coated with reddish-pink grime that clanged as it crushed and sorted iron ore into small pebbles. The highly automated operation requires only four workers and a supervisor for each work shift, as well as a few mechanics, blasting specialists and managers at an air-conditioned building nearby. At the peak of construction, a couple of hundred workers labored here.The desert around the site used to be dotted with large camps of workers, building more mines. Now the desert is empty.\u201cThere are always booms and busts,\u201d Mr. Sheppard said. \u201cBut this one is different.\u201dPort Hedland felt the pain quickly. Iron ore prices plummeted. Worried that workers might get angry and damage multimillion-dollar equipment, mining companies laid off tens of thousands of construction workers.\u201cOne day they just called in the trucks for lunch, and they said, \u2018Bring in your backpacks,\u2019 which was unheard-of,\u201d said Shannon Baker, a former power shovel operator at a mine near Iron Valley. \u201cThey got us together in the crew room and they said, \u2018The planes are at the airport to take you out.\u2019\u201dRents and housing prices have fallen by three-quarters, said Jim Henneberry, the owner of one of Port Hedland\u2019s biggest real estate brokerage firms. A fifth of the town\u2019s homes sit empty.Bill Dziombak spent $1 million apiece to build luxury townhouses here, only to see rents and prices collapse. \u201cI never expected this to go bang the way it did, in just 12 months,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like falling off the edge of a cliff.\u201dCustomers at Camilo Blanco\u2019s car repair garage no longer need reservations. \u201cI\u2019ve had customers coming in and saying, \u2018This is the last time I\u2019ll see you, because I have to leave town,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Blanco, who is also Port Hedland\u2019s acting mayor.Departing miners have sold so many used power boats, muscle cars and dune buggies that the local market is glutted. Mr. Blanco was recently offered an options-laden $14,000 Rhino dune buggy for half that price, and he still bargained: \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll pay you five grand for it,\u2019 and it\u2019s sitting in my yard now.\u201dLocal leaders who spent heavily during the boom times are now under pressure to cut real estate taxes, which in many cases are still based on eye-wateringly high property values. Simply operating Port Hedland\u2019s new basketball arena costs $2 million a year, or 3 percent of the city\u2019s annual budget.\u201cIt\u2019s like surfing,\u201d said Colin Barnett, the premier of Western Australia state, in an interview in Perth. \u201cWhen the wave comes, you\u2019ve got to catch it and you\u2019ve got to ride it hard and get everything out of it. When the wave\u2019s not there, you\u2019ve got to paddle hard, and we\u2019re paddling hard at the moment.\u201dEven in the middle of the worst of the mining slump, Australia has found a potential source of strength, again from China: people like Ike Wang.Mr. Wang, 24, graduated last year from Murdoch University in Perth, where he was one of hundreds of students from mainland China. He is looking for a full-time job in marketing and, despite Western Australia\u2019s slowdown, he has an advantage: His family back in Tianjin, China, paid $370,000 at the start of this year to buy him a two-bedroom apartment.The 13th-floor apartment, with white walls and a white carpet, is nearly empty of furniture. But it has a good view over the city and what seems like solid workmanship. (Coincidentally, Mr. Meadowcroft did some of the plumbing for the complex.)The apartment gives Mr. Wang a free place to live while he decides his next move. \u201cI like that it\u2019s a new apartment,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is new and clean.\u201dReal estate developers say that they see a lot of Chinese families eager to buy homes in Australia. \u201cI think the investment return is the No. 2 concern \u2014 it\u2019s about getting money somewhere that is stable and safe, it\u2019s about getting the money out\u201d of China, said Paul Blackburne, a developer of numerous Perth apartment complexes.As in the United States, low interest rates have also fanned demand for houses and apartments from local buyers. Australian government data shows that it approved $18.2 billion in Chinese real estate investments in the year that ended June 30, 2015, twice as much as the year before, and more than triple the total last year for the United States, which was the second-largest overseas investor. And developers say that a lot more Chinese money is quietly flowing into Australian real estate without government approvals.Port Hedland and the entire state of Western Australia face budget problems. The state has begun moving to sell a 50-year lease on the Utah Point berth, possibly to a Chinese buyer, despite objections from smaller companies like Mineral Resources, which owns the low-cost Iron Valley mine and cannot use the other docks because they are controlled by giant rivals like BHP. (Mr. Meadowcroft coincidentally helped build the Utah Point berth as well.)But unemployment has barely risen in Port Hedland or in Western Australia over all. Some, like Mr. Meadowcroft, found jobs in Perth. Many moved east to Sydney and Melbourne to work in the construction sector there.One worry in Australia is whether the country is now on an economic trajectory similar to that of the United States a decade earlier. Australia\u2019s central bank warned in April that if Chinese demand faltered, Australia\u2019s real estate market could suffer and the country\u2019s banking system, heavily exposed to home mortgages, could be harmed.But for now, Chinese money is still flowing. Many miners who squandered their earnings during the iron ore boom are now trying to catch up in construction jobs. But many others socked away their money from the boom and have used those savings to buy homes or start small businesses.\u201cThey were micro-entrepreneurs,\u201d said Tom Barratt, a University of Western Australia doctoral student who is doing his thesis on labor markets in the Pilbara hills.Mr. Meadowcroft is among those savers. He bought a house and soon paid off most of the mortgage. He also married his longtime girlfriend after years of commuting to far-flung mines and ports, and is now raising two children as he learns to be a plumber.Although his savings account is much smaller now, he has no regrets about the boom years. \u201cThat was 12 years of really hard work,\u201d he said, \u201cto achieve what a lot of people don\u2019t achieve in their whole lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the Debaters: What Shall We Do About the Tech Careening Our Way?", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtHere\u2019s a question I\u2019m hoping comes up at Monday\u2019s presidential debate: Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump, what would you do about self-driving trucks?That sounds goofy, but it\u2019s big league. The self-driving truck is an 18-wheeled trick question barreling toward us from an uncertain future. In testing how Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton might respond to the not-too-distant possibility of trucks that drive themselves, we might get at something most political debates fail to address: how the candidates are weighing the costs and benefits of rapid, unpredictable and transformative technological change.But it wouldn\u2019t all be rainbows. At least at first, the autonomous technology wouldn\u2019t be perfect. Errors and bugs, perhaps fatal ones, might spark politically damaging fear and outrage. In the long run, if the trucks prove successful and our logistics infrastructure adjusts to accommodate them, they could begin to displace the three million Americans (mostly men) who now drive trucks for a living, not to mention truck stops and the small towns that depend on them.There would be deeper issues to consider: The threat of hacking, the narrowing economic control over a vital lane of national commerce, and a growing detachment from America\u2019s ineffable, often irrational love affair with the open road.Though less than a year old, Otto has a fleet of six trucks now constantly driving across California to test its technology, which the company aims to sell as an aftermarket add-on to trucking companies sometime in the next few years. When it\u2019s for sale, Otto\u2019s system will drive the truck fully on freeways; the driver will take over on all other roads, as well as assist in other functions (refueling, filling out paperwork).How Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton think about autonomous trucks is in some ways a test case for their ideas about technology generally. It might reveal how they would weigh the benefits of innovation \u2014 which usually accrue diffusely to the nation at large \u2014 against the particular burdens borne by a small group (the truck drivers who might lose their jobs, in this case).Their answer might also illuminate how they would balance competing advances and losses for the economy, the labor market, health and safety and the environment. More fundamentally, their thoughts on trucks could give us a look into their deepest ideas about technology. Are they more inclined toward bold, optimistic grabs at the future, or to recoil at the potentially devastating possibilities of its being unleashed?As far as I can tell, Mr. Trump has not talked about self-driving trucks.\u201cA new truck costs $160,000 to $200,000, and they can basically only drive it nine hours a day,\u201d Mr. Ron said. With Otto\u2019s technology, the driver would be able to double his output \u2014 he could drive all day, then take a nap while the rig barrels along the road, then come back to driving.\u201cThe truck is always productive,\u201d Mr. Ron said. \u201cThey\u2019re making more money, because they can use it more. They\u2019re seeing their families more often, because they can finish their long-haul routes faster. And most importantly, they\u2019re safer.\u201dThe technology is not there yet. During a recent ride on the freeways surrounding Otto\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, an Otto driver and engineer showed me how the prototype was working. After self-driving was flipped on, the rig handled most conditions fairly well \u2014 it steered itself around bends and maintained a consistent distance from other vehicles.But about a half-dozen times during the 20-minute ride, the cab emitted a sharp beep warning the driver that it detected some trouble, and that it needed him to immediately take over. The engineer noted each of these instances; back at the office, Otto\u2019s techies will examine each incident to teach the system better tricks.For truck drivers, the benefits of automation are less certain. Kara Deniz, a spokeswoman for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, told me the union had not issued any policy decisions on automation because there were more questions than answers about the impact of self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe believe experienced, skilled drivers will be needed well into the future,\u201d she added.Several truckers I talked to were resistant to automation.\u201cThe idea that we\u2019ll go to automated trucks and then drivers will sleep while the truck drives \u2014 not a chance in hell. I would never do that,\u201d Wade Dowden, 32, who\u2019s been driving a truck for 10 years, told me while he was on the road in Houston.Mr. Dowden is no technophobe. He said easy access to live maps and mobile entertainment had made everything about driving a truck much less stressful than before. Now Mr. Dowden spends his days listening to audiobooks and podcasts, and when he\u2019s not driving, he watches Netflix and studies for a degree in transportation management.Yet he isn\u2019t ready to turn over his truck to a computer.\u201cIt would make the job not worth doing,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019re only paying a guy to drive the final miles into a city, we\u2019re certainly not going to get a raise for that.\u201dThat leads back to what Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump might say about self-driving trucks if they were asked on Monday. There are many potential policy ideas to delay, accelerate or ease this transition. They could ban self-driving trucks entirely. Or they could also institute a retraining program for drivers. Or do nothing and see what happens.Mr. Dowden, though, has no faith either will do anything meaningful to address the issue, because he thinks both are out of touch. \u201cThey just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Fed Is About to Raise Interest Rates", "Date": null, "News": "Advertisement\nWhen the Fed increased its benchmark interest rate last December after keeping it near zero for seven years, Fed officials were in general agreement that they might raise rates as many as four times in 2016. Instead, they are likely to increase them for the first time this year at their final meeting of 2016, on Dec. 13 and 14. During an economic recovery, the number of people who can\u2019t find work gradually dwindles. Employers start chasing applicants. Wages start to rise. And the Fed, worried about inflation, starts raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.More than seven years into the current recovery, the unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, a historically normal level, but the rest of the picture doesn\u2019t look quite right. The unemployment figure counts only people who are actively seeking work, but millions of adults remain on the sidelines. By keeping rates low, the Fed could draw more of those people back into the work force. But labor market conditions are tightening, wages are rising, and policy makers increasingly are worried about overheating. If the Fed were to \u201cdelay increases in the federal funds rate for too long, it could end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly,\u201d Ms. Yellen told Congress last month. The Fed cut its benchmark rate by five percentage points in response to the Great Recession. That is five points of stimulus, right? Well, Fed officials are increasingly convinced that it has become more like three points of stimulus.Global interest rates are in a historic swoon. The problem can be described as a glut of money or an absence of attractive investment opportunities. One consequence is a narrowing gap between the market rate and the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate.That means the Fed is providing less stimulus than it thought, which in turn means it doesn\u2019t need to pull back quite so quickly, since it doesn\u2019t have as far to go. But \u2026The Fed usually increases rates because it fears inflation, and inflation remains sluggish, in part because of the weakness of the global economy. But Fed officials have other worries. Notably, they are worried about creating future financial crises.Low rates are intended to encourage financial speculation. But too much risk-taking is not a good thing. And the longer rates stay low, the greater the risks. Fed officials have highlighted some areas, like commercial real estate, but they are also worried about the problems they cannot see. After all, the next crisis usually comes from a different place than the last one.20%Paul A.VolckerAlanGreenspanJanet L.Yellen15Each Fedchairman\u2019stenureBen S.Bernanke1050\u201980\u201985\u201990\u201995\u201900\u201905\u201910\u20191520%Paul A.VolckerAlanGreenspanBen S.BernankeJanet L.Yellen15Each Fedchairman\u2019stenure1050\u201980\u201985\u201990\u201995\u201900\u201905\u201910\u20191520%Paul A.VolckerAlanGreenspanBen S.BernankeJanet L.Yellen15Each Fedchairman\u2019stenure1050\u201980\u201985\u201990\u201995\u201900\u201905\u201910\u20191520%Paul A.VolckerAlanGreenspanBen S.BernankeJanet L.Yellen15Each Fedchairman\u2019stenure1050\u201980\u201985\u201990\u201995\u201900\u201905\u201910\u201915It seems like a distant fever: In the late 1970s and early \u201980s, energy prices soared and the inflation rate rose into the double digits, spiking at nearly 15 percent. To bring inflation under control, Paul A. Volcker, as Fed chairman, pushed the benchmark rate up to 20 percent (and home buyers looking for a 30-year fixed mortgage paid up to 18 percent). The higher rates plunged the economy into a deep recession. Since then, inflation has fallen sharply, but the economy has had a harder time delivering broad-based prosperity as inequality has widened and incomes for most Americans have stagnated. This pattern has continued even as the United States has slowly recovered from the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent financial crisis. Fed officials, like sailors trying to make headway on a windless sea, have resorted to a number of extraordinary measures, including pumping trillions of dollars into the banking system and leaving short-term rates near zero for years, in an effort to revive the economy. But the Fed\u2019s inability to restore growth to historical levels has exposed shortcomings in current macroeconomic theory and set off a vigorous debate over how to navigate a changing economic environment. Putting the United States in a global frame, Ms. Yellen, in a speech in August, discussed the \u201cmarked decline\u201d in the interest rate levels necessary to bring about maximum employment and output. The reasons are varied, she said: a slowdown in population growth in many countries, smaller productivity gains and a \u201cdecreased propensity to spend\u201d because of various financial crises around the world since the late 1990s.

The Chinese Communist Party doesn\u2019t trust the invisible hand of capitalism alone to encourage entrepreneurship, especially since it is a big part of the leadership\u2019s strategy to reshape the sagging economy.Which is why the government of Hangzhou \u2014 a former royal capital that has been a major commercial hub for more than a millennium \u2014 built Dream Town and lavishes resources on start-ups. The businesses here get a slate of benefits like subsidized rent, cash handouts and special training, all courtesy of the city.Chemayi, which offers car repair services through a smartphone app, is staying rent-free at Dream Town for three years and is applying for as much as $450,000 in subsidies from city authorities to help pay salaries and buy equipment.\u201cFrom the central government all the way down to local governments, we have seen a lot of warm support,\u201d said Li Liheng, co-founder and chief executive of Chemayi.For much of China\u2019s long economic boom, young people flocked to manufacturing zones for jobs making bluejeans or iPhones. But today China is trying to move beyond just being the world\u2019s factory floor. Policy makers want the next generation to find better-paying work in modern offices, creating the ideas, technologies and jobs to feed the country\u2019s future growth.Premier Li Keqiang frequently calls for \u201cmass entrepreneurship.\u201d In March at the National People\u2019s Congress, he bragged that 12,000 new companies were founded each day in 2015.The entrepreneurial embrace comes with lots of financial support. Across the country, officials are creating investment funds, providing cash subsidies and building incubators.\u201cWithout these kinds of subsidies, you only rely on private money, and you wouldn\u2019t see so many technology start-ups happening today,\u201d said Ning Tao, a partner at Innovation Works, a venture capital fund in Beijing. \u201cWithout quantity, you cannot have quality.\u201dBut the heavy spending is adding to worries about an inflating bubble in the world of China\u2019s tiniest companies. Along with the government funds, venture capital money is flooding the country. About $49 billion in deals were made last year, making China second only to the United States, according to the accounting firm Ernst & Young.Some economists and entrepreneurs are concerned that the government is helping fuel a frenzy that might ultimately result in failed businesses, wasted resources and financial losses. Just one city, Suzhou, near Shanghai, has announced it will open 300 incubators by 2020 to house 30,000 start-ups.Beijing\u2019s policy makers have a long history of giving favored companies easy access to loans and subsidies to propel certain industries, with both good and bad consequences. Though that tactic lubricated the nation\u2019s industrialization, it also contributed to the excess that has buried the country in empty apartment blocks, mothballed cement plants and sputtering steel mills \u2014 all of which threaten the economy\u2019s stability.\u201cI think the subsidies shouldn\u2019t be a long-term policy,\u201d Jin Xiangrong, an economist at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, said of the start-up support programs. \u201cThey can lead to overcapacity like the kind we see now in China\u2019s manufacturing sector, which is largely a result of government support.\u201dHangzhou city officials turned down requests for interviews.At Dream Town, Mr. Li, 39, frets more about his own business. He got the initial idea for Chemayi in 2009 after a car accident. To find a trustworthy mechanic, he searched online, asked friends for advice and visited repair shops.But Mr. Li found it difficult to judge who was reliable. A car culture \u2014 and all the services that come with it \u2014 is relatively new in China.Aiming to fill the information void, he and three friends set up Chemayi in 2013 with 5 million renminbi (currently $750,000) of their own money. For an annual fee, Chemayi sends out staff members to help fix flat tires, paint scratches or repair broken-down engines.\u201cHenry Ford is gone for so many years, but we are still driving his cars,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cI felt that I also must pursue a cause that will persist after I\u2019m gone.\u201dChemayi beat out more than two dozen other start-ups for a coveted space in Dream Town in a 2014 competition. Another co-founder, Ouyang Feng, delivered a 40-minute presentation to a panel of judges who peppered him with questions about Chemayi\u2019s business model and future prospects. The provincial governor watched over the grilling.In the end, the committee awarded Chemayi a three-foot golden key that symbolically opened the doors to Dream Town.Chemayi now has 284 employees in four cities, with plans to reach 1,000 by the end of the year. Mr. Li said his company had raised $22 million in private money and turned a profit of about 10 million renminbi last year.\u201cA lot of Chinese people want to be successful. They want to initiate change through innovation,\u201d Mr. Li said in his spacious corner office, while fussing with a traditional Chinese wooden tea-making set. \u201cThat is a formidable power.\u201dHangzhou is a natural center for China\u2019s start-up fever. After China embraced capitalist reform in the 1980s, Zhejiang province, of which Hangzhou is the capital, emerged as a leading base for the export industries that fueled the country\u2019s rapid growth. Factories pumped out products like socks and plastic Christmas trees.Now that zeal for commerce is being channeled into technology start-ups. Hangzhou is home to China\u2019s most famous internet company, the e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has become a training ground for would-be entrepreneurs.The neighborhoods near Alibaba\u2019s sprawling campus, once a poorly developed area on the city\u2019s outskirts, now make up a budding tech center with newly built office parks like Dream Town, dominated by ambitious college graduates, angel investors and venture capitalists. The local restaurants have become hangouts to exchange ideas and gossip over fried squid and stewed pork and eggs.Feng Xiao is typical of this new breed. Mr. Feng, 39 and a Hangzhou native, spent 11 years at Alibaba, mainly in sales and marketing.\u201cThere is a Chinese proverb, \u2018The soil is too rich,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feng said. Alibaba \u201coffered you a lot of opportunities. It was easy to have a sense of success. But I wanted to be able to start from scratch.\u201dHis start-up was born in Alibaba\u2019s cafeteria, where he ate meal after meal. \u201cI really missed Mom\u2019s cooking,\u201d he said. He figured that many other people, trapped working for long hours far from home, felt the same.Mr. Feng and two other Alibaba employees left their jobs in 2014 and opened a food delivery service, Mishi. Their plan was to connect people willing to prepare homemade meals with on-the-go professionals who were too busy to cook. They set up shop in a friend\u2019s empty house, decorated with secondhand furniture and photos from home.Along with raising $19 million from private investors, Mishi caught the eye of the Hangzhou city government. In 2014, district officials awarded Mishi 5 million renminbi to help pay the bills. Its rent in a Hangzhou office park is also subsidized.\u201cThe most important thing on the part of the government is whether they are open\u201d to new types of businesses, Mr. Feng said. \u201cWe are glad to see they are aggressively supporting us.\u201dHangzhou represents what Chinese leaders see as the nation\u2019s economic future. The country used to generate astronomical growth rates by depending heavily on low-cost exports and extremely high investment in apartment towers, factories and highways. China built so many steel mills that it can produce 10 times as much steel as the United States.But today, costs are rising, eating away at the competitiveness of many export industries. The long investment boom has saddled the economy with too many factories and a mountain of debt.Instead, policy makers are encouraging a shift to new growth engines, like services and high tech. The entrepreneurial focus is providing an economic boost for Hangzhou.The city\u2019s gross domestic product rose 10.2 percent in 2015, compared with the 6.9 percent national growth rate. Hangzhou\u2019s service sector, which includes many start-ups, was the main engine of that strong performance, surging 14.6 percent.\u201cThe Chinese know that state-owned enterprises are not going to employ everybody,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at GGV Capital, a venture capital firm that operates in both Silicon Valley and China. \u201cThey need young people to create jobs for themselves, so they are encouraging them to try something new.\u201dMishi, the food delivery start-up, has created 100 full-time jobs, and has bolstered the incomes of more than 10,000 home chefs.Cai Liangen, a retired businessman turned Mishi cook, learned about the start-up when a marketing team visited his apartment complex seeking to enlist new chefs.Last November, he and his wife began making local specialties in their kitchen, including a sliced pork dish prepared with \u201cmy mother\u2019s secret recipe,\u201d Mr. Cai said. They now receive 40 orders a day and earn 5,000 renminbi a month, increasing their total income 70 percent.\u201cWe do it because we love to cook,\u201d Mr. Cai said, \u201cbut the money is good to have, too.\u201dAfter submitting a 10-page proposal in 2014 to join a Hangzhou incubator, Ai Binke sat nervously before a committee of tech industry executives who questioned his future prospects. His software company, Yun Ran Internet of Things, had only four employees, and its business deals had been small. But his start-up, Mr. Ai explained to the committee, had great potential.That was sufficient for the judges to award him 100,000 renminbi in subsidies. The bulk, roughly 70 percent, was instantly transferred into his corporate bank account. \u201cAs long as you run projects that are encouraged by the Hangzhou government, you can get the subsidies,\u201d said Mr. Ai, 29. \u201cIt\u2019s not very difficult.\u201dLocal governments around China are spending heavily on start-ups. In Shenzhen, authorities are offering to subsidize up to 70 percent of rent for \u201ccreative\u201d start-ups. Local officials in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu are setting up a 200 million renminbi \u201centrepreneurship and innovation development fund\u201d and promising subsidies of up to 5 million renminbi.Officials in Guangdong province in China\u2019s south will cover part of a start-up\u2019s losses. Even the lesser-known city of Yingtan, in an area of Jiangxi province mainly known for its ancient Taoist temples, is planning to build an incubator.Hangzhou\u2019s government has been one of the more active. Officials are forming a venture capital fund of 4.7 billion renminbi , with contributions from companies, according to the city\u2019s website. This year, Hangzhou announced that it would give 100 million renminbi annually to help start-ups pay expenses.But governments historically have a spotty record of using state-directed money to generate business success stories.In China, government efforts to assist new businesses have often led to waste and excess. Too much investment pours into favored industries, spawning poorly conceived projects in areas like hotels and solar panels. By trying to spur start-ups, the state is also engaging in a high-risk business that even for the most experienced venture capitalist is prone to produce more failures than successes.Hangzhou officials are trying to avoid such pitfalls. At Dream Town, the financial aid is often linked to a start-up\u2019s performance. The amount of free rent depends on how much private capital a company can raise. Cash handouts are tied to revenue targets or top-selling apps.Government officials also enlist professionals to help allocate the city\u2019s money. The committee that judges applicants to Dream Town is usually made up of tech executives, financiers and academics.Ye Feng, a manager at another incubator who has sat as a judge on three occasions, said she quizzed the contenders on their technology, business plan and even product pricing.Usually about 30 start-ups appear at each competition. No more than four make the cut to enter Dream Town. \u201cThe competition is quite fierce,\u201d Ms. Ye said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to make a decision.\u201dBut some in Hangzhou fear that the government is doling out too much money, and it is flowing to start-ups with weak business plans and feeble prospects. Mr. Ai of Yun Ran said that two neighbors also received city subsidies. One, a robotics start-up, failed to attract private capital and closed, while the other, a mobile game company, is struggling to stay afloat as its business withers.The government money, Mr. Ai said, often cannot replace the private capital necessary for start-ups. \u201cWithout financing, it would be very hard for them to survive,\u201d he said.Owen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Rules Look to Unify Digital Market, but U.S. Sees Protectionism", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle may have to pay publishers for their content. Facebook might, too. WhatsApp could have to follow tougher telecom standards.A new set of rules, expected to be unveiled by European Union officials on Wednesday, is likely to put new pressure on American tech companies.Europe calls it consumer protection. Silicon Valley calls it protectionism.In some ways, they are both right.The aim? To give the bloc\u2019s roughly 500 million consumers unfettered access to services like movie streaming, online shopping and cloud computing, no matter where they live. At the same time, the proposals would force some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies to comply with stringent competition, privacy and copyright rules.For many executives from American tech companies, such plans, which will still take years to come into effect and which will be subject to intense lobbying, feel like another round of protectionism. And while Europe\u2019s policy makers balk at these claims, the fact that Google, Facebook and Microsoft, among others, will be the most affected by the digital revamp has again highlighted how much Europeans rely on American tech when using digital services in their daily lives.The plans to be announced by the Brussels-based European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, include:The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u25a0 Providing financial incentives to telecom operators like Deutsche Telekom and Orange to invest in the region\u2019s mobile and broadband networks.

{"Headline": "Rare Harmony as China and U.S. Commit to Climate Deal", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANGZHOU, China \u2014 President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China formally committed the world\u2019s two largest economies to the Paris climate agreement here on Saturday, cementing their partnership on climate change and offering a rare display of harmony in a relationship that has become increasingly discordant.On multiple fronts, like computer hacking and maritime security, ties between China and the United States have frayed during the seven and a half years of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. The friction has worsened since the ascension of Mr. Xi as a powerful nationalist leader in 2013.Yet the fact that he and Mr. Obama could set aside those tensions to work together yet again on a joint plan to reduce greenhouse gases attests to the pragmatic personal rapport they have built, as well as to the complexity of the broader United States-China relationship, a tangle of competing and congruent interests.At a ceremony in this picturesque lakefront city, the two leaders hailed the adoption of the Paris agreement as critical to bringing it into force worldwide. Though widely expected as the next step in the legal process, the move could provide a boost to those who want to build momentum for further climate talks by bringing the December accord into effect as soon as possible.Countries accounting for 55 percent of the world\u2019s emissions must present formal ratification documents for that to happen, and together, China and the United States generate nearly 40 percent of the world\u2019s emissions.\u201cDespite our differences on other issues, we hope our willingness to work together on this issue will inspire further ambition and further action around the world,\u201d Mr. Obama declared.Mr. Xi praised the Paris agreement as a milestone, adding, \u201cIt was under Chinese leadership that much of this progress was made.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s chaotic welcome on the tarmac captured the mood on the eve of the G20 summit. There were arguments at the airport between White House aides and Chinese security officials who tried to keep back reporters. Shouting matches also broke out between Mr. Obama\u2019s staff and guards over how many people were allowed into the state guesthouse where he and Mr. Xi later met.In recent years, the Obama administration has sought to highlight cooperation on climate change, but China\u2019s commitments, first made in 2014, have been less a concession to American pressure than a restatement of its own goals. They include a promise for China\u2019s carbon emissions to reach a plateau or decline \u201caround 2030,\u201d but without any specific target for reductions like those Mr. Obama pledged for the United States (between 26 and 28 percent of 2005 levels by 2025). That means China has plenty of room to continue burning fossil fuels to power its economy.\u201cThe story of the past eight years is not mainly the pivot or the rebalance; it is the very substantial increases in Chinese capacities since 2008,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, who helped formulate Mr. Obama\u2019s Asia strategy as his chief China adviser in the first term.\u201cHow has the U.S. dealt with that?\u201d he added. \u201cHow has the U.S. confronted that?\u201dThe Obama administration has experimented with a variety of approaches: pledging to respect China\u2019s \u201ccore interests\u201d in 2009; shifting in 2011 to a more assertive stance \u2014 verging on containment \u2014 as Mr. Obama articulated his pivot to Asia; then resisting China\u2019s proposal in 2012 to embark on a new model of great-power relations.To some critics, that was an inconsistent strategy \u2014 one that alternately cheered or sowed anxiety among American allies, and likewise alienated or emboldened China. Under Mr. Xi\u2019s leadership, China has made aggressive claims to shoals and reefs in the South China Sea, picking fights with neighbors like the Philippines and Vietnam.\u201cThis back and forth has, I think, exacerbated what was already a growing problem with a China that was already more assertive in the context of the financial crisis,\u201d said Michael J. Green, who was the chief Asia adviser on the National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration and is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.But the administration\u2019s defenders, like Mr. Bader, argue that Mr. Obama was merely following in the tradition of presidents, Democrat and Republican alike, dating back to Richard M. Nixon. They have tried to manage China\u2019s rise by drawing it into the international system and prodding it to accept rules of the road in trade, navigation and other areas.Mr. Obama was expected to press Mr. Xi to abide by the ruling in a meeting after the climate ceremony, less because he expected the Chinese leader to reverse himself than because the ruling is a vital predicate for undermining the legitimacy of China\u2019s imperial claims.Meanwhile, Mr. Obama\u2019s struggle to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership has stoked doubts about America\u2019s economic staying power. The 12-nation pact, which excludes China, has become the centerpiece of the pivot to Asia. But it has fallen victim to election-year politics at home and now seems unlikely to pass, even in a lame-duck Congress.Some of the nations that signed on, particularly Japan \u2014 America\u2019s most important Asian ally and a nervous neighbor of China \u2014 have made political sacrifices by opening markets in order to meet the standards demanded by the United States. Failure to pass the trade pact, Asian diplomats and analysts said, would leave them feeling burned.\u201cThe Japanese, living in an uncertain world, depending on an American nuclear umbrella, will have to say on trade: \u2018The Americans could not follow through,\u2019\u201d Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore said during a recent visit to Washington, standing next to Mr. Obama. \u201cIf it\u2019s a matter of life and death, whom do I have to depend on?\u201dMr. Obama and his chief trade negotiator, Michael B. Froman, understand the stakes. They plan a full-court press to sell the pact on this presidential trip \u2014 characterizing its passage as a litmus test of American leadership \u2014 in hopes that the message will echo back home.\u201cWe are one vote away from cementing our leadership in Asia or ceding it to China,\u201d Mr. Froman said in an interview in Beijing. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Congress wants to hand the keys to the castle to China.\u201dThe Trans-Pacific Partnership is viewed in Asia as the handiwork of Mr. Obama in particular, especially since the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, who repeatedly backed it when she was Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of state, has renounced her support. If Congress fails to pass it, Asian diplomats said, China will emerge as a victor.\u201cIt will be a political disaster and play into the Chinese narrative that China is a geopolitical fact, whereas the U.S. presence is the consequence of a geopolitical calculation which could change and thus is not reliable,\u201d said Bilahari Kausikan, the ambassador at large for Singapore.In practical terms, the United States would lose the chance to shape the economic future of the region, allowing China to forge ahead with its \u201cSino-centric economic order,\u201d which includes a multibillion-dollar project to build a new Silk Road linking Asia to Europe.Mr. Bader is among several American officials who are guardedly confident that the next presidential administration will find a way to win approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, perhaps by adding side agreements on contentious points. But he expressed concern that the South China Sea would be a chronic source of friction.\u201cThe situation hasn\u2019t stabilized,\u201d Mr. Bader said. \u201cAchieving that is beyond the capacity of the U.S. alone.\u201d\u201cChina will never stop our construction,\u201d the head of China\u2019s navy, Adm. Wu Shengli, said in July.Last month, China took delivery of a dredger, one of the biggest in its inventory, from a Dutch shipyard. The vessel would be suitable for dredging at Scarborough Shoal, a disputed reef 150 miles from the Philippines.China, some academics say, plans to create an extremely large artificial island that would complete a strategic triangle of bases in the sea.\u201cObama is seen as reluctant to push back,\u201d said Alan Dupont, a former defense intelligence analyst for the Australian government. \u201cHe has allowed China to militarize the islands in the South China Sea. The United States hasn\u2019t put it at the top of its list.\u201dTo reassure its allies, Mr. Dupont said, the United States would have to reinforce its military presence in the Pacific even further than it has under Mr. Obama\u2019s pivot, or rebalance, as it has also been called.\u201cThere has to be a rebalance plus,\u201d he said.Yufan Huang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Condemns Trump in Full-Throated Pitch for Clinton", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 President Obama vigorously defended Hillary Clinton on Tuesday as a relentless leader who had been held to unfair standards during an uncommonly wild presidential campaign, pleading with the voters who were the core of his own support to tune out the \u201creality show\u201d noise of the race and vote for his chosen successor.\u201cWe cannot afford, suddenly, to treat this like a reality show \u2014 we can\u2019t afford to act as if there\u2019s some equivalence here,\u201d Mr. Obama told thousands of people at an afternoon rally in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\u201cWhat sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesn\u2019t stop caring, and she doesn\u2019t stop trying, and she never stops fighting for us \u2014 even if we haven\u2019t always appreciated it,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The roughly 40-minute speech was by turns a condemnation of Donald J. Trump and a venting session about news coverage of a presidential race that Mr. Obama argued had focused on the \u201cfrivolous\u201d while allowing Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, to go unchallenged. Its intended audience was the young and minority voters who had propelled Mr. Obama to the White House.\u201cI love you, too \u2014 but we got some business to do here,\u201d Mr. Obama told the crowd as it chanted his name. \u201cI am really into electing Hillary Clinton \u2014 like, this isn\u2019t me going through the motions here. I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton.\u201dEight years ago, Mr. Obama defeated Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination in large part by appealing to young people and minorities who had never participated in presidential elections but were inspired by his hopeful message and newness to politics. Now he is trying to energize those voters on behalf of a candidate whose decades-long political and policy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is her chief selling point, and who struggled to draw their support during a bruising primary campaign as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont linked her to what he characterized as the corrupt status quo.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\u201cWe always like the new, shiny thing \u2014 I benefited from that when I was a candidate \u2014 and we take for granted sometimes what is steady and true, and Hillary Clinton is steady, and she is true,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe young people who are here, who all you\u2019ve been seeing is just the nonsense that\u2019s been on TV, you maybe don\u2019t remember all the work that she has had to do, and all the things that she has had to overcome.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t stay home because, \u2018You know, she\u2019s been around for a long time,\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI need you to work as hard for Hillary as you did for me.\u201dMr. Obama referred obliquely to the controversy, asking the crowd gathered on a tree-lined boulevard to permit him to \u201cjust vent for a second\u201d about the questions dominating the presidential campaign.An aide to Mrs. Clinton said she had watched the speech on television from her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., where she spent the day reading briefings and making calls. She planned to take another day off before returning to the campaign trail Thursday.Mr. Obama\u2019s speech was the latest turn in the evolution of his relationship with Mrs. Clinton. Their once-bitter rivalry transformed into a partnership when he selected her as secretary of state, and they now have a vital political alliance with consequences for both of them.Mr. Obama seemed exhilarated to be back on the campaign trail, and he has told his advisers that he is eager to be useful to Mrs. Clinton. Aides say he will spend the final days of the race traveling extensively on her behalf. Michelle Obama, a rare and reluctant presence at political events, also plans to become involved this week, appearing at a Friday rally at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., to exhort people to register before that state\u2019s Oct. 17 deadline.While Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton will represent the entire country, the Americans who selected them are a small part of it.\u201cTheir nominee is out there praising a guy, saying he\u2019s a strong leader because he invades smaller countries, jails his opponents, controls the press and drives his economy into a long recession,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThink about the fact that that is Donald Trump\u2019s role model.\u201dIn an apparent appeal to Republicans alienated by Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, he marveled at how far the party had strayed from the principles espoused by Abraham Lincoln or Ronald Reagan.\u201cHe saw America as a shining city on a hill,\u201d Mr. Obama said, referring to Reagan. \u201cDonald Trump calls it a divided crime scene. He\u2019s not offering any real policies or plans, just offering division and offering fear. And he\u2019s betting that if he scares enough people, he might just scare up enough votes to win this election.\u201dThe president also reminded voters of his accomplishments over eight years, including job and wage growth and a health care measure that provided insurance for 20 million people. \u201cThanks, Obama,\u201d he said, adopting a phrase his critics have used sarcastically.Mr. Obama argued that Mrs. Clinton was the only candidate who could build on those successes, and he ridiculed the notion that Mr. Trump would appeal to working-class voters.\u201cReally?\u201d Mr. Obama said with a smile. \u201cThis guy who spent 70 years on the earth showing no concern for working people?\u201dMr. Obama also spent time Tuesday raising money to elect Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats, attending a fund-raiser at a downtown Philadelphia hotel for the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint operation with the Democratic National Committee and state parties, and one at a private home in New York City for the party\u2019s House campaign arm.Amy Chozick contributed reporting from New York.videovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Chaumet, Rousing \u2018a Sleeping Beauty\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 \u201cChaumet had become a sleeping beauty, a much admired and exquisite jewelry house that had nevertheless quietly slipped under the radar over the years. When I joined the company, it became my task to wake her up again.\u201dThe description came from Jean-Marc Mansvelt, the chief executive of the famed maison owned by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, as he sat in his office at its resplendent 18th-century headquarters on the Place Vend\u00f4me during Couture Week in July.\u201cSince the day I arrived, every single employee here has been working towards the moment of this collection\u2019s unveiling. It\u2019s a very important moment for us,\u201d Mr. Mansvelt said. \u201cBecause it is not just about celebrating natural beauty, the literal interpretation of the title. It is about showcasing our identity, the style of our craftsmanship and the Chaumet legacy. It is a reflection of the facets that make us who we are.\u201dThe collection had four major motifs \u2014 wheat, lily, laurel and oak \u2014 and heritage pieces with those themes were found in the house archives to inspire new designs with contemporary twists. Think of a diamond-encrusted oak-leaf ring, brushed-gold earrings in the shape of wheat sheaves that gently sweep along the ear or a between-the-finger ring that looks like a laurel leaf.Even the tiara was given a 21st-century update, finding form in a flowering headpiece set with two large lilies (both detachable as brooches) forged from red spinels, rhodolite garnets, white diamonds and two pear-shaped tourmalines. Several of the one-of-a-kind pieces had \u201csold\u201d signs next to them during the press preview \u2014 signs that clearly were welcomed by Mr. Mansvelt.\u201cBetween the issues with our economy and string of terror attacks, it is no secret that France has become a tough trading market for everyone in luxury as of late \u2014 all of Place Vend\u00f4me has been suffering,\u201d he said, adding that retail foot traffic had roughly halved in the first half of this year in the country\u2019s most upmarket and expensive shopping destination.\u201cBut we know and understand the tastes of our client,\u201d he continued. \u201cThese are not ostentatious customers looking to do status symbol-driven spending in some flashy, trend-driven house.\u201cThey know what they are buying into when they buy a piece of our jewelry: quiet and refined statements that stand the test of time.\u201dChaumet was founded in 1780 by Marie-\u00c9tienne Nitot, jeweler to Marie Antoinette, making it one of the world\u2019s oldest jewelry houses. A celebration of its rich history, as well as its dazzling roster of A-list tiara clients \u2014 from Empress Jos\u00e9phine to Edith Wharton, were the driving forces behind Mr. Mansvelt\u2019s decision last fall to introduce the Mus\u00e9e \u00c9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re, a pop-up museum in the Chaumet headquarters that has since become a permanent fixture.But for the time being, there are no plans to increase the 80 stores it has in world capitals or its large network of authorized resellers. \u201cFor the moment we are focusing on where we are; we want to do better \u2014 and more \u2014 in the places we are already established,\u201d Mr. Mansvelt said.Chaumet has long had a heavy focus in Asia and the Far East, with openings in recent years focused on the Middle East. Significantly, after a botched expansion effort in the 1990s, it has no points of sale in the Americas \u2014 although the company says that a sizable proportion of its clients are Americans who spend abroad.\u201cI am happy with where we are and the trajectory we are taking,\u201d Mr. Mansvelt said. \u201cThere are many reasons to be confident.\u201d One positive, he said, is that Chaumet is not exposed in the beleaguered luxury watch market, unlike many of its rivals. Another is that the house is \u201ca brand waiting to be discovered \u2014 a position in the sector is ours to win in the long term, rather than to lose in the short term,\u201d he said.\u201cFurthermore, the fine jewelry market is proving far more robust than most other trend-focused product categories. Our business is not like that of fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about creating enduring art pieces \u2014 exquisite investments that will stand the test of time and be handed down from one generation of clients to the next.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think a 401(k) Is Not a Sexy Benefit? Competition May Change That", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a company starts up, a retirement plan is usually the last item on the laundry list.Many employers want to offer one, but uncertainty over costs and a time-consuming setup process deter many.But changes in technology, an expense war in the mutual fund industry and innovative plan offerings have made smaller companies take a second look. In a tight labor market, benefits like retirement plans are increasingly being viewed as necessities to attract quality, long-term employees.\u201cI know that investing can be daunting at first,\u201d Mr. Nemeroff said. \u201cThis gave them an extremely easy method of investing into their future.\u201dThe company offers a 50 percent employer match on the first 3 percent of employee contributions. The company hired 1847 Financial, a division of Penn Mutual, to set up and administer the plan, and employees can invest in several funds offered by American Funds.\u201cWe made sure it was right for our employees,\u201d Mr. Nemeroff said. It cost about $50,000 to set up the plan, administer it and educate his work force, he said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure our employees understood it.\u201dAlthough such costs can be prohibitive for some companies in their early stages, Printfly reported $23 million in sales last year and is projecting growth of 40 to 60 percent this year.Yet for most start-ups, seeding a retirement plan doesn\u2019t seem as enticing to would-be employees as ownership or recreational benefits. Many typically offer a stake in the company, or nonmonetary benefits like eclectic cafeterias or pool tables.\u201cVery few start-ups offer retirement plans on Day 1,\u201d said Jamie Hopkins, a professor at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa., which trains financial professionals, and a co-director of its New York Life Center for Retirement Income. \u201cLess than 10 percent of start-ups offer a plan.\u201dIn recent years, the needle has barely moved when it comes to small companies offering 401(k)s.Eight years later, slightly more than 34,000 401(k) plans were started by similar-size companies, said Brooks Herman, head of data and research for BrightScope, noting that there was a dip in new plans after the 2008 financial crisis. The company\u2019s snapshot does not include individual or small-employer individual retirement accounts, so the actual numbers are probably higher.\u201cEconomic and market conditions have a greater effect on new benefits \u2014 like a 401(k) plan being offered \u2014 than the availability of cheap services,\u201d Mr. Herman said.Although they are subject to various rules and contribution limits, tax deductions are also available to employers for 401(k) plans. Businesses that start such plans can qualify for a tax credit of up to $500 for each of the first three years of their plans.To qualify, a business must have at least one employee, other than the owner, who earns less than $120,000 a year. Employers can also deduct any matching contributions.Still, costs matter for businesses. Entrepreneurs understandably watch every dollar, so the often-steep administrative expenses of a retirement plan can be discouraging. Most conventional 401(k)\u2019s involve a lot of paperwork, filing requirements and continuing administrative expenses.Small employers are often saddled with higher costs because, the argument goes, they do not offer economies of scale. However, the mutual fund and exchange-traded-fund industry is increasingly competing on expenses and has pursued smaller companies.For example, Vanguard\u2019s Target Retirement 2050 Fund, a \u201ctarget-date\u201d bundle of four of the company\u2019s funds for participants who plan to retire around 2050, costs only 0.16 percent in expenses annually.Employees and employers alike have also had other retirement savings options.The Simplified Employee Pension, or SEP I.R.A., for small-business owners and the self-employed, and the Simple I.R.A., which allows both employees and employers to contribute to an individual retirement account, have been available for decades and require minimal paperwork.Employees can set up their own I.R.A. or retirement plans, but company-sponsored 401(k)\u2019s have distinct benefits. Employees can contribute up to $18,000 tax free to 401(k)\u2019s, and those 50 or older can contribute an additional $6,000.Betterment said it had more than 200 companies in its new small-business offering \u2014 75 percent of which had fewer than 250 employees \u2014 although it would not disclose how many were start-ups.The industrywide push to lower fund and plan costs will continue to make retirement plans more appealing to entrepreneurs.\u201cWe\u2019ll see more low-cost plans,\u201d said Mr. Hopkins of the American College of Financial Services.The various changes and rules can be daunting, but advisers say the best first step for start-ups considering offering retirement plans is to gather information for themselves and for their employees.\u201cThe best thing is to get educated by someone you trust,\u201d said Mr. Nemeroff of Printfly. \u201cDon\u2019t do it by yourself. Ask yourself how it\u2019s going to help your team. Education is the most important part. How can you help everyone plan for the future?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mr. Trump\u2019s Stupid Excuses on Taxes", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMr. Trump\u2019s principal argument for why he should lead the country is that he is a successful businessman and billionaire. According to him, he alone has the negotiating chops necessary to boost the economy and bring foreign adversaries to their knees. Yet, he refuses to tell voters how he comes by his money, how much he actually has and what he does with it.It is odd that Mr. Trump, who demanded proof on paper that President Obama was born in the United States, would expect voters to take on faith his own claims about his commercial successes, his dealings with business partners, what he gives to charity and other financial matters that could conflict with his duties if elected president. His tax returns are the only documents that can conclusively corroborate or disprove his claims and allay concerns about conflicts of interest.Mr. Trump says he wants to fix a \u201crigged\u201d political system controlled by a powerful elite.

Trump.But with less than eight weeks until Election Day and tightening polls showing a majority of voters dislike and distrust her, aides said it was imperative that Mrs. Clinton deliver a more uplifting message.\u201cFrom now until Nov. 8, everywhere I go I\u2019m going to talk about my ideas for our country,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. Next week, Mrs. Clinton plans speeches to discuss how she would help young people and improve the economy, weaving in her own background as an advocate for children and as a first lady focused on women and families.That focus was central in her address here at the University of North Carolina, where she took the stage to James Brown\u2019s \u201cI Got You (I Feel Good),\u201d seeming rested and revived, eager to tell the audience that her rare couple of days of downtime allowed her to \u201creconnect with what this whole campaign is about.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m running for all mothers and fathers trying to stay healthy so they can be there for their kids, but perhaps most of all, I\u2019m running for those kids,\u201d she said. \u201cStanding up for children has been the work of my life, as a lawyer for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, as first lady of Arkansas, in the White House.\u201dWith just 54 days until the election, \u201csitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be,\u201d she said. But she called the time off \u201ca gift.\u201dHer return to the campaign trail comes as a series of polls suggest a closer race. Mrs. Clinton has faced a more disciplined Mr. Trump and scrutiny over her failure to initially disclose her pneumonia to all but a few close aides.A New York Times/CBS News poll released on Thursday found her virtually tied with Mr. Trump among likely voters.Asked about the narrowing gap with Mr. Trump on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019ve always said this is going to be a tight race.\u201dOn her campaign plane earlier Thursday, a peppy-sounding Mrs. Clinton said she felt fully recovered. \u201cI am doing great,\u201d she said before takeoff in White Plains, N.Y., as she made her way down the aisle.Mrs. Clinton flashed a wide smile at journalists studying her for signs of fatigue or illness and said she was looking forward to getting back into action. And at her rally later, she reflected on her time recuperating.Mrs. Clinton offered a rare public glimpse at her self-effacing humor, poking fun at herself for her plans that span \u201c38 different policy areas.\u201dShe said, \u201cLike a lot of women, I have a tendency to overprepare.\u201dMrs. Clinton did not entirely avoid criticizing Mr. Trump, telling reporters after the event, \u201cWe don\u2019t need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms.\u201dIt was a reference to the child care proposals that Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka unveiled this week.The Clinton campaign\u2019s efforts to put forth a kinder, gentler candidate began last week with a speech that Mrs. Clinton delivered in Kansas City, Mo., on her Methodist faith.But the change in tactics hit an unexpected snag on Sunday when Mrs. Clinton abruptly left a ceremony to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Amid intense scrutiny over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lack of transparency over her initial diagnosis, her physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, later disclosed that Mrs. Clinton had been told she had pneumonia last Friday and that she had been overheated and dehydrated on Sunday.Rather than making her case to the American people, Mrs. Clinton found herself recovering at home as her campaign confronted a series of distractions and dueling doctors\u2019 notes from her and Mr. Trump.And she had to apologize on Saturday after a backlash over remarks she made at a Friday night fund-raiser in Manhattan in which she said that half of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters fell into a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d \u2014 bigots, essentially, of one sort or the other.On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton, when pressed about her handling of her diagnosis, appeared eager to put the rough patch behind her.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to stop,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to quit campaigning.

{"Headline": "Flagged Two Times in 2014, Ahmad Rahami Passed Scrutiny", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Ahmad Khan Rahami returned in March 2014 from a nearly yearlong trip to Pakistan, he was flagged by customs officials, who pulled him out for a secondary screening. Still concerned about his travel, they notified the National Targeting Center, a federal agency that assesses potential threats, two law enforcement officials said.It was one of thousands of such notifications every year, and a report on Mr. Rahami was passed along to the F.B.I. and other intelligence agencies.Five months later, when Mr. Rahami\u2019s father told the police after a domestic dispute that he was concerned about his son having terrorist sympathies, federal agents again examined his travel history. And again, despite Mr. Rahami\u2019s now having been flagged twice for scrutiny, the concerns were not found to warrant a deeper inquiry, one of the law enforcement officials said. Ahmad Rahami was not interviewed by federal agents.But now, the travel history of Mr. Rahami, who is accused of carrying out bombings in New York and New Jersey last weekend, has become a focus of investigators, a subject made all the more urgent by details contained in a notebook that suggests he drew inspiration largely from the Islamic State.In particular, Mr. Rahami cites a founding member of the Islamic State who called on Muslims around the world to take up whatever arms they could find and spill the blood of nonbelievers.The assessment of Mr. Rahami by the F.B.I. began in August 2014, and it once again reviewed the report by the National Targeting Center.The center was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to function as an intelligence analysis agency within the Department of Homeland Security.\u201cBy identifying high-risk passengers and cargo well before they would cross our land borders, sail into our ports or touch down on our tarmacs, the N.T.C. team is on duty to protect our people and economy 24/7,\u201d the federal government\u2019s description of the agency says.It is unclear how much information the report contained about Mr. Rahami\u2019s activities during the 11 months he was in Pakistan, starting in April 2013, and about any other trips he made while abroad.Investigators are interested in learning more about both a three-week trip he made to Afghanistan and another trip he may have made to Ankara, Turkey, according to the law enforcement officials, who spoke about the continuing investigation under the condition of anonymity. The report by the targeting center did not mention any travel to Turkey, according to one of the officials.Records the New York Police Department provided to customs officials indicate that Mr. Rahami traveled to Ankara for an unspecified length of time in January 2014, according to another law enforcement official and documents obtained by The New York Times.That trip would have happened at a time when international authorities were concerned about the flow of foreign combatants to Syria to fight in the civil war there, but before the Islamic State became widely known as a source of global terrorism.The Islamic State was just making its first expansion into Iraq then, taking the city of Falluja. Mostly, the group was seen as an Islamist rebel force in the Syrian conflict that had become focused on grabbing territory from fellow opposition groups \u2014 especially the Nusra front, which, like the Islamic State, had started as a branch of Al Qaeda but instead became an enemy.The questions about where Mr. Rahami drew his inspiration and whether he had help are at the center of the investigation even as an intense legal battle takes shape over how his case is being handled.Defense lawyers are fighting to get Mr. Rahami before a judge so he can be appointed a lawyer and have charges laid out against him, while prosecutors are pushing back.The new information being gleaned from Mr. Rahami\u2019s notebook, a copy of which was provided to The Times by another law enforcement official, who was not authorized to speak to the press, paints a substantially different picture from what could be understood by the snippets highlighted in the criminal complaint filed in federal court on Tuesday night.That summary mentioned Anwar al-Awlaki, once Al Qaeda\u2019s leading propagandist, who is equally popular with the Islamic State\u2019s followers, but made no mention of the ISIS spokesman and senior strategist Abu Muhammad al-Adnani.The pages of Mr. Rahami\u2019s journal echo the talking points of Mr. Adnani, who in May advised followers around the world to commit violence in their home countries if travel to Syria proved too difficult.Fragments of the journal \u2014 much of it rendered illegible because of blood stains \u2014 suggest that Mr. Rahami may have himself been frustrated in his attempts to reach Syria and was using that as justification for committing terror at home.One page has the word \u201cblocked,\u201d followed by: \u201cYou should have let us meet death overseas.\u201dOn a subsequent page, he wrote \u201cback to Sham,\u201d an archaic regional name that has come to be used for Syria. He goes on: \u201cI looked for guidance and Alhumdulilah,\u201d he says, using an Arabic expression praising God. \u201cGuidance come / Sheikh Anwar / Brother Adnani / Dawla. Said it clearly attack The Kuffar in their backyard.\u201d The last sentence appears to refer to Mr. Adnani\u2019s speech this summer in which he beseeched followers to hurt unbelievers in whatever manner they could and wherever they found them.Mr. Rahami makes clear that he planned to die a martyr: In \u201cmy heart, I pray to the beautiful wise Allah / to not take jihad away,\u201d he said. \u201cI begged for shahada,\u201d he continued, using the Arabic for martyrdom, \u201cand inshallah this call will be answered.\u201dMr. Rahami also refers to more recent comments Mr. Adnani made.\u201cIf the tyrants have closed in your faces the door to Hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad and make their act a source of pain to them,\u201d Mr. Adnani said in a speech released by the Islamic State in May. \u201cThe smallest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the largest action by us, and more effective and more damaging to them.\u201dThe authorities are also still searching for two men who apparently stumbled on one of the bombs planted in Manhattan on Saturday evening and took the explosive device out of a bag before walking away with the bag \u2014 although officials said they were not believed to be part of the plot.On Wednesday, investigators, who believe the bag may be a valuable piece of evidence, released images of the men \u2014 one wearing a pink golf shirt and the other wearing a light brown button-down collared shirt. The images were taken from surveillance video that shows the men walking on 27th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue in Chelsea between 8 and 9 p.m. on Saturday.The authorities said they did not believe the men were tied to Mr. Rahami.\u201cWe have no reason to believe they\u2019re connected,\u201d Chief James Waters, head of the New York Police Department\u2019s Counterterrorism Bureau, said at a news conference on Wednesday morning.The city police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, said they were considered witnesses.Mr. Rahami is recovering in Newark from wounds he sustained in a shootout with the police in Linden, N.J., on Monday morning, when he was taken into custody.The United States attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, said on Wednesday that the government would bring Mr. Rahami to New York City to face charges.\u201cIn the near future, it is our intention to bring the defendant to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York,\u201d she said in remarks made in Washington.The chief federal public defender in Manhattan, David E. Patton, wrote late on Tuesday night to Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein, asking for a court hearing at the earliest possible time and proposing that if Mr. Rahami\u2019s health did not permit his travel to Manhattan, Mr. Patton\u2019s lawyers could represent him in New Jersey at the hearing by telephone or video.\u201cThe Sixth Amendment requires that he be given access to counsel on the federal charges, and that he be presented without delay,\u201d Mr. Patton wrote.The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, asked the judge to deny the request. In court papers on Wednesday, his office said that because Mr. Rahami was arrested by the local police and is being held on state charges in connection with the shootout, he is not in federal custody. That, the prosecutors argued, means that he does not yet have a right to a prompt appearance in federal court and the provision of a lawyer there.Mr. Patton responded later on Wednesday that it was \u201cundisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning\u201d Mr. Rahami, and that his office had decided to represent Mr. Rahami after determining that he qualified as an indigent defendant.But the judge, in a ruling issued on Wednesday night, found that the court did not have the authority to appoint Mr. Rahami a lawyer or order an appearance at this time.Peter Liguori, the deputy public defender in Union County, where the shooting of the Linden police officers took place, said he had not received notification that Mr. Rahami had requested a lawyer. \u201cWe want to make sure that his constitutional rights are protected,\u201d Mr. Liguori said. \u201cIf he or his family has requested our assistance, we will certainly help him and make sure that he gets proper representation.\u201dReporting was contributed by Julia Preston, William K.

{"Headline": "Voters\u2019 View of a Donald Trump Presidency: Big Risks and Rewards", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost voters consider Donald J. Trump a risky choice for president, saying he lacks the right temperament and values, but he is seen as more transformative and better at handling the economy than Hillary Clinton, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.Mrs. Clinton, despite being as disliked as Mr. Trump, is seen as a safer option. Majorities of voters say she has the temperament for the job and would better handle foreign policy. Only 36 percent of them, however, view her as an agent of change. That perception deeply worries some Clinton campaign advisers, who want the race to hinge on Mr. Trump\u2019s character rather than voters\u2019 desire to upend the status quo.With less than eight weeks until Election Day, the two candidates are locked in a close contest in which the challenge from third-party candidates may make a difference. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has the support of 46 percent of likely voters nationwide, compared with 44 percent for Mr. Trump, the Republican; that result includes voters who said they were leaning toward a candidate.Looking more broadly at all registered voters, Mrs. Clinton holds a wider edge, 46 to 41 percent, driven by her support among women, minorities and college graduates. Getting registered but unlikely voters to the polls in November is a large challenge for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.Mr. Trump has an advantage among men, whites and less educated voters.In a four-way race, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are tied at 42 percent each. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, has the support of 8 percent of likely voters, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, takes 4 percent. Mr. Johnson is hoping to qualify for the coming presidential debates, but he is short of the requirement of reaching 15 percent support in an average of major polls.Among likely voters younger than 30, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support drops 10 points in a four-way race. Their support for Mr. Trump falls seven points, but he is not relying on young voters as much.The race has clearly grown tighter in recent weeks. National polling averages have narrowed markedly from early August to today.Polls in a number of key swing states, including Ohio and Florida, have narrowed in the past week as well. Projections of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Electoral College advantage have also shown a tightening based on recent polls.Voters expressed discontent with both candidates. Among those who say they intend to vote for Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, slightly more than half express strong support. The rest say that they harbor reservations about their candidate or that they are voting simply to thwart the other nominee.Despite the voters\u2019 misgivings, the major-party nominees are consolidating support among their party faithful. Mrs. Clinton commands support of 87 percent of Democrats, while Mr. Trump is supported by 85 percent of Republicans.Locked in a tight race, both candidates are raising red flags with voters. Most voters think Donald J. Trump is a risky choice and does not have the temperament and personality to be president, but Hillary Clinton continues to struggle with broad perceptions that she is not trustworthy and cannot bring real change to Washington, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll found.The poll results offer more cause for concern than confidence for Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton as they prepare for their first debate, on Sept. 26, and as early voting begins in some states next weekend. Their favorability ratings remain stubbornly low, with only about one-third of voters seeing each of them positively, despite the candidates\u2019 attempts to use their conventions, commercials and public appearances to persuade voters to see them in a new light.A majority of voters say Mr. Trump does not care about the needs or problems of Hispanics; most voters see Mrs. Clinton as caring about Hispanics, and a majority of voters agree with her view that most illegal immigrants in the country should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship.The nationwide telephone poll was conducted with 1,433 registered voters from Sept. 9 to 13 on cellphones and landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all voters.Mr. Trump\u2019s temperament stands out as potentially his most damaging vulnerability, as his penchant for insults and provocations often undercuts his political message. Trump advisers see the televised debates as Mr. Trump\u2019s greatest opportunity to reassure people about his personality, but he starts off in a weak position, with 64 percent of voters saying he does not have the right temperament to be president.Sixty-seven percent of voters see Mr. Trump as a risky choice for president, compared with 51 percent who hold that view about Mrs. Clinton \u2014 a surprising number in itself given that she has been a president\u2019s spouse, a senator and a secretary of state.For Trump advisers, the image of Mr. Trump as a gamble comes with an upside. They concede that he is most likely to lose the election if a majority of voters view him as dangerous or reckless. But if he can persuade people to see him simply as unpredictable \u2014 even cagey in a strategic sense \u2014 as well as committed to disrupting the federal government, voters could regard him as worth taking a chance on for four years while looking to his advisers and Congress as a check on his power.Several Trump supporters said in follow-up interviews that they believed he was worth the risk, given the economic and security challenges facing the nation. Forty-eight percent of voters think Mr. Trump could bring real change to Washington, a 12-point edge over Mrs. Clinton; another 48 percent think he could not bring change.\u201cThe risky part with Trump is the fact of his rhetoric, how he says things,\u201d said Patrick Kellegher, 52, a political independent and a retired deputy sheriff from Anaconda, Mont. \u201cBut I think he is outside the known government circles.\u201d He added, \u201cI think Trump will bring about real change because he\u2019s looking at it through a different scope.\u201dThe candidates also face continued doubts about their honesty. Of the two, Mrs. Clinton has tried more visibly to address misgivings about her trustworthiness, by releasing decades of tax returns and more details about her health than Mr. Trump has. Yet one stain on her reputation is proving indelible: About seven in 10 voters say she did something wrong when she used a private email server as secretary of state, including 45 percent who say she did something illegal.Concerns about her judgment linger even among some of her supporters, who say she could have been more forthcoming about her email practices before they grew into a political controversy and the focus of a scathing F.B.I. report.\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s been dishonest or untrustworthy in a way that disqualifies her to be president, but she shouldn\u2019t have worried so much about political ramifications and come clean up front,\u201d said Lindsay Dofelmier, 36, a lawyer in Houston who is supporting Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Trump has yet to release any of his tax returns, a break with political tradition that goes back decades, and has been far less specific than Mrs. Clinton on many personal and political questions, including his policy proposals. Asked if it was necessary for Mr. Trump to release his tax returns, 59 percent of voters said it was. Forty-five percent of voters said they would like the candidates to release more medical records.An earlier version of this article misstated Donald J. Trump\u2019s support among white voters. He leads Hillary Clinton among white voters by 51 to 40 percent, not by 57 to 33 percent. He leads among white men by a 57 to 33 percent margin.Megan Thee-Brenan, Giovanni Russonello and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton: My Plan for Helping America\u2019s Poor", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe true measure of any society is how we take care of our children. With all of our country\u2019s resources, no child should ever have to grow up in poverty. Yet every single night, all across America, kids go to sleep hungry or without a place to call home.We have to do better. Advocating for children and families has been the cause of my life, starting with my first job as a young attorney at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, and if I have the honor of serving as president, it will be the driving mission of my administration.The good news is that we\u2019re making progress, thanks to the hard work of the American people and President Obama. The global poverty rate has been cut in half in recent decades. In the United States, a new report from the Census Bureau found that there were 3.5 million fewer people living in poverty in 2015 than just a year before.Median incomes rose by 5.2 percent, the fastest growth on record. Households at all income levels saw gains, with the largest going to those struggling the most. The census report makes clear that when hard-working Americans get a small boost \u2014 like food stamps and health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 they can climb out of poverty.But make no mistake: We still have work to do. Families across the country were devastated by the Great Recession.My plan would expand Low Income Housing Tax Credits in high-cost areas to increase our affordable housing supply, and fuel broader community development. So if you are a family living in an expensive city, you would be able to find an affordable place to call home and have access to the transportation you need to get to good jobs and quality schools.We also need to ensure that our investments are reaching the communities suffering the most from decades of neglect. We have got to acknowledge that even though poverty overall has fallen, extreme poverty has increased. Tim Kaine and I will model our anti-poverty strategy on Congressman Jim Clyburn\u2019s 10-20-30 plan, directing 10 percent of federal investments to communities where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years. And we\u2019ll put special emphasis on minority communities that have been held back for too long by barriers of systemic racism.As president, I will continue my life\u2019s work focused on creating opportunities for children and fairness for families. We need to expand access to high-quality child care and guarantee paid leave so parents at all income levels can balance their jobs and lives. And we will work to double investments in Early Head Start and make preschool available to every 4-year-old because our children deserve the best possible start in life.This November, the American people will have to choose between an economy that works for everyone and an economy that benefits the well off at the expense of everyone else. The choice couldn\u2019t be clearer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of Japan Raises Target Despite Limited Progress", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Despite sagging public confidence in its ability to encourage growth, Japan\u2019s central bank on Wednesday raised a key economic target and said it would continue to pump money into the economy until it succeeded.The announcement is very likely to add fuel to a debate about the effectiveness and credibility of the Bank of Japan, which has taken an increasingly active role in trying to shake the economy, the world\u2019s third-largest, out of two decades of doldrums. It comes amid broader questions about the ability of central banks around the world \u2014 and whether they are running short of tools to re-energize global growth.The Bank of Japan said on Wednesday that it had set a new target for Japan\u2019s consumer prices, saying it intended to \u201covershoot\u201d its existing price target of 2 percent price rises, year-over-year.It did not specify by how much \u2014 and it gave little indication of how it would do so. After three and a half years of trying to lift prices under its current governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, the bank\u2019s standard measure of inflation stood most recently at minus 0.5 percent.Falling prices, a relatively new problem in places like Europe, have haunted Japan for two decades. They are associated with weak economic growth, as wages and corporate revenues slide in tandem with the cost of goods and services. Escaping the trap, known as deflation, has been a central goal for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who appointed Mr. Kuroda in 2013.Events have not played out as planned.Mr. Kuroda initially promised to beat deflation in two years, a deadline that has come and gone. The bank has tried a number of tactics to lift prices, including a reduction of interest rates below zero and buying large quantities of government bonds. Those tactics have poured money into Japan\u2019s financial system, making it cheaper to borrow and \u2014 in theory, at least \u2014 encouraging the sort of spending that leads to higher prices and economic growth.In January, the Bank of Japan took the unusual step of introducing a negative short-term interest rate, a policy also adopted by central banks in Europe. The idea is to encourage lending to households and businesses by penalizing commercial banks that keep cash sitting unused at the central bank. The bank kept its rate steady at minus 0.1 percent on Wednesday.External shocks, like the plunge in oil prices in 2014, have hampered the bank\u2019s efforts to create inflation. But ultimately, the bank said Wednesday, a sustained rise in prices has not occurred for one main reason: Japanese people don\u2019t believe it will.\u201cThe price stability target of 2 percent has not been achieved,\u201d the bank said, \u201clargely due to developments in inflation expectations.\u201dMr. Kuroda has relied heavily on what economists say is the self-fulfilling nature of inflation predictions. If people think prices will rise tomorrow, they are likely to spend and borrow more today and to demand wage increases to offset the predicted rise in the cost of living. By bracing for inflation, they can in effect create it.The importance of expectations, Mr. Kuroda said, was behind the bank\u2019s decision to aim on Wednesday for even faster price rises. \u201cWe are showing an extremely strong commitment,\u201d he said.Yet the longer the bank goes without succeeding, some specialists say, the more likely people are to ignore its promises.\u201cKuroda gambled and lost,\u201d said Takuji Okubo, an analyst at Japan Macro Advisors. He pointed to other tweaks to its policies announced on Wednesday as evidence that the bank itself recognized it needed to change course.In one of the changes, the bank said it would seek to exert more direct influence on long-term interest rates, instead of just the short-term rates that central banks normally control. Long-term rates have fallen as a result of the bank\u2019s policies. That is what the bank wanted \u2014 lower borrowing costs are good for economic activity \u2014 but if anything, they may have fallen too far.Commercial banks have complained loudly. They make money by exploiting differences between the cost of short- and long-term credit, which have largely disappeared in Japan. In a review of the Bank of Japan\u2019s policies completed before Wednesday\u2019s announcement, central bank officials identified the situation as an adverse side effect that could destabilize the financial system.In the future, the bank said, it would carry out its bond-buying program in such a way that yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds \u2014 the benchmark for long-term borrowing costs \u2014 would \u201cremain more or less at the current level\u201d (around zero). The share prices of commercial banks rose sharply in response.Mr. Okubo said the bank\u2019s new long-term rate target amounted to a tightening of monetary policy, an assertion Mr. Kuroda rejected. The 10-year yield has fallen as low as minus 0.3 percent since February, after the Bank of Japan took the unusual step of cutting its crucial short-term rate below zero, and it remained slightly negative on Wednesday.\u201cIt\u2019s not tapering,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said, adding that the bank would continue to buy bonds at a rate of about 80 trillion yen a year, or about $785 billion, the same as previously.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Preparing for the Primaries", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayUpdated, 11:17 a.m.Good morning on this flawless Monday.When it comes to the looming state and local elections, the primaries could be the biggest battles.\u201cThe primary is often a lot more of a race than the general election is in certain districts,\u201d Ms. Rosier said.\u201cThat seat hasn\u2019t been open in a while, and four is quite a lot,\u201d Ms. Rosier said.The long-term incumbent, Velmanette Montgomery, a Democrat who has served in the State Senate since 1984, is facing Michael Cox, who has served prominently in the Obama administration.The State Senate is split between 31 Democrats and 31 Republicans, with one vacancy. This is the battle for that empty seat, and there are five candidates who want it.Here\u2019s what else is happening:We officially nominate today as a perfect day.Expect plenty of sun, a soft breeze, and a cloud or two to make its way across the sky, for a bit of variety.Luckily, similarly splendid candidates are in the forecast this week.In other news:Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr were running as Democratic-Republicans, and the president, John Adams, and Charles Pinckney were running as Federalists.The Democratic-Republicans prevailed, but here\u2019s where it gets tricky: At the time, votes did not distinguish between candidates for president and vice president.So when Jefferson and Burr tied, the decision of who would become president was left to the House of Representatives, which was controlled by the Federalists.Alexander Hamilton, a staunch Federalist, loathed Aaron Burr and made it known.He must have had a way with words, because Jefferson \u2014 the lesser of two evils, in Hamilton\u2019s opinion \u2014 was elected president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of the First Debate", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollowing is a transcript of the first presidential debate on Monday, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight\u2019s format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We\u2019ll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America\u2019s direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we\u2019ll have an open discussion.The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)Well, I don\u2019t expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we\u2019re going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let\u2019s begin.We\u2019re calling this opening segment \u201cAchieving Prosperity.\u201d And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There\u2019s been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we\u2019ll build together. Today is my granddaughter\u2019s second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work.And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I\u2019ve heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you\u2019re under. So let\u2019s have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let\u2019s be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.How are we going to do it? We\u2019re going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it\u2019s good to be with you. We\u2019re going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.Mr. Trump, the same question to you. It\u2019s about putting money \u2014 more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes.So we\u2019re losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what\u2019s happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it\u2019s the eighth wonder of the world. They\u2019re building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much.So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They\u2019re all leaving. And we can\u2019t allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we\u2019re going to do, but perhaps we\u2019ll be talking about that later.But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left \u2014 fired 1,400 people. They\u2019re going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we\u2019ve ever had.I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that\u2019s exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy.We just have a different view about what\u2019s best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that\u2019s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we\u2019ll be and that everything will work out from there.I don\u2019t buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we\u2019ll grow. That\u2019s the kind of economy I want us to see again.Our country\u2019s in deep trouble. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They\u2019re the best, the best ever at it. What they\u2019re doing to us is a very, very sad thing.So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they\u2019re taking our jobs, they\u2019re giving incentives, they\u2019re doing things that, frankly, we don\u2019t do.Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We\u2019re on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there\u2019s a tax. When they sell in \u2014 automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there\u2019s no tax. It\u2019s a defective agreement. It\u2019s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven\u2019t done anything about it.Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton \u2014 yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It\u2019s very important to me.But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She\u2019s been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn\u2019t she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you\u2019re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you\u2019re wrong.And once you say you\u2019re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I\u2019m saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that\u2019s a big, big factor.In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \u201cGee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\u201d Well, it did collapse.Now, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we\u2019re now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.Independent experts have looked at what I\u2019ve proposed and looked at what Donald\u2019s proposed, and basically they\u2019ve said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.They\u2019ve looked at my plans and they\u2019ve said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it\u2019s real.So I\u2019ve tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we\u2019re going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we\u2019ve made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.Now, look, I\u2019m a great believer in all forms of energy, but we\u2019re putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can\u2019t do what you\u2019re looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.The Obama administration, from the time they\u2019ve come in, is over 230 years\u2019 worth of debt, and he\u2019s topped it. He\u2019s doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they\u2019re not doing it.And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they\u2019re gone.And, Hillary, I\u2019d just ask you this. You\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you\u2019ve been doing it, and now you\u2019re just starting to think of solutions.(CROSSTALK)When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.But let\u2019s not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I\u2019ve said what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m going to have a special prosecutor. We\u2019re going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we\u2019re going to hold people accountable.When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can\u2019t win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)So we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I\u2019m very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.When I go around \u2014 Lester, I tell you this, I\u2019ve been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing \u2014 the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I\u2019m cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.I\u2019m going to cut regulations. I\u2019m going to cut taxes big league, and you\u2019re going to raise taxes big league, end of story.(CROSSTALK)Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I\u2019d like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you\u2019re calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I\u2019d like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.I\u2019m getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it\u2019s not a tax \u2014 it\u2019s really not a great thing for the wealthy. It\u2019s a great thing for the middle class. It\u2019s a great thing for companies to expand.And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they\u2019re going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can\u2019t bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won\u2019t allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what \u2014 is so bad.So what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re leaving our country, and they\u2019re, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can\u2019t work out a deal to \u2014 and everybody agrees it should be brought back.Instead of that, they\u2019re leaving our country to get their money, because they can\u2019t bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can\u2019t get together. Because we have \u2014 we have a president that can\u2019t sit them around a table and get them to approve something.And here\u2019s the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it\u2019s double that. It\u2019s probably $5 trillion that we can\u2019t bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you\u2019d get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.(LAUGHTER)You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...(CROSSTALK)And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We\u2019re in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that\u2019s going to come crashing down.We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that\u2019s doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political \u2014 by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you\u2019re going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income \u2014 in fact, the income \u2014 I just looked today \u2014 the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.But that\u2019s the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that\u2019s doing so badly, that\u2019s being ripped off by every single country in the world, it\u2019s the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody \u2014 Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who\u2019s negotiating these trade deals?We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.And in a way, I should be complaining. I\u2019m not even complaining. I don\u2019t mind it. It\u2019s almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don\u2019t.I will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns \u2014 against my lawyer\u2019s wishes \u2014 when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release.(APPLAUSE)I will release my tax returns. And that\u2019s against \u2014 my lawyers, they say, \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d I will tell you this. No \u2014 in fact, watching shows, they\u2019re reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don\u2019t release your returns until the audit\u2019s complete. When the audit\u2019s complete, I\u2019ll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.So you\u2019ve got to ask yourself, why won\u2019t he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he\u2019s not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he\u2019s not as charitable as he claims to be.And the financial disclosure statements, they don\u2019t give you the tax rate. They don\u2019t give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he\u2019s ever going to release his tax returns, because there\u2019s something he\u2019s hiding.And we\u2019ll guess. We\u2019ll keep guessing at what it might be that he\u2019s hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.As far as my tax returns, you don\u2019t learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that.The other thing, I\u2019m extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 \u2014 which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that\u2019s really not a lot of money. It\u2019s not a lot of money relative to what I had.The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was \u2014 actually, it wasn\u2019t even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn\u2019t even on that. But it\u2019s not $650. It\u2019s much less than that.But I could give you a list of banks, I would \u2014 if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly.I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It\u2019s because it\u2019s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country\u2019s a mess, you know, it\u2019s one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything\u2019s in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country.You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible \u2014 you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land \u2014 we\u2019ve become a third world country.So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we\u2019re a mess. We haven\u2019t even started. And we\u2019ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it\u2019s 6 or 5, but it looks like it\u2019s 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.And it\u2019s really a shame. And it\u2019s politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We\u2019re a debtor nation. We\u2019re a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don\u2019t have the money, because it\u2019s been squandered on so many of your ideas.And the other thing I think is important...And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I\u2019ve met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It\u2019s a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn\u2019t pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...I can only say that I\u2019m certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.And when we talk about your business, you\u2019ve taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn\u2019t get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.Now, if you want to change the laws, you\u2019ve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I\u2019m running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that\u2019s what I do.But what she doesn\u2019t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I\u2019ll give you an example. We\u2019re just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don\u2019t get there one way, I\u2019m going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.But we\u2019re opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I\u2019m a year ahead of schedule. And that\u2019s what this country should be doing.We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they\u2019re supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don\u2019t have people that know what they\u2019re doing.When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country.The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it\u2019s been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we\u2019ve seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.So how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.And we\u2019ve got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they\u2019re well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we\u2019ve got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we\u2019re seeing today.And when I look at what\u2019s going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what\u2019s going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it\u2019s \u2014 I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long \u2014 we need law and order in our country.I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just \u2014 just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very \u2014 I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he\u2019ll because it\u2019s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.In Chicago, they\u2019ve had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I\u2019m saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over \u2014 almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order.Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn\u2019t be having it.We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they\u2019re illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant.The Times analyzed the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump in real time.We have to be \u2014 we have to know what we\u2019re doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don\u2019t have good community relations in Chicago. It\u2019s terrible. I have property there. It\u2019s terrible what\u2019s going on in Chicago.But when you look \u2014 and Chicago\u2019s not the only \u2014 you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there\u2019s some bad things going on. Some really bad things.But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do.Now, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don\u2019t want to see it creep back up. We\u2019ve had 25 years of very good cooperation.But there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it\u2019s just a fact that if you\u2019re a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we\u2019ve got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say \u2014 we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.We need to have more second chance programs. I\u2019m glad that we\u2019re ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn\u2019t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this.And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now \u2014 and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby \u2014 right now, we\u2019ve got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who\u2019s on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.I\u2019ve met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it\u2019s an issue. They\u2019ve got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn\u2019t be on there, we\u2019ll help them, we\u2019ll help them legally, we\u2019ll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that\u2019s a term that I think was a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s been horribly met, as you know. I think you\u2019ve apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say.And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you\u2019re talking about takes guns away. Well, I\u2019m talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don\u2019t think \u2014 I really don\u2019t think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.I think maybe there\u2019s a political reason why you can\u2019t say it, but I really don\u2019t believe \u2014 in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It\u2019s hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.Look, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?But let\u2019s also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.The African-American community \u2014 because \u2014 look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They\u2019ve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that\u2019s what it is. They\u2019ve controlled these communities for up to 100 years.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)When I got involved, I didn\u2019t fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I\u2019m satisfied with it. And I\u2019ll tell you why I\u2019m satisfied with it.(CROSSTALK)Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know \u2014 now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that\u2019s not true. Look, it\u2019s true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter \u2014 you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can\u2019t bring back jobs, she can\u2019t produce.(CROSSTALK)But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I\u2019ve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.(LAUGHTER)And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.But it can\u2019t be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump\u2019s best efforts to bring him down.But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn\u2019t work. It really doesn\u2019t.Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father\u2019s company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country \u2014 it was a federal lawsuit \u2014 were sued. We settled the suit with zero \u2014 with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do.But, frankly, I look \u2014 I look at that, and I say, isn\u2019t that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it\u2019s just one of those things.I\u2019ll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it\u2019s a tremendously successful club. And I\u2019m so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I\u2019m very, very proud of it. And that\u2019s the way I feel. That is the true way I feel.Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There\u2019s no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald\u2019s very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...(CROSSTALK)And we\u2019re going to have to make it clear that we don\u2019t want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don\u2019t want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country.And the Russians need to understand that. I think they\u2019ve been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that\u2019s why I was so \u2014 I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It\u2019s one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information \u2014 in administrations...In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They\u2019ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed \u2014 16,500 Border Patrol agents.So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I\u2019ll take the admirals and I\u2019ll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we\u2019re in. Look at the mess that we\u2019re in.As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we\u2019re not. I don\u2019t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She\u2019s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don\u2019t \u2014 maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That\u2019s what we learned.Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don\u2019t know, because the truth is, under President Obama we\u2019ve lost control of things that we used to have control over.We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they\u2019re beating us at our own game. ISIS.So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is \u2014 it is a huge problem. I have a son. He\u2019s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it\u2019s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it\u2019s hardly doable.But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that\u2019s true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.We\u2019re making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we\u2019re hoping that within the year we\u2019ll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they\u2019ve had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we\u2019ve got to defeat ISIS, and we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.So she talks about taking them out. She\u2019s been doing it a long time. She\u2019s been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn\u2019t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn\u2019t have had them.Or, as I\u2019ve been saying for a long time, and I think you\u2019ll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil \u2014 and we should have taken the oil \u2014 ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil \u2014 a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.But let\u2019s talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That\u2019s the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people?And I think we\u2019ve got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.So we\u2019ve got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we\u2019ve got to work more closely with our allies, and that\u2019s something that Donald has been very dismissive of.We\u2019re working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We\u2019re working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.They\u2019re on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald\u2019s rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that\u2019s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they\u2019re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they\u2019re going.But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I\u2019m a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I\u2019ll tell you. I haven\u2019t given lots of thought to NATO. But two things.Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren\u2019t paying their fair share. Number two \u2014 and that bothers me, because we should be asking \u2014 we\u2019re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they\u2019re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because \u2014 and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest \u2014 but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times.And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that\u2019s great. And I think we should get \u2014 because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It\u2019s a lot of money to protect other people. But I\u2019m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.And they\u2019re going to do that. And that was \u2014 believe me \u2014 I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to get credit for it \u2014 but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn\u2019t believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can\u2019t believe it. They said...And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in \u201904. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely \u2014 because if you read this article, there\u2019s no doubt. But if somebody \u2014 and I\u2019ll ask the press \u2014 if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it\u2019s a terrible and a stupid thing. It\u2019s going to destabilize the Middle East. And that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s done. It\u2019s been a disaster.(LAUGHTER)I have a much better \u2014 she spent \u2014 let me tell you \u2014 she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising \u2014 you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names \u2014 oh, temperament, let\u2019s go after \u2014 I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a...(LAUGHTER)Let\u2019s talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it\u2019s ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.And we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn\u2019t enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.And we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran\u2019s nuclear program without firing a single shot. That\u2019s diplomacy. That\u2019s coalition-building. That\u2019s working with other nations.The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I\u2019d blow them out of the water and start another war. That\u2019s not good judgment.(LAUGHTER)Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we\u2019re losing a fortune. That\u2019s why we\u2019re losing \u2014 we\u2019re losing \u2014 we lose on everything. I say, who makes these \u2014 we lose on everything. All I said, that it\u2019s very possible that if they don\u2019t pay a fair share, because this isn\u2019t 40 years ago where we could do what we\u2019re doing. We can\u2019t defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they\u2019re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not \u2014 we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike.I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it\u2019s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can\u2019t take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we\u2019re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I\u2019ve ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn\u2019t you do that? Why didn\u2019t you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody\u2019s ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.So you say to yourself, why didn\u2019t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don\u2019t have to do much.It is essential that America\u2019s word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I\u2019ve talked with a number of them. But I want to \u2014 on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.It\u2019s also important that we look at the entire global situation. There\u2019s no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I\u2019d rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.And Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he\u2019s going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it\u2019s like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it\u2019s a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That\u2019s what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they\u2019re abroad or at home.We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that\u2019s right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we\u2019re defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we\u2019re defending them, and they\u2019re not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don\u2019t believe that Hillary has the stamina.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)But it\u2019s bad, bad experience. Whether it\u2019s the Iran deal that you\u2019re so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it\u2019s the Iran deal, whether it\u2019s anything you can \u2014 name \u2014 you almost can\u2019t name a good deal. I agree. She\u2019s got experience, but it\u2019s bad experience. And this country can\u2019t afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.(APPLAUSE)(APPLAUSE)But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something...And I will tell you this, Lester: It\u2019s not nice. And I don\u2019t deserve that.But it\u2019s certainly not a nice thing that she\u2019s done. It\u2019s hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...(APPLAUSE)And I know Donald\u2019s trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election\u2019s really up to you. It\u2019s not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don\u2019t even know.(APPLAUSE)The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue.A reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. My thanks to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump and to Hofstra University for hosting us tonight. Good night, everyone.ENDAn earlier version of this transcript, compiled and provided by the Federal News Service, omitted some sections.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Decline in Oil Prices Lands on Government Workers as Saudi Arabia Cuts Paychecks", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cuts, unveiled in a series of royal decrees and cabinet statements read aloud on state television, reduced ministers\u2019 salaries by 20 percent, slashed perquisites for members of the consultative assembly and limited overtime pay and vacation for civil servants.The drop in world petroleum prices since 2014 has caused major financial problems for the Saudi government, which gets most of its income from oil and ran a budget deficit of nearly $100 billion last year.The new measures came as a shock to many in the country\u2019s bloated public sector, which for decades has served as a vehicle for the royal family to distribute its oil wealth in the form of well-paid jobs that often require little work.More than two-thirds of employed Saudis work for the government.The government this year started a major project, known as Vision 2030, aimed at overhauling the economy, reducing the dependence on oil and creating a more productive native work force.Yet few of the plan\u2019s measures have been put in place. The government has raised fuel and water prices and frozen large construction contracts, leaving some companies unable to pay their workers.But Monday\u2019s cuts were the first to reduce Saudi paychecks.Royal decrees cut ministers\u2019 pay by 20 percent and forced them to pay their own telephone bills for personal lines. They also cut by 15 percent stipends for housing, cars and other perks for members of the country\u2019s consultative Shura Council, who are appointed by the king.In a statement, the cabinet limited the bonus that civil servants can earn for working overtime and capped annual leave at 30 days. It also put a freeze on new hires for government jobs through the end of the year.Saudi troops currently involved in the country\u2019s war in Yemen were exempted, the statement added.Besides its budget difficulties, the Saudi economy also faces a demographic challenge, with an estimated 300,000 new job seekers entering the market every year. With the government no longer able to absorb them, many economists doubt that the private sector can either, threatening to raise unemployment rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Do You Make Turbo Engines More Efficient? Just Add Water", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFOR decades, automakers have relied on turbocharging, which uses energy captured from exhaust gases to force additional air into the cylinders, to increase the power and efficiency of some gasoline engines.But turbocharged engines are in a bind, caught between increasingly stringent fuel economy and emission standards and consumers unwilling to sacrifice performance to achieve those environmental benefits.That\u2019s why a prominent automotive supplier has developed a counterintuitive technology that could enhance turbocharged engines for passenger cars by improving fuel economy with no reduction in power.How? By spraying water into the cylinders as the engine is operating.The basic principle is that by cooling combustion temperatures and reducing the tendency of the fuel-air mixture to fire erratically, water injection allows engineers to increase an engine\u2019s compression ratio, or reduce engine size, that way increasing its efficiency. The developer, the German auto supplier Robert Bosch, calls its system WaterBoost.It is not a new concept. Water-injection technology came to prominence during World War II, when it was used to enhance the performance of supercharged, piston-powered fighter planes during takeoffs and strenuous combat maneuvers.Water injection made another appearance in one of the first turbocharged production cars, the 1962 Oldsmobile Cutlass Turbo Jetfire, where, instead of the sophisticated antiknock sensors that are standard equipment in modern cars, a mixture of water and methanol was added to the air-fuel mixture to control combustion.Water injection appeared again in the 1980s in some turbocharged Formula One cars, which did much to burnish turbocharging\u2019s public appeal.But the approach has never caught on for mass-market automobiles.Whether it can take hold now is a big question for Bosch. But BMW, one of Bosch\u2019s customers, is already using a version of the technology in its high-performance M4 GTS cars, and company officials said they liked the results. It was Bosch\u2019s involvement in BMW\u2019s project that led Bosch to develop WaterBoost as a stand-alone product.\u201cWe are highly convinced about the performance of the M4 GTS and very delighted about the enthusiastic feedback we get from our customers,\u201d Dirk Haecker, vice president of engineering at BMW\u2019s M Division, wrote in an email exchange. Mr. Haecker said BMW was considering adopting the water-injection technology for other of its M-series cars.But Bosch, which plans to have a commercial version of WaterBoost available by late 2019, faces some market challenges.The drawbacks include the need for carmakers to redesign the intake ports and many other components of their turbocharged engines, and the need for consumers to periodically refill a tank with distilled water. And some experts predict that other less disruptive technologies will emerge that can bring similar efficiency gains to turbocharged engines.\u201cIf today\u2019s turbocharging were the future technology, I would say it is likely that manufacturers will pick this up in the future,\u201d said John German, a senior fellow at the International Council on Clean Transportation, an independent nonprofit group. \u201cBut it\u2019s the potential to achieve similar efficiency improvements in other ways that I think is the biggest challenge to WaterBoost technology, in ways that don\u2019t require the consumer to refill the water tank.\u201dBosch says WaterBoost can reduce fuel consumption by as much as 4 percent in regular driving conditions and by as much as 13 percent in high-load situations, like accelerating on a freeway or making long uphill climbs.While Bosch had extensive experience in the development of water-injection systems for motor sports, where minimizing weight and maximizing performance are the primary considerations, developing a version suitable for passenger cars presented a challenge.\u201cSystems for racecars are really different than for passenger cars,\u201d said Martin Frohnmaier, general project manager at Bosch. \u201cFor passenger cars you need to focus much more on endurance, much more on durability and so on.\u201dThe power of modern turbocharged engines is limited by a number of variables, including knocking and heat stress on the exhaust components. By cooling the fuel-air mixture under high-load conditions, water injection reduces the knocking tendency and also reduces the need to inject additional fuel into the cylinders to protect the exhaust components through evaporative cooling. This allows the engine to produce more torque without a corresponding increase in fuel consumption.While BMW seems to be focused on using water injection as a means to increase performance, Bosch sees an opportunity for a much broader application of the technology aimed at meeting environmental goals.\u201cWe see water injection as very important technology to help our customers reach their emissions targets in the near future,\u201d said Fabiana Piazza, head of project management at Bosch.Ms. Piazza declined to speculate on what WaterBoost would cost automakers \u2014 and ultimately, car buyers \u2014 saying that the specifications of the system, and the complexity of incorporating it into their vehicle lines would vary.While Bosch says that WaterBoost is fully tested and plans to start production in 2019, how the system will fare in the marketplace is still a question. A number of other technologies under consideration \u2014 including cooled exhaust gas recirculation, variable compression ratio and something known as the Miller thermodynamic cycle \u2014 might also reduce fuel consumption of turbocharged engines by 3 to 5 percent.It is too early to know whether water injection would have the same impact on fuel economy in turbocharged engines outfitted with one or more of these other technologies.\u201cA lot depends on its synergies with these other technologies,\u201d said Mr. German of the International Council on Clean Transportation. \u201cRight now, with the current, relatively unsophisticated turbocharged systems, water injection should be quite effective. But will it still be effective as turbocharged engines become more sophisticated and efficient?\u201dA picture caption on the Automobiles page on Friday with an article about the use of water-injection technology to turbocharge car engines misidentified the technology used in BMW\u2019s M4GTS. It is BMW\u2019s own version of water injection, not Bosch\u2019s WaterBoost system.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s days before the opening of her sophomore show at Laura Bartlett Gallery in London, and Calero is at Gloria\u2019s Unisex Salon, a local\u2019s haunt that\u2019s situated under the railway arches in Elephant and Castle. \u201cI realized I needed a change,\u201d she says, showing off her Rapunzel length jet-black hair. \u201cIt has got so long that cycling around Berlin, where I live, has become kind of dangerous.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time the artist has visited Gloria Dominguez\u2019s salon. After spotting an advertisement for the hairdresser in a copy of the local Latin News (Dominguez hails from Ecuador), Calero enlisted her help for her debut display at Laura Bartlett \u2014 a reconstructed Latin beauty salon, where visitors could get their hair and nails done.\u201cI really like to socially engage with people in my work,\u201d explains Calero, who is wearing her trademark blue studio jacket, picked up from a Berlin hardware store and covered with the same painterly markings as her latest canvases. \u201cHaving left Venezuela for Spain when I was 17, my approach is always with the eye of an immigrant.\u201d Calero\u2019s frequent focus is the precarious political situation in her native country, which is currently on the verge of collapse, and her stand at Art Basel this summer featured a Venezuelan Currency Exchange Booth, an experiential commentary on the country\u2019s faltering economy and rampant inflation. Even the act of cutting one\u2019s hair is politically charged for her: \u201cHaving your hair and nails done may seem superficial,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut back home salons have an important social function. It\u2019s not just about beauty, it\u2019s a place to share secrets and to find black market goods, such as toilet roll, that you can no longer get in the supermarket. The hairdresser is almost like a psychologist.\u201dFor an artist with a confessed fear of blank spaces, whose paintings typically act as a vibrant backdrop to her complex installations, this \u201cSolo Pintura\u201d (meaning \u201conly paintings\u201d) show is something of a rarity. \u201cFor the first time I feel as though the canvases can speak for themselves,\u201d she says of the work, whose freewheeling feel and Caribbean colors are often likened to Matisse\u2019s, but whose influence is drawn as much from Mexican muralists and the Brazilian modernist Tarsila do Amaral. Calero touches on, and revisits, themes from every style she\u2019s ever created: There are studies of interiors (which recall her grandmother\u2019s farm in the grasslands plains of Los Llanos), tropical fruit motifs, architectural elements and glorious mosaic patterns brought into magnified relief. The show\u2019s pared-back display is entirely aligned with Calero\u2019s own clean-cut new look, with hair that has been deftly shorn to shoulder-length by Dominguez in a matter of moments. \u201cOh my god!\u201d cries Calero, holding a braid aloft in something akin to a victory wave, before embracing Dominguez. \u201cFor a minute I thought I looked like a teenage boy \u2013 but I love it, Gloria!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What I Learned From a Stroke at 26: Make Time to Untangle", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPreoccupationsAs an idealistic, knowledge-hungry college graduate and aspiring writer, I had grown tired of hopping from one office gig to the next. It was 2000 and technology was in full bloom. I wanted to cash in on the digital gold rush. Like many of my friends in Austin, Tex., I figured, why not join the internet economy?I answered an ad for a job at a venture-backed start-up company with a focus on education. More than just offering stock options, the job promised a creative launching pad that I would have been foolish to ignore. After interviewing for the position, I happily accepted the company\u2019s offer.Each day at the company was a sensory experience filled with color \u2014 the office was painted in 17 of them \u2014 fragrant candles, brain games and yoga balls. Each week pulled me into stimulating projects, problems to solve, new technology and, best of all, interaction with a team of talented, intelligent and dedicated co-workers.My ambition swelled. I hustled my way up the chain of command and managed to survive layoffs. In a matter of months, I found myself leading development and marketing for a team of designers, programmers, producers, subject matter experts, sales staff and writers.I would easily clock 70 hours of work a week \u2014 more if we were on a deadline. I was often the first in the office and the last to leave. But I was more than happy to give my job my all.To keep up the pace, I put myself through a series of self-imposed tortures that included overcaffeinating and taking catnaps in place of real sleep. I was 26 and felt invincible. I figured I could handle the pressure, so I ignored repeated headaches, blurred vision and general exhaustion.Early one summer morning in 2001, I arrived at the office and felt a slight buzzing in my right eye and some tingly numbness in my hands, which I dismissed as mere morning grogginess. A little later, I stood up to make a presentation at a team meeting. A colleague later told me she saw my mouth droop as my words started slurring.The next thing I knew, someone was saying: \u201cYou\u2019ve had a stroke. We have to run a scan to figure out what\u2019s going on. Do you understand?\u201dI was in my 20s, and my brain was damaged. I couldn\u2019t articulate my thoughts to the doctor or nurses. While the words were there and I clearly saw them in my mind, I couldn\u2019t connect them to speech. My hands were still tingling, and I was unable to sign my name after my brain scan, because I couldn\u2019t remember how to spell it.When I was discharged from the hospital late the next day, the cabdriver asked me, \u201cWhere do I take you?\u201d I couldn\u2019t remember the name of my street. I handed him the discharge paperwork with my address on it, arrived home and slept for a long while.Being so young, I had not even considered that having a stroke was a possibility. But I have since learned that they are on the rise among younger people. My doctor did not directly link my stroke to overwork, but said it could have been aggravated by stress, overexertion and exhaustion.After being released from the hospital, I felt helpless and humiliated over my loss of control. My aura of invincibility had shattered. But I slowly recovered. Every night, I\u2019d practice spelling polysyllabic words, like \u201carachnophobia\u201d and \u201cCzechoslovakia,\u201d backward; I\u2019d do complex math problems; I worked on relearning memories that had been disrupted. I practiced yoga and meditation. The more I accepted my imperfect mind, the more I settled into a place of contentment.Thanks to the support of my colleagues, I returned to work, but by necessity my frenetic daily sprint had to slow to a crawl. Now I made time for pauses and reflection \u2014 and my work, and my life, became richer as a result.Because of the stroke, I reset my professional priorities. With each new career opportunity \u2014 from writing books to starting a company to consulting on various projects \u2014 I learned the value of a calendar and how to avoid overcommitment.I began to own my calendar and live by it. I scheduled everything in it: work commitments, exercise, walks, social gatherings and even sleep time. I continue to do so to this day. I now have a daily mental reset hour that is usually every afternoon around 4 or 5. I walk with my wife, I breathe, I smile, I meditate and say hello to random people and animals, and I write in a journal or draw.Even today, as I run multiple ventures and travel frequently, I still make time to untangle from the digital world and plug back into what really matters: time with people I love, time for creativity and time in nature. As for my career, I look at it as a series of meaningful projects stacked one on top of another, none of them too consuming or overwhelming.Overload is the way of work these days. It\u2019s how the ambitious among us are hard-wired, and it\u2019s quite dangerous, as my experience showed. But it\u2019s also dangerous for us not to fully pursue \u2014 and give our all to \u2014 opportunities that move us forward. This is the dynamic tension we face in today\u2019s creative economy.If we want more, we have to give more, but we have to stay aware of what we might give up in the process. While it\u2019s great to be ambitious, we must learn to listen for cues, step back and slow down the pace at times. We need to learn how to create space for both making a living and making a life.Jonas Koffler is a co-author, with Neil Patel and Patrick Vlaskovits, of \u201cHustle: The Power to Charge Your Life With Money, Meaning and Momentum\u201d (Rodale).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cultural Property Protection Law Comes Under Fire in Germany", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Art of Collecting\u201cI can imagine that Berlin will become considerably more important if London loses its influence,\u201d Mr. Roth predicted in an interview with the German press agency DPA.But then Germany held a vote of its own. It\u2019s not going anywhere, but maybe a lot of art there isn\u2019t, either.In early July, Parliament enacted the Cultural Property Protection Law, or Kulturgutschutzgesetz. The most contentious feature of the law requires a license to take any artwork that is more than 70 years old and valued at more than 300,000 euros out of Germany. A license will be approved only if a branch office of a government agency \u2014 there will be one for each of the 16 states \u2014 determines that the work is not of national significance.Opponents of the law say it will do little to achieve its goal of preserving Germany\u2019s cultural heritage and could damage it by limiting public viewing, in and out of the country, of important works. For so little, if any, benefit, the critics add, the potential restriction on so much art \u2014 works priced above \u20ac300,000, or about $337,000, hardly constitute an exclusive club \u2014 will make Germany a smaller and more insular market and put a cap on prices.The law caused considerable harm even before it was enacted, German dealers say. Because it was discussed and debated for months, collectors saw it coming. Many exported works that might have required a license after it took effect. They were egged on, the dealers say, by the big international auction houses, which offered to sell or store works abroad after warning owners of the plunge in value that would occur if they remained in Germany.Representatives from Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s said they preferred not to discuss the law or their response to it.With many works taken abroad, the law has had an appreciable impact already, but authorities on the market fear that there is more to come. The need for an export license will dampen interest from buyers, they predict, especially those outside Germany.\u201cA high-value work could sell for one-tenth of the price in Germany\u201d that it might fetch elsewhere \u201cbecause it\u2019s a low-price market,\u201d said Clare McAndrew, the founder and managing director of Art Economics, a research and consulting firm in Dublin. In Germany, she said, \u201cthey don\u2019t have high-value sales or a critical mass of buyers.\u201dThe law is not the only impediment that the German government puts in the way of art collectors and dealers. Mr. K\u00f6nig pointed out that value-added tax, at 19 percent, is assessed on the total price of an art sale, not just on the profit that a dealer makes from it. German dealers also must add 5.8 percent to the price of a work bought from a living artist as a social charge, he said.Critics of the law make a persuasive case. Too persuasive, in the opinion of Klaus Gerrit Friese, a prominent Berlin gallery owner and the former director, for 18 years, of the Association of German Galleries.\u201cGalleries hurt themselves by discussing it so openly,\u201d Mr. Friese said. \u201cEveryone says the market is weak and they\u2019re not getting the money they expect when something is sold in Germany. They think they can get double or triple when they sell in Switzerland or London.\u201dThe export of nationally important artworks was subject to a state veto before the law was passed. But it was applied sparingly. The law brings the export of any modestly priced work under government discretion, drawing complaints on several grounds.Judging cultural importance on financial, rather than exclusively curatorial, criteria shows a lack of understanding of what makes a work part of a country\u2019s heritage, art experts say. It also betrays what many see as the real reason behind the law: a desire to allow German museums to buy good merchandise cheap.\u201cThey\u2019re saying they don\u2019t want it to leave the country,\u201d Mr. Schultz said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t want to pay the price to keep it here.\u201dIf that is an intention of the law, it may backfire, said Friederike Gr\u00e4fin von Br\u00fchl, a partner in Berlin for the law firm K&L Gates who focuses on art issues. German tax rules confer benefits on collectors who lend their works to public institutions, but the raised profile that comes from public exhibition has made some clients reluctant to lend their art, regardless of the breaks, Ms. von Br\u00fchl said. \u201cI hear from collectors that they don\u2019t want to put works on display because they will become known and be considered part of the national heritage,\u201d she said.The law may seem like an un-European restriction on the free movement of property, but Ms. McAndrew noted that art is singled out in the European Union\u2019s founding document. \u201cIn the Treaty of Rome, one derogation allows member states to put whatever controls they like on something called \u2018national treasures,\u201d\u2019 she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the one exception to free trade.\u201d Many countries have cultural property laws of varying severity. Italy and Spain \u201ccall everything a national treasure,\u201d Ms. McAndrew said. Britain\u2019s law is less restrictive. Its most important feature is a market mechanism; if a buyer is found for a work that comes under the law, the government has a year to match the price offered or let it go. The law is somewhere in the middle, Ms. McAndrew said, but she called the law \u201cquite an invasion of people\u2019s private property rights.\u201d But in Germany, private property confers responsibilities, not just rights, Ms. von Br\u00fchl said. The constitution includes a notion of noblesse oblige: an obligation for those who have \u2014 art in this case \u2014 to share it with those who do not.The validity and limits of the law will ultimately be decided in the courts, she said, with the highest court, the Federal Constitutional Court, being the eventual final arbiter. To try to push the process along, collectors are being encouraged to step up and create test cases to challenge the law. In the meantime, collectors who want to export art can try to turn the cultural bureaucracy to their advantage. Dealers say they have adopted a tactic of shopping around for a branch of the licensing agency that might see a particular work as insufficiently important to keep in the country.\u201cYou\u2019re still allowed to move it around within Germany,\u201d Mr. Schultz said. \u201cYou could take it to a place where they don\u2019t care as much. Berlin may say yes,\u201d that a work is of national importance. \u201cBavaria may say no.\u201dAs for those who have spirited their collections out of the country already, they may not be as much in the clear as they think, at least not financially, especially if Britain was the final destination. All of a German citizen\u2019s assets are liable to inheritance tax wherever they may be, Ms. von Br\u00fchl said, but other countries tax the estates of foreigners on assets located within their borders.Treaties typically eliminate double taxation that arises from discrepant legal systems, but no such treaty exists between Germany and Britain, she said. German collectors who bought a one-way ticket to London for their art may want to move to a tax-friendlier location, such as Amsterdam, she advised.Another option to consider, she said, is owning art through a company, foundation or trust.There is more at stake in the law than just the prices at which artworks sell and the ability to move them in and out of the country, Ms. von Br\u00fchl added.A thriving German art market \u201cis good for the whole cultural ecosystem,\u201d she said. \u201cArtists like to live in Berlin today. That could change.\u201dThat is what worries Mr. K\u00f6nig. He said he was considering opening a gallery in London, Brexit or no Brexit, or New York as a hedge against adverse developments at home.\u201cI hope German culture remains so prosperous that we can survive this,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as the art remains strong, we should be O.K., but it\u2019s questionable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some 400 EU-led peacekeepers help maintain calm, but that force could be expanded if hostilities break out.But there are fears that any instability could spill over into a region where the prospect of European Union membership has seemed increasingly elusive.In Serbia, impatience is rising over the slow process of joining the European Union, and the country\u2019s economy is shaky.Even as the region struggles with corruption and ineffective administration, the European Union is facing a backlash from voters in countries like France, the Netherlands and elsewhere who are angry about the handling of the refugee crisis, and leery of expanding the 28-nation bloc.But Mr. Latal, the analyst in Sarajevo, said the West could not afford to ignore Bosnia.\u201cThe West has forgot the hard lessons of the past, that Bosnia can dangerously destabilize the region,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk is that they make the same mistake they made in early 1990s, where they were unable to prevent breakup of the former Yugoslavia and war.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Tourists Pump Cash Into a Hot Destination: China", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANYA, China \u2014 When Stephan Stoss arrived here six years ago, little more than lush foliage lined the roads leading to the 492-room Hilton where he is now general manager.Few other international hotels had been built along the town\u2019s picturesque bays. Mr. Stoss and his colleagues from those that were operating would meet regularly for dinner around a small table.Today, they would need a banquet hall. St. Regis and MGM hotels have joined the Hilton on a stretch of white-sand beach on Yalong Bay. Elsewhere in Sanya, Hyatt, Westin, Shangri-La and other prominent chains have built properties. Hilton alone has three hotels in town.Those once-quiet streets around the Hilton are clogged with tour buses. Upscale apartment blocks and gated communities of multimillion-dollar villas have replaced the wild brush.\u201cThe speed things go here, you don\u2019t have that in any other destination,\u201d said Mr. Stoss, 54. \u201cOnly China.\u201dAgainst the backdrop of China\u2019s slowing economy, tourism is a bright spot. Many Chinese families are still getting wealthier, and spending that extra income on travel.Groups of Chinese tourists are already a common sight, from Times Square to Buckingham Palace to Angkor Wat. But a bigger part of the travel story is the boom within China. Last year, Chinese tourists took four billion domestic trips, twice as many as in 2010 and significantly more than the 122 million journeys abroad, according to government statistics.The government has been encouraging Chinese families to pack up and go. As the economy\u2019s traditional export and investment engines have been slowed by feeble demand and excess factories, policy makers are trying to shift toward services and consumption.Tourism is central to that transition. The government hopes China\u2019s swelling middle class will spend more on leisure and entertainment to create jobs in hotels, airlines and restaurants.\u201cHere it is becoming more important for people to have quality spare time,\u201d Mr. Stoss said, \u201cand they are willing to pay for that.\u201dBeijing is counting on travelers like Leng Zhichen, 28. Mr. Leng, an entrepreneur from Qingdao in Shandong Province on the east coast of China, travels with his wife and 2-year-old daughter nearly every month, often for long weekends and usually within China.\u201cI like to spend more time with my child, and have her experience different places,\u201d Mr. Leng said as he relaxed in the Hilton\u2019s lobby.Despite the economic downturn, his income is surging \u2014 up tenfold in three years to 3 million renminbi ($450,000). With more disposable cash, he spends several times as much on hotels and meals as he previously had.\u201cMy travel has changed since I had a family,\u201d said Mr. Leng, who runs his own jewelry brand. \u201cI stay in nicer hotels and eat better-quality food.\u201dHainan, the island province that includes Sanya, is at the center of the government\u2019s push.In 2009, the national government designated Hainan for development as an \u201cinternational tourism island\u201d and unleashed a torrent of investment to support its travel industry. A high-speed railway that zips around the island was completed last year, and a new airport for Sanya is on the way. Private investors poured money into expensive golf courses, luxurious hotels and rows of vacation homes.On Sanya\u2019s beaches, crowded with frolicking children, worries about China\u2019s economy seem a distant mirage. Last year, tourist arrivals in Sanya neared 15 million, almost 70 percent more than five years earlier. Ninety-eight percent of the visitors were Chinese.Revenue from tourist businesses more than doubled over that time, to 30 billion renminbi ($4.5 billion) last year. It helped drive Hainan\u2019s overall growth, with the province\u2019s economy up 7.8 percent in 2015, substantially faster than the 6.9 percent nationally.But not all is perfect in paradise. When the government selects one sector for support \u2014 whether steel or solar panels \u2014 it often helps contribute to undue exuberance among investors, resulting in wasteful projects that depress the economy.In Hainan, the excitement over tourism has left the island littered with more golf clubs, apartment buildings and hotel suites than even the rising tide of travelers can fill. The number of hotel rooms in Sanya has increased 40 percent in only five years.The boom in hotels has created such cutthroat competition that room rates have dropped about 30 percent in three years, Mr. Stoss of Hilton estimated. \u201cIt is becoming harder and harder\u201d to maintain revenue, he admitted.Too many golf courses are chasing too few golfers as well. Lured by the increasing tourist traffic, investors opened eight golf courses in Sanya, many of them with luxurious clubhouses catering to rich Chinese.But President Xi Jinping\u2019s anticorruption campaign has scared government officials and state enterprise executives away from the game, seen by many in China as a sport for the well heeled. The high season for golf, during the cooler winters, is only about four months long, leaving the courses scrambling for customers the rest of the year.\u201cMost golf courses are losing money,\u201d said Dai Yuying, general manager of Sanya Luhuitou Golf Club, adding that his tournament-quality course is managing to break even. \u201cThe number of people who play golf has decreased a lot.\u201dToo many vacation homes are roasting empty in the Sanya sun. The local property association estimated that it would require nearly four years to find buyers for all of the unsold residences on the market.While the pace of expansion has slowed somewhat, developers are still building. Lu Keyong, marketing director of the Yalong Bay Development Company, said his firm remained convinced that more tourists would bring more home buyers. The company is building more apartments near Sanya\u2019s airport.\u201cThe need for accommodation is a necessity for people,\u201d Mr. Lu said.The government is prodding investors to do more than throw up hotels and apartments. Officials said it had become harder to get state permission to build hotels.Instead, they are encouraging investment in projects with a wider range of entertainment options. One hotel complex, Kerzner International\u2019s $1.6 billion Atlantis, will have water slides, exhibits of marine life, and event halls when it opens in 2017.\u201cThere is only one thing I worry about in the long term,\u201d said Zhao Kuan, secretary general of the Sanya Tourism Association, a business group. \u201cWe need to diversify the attractions.\u201dThe jammed restaurant at the Grand Metropark Resort near the Hilton offers reason for optimism.At one table, Chen Hong, 32, slurped up a morning bowl of noodles with her sister, sister-in-law, parents, nephew and 5-year-old son. Ms. Chen, from Xuzhou in eastern China, was on her first trip to Sanya, and said she wanted to take a lot more vacations like this one.Her husband\u2019s income as a civil servant has increased in recent years, and so has their interest in travel. They aim to take one long vacation a year, especially since they see it as important for their child.\u201cI think travel should broaden his horizons,\u201d she said.Zhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May, Britain\u2019s Prime Minister, Plays the \u2018Brexit\u2019 Waiting Game", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From BritainLONDON \u2014 She is known in the British civil service as Theresa May, or Maybe Not. But after months in which she has provided little clue as to how she intends to negotiate Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, Mrs. May could soon have a harder time dodging the question.Mrs. May got through the summer by saying, \u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d a gnomic statement that raised countless questions; left cabinet ministers trying to shape the debate to their own, often diverging, views; and annoyed her counterparts in Europe, who are eager to get on with the negotiations.The leaders of the 27 other European Union nations will meet on Friday in Bratislava, Slovakia, but Mrs. May has been conspicuously excluded from the gathering, intended to begin discussing the shape and direction of the bloc after a British exit. Like much of Britain, the European leaders are still trying to discern her priorities and to size up her approach to carrying out a historic and complex rupture.The choices ahead are extremely complex and contentious, and for now, Mrs. May is letting various members of her cabinet set their own priorities, while emphasizing that the government \u2014 namely, she \u2014 has not yet taken official positions. She has no intention, she told Parliament, of giving \u201ca running commentary\u201d of the negotiations.In it, Mr. Johnson, reflecting concern among campaigners from the \u201cLeave\u201d camp that Mrs. May would water down their victory by negotiating a less-than-full break from Brussels, laid down four red lines: control over immigration from European Union countries, an end to British contributions to the European budget, ceasing the application of European legislation to Britain, and removing the country from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.At some point, Mrs. May\u2019s studied silence risks creating a leadership vacuum or feeding into the economic uncertainty that has hung over Britain since the referendum. The most fundamental decision may be how much to prioritize control over immigration, one of the clear demands from the referendum, and ending the freedom of movement and labor that membership in the European Union requires.While those favoring a British departure promised during the referendum campaign that immigration could be controlled and that Britain could retain access to the single market, agreement by the other 27 countries is nearly inconceivable, as it would overthrow one of the basic tenets of the bloc: that market access and freedom of movement are inextricably linked.While reclaiming control over the nation\u2019s borders seems to be the priority for many of the voters who favored leaving the bloc, many business interests in Britain \u2014 not least the financial services industry in the City of London and big manufacturers \u2014 want to retain access to the single market.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.When Mr. Davis told the House of Commons this month that it was \u201cvery improbable\u201d that Britain would remain in the single market, Mrs. May, through her spokeswoman, chided him and said he was only \u201csetting out his opinion.\u201d\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s view is that we should be ambitious and go after the best deal we can,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Helen Bower.Britain\u2019s financial sector, which represents 10 percent of gross domestic product, wants to preserve \u201cpassporting rights,\u201d the ability to offer services throughout the rest of the bloc, including in the 19 countries that use the euro. The chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, who backed remaining in the European Union, also wants to preserve passporting rights.In an interview in London, Mr. Macron said that financial institutions based in Britain must be prevented from selling their services in the eurozone after the country leaves the European Union. Passporting is an integral part of the single market, he said, and \u201cshould not be seen as a technical issue but a matter of sovereignty.\u201dHe continued: \u201cWe have the eurozone. Could we accept to be cleared, regulated and de facto have inflows and outflows from a country that has decided to leave the E.U.? For me, definitely not.\u201dIn the meantime, Mrs. May and her country are getting a taste of what it will mean to be outside Europe. While the summit meeting of the other European Union leaders on Friday in Bratislava is expected to produce little of substance, its theme is \u201csecurity,\u201d including borders, migration, terrorism and further defense cooperation. These are issues in which Britain, still a full member of the European Union, has a considerable interest and stake.How much cooperation will Britain after its departure want or expect from the European Union on such matters as policing, intelligence sharing, arrest warrants, extradition?Mrs. May, Britain\u2019s home secretary for six years, will have to make some choices there, as well.Advertisement"}

The region has recovered from the mudslides and flooding of 2011 that devastated the towns of Monterosso and Vernazza, and that decommissioned trails along the famous coastal path between the other villages: Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore. But another threat still looms: over-tourism. Possible remedies?

Opened last summer, Rio Bistrot is a modern osteria nestled above the village\u2019s minuscule harbor serving dishes that showcase the bounty of the local sea. At a table on the stone terrace, watch fishermen haul in the day\u2019s catch while savoring buttered toasts topped with plump anchovies from Monterosso (13 euros) and paccheri with fresh mussels from Riomaggiore (15 euros). And book in advance; this spot won\u2019t remain undiscovered for long.Vernazza is arguably the most photogenic \u2014 and popular \u2014 village, so arrive early before it\u2019s overrun with day-trippers. Pop into Batti Batti\u2019, a hole-in-the-wall focacceria, for a take-away breakfast of cheesy focaccia di Recco or pesto-slathered pizza (4 euros each). Then head to the quay to picnic while admiring the lemon-hued church, bobbing boats in the harbor and the pretty main piazza slowly coming to life. Return to Riomaggiore and follow signs for the Via dell\u2019Amore. This romantic cliff-top path, part of the Sentiero Azzurro, is closed indefinitely, but similar views can be found at A Pi\u00e8 de M\u00e0, a cafe and bar in a magnificent location near the trailhead. At a table on the terrace, high above the churning sea, try a glass of Cinque Terre wine from Walter de Batt\u00e8, a small artisanal producer of the region\u2019s floral white blend (6 euros). Prefer eating among Italians rather than in a polyglot dining room? Then reserve a table at L\u2019Articiocca, a cozy restaurant that opened in 2013 on a quiet side street in Levanto, one train stop north of Monterosso. Once seated on the patio, start with the Levanto specialty gattafin, pastalike fritters stuffed with spinach and wild herbs. Then order the trofie al pesto, twisted Ligurian pasta served in the traditional manner, with potatoes and green beans. The aromatic green sauce is prepared tableside with a well-worn mortar and pestle \u2014 a fun flourish that doubles as a free cooking lesson. Service is extremely genial but slow, so use the time between courses to sample rare craft beers produced by small Ligurian breweries, like Birra del Bracco and Genova\u2019s Maltus Faber. Dinner for two, about 70 euros. This may be the Italian Riviera, but the only Cinque Terre town with a wide swath of beach is Monterosso. In high season, rows of umbrellas in a rainbow of colors line the town\u2019s spiaggia di Fegina, each hue demarcating a different beach club. Arrive early to claim a spot on the free public beach, or pay for a sun-lounger to spend the morning relaxing in the shade of an umbrella between dips in the turquoise sea.Hundreds of steps separate the train station from the center of Corniglia, but the ascent is worth it for a truly local lunch. At Km 0, a small panino shop that opened in 2013, sandwiches and salads are composed of hyperlocal ingredients, like the Pignone panino with Ligurian sausage and fresh stracchino cheese from nearby Brugnato (5 euros). For dessert, walk down the street to Alberto Gelateria, an artisanal gelato shop where Corniglia\u2019s own products, like honey and basil, are used to create sensational flavors.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified one of the five towns of Cinque Terre. The village of Manarola is shown, not the village of Riomaggiore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "England\u2019s Forgotten Muslim History", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionLondon \u2014 Britain is divided as never before. The country has turned its back on Europe, and its female ruler has her sights set on trade with the East. As much as this sounds like Britain today, it also describes the country in the 16th century, during the golden age of its most famous monarch, Queen Elizabeth I.One of the more surprising aspects of Elizabethan England is that its foreign and economic policy was driven by a close alliance with the Islamic world, a fact conveniently ignored today by those pushing the populist rhetoric of national sovereignty.From the moment of her accession to the throne in 1558, Elizabeth began seeking diplomatic, commercial and military ties with Muslim rulers in Iran, Turkey and Morocco \u2014 and with good reasons. In 1570, when it became clear that Protestant England would not return to the Catholic faith, the pope excommunicated Elizabeth and called for her to be stripped of her crown. Soon, the might of Catholic Spain was against her, an invasion imminent. English merchants were prohibited from trading with the rich markets of the Spanish Netherlands. Economic and political isolation threatened to destroy the newly Protestant country.Elizabeth responded by reaching out to the Islamic world. Spain\u2019s only rival was the Ottoman Empire, ruled by Sultan Murad III, which stretched from North Africa through Eastern Europe to the Indian Ocean. The Ottomans had been fighting the Hapsburgs for decades, conquering parts of Hungary. Elizabeth hoped that an alliance with the sultan would provide much needed relief from Spanish military aggression, and enable her merchants to tap into the lucrative markets of the East. For good measure she also reached out to the Ottomans\u2019 rivals, the shah of Persia and the ruler of Morocco.The trouble was that the Muslim empires were far more powerful than Elizabeth\u2019s little island nation floating in the soggy mists off Europe. Elizabeth wanted to explore new trade alliances, but couldn\u2019t afford to finance them. Her response was to exploit an obscure commercial innovation \u2014 joint stock companies \u2014 introduced by her sister, Mary Tudor.The companies were commercial associations jointly owned by shareholders. The capital was used to fund the costs of commercial voyages, and the profits \u2014 or losses \u2014 would also be shared. Elizabeth enthusiastically backed the Muscovy Company, which traded with Persia, and went on to inspire the formation of the Turkey Company, which traded with the Ottomans, and the East India Company, which would eventually conquer India.In the 1580s she signed commercial agreements with the Ottomans that would last over 300 years, granting her merchants free commercial access to Ottoman lands. She made a similar alliance with Morocco, with the tacit promise of military support against Spain.As money poured in, Elizabeth began writing letters to her Muslim counterparts, extolling the benefits of reciprocal trade. She wrote as a supplicant, calling Murad \u201cthe most mighty ruler of the kingdom of Turkey, sole and above all, and most sovereign monarch of the East Empire.\u201d She also played on their mutual hostility to Catholicism, describing herself as \u201cthe most invincible and most mighty defender of the Christian faith against all kind of idolatries.\u201d Like Muslims, Protestants rejected the worship of icons, and celebrated the unmediated word of God, while Catholics favored priestly intercession. She deftly exploited the Catholic conflation of Protestants and Muslims as two sides of the same heretical coin.The ploy worked. Thousands of English traders crossed many of today\u2019s no-go regions, like Aleppo in Syria, and Mosul in Iraq. They were far safer than they would have been on an equivalent journey through Catholic Europe, where they risked falling into the hands of the Inquisition.The Ottoman authorities saw their ability to absorb people of all faiths as a sign of power, not weakness, and observed the Protestant-Catholic conflicts of the time with detached bemusement. Some Englishmen even converted to Islam. A few, like Samson Rowlie, a Norfolk merchant who became Hassan Aga, chief treasurer to Algiers, were forced. Others did so of their own volition, perhaps seeing Islam as a better bet than the precarious new Protestant faith.English aristocrats delighted in the silks and spices of the east, but the Turks and Moroccans were decidedly less interested in English wool. What they needed were weapons. In a poignant act of religious retribution, Elizabeth stripped the metal from deconsecrated Catholic churches and melted their bells to make munitions that were then shipped out to Turkey, proving that shady Western arms sales go back much further than the Iran-contra affair. The queen encouraged similar deals with Morocco, selling weapons and buying saltpeter, the essential ingredient in gunpowder, and sugar, heralding a lasting craving and turning Elizabeth\u2019s own teeth an infamous black.The sugar, silks, carpets and spices transformed what the English ate, how they decorated their homes and how they dressed. Words such as \u201ccandy\u201d and \u201cturquoise\u201d (from \u201cTurkish stone\u201d) became commonplace. Even Shakespeare got in on the act, writing \u201cOthello\u201d shortly after the first Moroccan ambassador\u2019s six-month visit.Despite the commercial success of the joint stock companies, the British economy was unable to sustain its reliance on far-flung trade. Immediately following Elizabeth\u2019s death in 1603, the new king, James I, signed a peace treaty with Spain, ending England\u2019s exile.Elizabeth\u2019s Islamic policy held off a Catholic invasion, transformed English taste and established a new model for joint stock investment that would eventually finance the Virginia Company, which founded the first permanent North American colony.It turns out that Islam, in all its manifestations \u2014 imperial, military and commercial \u2014 played an important part in the story of England. Today, when anti-Muslim rhetoric inflames political discourse, it is useful to remember that our pasts are more entangled than is often appreciated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Inequality Problem: Real Income Gains Are Brief and Hard to Find", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWorking families finally got a raise.Households all the way down the income scale made more money last year. The average incomes of the poorest fifth of the population increased 6.6 percent after three consecutive years of decline. And the official poverty rate declined to 13.5 percent from 14.8 percent in 2014, the sharpest decline since the late 1960s.\u201cThis shows the importance of robust labor markets,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cIf working-age Americans are going to get ahead, it is through a paycheck.\u201dAnd yet this positive news \u2014 while clearly undermining Donald J. Trump\u2019s unbridled pessimism about the American economy \u2014 does not justify unbridled celebration, either.\u201cThe next question is why did it take such a long time for things to look good?\u201d said Arloc Sherman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy analysis group. As Sheldon H. Danziger of the Russell Sage Foundation put it, it\u2019s great news that men\u2019s earnings from work increased 1.5 percent. But they are still lower than in the 1970s.The answer does not just involve sluggish growth. It is also about its distribution. Gains may be finally trickling down to those at the bottom of the ladder. But the numbers still offer a lopsided picture, with a gargantuan share of income rising to the top. While the bottom fifth of households increased their share of the nation\u2019s income, by the census\u2019s definition, to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent, the richest 5 percent kept 21.8 percent of the pie, the same as in 2014.\u201cThere\u2019s an inequality problem,\u201d Mr. Sherman added.Against the backdrop of the last few decades, the income gains revealed on Tuesday underscore how difficult the American economy has made it for average workers to get ahead. In nearly every successive economic cycle, progress came slower and harder than in the previous one.The data, which measured how Americans were doing six years into the economic recovery, show that incomes in the middle, measured in 2015 dollars, were still 1.6 percent below the previous peak of $57,423 a household, which was attained in 2007, just before the economy sank into what has come to be known as the Great Recession.How does that look compared to the nation\u2019s recent history? After the economy slipped into recession in 1969, it took only three years for incomes in the middle to rebound and surpass their previous peak. After the downturn of 1973, it took five; after back-to-back recessions in 1981 and 1982, it took seven.And, except for the long expansion that ran from 1991 through 2000, it has been getting worse. The economic growth from late 2001 to about the end of 2007 never even managed to deliver incomes above the previous peak for the typical household, reached near the end of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. The expansion underway today may not get there, either.Today, median household incomes are still 2.4 percent below the absolute peak they hit in 1999 \u2014 when Facebook had yet to come into existence, the big news in the music business was Napster, and the good times in Silicon Valley were about to come crashing down with the collapse of the dot-com bubble.At the bottom of the ladder, households at the 10th percentile \u2014 those poorer than 90 percent of the population \u2014 are still a bit poorer than they were in 1989. Americans have managed to develop an internet economy, invent social media and build driverless cars since then, but not to improve the lot of those at the bottom.Of course, the Census Bureau\u2019s numbers on income and poverty don\u2019t add up to a perfect representation of families\u2019 means. For one thing, they include only \u201cmoney income\u201d \u2014 excluding in-kind government benefits like housing vouchers or food stamps. They don\u2019t include the impact of taxes, ignoring the earned-income tax credit, which provides substantial help to families with low earnings.The current census data does suggest that growth can ultimately bring prosperity to average Americans. Still, it also points to the persistence of wide inequality as being at the center of the story.Across the entire bottom 60 percent of the distribution, households are taking home a smaller slice of the pie than they did in the 1960s and 1970s. The 3.4 percent of income that households in the bottom fifth took home last year was less than the 5.8 percent they had in 1974. With their share shrinking with almost every economic cycle, it is hardly a surprise that it takes longer for them to experience any income gains at all. Growth, alone, is not adding to their prosperity as it once did.By contrast, households in the top 5 percent have profited nicely from America\u2019s expansions. In 2015, they took in $350,870, on average. That is 4.9 percent more than in 1999 and 37.5 percent more than in 1989.Historical precedent suggests the latest economic expansion is getting long in the tooth. Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser in President Obama\u2019s first term, says there are better than even odds today that the United States will tip into a recession within three years. In July, Deutsche Bank said the probability of a recession within the next 12 months had jumped to 60 percent, the highest since August 2008. JPMorgan thinks the odds are 37 percent.For all but Americans at the very top, that means that the punch bowl may well be taken away again before the party really gets going. That is not how a well-functioning economy should work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hopes for Democracy\u2019s Spread Meet With Harsh Facts", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Democracy 2016WASHINGTON \u2014 These are tough days for enthusiasts of the world\u2019s steady march of democracy.A wave of nationalism \u2014 led by calls to raise the drawbridges against outsiders and their influence \u2014 has ushered in strongmen in places where, just a few years ago, democratic institutions seemed inevitably on the rise. Across the globe, the effects are clear: When nativism becomes a rallying call, tolerance and a willingness to compromise, the lubricants of liberal democracy, often seep away. The effects are dramatic. For a long while, American officials convinced themselves that Russia was gradually edging toward integrating itself in Western institutions, and the values they represent.But President Vladimir V. Putin has squeezed the life out of independent news media and any meaningful dissent in Russia. Increasingly, to oppose his government is to risk ending up dead.President Xi Jinping, who many in the Obama Administration thought four years ago would bring a modern, technocratic veneer to Chinese rule, and restrain its worst tendencies toward brutality, has veered in directions few in the administration predicted. The digital Great Wall is higher and thicker than ever. Newspapers and other publications have been shuttered, and his government has jailed dissidents on the vague charge of causing \u201cdisorderly\u201d debate. In Turkey, a freely elected leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, used a coup attempt against his government to execute what was clearly a preplanned purge that has cast thousands into prison, from schoolteachers to journalists. Washington has been reluctant to protest. It needs its bases in Turkey for the conflict in Syria. More than five years after the Obama administration urged President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to step down in the face of the protests, it is delivering arms and aid to his successor once removed, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a former general whose iron-fisted rule exceeds anything Mr. Mubarak ever managed to pull off. Yet Egypt\u2019s cooperation is so needed to keep a lid on the Middle East that the State Department is extraordinarily hesitant to condemn a situation in which democracy is a distant memory. Poland, the most effective of the newer members of NATO, has turned to a right-wing government, as has Hungary. In Austria, a presidential election in a few weeks could see the election of Norbert Hofer, who leads an anti-immigrant party.It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. The end of Cold War rivalries, China\u2019s growing wealth and integration with the world economy, the benefits of global trade and the internet\u2019s ability to wipe away traditional borders were supposed to make variations on the theme of democratic rule the inevitable choice.That was the meaning of \u201cThe End of History and the Last Man,\u201d Francis Fukuyama\u2019s 1992 book, which posited that the fall of the Berlin Wall was \u201cthe end point of mankind\u2019s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\u201d There are a few bright spots.In 1998, Indonesia looked like it might break apart after the fall of Suharto. Today it is an unruly but real democracy. From Africa to Latin America, there are stirrings of democratic instincts in places where they had rarely taken root. Yet ask around the world, and it is clear that the Western democracies that were supposed to be the model for a new, interconnected world look a lot less attractive than they once did. Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi deride the \u201cAmerican model\u201d as a prescription for disorder and decay. The election drama unfolding in the United States has fueled that argument, prompting many to question whether the style of democracy America preaches, for all its obvious benefits, brings out the worst instincts in an electorate.How did this happen? In a world where the internet was supposed to make everyone aware of the benefits of more direct democracy, how did the forces of order and authoritarianism roar back? How does one explain the rise of My-Country-First candidates like Donald J. Trump and the French far-right politician Marine Le Pen, both of whom have said that promoting democracy around the world is not a goal? The answers so far seem unsatisfying. Yes, the economic downturn that swept the world starting in 2007 left untold millions behind, and many have never caught up. A McKinsey Global Institute study concluded that roughly two-thirds of households in the world\u2019s wealthy countries saw their disposable income stagnate in the decade after the downturn, a sharp change from the decade before. The well-documented populist anger at elites, and the income inequality those elites represent, are often blamed for the backlash that has followed. But that is the kind of problem that working democracies are supposed to self-correct. Without question, Twitter, Facebook and the advent of mobile communications brought down dictators during the Arab Spring. It is hard to imagine the furious, seemingly spontaneous gatherings seen in Tahrir Square in Cairo and on the streets of Aleppo, Syria, without instant communications. Twitter, however, is better at starting a revolution than completing one. It can help organize a protest but not a government. That requires a set of skills that the street revolutionaries in Egypt, somewhat na\u00efvely, told Secretary of State Hillary Clinton they were uninterested in pursuing. It wasn\u2019t their job to create a new government, they told her on a visit to Egypt in the spring of 2011, not long after Mr. Mubarak was packed off to jail. She left dumbstruck, she told a reporter in her office shortly afterward.\u201cIf you don\u2019t organize, if you don\u2019t pick candidates, if you don\u2019t participate in the process, the Islamists are going to win,\u201d she recounted telling the protesters. They ignored her. Soon after the Islamists won the election, a countercoup put the generals back in charge, and now both the Muslim Brotherhood, which provided the first successor to Mr. Mubarak, and many of the protesters are locked up. Even in established democracies, the era of instant communications is having effects that few predicted. Mr. Trump has capitalized on those changes better than any politician in modern memory, brilliantly outmaneuvering 16 rivals who did not realize that the rules had changed.\u201cModern media enhances transparency, but that is a two-edged sword for democracy,\u201d said Joseph S. Nye Jr., the Harvard professor who wrote, most recently, \u201cIs the American Century Over?\u201d (He concluded that it has a lot of gas left.) \u201cMore people have information that allows them to participate, but leaders have less time and space for the deliberation and compromise that Madison believed were essential to effective democratic government.\u201d In fact, if there is a lesson of the past decade, it may be that information overload rarely translates into a political impetus to find middle ground. Mr. Trump\u2019s we\u2019ll-build-a-wall speech went viral, and people took sides. Instant video playback, and instant fact-checks, make it increasingly harder for politicians to gradually reverse positions without being called on it. While facts are available more readily than ever, they often seem to be afterthoughts. Witness the surge in Google searches in Britain about the meaning of leaving the European Union. The big surge happened the day after the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote, not before.What\u2019s clear is that Americans have to rethink the automatic assumption that the world secretly wants to replicate American-style, or even Western-style, democracies. Many do, but as Henry Kissinger noted lately, we fooled ourselves into thinking that our biggest challengers from the last century were now committed to integrating themselves into Western-designed, democratically-based institutions in this century. \u201cThe problem with the American view of Russia is that we have always thought of Russia as an incipient NATO country,\u201d Mr. Kissinger said last month at a forum in Kent, Conn. \u201cThat it would gradually slide into an orbit and accept a so-called rules-based system. But Russia has a different history and a different culture.\u201dSo do the Chinese and the Egyptians and the Turks. The leaders of those countries feel less pressure than they did a decade ago to open their societies. Democracy is hardly dead; for billions around the world, it remains a cherished dream. But the end of history, it turns out, looks more and more like another beginning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump Supporters Want You to Believe", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s assume, just for the sake of argument, that Donald Trump and his supporters on the deplorable right actually mean what they say and are not just spewing sound bites for fun or attention.If that\u2019s the case, here are some of the things they want Americans to believe:\u2022 Vladimir Putin, an unabashed dictator who invades other countries, tramples on his people\u2019s civil and human rights, and has the blood of Russian journalists on his hands is the proper role model for an American president.\u2022 Disgruntled right-wingers would be justified to rise in armed rebellion if they don\u2019t like the results in November. Because of course that\u2019s what Thomas Jefferson and the other founding fathers had in mind when they set in motion more than 200 years of peaceful transfer of power.\u2022 Hillary Clinton has a fatal illness and the national media are conspiring to cover it up. (Why have I never been invited to join these conspiracies?)The list goes on and on, and I have not even mentioned the idea that building walls on our borders and starting trade wars with countries like China would somehow jumpstart the American economy.Just this past weekend, the Republican governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, told the hilariously named \u201cValues Voter Summit\u201d that there could be bloodshed if Clinton is elected this fall.\u201cThe roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what?\u201d he said. \u201cThe blood, of who? The tyrants, to be sure, but who else? The patriots. Whose blood will be shed? It may be that of those in this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren.\u201d(Bevin was taking some liberties with a quote from Jefferson, who actually said that the blood of patriots is the \u201cmanure\u201d of the tree of liberty, which is a better description for Bevin\u2019s comments.)Bevin went on to talk about Islamic extremists who threaten American freedoms. But he clearly was echoing the view of some extremists, including Trump himself, who have suggested that violence might be an appropriate response to a Clinton victory.The Republicans call themselves the party of Abraham Lincoln, but seem to have forgotten that Lincoln took the nation to war to put down an illegitimate insurrection by Southern states who objected to his election. Maybe they just remember his suspension of habeas corpus, the kind of steel-fisted governing that Trump admires so much in Putin.At the town hall meeting last week where Matt Lauer made a national fool of himself, Trump said he admired Putin because he \u201chas very strong control over a country.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a very different system, and I don\u2019t happen to like the system, but certainly in that system, he\u2019s been a leader. Far more than our president has been a leader.\u201dThis is moral relativism in its most base form. Does Trump believe that Stalin, Mao and Hitler were even greater leaders? They had \u201cvery strong control\u201d \u2014 even if the systems they ran were mind-bogglingly brutal. They also were, ultimately, failures. Putin is such a good leader that he has presided over the economic collapse of his country.A presidential candidate\u2019s health, meanwhile, is actually relevant to voters. But it\u2019s hard to believe that Clinton\u2019s attackers really care about that. Questioning her physical well-being is just another way to throw mud at her.The ideas that have turned this election into such a farce are not just dangerous and appalling by the standards of American democracy and political traditions. They also violate just about every principle the Republican conservatives have been voicing since the days of Ronald Reagan, whom the Grand Old Party still claims as its icon.(I can just imagine Trump in Reagan\u2019s place, standing in Berlin and yelling \u201cMr. Gorbachev, nice wall!\u201d)Actually, the Republican Party that Reagan built has been moribund since the rise of the Tea Party and the do-nothing Congress led by Mitch McConnell and John Boehner. If Trump finally kills it with his conspiracy-mongering, immigrant-bashing, race-baiting and Kremlin-loving, it will just be a coup de gr\u00e2ce.Advertisement"}

Leaders will also discuss expanding readily deployable European Union forces and increasing joint cooperation on military procurement.Leaders are also expected on Friday to endorse allocating more police officers and equipment to help Bulgaria guard its southeastern border with Turkey and to help prevent another wave of mass migration.The looming question is how much the meeting in Bratislava can contribute to addressing Europe\u2019s biggest challenge: reversing the notion that pro-European leaders and the Brussels bureaucracy are promulgating a vision of Europe that is increasingly out of step with the political sentiment in much of the bloc.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dismal Days for Brazilian Democracy", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorRio de Janeiro For an event that marked the end of an era, the final act of the impeachment of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was a staid affair, punctuated by procedure and civil speeches.When the final vote count was announced \u2014 61 for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s removal, and 20 against \u2014 the senators joined in an impromptu rendition of the national anthem. Around the country, protests were few and sparsely attended.By Brazilian standards, it was a strangely muted reaction after the yearlong battle that had paralyzed the nation. Its conclusion capped more than a decade of Workers\u2019 Party rule, led first by Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who took office in 2003, then by his successor, Ms. Rousseff, from 2011. And it marked the end of a period of growth, political stability and optimism during which working-class Brazilians had felt truly represented in power and had dared to expect more for themselves, their families and their country.Brazil was the next big thing \u2014 and Brazilians believed it. The feeling was captured when the International Olympic Committee announced its decision to award the 2016 Summer Olympics to Rio de Janeiro, bringing the Games to South America for the first time. Hearing the news, Mr. da Silva cried, \u201cThe world has recognized that the time has come for Brazil.\u201dAs rapid and exhilarating as Brazil\u2019s rise was, its unraveling over the years that followed has been slow, painful and exhausting.First, the economy. After reaching a peak in Mr. da Silva\u2019s last year in office, when gross domestic product grew 7.5 percent, growth slumped during Ms. Rousseff\u2019s first term to 0.1 percent in 2014, and then the economy went into free fall, shrinking nearly 4 percent last year.What does this all mean for Brazil?Dilma Rousseff\u2019s ouster marks the end of a 13-year period in which Brazilians had dreamed big, only to see their newfound expectations, new self-image and national aspirations dashed. While Mr. da Silva was a symbol of a nation\u2019s hopes, Ms. Rousseff became a lightning rod for its frustrations.Not even the Olympics could lift the mood. The president was removed, but her slow-motion downfall did not provide Brazil with the catharsis it craved. There were those tears, yes; but if few protested, even fewer celebrated.That\u2019s because Ms. Rousseff\u2019s departure is a first step toward change, but it does not mean those who took it know the next one. Her impeachment leaves Brazilian democracy with a power vacuum, facing one of its toughest trials since it emerged from a military dictatorship more than 30 years ago.The Workers\u2019 Party is in tatters, but no other political group or leader has the credibility to unite an angry, divided electorate. Ms. Rousseff\u2019s vice president, Michel Temer, who now governs Brazil, is reviled. He will shift the country to the right, as he made clear when he nominated the first all-white, all-male cabinet in decades. He will try to pass unpopular budget-tightening measures, but it\u2019s doubtful he will succeed with such a fractious Congress.The country is weary of the scandals and political machinations that play out as a soap opera on the nightly news. Dilma Rousseff is gone, but her oddly muted departure suggests that few Brazilians expect things to improve anytime soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Put Globalization to Work for Democracies", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionA Chinese student once described his country\u2019s globalization strategy to me. China, he said, opened a window to the world economy, but placed a screen on it. The country got the fresh air it needed \u2014 nearly 700 million people have been lifted from extreme poverty since the early 1980s \u2014 but kept mosquitoes out.China benefited from the flourishing of trade and investment across national borders. For many, this was the magic of globalization.But it\u2019s not the whole story. Look closely at the economies that converged with richer counterparts \u2014 Japan, South Korea, China \u2014 and you see that each engaged globally in a selective, strategic manner. China pushed exports, but it also placed barriers on imports to protect employment in state enterprises and required foreign investors to transfer know-how to domestic companies.Other countries that relied on globalization as their growth engine but failed to put in place a domestic strategy became disillusioned. For example, few countries tried as hard as Mexico to integrate with the world economy, through Nafta and liberal trade and financial policies. Yet the country\u2019s economic growth in recent decades has been sluggish, even by the modest standards of Latin America.The bigger worry today is that unmanaged globalization is undermining democracy. Democratic politics remain tethered to nation-states, while institutions that make the rules for global markets are either weak or seem too distant, especially to middle- and lower-class voters.Globalization has deepened the economic and cultural divisions between those who can take advantage of the global economy and those who don\u2019t have the resources and skills to do so. Nativist politicians like Donald J. Trump have channeled the resulting discontent as hostility to outsiders: Mexican or Polish immigrants, Chinese exporters, minorities.We need to rescue globalization not just from populists, but also from its cheerleaders. Globalization evangelists have done great damage to their cause not just by underplaying the real fears and concerns on which the Trumps of this world thrive, but by overlooking the benefits of a more moderate form of globalization.We must reassess the balance between national autonomy and economic globalization. Simply put, we have pushed economic globalization too far \u2014 toward an impractical version that we might call \u201chyperglobalization.\u201dThe new model of globalization stood priorities on their head, effectively putting democracy to work for the global economy, instead of the other way around. The elimination of barriers to trade and finance became an end in itself, rather than a means toward more fundamental economic and social goals. Societies were asked to subject domestic economies to the whims of global financial markets; sign investment treaties that created special rights for foreign companies; and reduce corporate and top income taxes to attract footloose corporations.Some simple principles would reorient us in the right direction. First, there is no single way to prosperity. Countries make their own choices about the institutions that suit them best. Some, like Britain, may tolerate, say, greater inequality and financial instability in return for higher growth and more financial innovation. They will opt for lower taxes on capital and more freewheeling financial systems. Others, like Continental European nations, will go for greater equity and financial conservatism. International firms will complain that differences in rules and regulations raise the costs of doing business across borders, but their claims must be traded off against the benefits of diversity.Second, countries have the right to protect their institutional arrangements and safeguard the integrity of their regulations. Financial regulations or labor protections can be circumvented and undermined by moving operations to foreign countries with considerably lower standards. Countries should be able to prevent such \u201cregulatory arbitrage\u201d by placing restrictions on cross-border transactions \u2014 just as they can keep out toys or agricultural products that do not meet domestic health standards.Third, the purpose of international economic negotiations should be to increase domestic policy autonomy, while being mindful of the possible harm to trade partners. The world\u2019s trade regime is driven by a mercantilist logic: You lower your barriers in return for my lowering mine. But lack of openness is no longer the binding constraint on the world economy; lack of democratic legitimacy is.It is time to embrace a different logic, emphasizing the value of policy autonomy. Poor and rich countries alike need greater space for pursuing their objectives. The former need to restructure their economies and promote new industries, and the latter must address domestic concerns over inequality and distributive justice. Both objectives require placing some sand in the cogs of globalization. For example, developing nations may be allowed to subsidize some industries in return for rich nations being allowed to use tariffs against countries \u201cdumping\u201d goods produced under substandard labor or environmental standards.Fourth, global governance should focus on enhancing democracy, not globalization. Global governance cannot overcome major problems like inequality, social exclusion or low growth, but it can help by devising norms that improve domestic policy making, like requirements on transparency, public deliberation, broad representation, accountability and use of scientific or economic evidence in domestic proceedings. To some extent, the World Trade Organization already advocates these disciplines. They deserve greater priority over trade liberalization and regulatory harmonization.And finally, nondemocratic countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia \u2014 where the rule of law is routinely flouted and civil liberties are not protected \u2014 should not be able to count on the same rights and privileges in the international system as democracies can. When a nation is not democratic, we can no longer presume that its institutional arrangements reflect the preferences of its citizens. Therefore it lacks a prima facie argument for shielding its market rules from international scrutiny. It would be appropriate for democracies to consider less permissive rules for them \u2014 for example, by requiring a higher burden of proof from non-democracies when they file a trade complaint against democracies.When I present these ideas to globalization advocates, they say the consequence would be a dangerous slide toward protectionism. But today the risks on the other side are greater, namely that the social strains of hyperglobalization will drive a populist backlash that undermines both globalization and democracy. Basing globalization on defensible democratic principles is its best defense.Globalization, within limits, has been good economics. Globalization, within limits, can be good for our democracies, too.Dani Rodrik, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, is the author of \u201cEconomic Rules: The Rights and Wrongs of the Dismal Science\u201d and \u201cThe Globalization Paradox: Democracy and the Future of the World Economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Human Glitter.\u2019 The Beckerman Twins Are Fashion Week Stars", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySam and Cailli Beckerman go through every waking moment as if they have just won the big prize on the fun wheel. They radiate optimism to an almost absurd degree. They dress bravely and outrageously.\u201cThey\u2019re two of the most authentically joyful human beings I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life,\u201d said Karen Robinovitz, the creative director and co-founder of Digital Brand Architects, an agency that represents them. \u201cI describe them as human glitter.\u201dFor the Beckermans, New York Fashion Week is a chance to see friends from the global fashion tribe and to reconnect with companies that pay them.Hanging out with them, however, you see that it\u2019s hard to determine where the marketing ends and real life begins, which, for the brands, is the point. As Sam put it, about a recent project: \u201cWe\u2019re Disney girls. We\u2019re obsessed.\u201dThey are also Chanel girls, H&M girls, Moschino girls, Coach girls, Refinery29 girls, Aldo girls and Kenzo girls. Does that leave anybody out?\u201cOh, yeah, we\u2019re Saks girls, too,\u201d Cailli said.What sets the Beckermans apart from other fashion bloggers, and what brands and designers love about them, is their over-the-top personal style. They often wear clashing, cartoonish, multilayered outfits that few others could pull off \u2014 say, Haruno Shibuya Army pants with blue faux-fur on the knees paired with Fenty x Puma sneakers and a Coach black leather vest.And there are two of them.\u201cI try to be like the Beckermans,\u201d Ms. Rocha said. \u201cI put on everything in the morning. And then I take it off. I\u2019m scared to be fun.\u201dThe Beckermans were once New York-based designers themselves. They lived in the city for 10 years. They graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology and had a short-lived clothing line, Beckerman, that showed in 2007 during fashion week.Creating and marketing a collection was stressful, they said. They much prefer attending other designers\u2019 shows, which combines all their favorite things: taking photographs, meeting people, seeing fresh fashion and dressing up.They arrived on Sept. 7 from Toronto, where they live together, schlepping five bags of checked luggage between them.\u201cNot the hard-shell kind, they don\u2019t expand enough,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThe stretchies.\u201dOn Thursday, after lunch with a friend and before a party hosted by the Gap and Refinery29, they rested briefly at the bar of the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown, where they were staying (they are not, for the record, Roosevelt girls).Though the observation commonly applies to identical twins, it\u2019s virtually impossible to tell Sam and Cailli apart. They both have long platinum blond hair parted in the middle and eyebrows dyed black. They both have the same full-throated laugh and voices like that of Melanie Griffith circa \u201cWorking Girl.\u201d They share email and social media accounts and sign off \u201cXo Sam and Cailli,\u201d so you can\u2019t ferret out distinctions online, either.In person, you\u2019re reduced to remembering that Cailli\u2019s face is ever-so-slightly rounder, and that Sam, by infinitesimal degrees, takes charge in social interactions. Knowing the awkwardness this induces in others, the women are fine with, and even encourage, treating them as one interchangeable unit.At the bar, Cailli wore Alexander Wang short shorts and thick-soled Chanel sandals that lit up, while Sam paired H&M leather shorts with her Chanel light-ups. Both wore on-brand Gap hashtag #DoYou T-shirts.They were excited for the whirlwind week ahead, but, then, every day is a whirlwind. In the last few months, working with various brands, they had traveled to the south of France (\u201cWe stayed in a villa\u201d), to a big mall in King of Prussia, Pa. (\u201cWe\u2019re mallrats\u201d), to Los Angeles (\u201cWe got to see our younger sister, Chloe\u201d), to Cuba and Vancouver, British Columbia, to Las Vegas for an electronic music festival (\u201cWe love dancing!\u201d) and to New York. Now they were back in the city before going to Toronto briefly and then Paris for more shows.\u201cI have to look through our Instagram to know what we did,\u201d Sam said jokingly, cracking herself and Cailli up.Soon their car and driver pulled up outside \u2014 provided for them, along with an accompanying hashtag to use, by Lexus. Crawling through traffic, they turned the S.U.V. into a mobile studio, snapping photos of their outfits and editing on their phones.\u201cThis is where we take the best selfies,\u201d Cailli said.Sam explained: \u201cThe lighting is great. You just have to make sure the seatbelt isn\u2019t showing too much.\u201dThe party was at a Gap pop-up shop in a raw storefront in TriBeCa. The Beckermans weren\u2019t required to do much more than show up, pick out some clothes from the racks and photograph themselves having fun wearing them.\u201cI saw their Chanel shoes and I was, like, please,\u201d Mr. Massel said. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to meet you guys for four years.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Massel appeared to be overheating in the Beckermans\u2019 presence. \u201cI\u2019m so sweaty,\u201d he said, whipping out his phone for a group selfie. \u201cI\u2019m so excited. I need to get a towel.\u201dTurning to a reporter, he said: \u201cNo one does fashion like them. You can\u2019t follow them for inspiration. You can\u2019t even try.\u201dIt takes work to look as stylishly kooky as the Beckermans. At the Gap party, under their outfits, they wore other outfits, Superman-style, so that they could quick-change for two more parties later that night.They also coordinated the entire week\u2019s looks in advance, as they do before every trip, dressing and photographing themselves at home so each outfit is cataloged on their iPhones.On Friday, amid another day of shows, appointments and parties, the Beckermans were fitted for the Jeremy Scott runway show. As friends and muses of the designer (\u201cWe\u2019re like his No. 1 hype girls,\u201d Cailli said), they would be sitting front row, wearing the kitschy, pop clothes Mr. Scott designs for his other label, Moschino, which seem tailor-made for them.At Moschino\u2019s Midtown headquarters, the sisters picked out complementary rather than matching outfits: rubber cowboy boots in pink and aqua and minidresses with a graphic image of animated characters, one Ren, the other Stimpy. \u201cWe try not to dress too twinny because we\u2019re already twinny,\u201d Sam said. (Or was it Cailli?)Katie Newman, a young publicist who helped the women select the outfits, said, \u201cI wish I could be your triplet.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re great girls,\u201d said Sam, who, like Cailli, is full of praise for nearly everyone and everything.Backstage after the show, the Beckermans gave Mr. Scott a congratulatory hug. The designer was asked what he loves about them.In a way, with their everyday outrageousness and unconditional love for clothes, the Beckermans resemble the fashion characters of a less commercial era. You got the sense that, even without the iPhones welded to fingers constantly typing out corporate-approved hashtags, Sam and Cailli would be doing the exact same thing they are doing now.Advertisement"}

By comparison, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2014 memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d which also fell short of expectations, sold more than 85,000 copies in its first week.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s more revealing 2003 memoir, \u201cLiving History,\u201d about her years in the White House, sold about six times as many copies in its first week as \u201cHard Choices.\u201dCandidates often release hurriedly-written books during their campaigns, often aimed at spreading their message and attracting publicity, rather than topping the best-seller charts.In 2006, Senator Barack Obama published \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d which laid out his vision for the country. In February 2008, when Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination against Mrs. Clinton gained momentum, the book averaged sales of more than 35,000 a week.Others cash in after an election. Sarah Palin\u2019s \u201cGoing Rogue: An American Life\u201d sold 469,000 copies in its first week in November 2009.\u201cStronger Together,\u201d whose cover shows Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine waving, arrived closer to Election Day than most of these types of books.Named after the campaign\u2019s slogan, \u201cStronger Together\u201d offers readers, according to the book jacket, \u201cspecific and practical solutions, while also articulating a bold and expansive vision of change and renewal.\u201dIts roughly 250 pages intersperse bullet-point policy ideas, like \u201claunch a national initiative for suicide prevention\u201d and \u201chumanely address the Central American migrant crisis,\u201d with photographs of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine on the campaign trail, charts in the campaign\u2019s signature chunky font and highlights from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches.Aides said that the proceeds were going to charity, and that the release was part of a larger plan to more clearly communicate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vision for the country, rather than just her case against Donald J. Trump, her Republican opponent.Timed to the Sept. 6 release of the book, Mrs. Clinton \u201cwill do a series of \u2018Stronger Together\u2019 speeches over the course of the next several weeks,\u201d a campaign spokesman, Jennifer Palmieri said. (A case of pneumonia caused Mrs. Clinton to postpone the first of those speeches, on an \u201cinclusive economy,\u201d initially scheduled for Tuesday in California.)Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kaine held the book up at campaign rallies last week.At one point, Mrs. Clinton greeted reporters on her campaign plane holding a copy of the book. \u201cWe\u2019re putting out a book tomorrow, called \u2018Stronger Together,\u2019 which is our blueprint for America\u2019s future,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe wanted voters to be able to find, in one easy place, all of the various plans and policies that I\u2019ve been talking about throughout this campaign.\u201dA spokesman for the publisher, Simon & Schuster, which also published Mrs. Clinton\u2019s earlier books and Bill Clinton\u2019s best-selling memoir, \u201cMy Life,\u201d declined to comment about the first-week sales.Advertisement"}

Christopher Bailey was there, chatting with fellow designers Mary Katrantzou and Roksanda Ilincic. Natalie Massenet and Anya Hindmarch, Joan Burstein, Vivienne Westwood and Carmen Busquets all hovered close by.So far, so fashion week.But this was no ordinary room, and it was no ordinary function. The party was at 10 Downing Street. And the host \u2014 sporting a crisp, oversize white shirt from a collaboration by the London-based duo Palmer Harding and the department store John Lewis, and some Russell & Bromley lip-motif kitten heels \u2014 was Theresa May, the country\u2019s new prime minister.\u201cBritish fashion is of huge importance to our country,\u201d Mrs. May said, especially the \u201cfashion apprentices, scholarship winners and graduate trainees who are the future of British fashion,\u201d who were also invited to the event. She also noted that the British fashion industry\u2019s contribution to the national economy had increased 8 percent in the 12 months ending in June, to 28 billion pounds, or $37 billion, according to the research firm Oxford Economics. And the sector generates almost 900,000 jobs.\u201cThe government I lead will do everything we can,\u201d she continued, \u201cincluding providing the right investment in training and skills, to help everyone, whatever people\u2019s backgrounds, to go as far as their talents can take them.\u201dFor decades the country, and London in particular, have been perceived as a melting pot of talent, both from home and abroad. Can the city maintain that reputation?\u201cFrom our homegrown start-ups to international fashion houses \u2014 every business in the creative industry will play a major role in ensuring we make a success of Brexit,\u201d Mrs. May said in a statement released later. (She did not mention the vote at the cocktail party.) \u201cBy taking advantage of the opportunities that leaving the E.U. gives us and playing to our strengths as a great trading nation \u2014 we can build a fairer economy that works for all, not just the privileged few.\u201d\u201cIt is fair to say that the majority of London\u2019s fashion industry were not in favor of Brexit,\u201d Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, said in an interview. \u201cSo the priority for us since has been to meet with as many people here as possible to hear concerns and give them access to advice around potential challenges like intellectual property regulations, trading tariffs and visas.\u201dThe council, Ms. Rush added, has joined forces with other arts-based industry bodies to communicate with the government in a unified voice.Lulu Kennedy, the founder of the fashion incubator Fashion East, suggested that while her organization\u2019s criteria traditionally required a candidate to have a business based in Britain, she now would be willing to consider nonresidents.And Ms. Katrantzou, a Greek who started her business in London after graduating from the Central Saint Martins master\u2019s program in 2009, and who was scheduled to show her latest collection on Sunday, noted that \u201cOnly 15 percent of the employees in my company are British \u2014 that says a lot about the type of people we can attract by being in London.\u2019\u2019\u201cThey all have diverse upbringings and perspectives, and came to the city to be part of and inspired by its vibrant arts scene,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI chose to live and work in London precisely because it is such a cultural magnet for creatives, and in proximity to the schools and established brands. Will future designers get that now?\u201dLeaders of the city\u2019s art and design schools emphasize that the answer to Ms. Katrantzou\u2019s question is yes \u2014 and say that they are working closely with the office of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to secure the best possible outcome from a Brexit. Nigel Carrington, the vice chancellor of University of the Arts London, which includes Central Saint Martins, said that the schools had told current students they would be able to stay in the country, and that they have been evaluating the potential impact on foreign students\u2019 fees and the flow of graduate talent. (Historically, students from European Union members have paid the same fees as British students.)Paul Thompson, the rector of the Royal College of Art, said that London\u2019s position as a hub of creativity was not just based on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union.\u201cThere are plenty of global cities that aren\u2019t part of the E.U. which are also great capitals of culture and finance,\u201d Mr. Thompson pointed out. \u201cThe top design talent won\u2019t want to leave London because it still has the best education prospects and broadest spectrum of specialist sectors in once place.\u201dBesides, he said, there were other factors threatening the city\u2019s artistic fabric, such as the eye-watering costs of living. \u201cBrexit isn\u2019t the biggest risk to London\u2019s position in the hearts and minds of creatives,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt is the expense of living here. Many artists and designers are now leaving, and rundown seaside towns like Margate and Hastings are experiencing a real renaissance. That is bad for London perhaps, but good for Britain over all.\u201dSotheby\u2019s, for its part, will hold its annual celebratory \u201cMade in Britain\u201d sale on Sept. 28, with items ranging from Swinging Sixties photographs and colorful postwar canvases to Young British Artist works by Damien Hirst. Alex Branczik, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art for Europe, said the auction house was expecting its best results yet.\u201cThere is a great deal of change and uncertainty at the moment \u2014 for every sector,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the city occupies a unique and powerful place in the creative mind, and in the minds of the world\u2019s collectors. I feel bullish that for now, that position is here to stay.\u201dAnd back at 10 Downing Street, Ms. Massenet was (unsurprisingly) equally upbeat, pointing out that she started her online fashion site Net-a-Porter in 2000, in the depths of the fallout from the first dot-com bubble.\u201cThere have been many booms and busts over the decades,\u201d she said. \u201cBut London fashion and the creative industries have endured \u2014 indeed, prospered even \u2014 in difficult times.\u201dAnd so the long catwalk to the future begins.Advertisement"}

Burman, director of the centrist Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make our long-term fiscal problems worse.\u201dTo varying degrees, all agreed that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposal would increase taxes on the rich and big business but that it would add so many new layers of complexity that it would, above all, be a huge boon for tax lawyers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of new complexity,\u201d said Mr. Burman.Although Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan is intended to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay more than they now do, it leaves intact loopholes that allow wealthy real estate developers like Mr. Trump to pay little or no tax, which could serve as a vehicle for sophisticated tax lawyers to exploit.David Kamin, an outside adviser to the campaign on tax and budget issues and an associate professor at New York University School of Law, said that the campaign was \u201ctaking a close look\u201d at provisions benefiting people like Mr. Trump, and that her proposals did not purport to cover every loophole she might seek to close or change as president.As for complexity, \u201cbroadening the base and closing loopholes for the wealthy inevitably involve a certain amount of administration,\u201d said Mr. Kamin, who emphasized that her proposals would simplify returns for small businesses and people with modest tax burdens.The experts generally praised Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals to benefit small businesses, which include a provision that would allow them to immediately deduct up to $1 million in capital investments, which would ordinarily have to be depreciated. (Mr. Trump has also called for immediately deducting capital investments, but on an even wider scale.)Mrs. Clinton has been frank in her acknowledgment that to pay for the many new social programs she has proposed, she needs to raise revenue, which she plans to do primarily through a tax increase on the rich.The Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution estimates that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tax plan would raise $1.1 trillion over the next decade; the Center for Federal Tax Policy at the more conservative Tax Foundation puts the figure at $498 billion, assuming no reduction in economic output from the tax increase.Nearly all the increase would come from new taxes on the wealthiest Americans. For those with adjusted gross incomes of more than $5 million, she would impose a 4 percent surcharge on top of the normal tax system. For those with incomes above $1 million, she would install a 30 percent effective tax rate, a version of what has become known as the \u201cBuffett rule\u201d after Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, complained that he paid taxes at a lower rate than his secretary. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan would also cap the tax value of deductions and exemptions at 28 percent and raise the estate tax.She would also close the notorious \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole that primarily benefits hedge fund operators and private equity managers, and, unlike Mr. Trump, not give it back by means of tax cut on the wealthy taxpayers who take advantage of it.The Tax Policy Center estimates that the top 1 percent of taxpayers \u2014 those with adjusted gross incomes of more than $750,000 \u2014 would face an average tax increase of $78,000, while the lower 95 percent \u2014 those earning less than $300,000 \u2014 would face little or no increase.But over all, Mrs. Clinton has shied away from a sweeping tax overhaul. \u201cIt\u2018s more tinkering at the edges,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation\u2019s policy center. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it reform. There aren\u2019t any major reformulations to make the code simpler or fairer. It\u2019s basically just a tax increase\u201d for the top income bracket.It goes without saying that raising taxes on the rich while leaving most of the existing tax code intact is anathema to Republicans and conservative economists, as well as many centrist Democrats who have long held dreams of a bipartisan \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d to carry out a sweeping tax overhaul to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the American economy.\u201cI have admiration for the mechanics\u201d of the Clinton proposals, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cThey\u2019re more detailed and structured than Trump\u2019s. But I have serious concerns about the quality. Their philosophy seems to be to give up on economic growth and try to deliver middle-class prosperity by taking from the rich.\u201dEveryone I interviewed criticized as fiendishly complicated and ineffectual what is probably Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most innovative proposal, which is to put in place a graduated scale for tax rates on capital gains.Under Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan, taxpayers reporting capital gains held for one to two years would pay their ordinary income tax rate, which currently goes as high as 39.6 percent, just as they do now for gains held less than a year. Gains of two to three years would be subject to a 36 percent rate, and after that the rate would decline by four percentage points each year until it reached the current long-term rate of 20 percent. (All rates exclude the additional 3.8 percent surtax on net investment income.) In effect, there would be seven rate brackets for capital gains, compared with two under the current code.Although this nominally raises capital gains rates for some assets, it is not clear what, if any, effect it might have on overall revenue. The Tax Foundation estimates that it would cost the Treasury $374 billion over 10 years because it would encourage investors to hold assets longer, which would defer their taxes. The Tax Policy Center says it would depress revenue in the early years as investors delayed sales, but would eventually add $84 billion over 10 years.But the goal is not revenue; it\u2019s supposed to curb \u201cactivist\u201d investors and others focused on short-term results, and persuade corporate executives to manage for the long term rather than for quarterly profit, according to a speech Mrs. Clinton delivered at New York University in July 2015.However laudable the goal, using the capital gains tax \u201cis a misguided approach,\u201d said Mr. Burman (a view echoed by everyone I interviewed).\u201cThere\u2019s no empirical evidence whatsoever this would have any effect on management decision-making,\u201d Mr. Burman said. \u201cThe real issue is corporate governance. It would be better if management faced more, not less, pressure from investors.\u201dHow did such an arcane proposal, likely to appeal to a tiny sliver of voters, even make it into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tax plan?Ms. Tanden, a close confidante and former campaign worker for Mrs. Clinton, succeeded the Clinton campaign manager John Podesta as president of the Center for American Progress, the think tank that published the paper. Mr. Effron is a co-founder of Centerview Partners, a Wall Street private equity and investment banking firm. Mr. Effron is also a major donor and fund-raiser for the Clinton campaign and has been mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary in a Clinton administration.\u201cSecretary Clinton believes that American businesses need to break free from the tyranny of today\u2019s earnings report so they can focus on innovating and investing for the long term,\u201d said Mike Schmidt, an economic policy adviser at the Clinton campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s what this proposal is designed to advance.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals also do nothing to address the corporate tax rate, which, at 35 percent, is the highest in the developed world (though few companies actually pay anywhere near that rate). President Obama called for reducing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent in a compromise rebuffed by Republicans, but Mrs. Clinton would leave it at 35 percent and try to extract even more revenue by closing various loopholes.\u201cYou\u2019d think the business community would be up in arms over this, but I haven\u2019t heard a peep,\u201d said Mr. Holtz-Eakin. \u201cThe focus on personalities has driven this off the radar.\u201dSeveral experts cautioned, as did the Clinton campaign itself, that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tax proposals might well evolve after the election should she become president.Details aside, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tax proposals offer a stark alternative to Mr. Trump\u2019s and send a clear message that a top priority \u201cis increasing the tax liability at the top,\u201d Mr. Kamin said.\u201cThe message is, that has to be a key element of any progressive tax reform. Beyond that, she has other priorities as well, such as simplifying taxes for small businesses and tax relief for working families,\u201d he added. \u201cBut these are the key priorities, not a comprehensive list of every detail in the tax code that needs reform.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Split Screen Framed Trump and Clinton", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookThe split screen told the story at the first 2016 presidential debate, and it was not kind to Donald J. Trump.At the right was his opponent, Hillary Clinton, a practiced one-on-one debater, who held long, studied gazes on her opponent, delivered calibrated attacks and turned to the audience to smile incredulously at his responses.At the left was Mr. Trump, the volatile presence who alpha-dogged a season of Republican debates. Now he grimaced, squinted, nodded, pursed his lips, sniffed, huffed and interrupted, becoming, over the night, an agitated man in a box.This seemed to be by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s design. She had reportedly prepared to face two different versions of her opponent. There might be a reserved Mr. Trump, ready to reassure voters about his self-control. Or there might be the raging, ranting Mr. Trump of the primaries.But it didn\u2019t take long for Mrs. Clinton to find the other Mr. Trump under that thin second skin. Her needling began immediately. She referred to her opponent as \u201cDonald,\u201d where he pointedly called her \u201cSecretary Clinton.\u201d (\u201cYes, is that O.K.?\u201d he asked at his first reference to her.) She referred to his starting a business with a \u201c$14 million\u201d loan from his father, which Mr. Trump preferred to call a \u201cvery small loan.\u201dThe digs targeted Mr. Trump\u2019s status and founding mythos, triggering his image-protection reflex. He became combative and rattled, letting his opponent lead him down rhetorical detours (at one point he revived an old feud with Rosie O\u2019Donnell) knowing that he would follow his ingrained ABCs: always be counterpunching.It was Tony Soprano vs. Dr. Melfi, TV\u2019s biggest antihero blustering against the woman who had gotten inside his head.The campaign mind games had begun before the actual contest, like fisticuffs at a boxing-match weigh-in. After Mark Cuban, the billionaire bugbear of Mr. Trump, announced on Twitter that he would attend the debate, Mr. Trump threatened to invite Gennifer Flowers, whose reported affair with Bill Clinton endangered Mr. Clinton\u2019s presidential run in 1992.But there were no big stunts on air, and little in the candidates\u2019 styles we hadn\u2019t seen before. Mr. Trump spoke in direct, punchy sentences and fragments: \u201cTypical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn\u2019t work.\u201d And he used his hands as an emoji keyboard, punctuating his words with slashes, stabbing fingers and pinched O.K. gestures.Mrs. Clinton was steady and poised. At times her lines sounded rehearsed. (Stop trying to make \u201cTrumped-up trickle-down\u201d happen. It\u2019s not going to happen.) But one of her most effective lines, which she seemed to be waiting for a chance to use, was about preparation itself.\u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president.\u201dThe two candidates\u2019 stage styles served as campaign arguments in themselves. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s spotlighting her debate practice was a shorthand defense of the experience that her opponents have cast as insiderism.Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has used his improvisatory style to suggest that he would govern the country by quick instinct and golden gut. (Thus his tendency to announce \u201ccalled it\u201d after tragic news events.)It\u2019s entirely possible that their demeanors each came across as winning to their respective bases \u2014 one more way in which two Americas have viewed the election through different frames.But Monday night, it was Mrs. Clinton who seemed to be having the debate she wanted. Her body language was controlled, and she more often directed her attention outward toward the camera and audience.Mr. Trump, the reality-TV pro, showed less camera awareness, glaring at his opponent and directing answers downstage (presumably toward the moderator, Lester Holt, who was little seen on camera). By the end of the debate his declaration, \u201cI also have a much better temperament than she has\u201d drew spontaneous laughter.Some of the audience laughter and applause seemed more tactical than spontaneous, though the crowd had been warned to keep quiet. But it was nothing like the arena roar of the primary debates, which Mr. Trump in particular had thrived on.By the anarchic standards of the earlier debates, Mr. Holt kept reasonable control over the proceedings. He let exchanges run at length but was willing to step in; his questions were few but well-chosen.The major focus, indeed obsession, of the run-up to the debate was whether Mr. Holt would be willing to fact-check lies and inaccuracies. He did, though sparingly, for instance knocking down Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that he had opposed the Iraq war before it began.But fact-checking loomed over the debate even when Mr. Holt wasn\u2019t doing it. Media outlets and individual viewers were policing statements in real time online, and Bloomberg TV network did so live onscreen.Both candidates seemed aware of the magnifying glass. \u201cPlease, fact-checkers, get to work,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, after Mr. Trump told her, \u201cYou\u2019ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\u201d (Mrs. Clinton is 68. It was rather an overstatement.)Mr. Trump was also semi-restrained and semi-disciplined, coming off semi-prepared and closing on a note of semi-propriety. After Mrs. Clinton blasted him for his treatment of a beauty pageant contestant, he insinuated a dark personal attack while taking credit for not directly making it.\u201cI was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family,\u201d he said, \u201cand I said to myself, \u2018I can\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201dIt all depends on which Donald Trump shows up, or how many of him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kremlin Says It Wants a Spotless Election, but Locally It Is Marred", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOGLIATTI, Russia \u2014 The retiree out walking her Scottie in the rain last week in Togliatti, home of the infamous Lada automobile, was delighted to encounter an opposition candidate distributing pamphlets that called on President Vladimir V. Putin to step down.\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she fairly shrieked, grabbing a handful of the leaflets from Vitaly V. Yerkaev, 41, a beefy former homicide detective running for Parliament in the People\u2019s Freedom Party, or Parnas. \u201cI was not sure that Parnas was even part of the election here.\u201dThat Parnas would be just about invisible is not surprising.Throughout the campaign, most printing houses rejected Mr. Yerkaev\u2019s leaflets, and newspapers rejected his ads. The local government banned his posters and blocked him from television appearances mandated by law. \u201cAll we can do is put on our party T-shirts and hand out leaflets, that is it,\u201d he said.\u201cWe should have at least one alternative democratic party, but they don\u2019t allow anything,\u201d said the retiree, who asked that she be identified only as Larisa for fear of a visit from agents with Russian state security, the F.S.B.Russians go to the polls on Sunday to vote for a new 450-seat Parliament, or Duma, which Mr. Putin long ago reduced to a cheerleading squad that endorses his every move.The Kremlin has repeatedly promised that the voting will be free and transparent, yet the campaign here in Togliatti, long a bastion of opposition to the dominant United Russia Party, illustrates the gap between the promise of fair elections and the reality.Without doubt, Kremlin administrators want the voting to be seen as fair and free nationwide. They want to exorcise the ghosts of the last Duma vote, in 2011, and the 2012 presidential election, when widespread perceptions of fraud galvanized mass street protests by the middle class.More important, any suggestion that the election was stolen would pollute their paramount concern: the 2018 presidential election.Now 63, and seeking his fourth and quite possibly last presidential term, Mr. Putin wants to capitalize on his soaring popularity to win a resounding, legitimate victory that will cement his legacy.The Kremlin even appointed a respected human-rights advocate, Ella A. Pamfilova, to head the Central Electoral Commission. She warned local officials that suspect results would be nullified, a position endorsed by Vyacheslav V. Volodin, a senior Putin political adviser who is likely to be the next Duma chairman.\u201cI tell them that 99 percent is no longer in vogue,\u201d Ms. Pamfilova said at a news conference, referring to her discussions with local governors over the vote.Apparently not everyone got the memo.Opposition candidates and political analysts in the Samara region, which includes Togliatti and which Ms. Pamfilova referred to as \u201cthe most difficult spot,\u201d said the governor, Nikolai I. Merkushkin, was among the throwbacks.In speeches and an election pamphlet prepared by his team, he cast the blame for Russia\u2019s economic woes not on economic mismanagement or Western sanctions after the annexation of Crimea but on a plot by President Obama and the C.I.A. to undermine Russia.Opposition candidates are a fifth column on the payroll of the State Department and part of the scheme, the pamphlet said, along with the collapse in oil prices and the emergence of the Islamic State.Mr. Putin is on the case, not least by rebuilding the military, the pamphlet said, noting that \u201cour country forces others to take it seriously and this is something that American politicians don\u2019t like very much.\u201dMr. Merkushkin exploits fears in other ways, too, warning people in Togliatti not to come crying to him for help after the election if they vote against United Russia. \u201cYou yourselves will have made it so that we aren\u2019t doing anything for the people,\u201d he said.Division heads in Togliatti\u2019s Avtovaz automobile factory have told workers the same thing, said Pyotr A. Zolotaryov, a Duma candidate and the head of a shriveling independent union. \u201cThey said: \u2018If you vote for United Russia, the factory will continue working. If you don\u2019t, it will get shut down,\u2019\u201d he said.For the most part, the tactic works, analysts said, because people in Togliatti do not connect Mr. Putin and his policies to their problems.\u201cSuch a simple explanation that Obama is to blame works well given the problems people face that they don\u2019t understand,\u201d Mr. Zolotaryov said.In the post-Soviet era, demand for the boxy rattletraps plunged ruinously in the face of foreign competition. With car sales stagnating during the current recession, production here sank to 352,000 cars last year from 575,000 in 2014. Not many years ago, more than one in seven people in this town of about 700,000 worked building cars. The plant now employs 43,000 on reduced shifts, driving the lowest wages down to as little as $150 a month.Togliatti\u2019s fate rides on the car plant, so Duma candidates vow to rejuvenate it even though Renault-Nissan now runs it.The Communists won 29 percent of the vote here in 2011, against 26 percent for the Kremlin\u2019s United Russia. The Communist Party forms part of the loyal opposition that rarely challenges Mr. Putin, yet nostalgia for Soviet times casts it as an alternative. The party is expected to make gains across Russia this year given the sullen mood over the economy.New voting rules might also give a lift to other parties or independent candidates who concentrate on local pocketbook issues. Half the seats will be decided by individual races this time, and the other half by the old practice of national party lists.But not in Togliatti, if Mr. Merkushkin can help it.The governor organized election rallies in every voting district for the United Russia candidate, Vladimir V. Bokk, and forced all government employees to attend, opponents said. During the 50th anniversary celebrations at the Avtovaz plant, Mr. Bokk was onstage among those honored as \u201cexemplary industrialists.\u201dOpponents, according to the Communist candidate, Leonid Kalashnikov (no relation to the inventor of the rifle), \u201care being strangled.\u201d He initially put up some 16 billboards, he said, that included the sentence: \u201cThe governor should respond to the mess in this city.\u201d They were torn down overnight.The spokesman for the governor, Ilya Chernyshyov, dismissed the allegations of widespread election violations, accusing the opposition parties of filing complaints daily as a campaign tactic. \u201cTheir goal is to show that the rules are violated here, but it is not true,\u201d he said.Yet the small opposition parties like Parnas fared even worse.Sergey V. Simak, 49, a wiry environmentalist and university administrator, decided to run on the opposition Yabloko ticket out of anger over the Kremlin effort to dismantle all grass-roots organizations.He is no longer allowed to hold news conferences or organize demonstrations in the constant battle to protect green spaces, he said. On local policy, he added, \u201canyone who disagrees, or even does not applaud, is labeled an enemy and a fifth column.\u201dThe party gave him roughly $300 for his campaign, enough for two booths but not enough to print posters, he said.The race in Togliatti, one of about 25 across Russia that analysts call truly competitive, remains unpredictable. The Communists certainly enjoy support, but so does Mr. Putin, especially when it comes to Russia\u2019s overall image.\u201cPeople like what happened in foreign policy in recent years,\u201d said Aleksandr Gremin, a local political journalist. \u201cPeople like it that we can bomb Syria. People like that the candidates in the U.S. elections say that Putin can influence the vote there. We feel that we are a superpower again that reaches beyond its immediate borders.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Amazonia, Africa, and Tibet have invaded all our bookstalls.\u201dMark Twain pioneered this aggressive self-\u00addefense in the 1860s, the early years of democratized and commodified guidebook travel. By the time L\u00e9vi-\u00adStrauss took up the cudgel, photography was beginning to catch up with tourism, and since then travel writing and travel photography have come to seem, to the skeptical, like two sides of the same counterfeit token. L\u00e9vi-\u00adStrauss continued: \u201cTravel-\u00adbooks, expeditionary records, and photograph-\u00adalbums abound. ... Mere mileage is the thing; and anyone who has been far enough, and collected the right number of pictures (still or moving, but for preference in colour), will be able to lecture to packed houses for several days running.\u201dPhoto essays from around the world by Andrea Frazzetta, Joachim Ladefoged, David Maurice Smith, Kirsten Luce, Sebasti\u00e1n Liste and Raymond Meeks.The travel writer, at least, had to sit down and actually bash it all out, which gave him or her some measure of self-\u00adrespect. The travel photographer had it worse. The right to call itself art rather than mere mechanism had been photography\u2019s struggle since the medium was invented, but now practitioners had to differentiate their efforts from the unstudied shutter-\u00adclicks of rank amateurs. The problem grew even more dire as travel photography transitioned from a hobby to perhaps the ultimate signifier of the inauthentic and the conformist. In his 1954 essay \u201cThe Loss of the Creature,\u201d Walker Percy imagines a sightseer upon his first approach to the Grand Canyon: \u201cInstead of looking at it, he photographs it. There is no confrontation at all. At the end of forty years of preformulation and with the Grand Canyon yawning at his feet, what does he do? He waives his right of seeing and knowing and records symbols for the next forty years.\u201d In this case, the travel photographer has committed the original sin: His job is to create the ideal image against which the multitudes will inevitably find their own experiences wanting. The travel photographer is thereby caught in a bind. Either he is no better than the desultory tourist, or he is responsible for the fact that our experiences rarely resemble the advertisements or postcards.By now, Percy\u2019s contempt for this clich\u00e9 \u2014 the traveler so busy with documentation that he misses out on some phantom called the \u201cexperience itself\u201d \u2014 has itself become a clich\u00e9. But we are not much closer to resolving the fundamental paradox of travel, which is just one version of the fundamental paradox of late-\u00adcapitalist life. On the one hand, we have been encouraged to believe that we are no longer the sum of our products (as we were when we were still an industrial economy) but the sum of our experiences. On the other, we lack the ritual structures that once served to organize, integrate and preserve the stream of these experiences, so they inevitably feel both scattershot and evanescent. We worry that photographs or journal entries keep us at a remove from life, but we also worry that without an inventory of these documents \u2014 a collection of snow globes for the mantel \u2014 we\u2019ll disintegrate. Furthermore, that inventory has to fulfill two slightly different functions: It must define us as at once part of a tribe (\u201cpeople who go to Paris\u201d) and independent of it (\u201cpeople who go to Paris and don\u2019t photograph the Eiffel Tower\u201d).Now that social media has given us a public forum, both theatrical stage and deposit institution, for this inventory, we have brought to this paradox increasingly elaborate methods of documentary performance. But the underlying strategies are nothing new. The most elementary strategy is the avoidance of the Grand Canyon/Eiffel Tower conundrum entirely, but this works only if you\u2019re confident that you\u2019ve identified a satisfying alternative. (As Paul Fussell put it in his 1979 book \u201cAbroad,\u201d \u201cAvoiding Waikiki brings up the whole question of why one\u2019s gone to Hawaii at all, but that\u2019s exactly the problem.\u201d) Another is to forefront our own inauthenticity as a disclaimer. In his 1987 book \u201cThe Songlines,\u201d Bruce Chatwin described his lifelong attempt to write a book about nomads as a repudiation of his earlier involvement with art: \u201cI quit my job in the \u2018art world\u2019 and went back to the dry places: alone, travelling light. The names of the tribes I travelled among are unimportant: Rguibat, Quashgai, Taimanni, Turkomen, Bororo, Tuareg \u2014 people whose journeys, unlike my own, had neither beginning nor end.\u201d People, that is, who had a motive for travel that went well beyond the vanity of documentation.My favorite social-\u00admedia vacation of the summer, however, belonged to my friend David, who intermittently recorded a long cross-\u00adcountry road trip. It was a solo undertaking, and the loneliness of much of the imagery made me feel as though it deserved special attention.A week before David left, in mid-\u00adAugust, he posted a brief prelude in the form of a diptych: an uneventful video of a street scene taken from his stoop in Brooklyn followed by a black-and-white shot, taken between Chelsea and Hell\u2019s Kitchen, of a horseless buggy covered with a clear tarp; one of the new skyscrapers of the Hudson Yards development rises in the background. The two images in succession \u2014 the sentimentality of home, the gently self-\u00admocking irony of the black-and-white wagon \u2014 felt like a personal send-off in a minor key, an understated announcement that he was on his way.Over the course of the next week, there were some images I found inscrutable (audio CDs, stamped in red as RESTRICTED, of Bruce Dern doing a \u201cHenry V\u201d monologue at the Actors Studio), some readily intelligible as artifactual Americana (Smith & Wessons in the case of a Badlands pawnshop) and others that attempted sidelong glances at tourist landmarks (not Mount Rushmore itself but a shot of a family selfie in front of it; a photo of the Rocket Motel\u2019s neon next to its own identical postcard). There were a few pretty sunsets \u2014 one in Minnesota, one in Wyoming \u2014 that spoke of a late-day solitary melancholy.The best image of his trip was of a nighttime gas station. \u201cWhat is it,\u201d his caption asked, \u201cabout #gasstationsatdusk?\u201d The picture got a lot of likes \u2014 more than his others tended to \u2014 and occasioned a number of passing remarks in the comments, especially from other artists and art critics. One contributor said something about Ed Ruscha and Matthew Barney. But the unmistakable reference, one art historian pointed out in the comments, was to Edward Hopper. Hopper was a painter, of course, but as Geoff Dyer points out in his book \u201cThe Ongoing Moment,\u201d Hopper \u201ccould, with some justification, claim to be the most influential American photographer of the twentieth century \u2014 even though he didn\u2019t take any photographs.\u201d Dyer wrote that in 2005, long before Instagram existed, but the platform\u2019s retro filters only deepen the likeness.Hopper might remind Dyer of a photographer like Walker Evans, but the first thing a gas station at dusk recalls, for many travelers and travel writers who feel the need to justify their restlessness, is Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s \u201cQuestions of Travel\u201d and its \u201cgrease-\u00adstained filling-\u00adstation floor.\u201d Earlier in the poem, Bishop writes, \u201cThink of the long trip home./Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?\u201d The answer is familiar. We were right to go, but not because we got anywhere or achieved anything. It\u2019s because of the small moments of incidental grace, the insipid bits L\u00e9vi-\u00adStrauss disparaged (and subsequently indulged): \u201cBut surely it would have been a pity/not to have seen the trees along this road.\u201dIt\u2019s hard not to suspect that we\u2019ve seen Bishop\u2019s gas station before; it\u2019s the same Hopper we recognize from David\u2019s Instagram feed. At this point, given the layers of quotation and allusion, it seems silly to treat David\u2019s image as if it were, as Percy might have had it, some flimsy representation standing between himself and an unmediated world, or a private snow-globe reminder of that stretch of Interstate. It wasn\u2019t an act of representation at all, and it certainly wasn\u2019t private. It was the expression of affect he wanted to communicate in that moment \u2014 something a little smart, and a little sad, and a little funny, and all in all very David. The image, an internet square of labyrinthine self-\u00adreferentiality \u2014 a photograph that recalled a painting that was at home in a poem \u2014 recalled for me a different line of Geoff Dyer\u2019s, where he quotes John Berger on Paul Strand\u2019s portraits: They arrested a moment \u201cwhose duration is measured not by seconds, but by its relation to a lifetime.\u201dThe tourist caricature is in a funny position. The \u201cpoint\u201d of his or her vacation is not something discrete, like L\u00e9vi-\u00adStrauss\u2019s registration of a new marriage rule, but simply the accumulation of rarefied experience for its own sake, which means that every single moment must be optimally memorable \u2014 that is, photographable. Unlike the tourist, the traveler accepts that the point isn\u2019t the intensity of the peak experiences but the way the journey itself sacralizes any given moment as a metonym for the whole. Feel free to photograph the gas station.There\u2019s a parallel in photography. The first time I looked at David\u2019s gas station, I was at SFMoMA, where I\u2019d just seen galleries of large-\u00adformat photographers, including Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth. They document all the shipping containers in a southern Italian port, the controlled chaos of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Their painterly intensity and formal composition derive from Henri Cartier-\u00adBresson\u2019s definition of photography as \u201cthe decisive moment,\u201d the juncture of maximal effect and maximal information. In \u201cDiana and Nikon,\u201d her 1980 book on photography, Janet Malcolm expanded on the idea, remarking that \u201cthe arresting of time is photography\u2019s unique capacity, and the decision of when to click the shutter is the photographer\u2019s chief responsibility.\u201d She contrasts the pictorialism of such photographers as Cartier-\u00adBresson, Steichen and Atget with the apparent vulgarity of subsequent generations of street photographers.For Dyer, the road trip plays a crucial role in this midcentury photographic turn to the vernacular. It was Robert Frank, Dyer writes, who gave us the \u201congoing\u201d moment instead of the \u201cdecisive\u201d one. He invented America as \u201ca place to be seen from a car, a country that could be seen without stopping. If we do choose to linger it is often to try to work out why Frank took a particular picture (what\u2019s so special about this?).\u201d Garry Winogrand \u201cpushed things a stage further, combining Frank\u2019s ad hoc aesthetic with a pictorial appetite so voracious it bordered on the indiscriminate.\u201d The point of a photograph of a trail, or some billboard half-seen out the window of a bus, is that it could easily be exchanged for the image taken immediately before or immediately afterward. The random sample communicates in one unpremeditated frame all the significance that particular person\u2019s drive down that particular road could possibly contain.Revisiting my photographs from those same trips is dislocating in a different way. The difference may, of course, be a question of my own orientation: I\u2019m habituated to the way a given experience is encoded in language. Writers love to repeat the truism that they need to see what they write to know what they think; seeing what you shot betrays the extent to which what you think is produced, and thereby constrained, by its method of thought. Always I find my photographs replete with remainders, pedestrian details that contradict and undermine the equally pedestrian account I committed to words. The colors are different. Drops of scarlet blood on a hard tarmac black as obsidian. An overturned brass samovar in a dingy brown train compartment. A bright alarum of pink cherry blossoms against a glass-flat cobalt sea. There is something about those moments, fugitively apprehended as they might have been, that seem to me now odd and decisive. They don\u2019t at all seem like random samples of the ongoing. I never think, What was so special about this? I think instead, Yes, I remember now exactly what was so special about this. They mutely twitch with escaped significance. When we see what we saw, we are reminded of what was apprehended \u2014 and let go.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s a Businessman. Where\u2019s His Business Backing?", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookShould it come as a surprise that not one chief executive among the Fortune 100 has donated money to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign?Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters trumpeted, excuse the pun, the lack of donations from the nation\u2019s largest companies as a badge of honor. Big business, they say, has failed the country, so why would their guy want its support?But the logic of this argument is backward. Mr. Trump has campaigned as a successful businessman, a brilliant negotiator and someone, as he said in his own words, who can \u201cget along with people.\u201d He has contended that his economic policies will unleash unheard-of levels of growth \u2014 as much as 6 percent. He plans to lower corporate taxes, remove regulations and allow companies to repatriate cash held overseas. Together, these policies sound like a C.E.O.\u2019s dream.And yet here we are: Many of the most successful business people in the country refuse to support him \u2014 or do business with him, either.This is not an opinion. In case there is any doubt, here is a list of companies that in the last two years have publicly severed or reduced business relationships with Mr. Trump, mostly over his inflammatory rhetoric: Macy\u2019s, Univision, Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal, Serta, Disney\u2019s ESPN, the PGA Tour, Nascar and Perfumania.Those companies, which have customer bases that include broad swaths of the nation that ostensibly look like the electorate, all said some variation of what Macy\u2019s said: \u201cIn light of statements made by Donald Trump, which are inconsistent with Macy\u2019s values, we have decided to discontinue our business relationship with Mr. Trump.\u201dStill, based on Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, you would think that companies like Apple or Nike, which have railed for lower taxes and are pining to bring tens of billions dollars stashed abroad back to the United States, would be kneeling at the altar of Mr. Trump. (Apple\u2019s and Nike\u2019s chief executives have contributed to Mrs. Clinton.)Granted, there are his views on immigration and trade, which aren\u2019t in sync with United States multinational companies that manufacture products abroad. But then again, Mrs. Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership too, so that doesn\u2019t provide much of a choice.Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric\u2019s chief executive, who employed Mr. Trump on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d when G.E. owned NBC, was asked by Vanity Fair about him over the summer. \u201cThe Donald Trump that I had a chance to work with, I found to be fun to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe words? I can\u2019t reconcile with anything I believe in, or that I think the country stands for or that the company stands for.\u201dBy the way, this was Mr. Trump\u2019s reply last year to businesses that stopped doing business with him: \u201cMacy\u2019s, NBC, Serta and Nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country.\u201d (I should note here that I co-anchor \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on CNBC, which is a unit of NBCUniversal.)In fairness, it is worth pointing out that only 11 C.E.O.s of the Fortune 100 donated to Hillary Clinton, according to The Journal. Mr. Trump does have support from some businessmen like Jack Welch, Carl C. Icahn and Wilbur Ross, among others.But for a group that has historically leaned Republican, the absence of contributions is eye-opening, particularly since at least 19 of them gave to the other Republican candidates in the primaries.There is a good reason, wholly unrelated to political correctness, that the business community has not rallied around Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans. On its merits, that plan is expected to hurt the economy, according to nonpartisan economists. It is hard to find many serious economists, except a handful mostly advising his campaign, who say otherwise.According to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonpartisan think tank that includes a list of luminaries from both sides of the aisle, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plan would add $5.3 trillion to our national debt. That compares with $200 billion as a result of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan.\u201cBoth Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law\u2014 though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more, and Clinton\u2019s plan would slightly reduce deficits if we incorporated unspecified revenue from business tax reform,\u201d the committee wrote.None of this column is meant to suggest that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s economic plan will usher in a new age of stupendous growth. It won\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t fully address the need for corporate tax reform, and it won\u2019t bring many companies out from under the regulatory morass that they suffer. It won\u2019t bring trillions of dollars back from abroad. Her plan is unlikely to pump up the economy much compared with the path that we are currently on. It is very possible some of her policy measures could even slow the economy.And finally \u2014 again \u2014 there is the issue of trade. A centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda is renegotiating many of the country\u2019s trade agreements. In a new report published by his campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers suggest he would threaten, for example, to leave the World Trade Organization to get a better deal. \u201cWithout the U.S. as a member, there would not be much purpose to the W.T.O.,\u201d the advisers wrote.There is no question that the country would be improved by better trade pacts, but Mr. Trump\u2019s risky approach could start a trade war that could be disastrous for the country\u2019s largest companies. And the uncertainty of the negotiations themselves could slow the economy and rattle our foreign neighbors; just look at the resignation of Mexico\u2019s minister of finance for helping bring Mr. Trump there to meet-and-greet with the Mexican president. Other countries will want to avoid similar situations in which they could look like they are caving in to Mr. Trump. (By the way, for those who say, \u201cWho cares about what happens to big businesses that outsource anyway?\u201d think about all the money in all those 401(k) plans that is invested in them.)The Trump economic report cites the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing big business, and its complaints about regulatory burdens. The suggestion is that big business will back Mr. Trump, since he plans to reduce regulation. Yet it is hardly clear the Business Roundtable supports him. The organization has not endorsed either candidate, and its chief executive, John Engler, told The New York Times over the summer: \u201cWe\u2019re just on the opposite side of Trump on trade and immigration.\u201dMr. Trump, the self-described great negotiator, may brush aside the views of the country\u2019s leading business executives \u2014 but perhaps that is because he hasn\u2019t been able to strike a deal with them.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about a relative lack of support for Donald J. Trump from other businessmen, misstated, in some copies, the period of time for which The Wall Street Journal tabulated donation disclosures. It was through August, not through Aug. 11.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about a relative lack of support for Donald J. Trump from other businessmen, misidentified one of the organizations that has curbed ties with Mr. Trump in the last two years. It is the PGA Tour, not the PGA of America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cinema Is Dead? Telluride Says Not Yet", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookTELLURIDE, Colo. \u2014 Can we please kill the talk about the death of movies?Telluride began in the mid-70s largely as a place to show old, rare and restored films, a commitment that survives in a robust program of classics and curiosities presented by prominent guest directors. And it seduces audiences with the promise that the future of film \u2014 the art if not the photochemical medium \u2014 will be as glorious as the past. Maybe this is mythmaking or wishful thinking, but having spent a few days here in the dark I prefer to regard it as hardheaded realism. Whatever the state of the industry or the prevailing winds in the culture and the digital economy, the integrity and specificity of cinema is a fact. And its vital signs are strong.Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d is both an example of and an argument for the uniqueness of movies. A lavish and lovely musical romance, it is set in a Los Angeles populated by good-looking creative strivers. Two of these, a jazz pianist named Seb (Ryan Gosling) and a thesp (as the trades would say) named Mia (Emma Stone), meet cute in a gigantic traffic jam that doubles as a song-and-dance extravaganza. The next two hours follow the entwined, contrapuntal progress of their relationship and their careers, punctuated by more songs and ending in a swirl of piercing and complex emotion.It will, in any case, reward literal moviegoers, those hardy souls willing to switch off the flat screen, silence the cellphone and sit quietly in a roomful of strangers. Cinema is an art form, but it is also a destination, a reason to get out of the house. From the viewer\u2019s perspective, a movie is a nondomestic, nonserial experience, enclosed in time and space and, ideally, lingering in the mind after the lights go on and you stumble out into the world. Your perception is at least momentarily altered.A film festival is a collection of such experiences, an archipelago of self-enclosed worlds. You could drift from \u201cLa La Land\u201d to Denis Villeneuve\u2019s \u201cArrival,\u201d an eerie and emotional alien-visitation movie that similarly evokes and updates the grandeur and mystery of past science-fiction masterpieces. It shares some DNA with \u201c2001\u201d and \u201cSolaris,\u201d and stars Amy Adams as a linguist wrestling with grief and an imposing research assignment. Twelve madeleine-shaped black spaceships are hovering over Earth, and she must use her professional skills to figure out what their seven-legged inhabitants want.\u201cArrival\u201d is an elegant puzzle, an engrossing exercise in problem-solving \u2014 for the protagonist, the filmmaker and the viewer alike. Mr. Villeneuve, assisted by Bradford Young\u2019s haunting cinematography and Johann Johannsson\u2019s menacing, melancholy score, creates a heady, sensual atmosphere in which the boundaries between thinking and feeling are artfully blurred. Which may just be another way of repeating that it\u2019s a movie, rather than a franchise installment or a piece of platform-agnostic digital entertainment.Maybe that sounds overly defensive. It\u2019s hard, watching four or five films a day amid crowds of fellow pilgrims, to believe that you\u2019re participating in something marginal, obsolescent or beleaguered. There are too many revelations, large and small. There is the exquisite lyricism and deep feeling of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d Barry Jenkins\u2019s astonishing second feature, about a young black man\u2019s coming of age in three piercing chapters. The film cracks open stereotypes and wears its empathy and its artistry on its sleeve.There is the prickly wit and delicious complication of \u201cNorman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer,\u201d Joseph Cedar\u2019s ebullient Israeli-American comedy, with Richard Gere in the title role. There is the philosophical mischief of \u201cInto the Inferno,\u201d the latest documentary adventure from Werner Herzog, which follows him to the edges of volcanoes in search of cosmic meaning and human peculiarity.And then there are treasures in transit from Sundance, Berlin and Cannes, arriving on vapor trails of enthusiasm. Among these are Cristian Mungiu\u2019s \u201cGraduation,\u201d Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d Mia Hansen-Love\u2019s \u201cThings to Come\u201d and, above all, Maren Ade\u2019s \u201cToni Erdmann.\u201d Each one in its own way constitutes proof of life for movies. All of them, curiously, dwell at least partly on the complexities of parenthood.\u201cManchester\u201d is a lacerating, but also frequently funny, study of the long aftermath of grief, with Casey Affleck as a man damaged by past trauma trying to help his nephew (Lucas Hedges). \u201cGraduation\u201d is about a Romanian doctor\u2019s ethical struggles as he tries to help his daughter find a better future by studying abroad. \u201cThings to Come\u201d is a quiet midlife drama in which a philosophy professor (Isabelle Huppert) navigates disruptions in her family and her inner life.\u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d though. If a single movie were enough to silence reports of the death of cinema, it would be this one, an almost-three-hour German comedy set mostly in Bucharest. It you think that sounds preposterous, you\u2019re not wrong. I hesitate to offer further description, since any attempt to characterize this film in conventional terms \u2014 as a father-daughter story, a feminist satire of corporate behavior, a fable of global capitalism, an extended practical joke \u2014 would be woefully insufficient. It\u2019s something new under the sun, a thrilling and discomfiting document of the present moment and also, like every movie that matters, a bulletin from the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sidelined at the U.N., a Frustrated Taiwan Presses On", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnited Nations Memo\u201cThe United Nations talks about justice and human rights, yet they pretend we don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Ms. Ou, who, as the director of Taiwan\u2019s United Nations Task Force, is charged with a campaign to gain greater recognition for her people. \u201cIt\u2019s humiliating, ridiculous and childish.\u201dMr. Chiang\u2019s forces fled to what was once known as Formosa, a lush, mountainous island across the Taiwan Straits, and set up a rival government.Over the years, Beijing has wielded its growing economic and political muscle to chip away at Taiwan\u2019s international stature, picking off its diplomatic allies through generous aid packages, and retaliatory gestures, that have reduced to 22 the number of nations, including the Vatican, that still maintain official relations with Taiwan.But after four decades as something of a diplomatic nonentity, Taiwan is pushing back with renewed vigor. This month, a group of Taiwanese activists swept through the United States, holding protests that sought to highlight China\u2019s efforts to sideline Taiwan.The group is also lobbying members of Congress to press for the easing of State Department restrictions that bar Taiwan\u2019s top leaders, including the president, vice president and minister of foreign affairs, from setting foot in Washington.\u201cI find it frustrating that the international community has not been able to find creative ways to incorporate Taiwan onto the world stage,\u201d said Mr. Wang, noting past compromises that allowed both North and South Korea to participate in the United Nations, and the 2012 vote that gave Palestinians a nonvoting seat at the table. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s dignity and survival deserve more international support.\u201dOn most nights, the lobby of their building in Midtown is a beehive of public events that showcase Taiwanese films, the island\u2019s high-tech prowess and Taiwan\u2019s growing role as a beacon of tolerance in Asia for gays and ethnic minorities.But Beijing\u2019s good will appears to have dried up. Taiwan has yet to receive an invitation to the aviation group\u2019s forum in Montreal on Tuesday, and the Chinese government has signaled its displeasure with President Tsai in recent months by reducing the number of mainland tour groups allowed to visit Taiwan, worrying the island\u2019s tourist industry.\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking for us,\u201d said Ms. Ou, 42, the Taiwanese diplomat, who is in her second stint as chief of Taiwan\u2019s quest for greater international recognition. Before the General Assembly, Ms. Ou helped coordinate efforts to encourage heads of state to mention Taiwan\u2019s aspirations during their public speeches. Last year, she said, the tally came to 16.Throughout the week, she and her colleagues have been glued to their computer screens, anxiously watching the online speeches for words of encouragement.By Wednesday evening, the reviews were mixed. The presidents of Panama and the Dominican Republic, two of Taiwan\u2019s longtime allies, had failed to mention its plight, but the president of Nauru, the tiny Micronesian island nation, delivered a semantic home run, with three paragraphs condemning Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the international community.The remarks, which described Taiwan as \u201cNauru\u2019s close friend,\u201d left Ms. Ou feeling elated, prompting her to recite a traditional Chinese expression that extols perseverance in the face of a more powerful foe.\u201cWhen you are small and fighting a much bigger adversary,\u201d she said, \u201cyou had better use your wisdom.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to China\u2019s regulation of tourism in Taiwan. China reduced the number of mainland tour groups allowed to visit Taiwan, not the number of Taiwan tour groups allowed to visit the mainland.The United Nations Memo article on Sept. 26, about Taiwan\u2019s renewed quest for its own seat in the United Nations General Assembly, referred imprecisely to the state known as the Republic of China. It retreated to Taiwan after the Communists took over the mainland in 1949; it was not \u201cset up\u201d then.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roger Goodell\u2019s Power Play", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 After a recent preseason game here, the walking wounded roamed the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 locker room. They had not been injured on the field, but were among the many players bruised by the disciplinary practices of the N.F.L. and Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the most powerful sports league in America.Then there was guard Ramon Foster. He may incur Goodell\u2019s ire in a different way, as the team\u2019s union representative and one of several players across the league who are now preparing their brethren for a yearslong fight to rein in Goodell\u2019s power.Goodell\u2019s application of disciplinary policy, and his unwillingness to appoint an independent arbitrator to hear appeals, has corroded the fragile trust between him and the players, who see him as judge and jury, Foster and other union representatives said.To push their point, they have already told players to start setting aside money in case the players ultimately end up on a picket line without a paycheck.\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a guy like Roger Goodell, he can do whatever he wants because no one is in charge of him, especially with discipline,\u201d Foster said. \u201cFor us to actually battle this out, we need to save money. We have a chance to fight for this.\u201dFoster\u2019s call to action is unusual because the N.F.L.\u2019s current labor deal does not expire until 2021. But players said they were so alarmed by a string of suspensions they considered unreasonable, and the legal victories the league had won to uphold those decisions, that they needed to muster for action now.Their focus is the N.F.L.\u2019s personal conduct policy, which Goodell has used to penalize players for transgressions as varied as aggressive hits on quarterbacks, bullying teammates, domestic abuse and scheming to deflate footballs.Goodell, with an approach far more aggressive than that of his predecessor, Paul Tagliabue, has gotten as much attention in his first decade as commissioner for these punishments as for turning the league, which oversees America\u2019s most popular sport, into a $13 billion behemoth.Few players would dispute that someone who commits domestic violence should be penalized. But Goodell\u2019s suspension of players for more ambiguous infractions like deflating footballs or taunting teammates has led many fans, and some players, to complain that he is meddlesome and affecting the quality of play by sidelining some of the game\u2019s top stars.Players also want a neutral arbitrator, not Goodell, to hear their appeals.\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to just be that you say this is what it is and we don\u2019t get a chance to negotiate anything,\u201d said Mark Herzlich, a linebacker for the Giants and a member of the union\u2019s executive committee. \u201cWhat we want is fairness.\u201dThe season begins in Denver on Thursday night, with a rematch of last season\u2019s Super Bowl between the Broncos and the Carolina Panthers. But on Sunday, when most games will be played, Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback and one of the league\u2019s best players, will be conspicuously absent.Goodell has his defenders, including team owners, but even they express dismay that his disciplinary decisions have become a lightning rod and sometimes distracted from the game.\u201cI think it\u2019s largely due to the social-media age and the fact that he had some high-profile cases and admittedly made some mistakes,\u201d John Mara, an owner of the Giants, said of the attention Goodell receives. \u201cAnd he\u2019s become an easy target because of the money he makes. It\u2019s almost gotten to the point where no matter what he does, he faces an avalanche of a criticism.\u201dStill, Mara and many other owners said that they supported Goodell\u2019s approach and, contrary to what some of the commissioner\u2019s critics have said, insisted that he had not acted impulsively, but rather in the best interests of the league.\u201cOnce he makes up his mind, he certainly has a strong opinion on things,\u201d said Art Rooney II, an owner of the Steelers. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s someone who isn\u2019t seeking input.\u201dGoodell and his deputies are unapologetic.\u201cThe whole reason you have a commissioner in any sport, the most fundamental reason for that office, is to protect the integrity of the game,\u201d said Jeff Pash, the N.F.L.\u2019s top lawyer. The job of the commissioner, he added, is to make sure that fans \u201care rooting and supporting financially and emotionally for a game that is clean, that is honest, cares about fans and cares about the people who play the game.\u201dLabor-management tension has long been a feature of the N.F.L., though.In the 1970s and 1980s, players walked off the job several times to win concessions like free agency. By the 1990s, Tagliabue and the union chief at the time, Gene Upshaw, found common ground more often than not. In 2006, the players won what was widely perceived as the upper hand when the two sides renewed their collective bargaining agreement.Five years later, with the economy teetering, the owners clawed back those gains and then some, but only after a protracted fight with DeMaurice Smith, Upshaw\u2019s replacement.\u201cMy observation was when DeMaurice took over, it became combative,\u201d said Amy Trask, who was the chief executive of the Oakland Raiders until 2013. \u201cWith the union, everything was an argument. We could go into a meeting and say, Wow, my pencil broke, can someone give a pencil? and there would be an argument about No. 2 pencils.\u201dAfter the owners locked them out for more than four months, the players agreed to accept just 47 percent of the league\u2019s revenue, down from 50 percent. Amid the fight over money, the players focused less on the personal conduct policy, which has now become such a point of contention.In a league that practically prints money, threatening to walk off the job would seem self-defeating. Most careers in the N.F.L. are brutally short \u2014 the average length is less than four years \u2014 so players might be excused for opting to collect paychecks over trying to clip a commissioner\u2019s wings.The larger question, then, is whether the current fixation on Goodell\u2019s power will continue and how far the players are willing to go to try to check his authority.Pash said that the league was willing to negotiate with the union to amend the personal conduct policy, but that the union would have to understand the owners\u2019 position and stop trying to overturn the commissioner\u2019s rulings by going to court.For their part, many players have said they recognize that they, like employees at any company, must be accountable for their actions on and off the job. They insist that they have only gone to court because the commissioner overstepped his authority in applying the personal conduct policy. They also reject the notion that they must give the owners something \u2014 like agreeing to play an 18-game season \u2014 in return for overhauling the policy.\u201cThey\u2019ve created this Dumpster fire; they have to put it out,\u201d said Eric Winston, an offensive lineman with the Cincinnati Bengals and the president of the N.F.L. Players Association. \u201cThey can\u2019t come to the union and say, \u2018We\u2019ve abused this policy for 30 years; you need to give us something so that we can change it.\u2019\u201dBill Pennington contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dell Gets Bigger and Hewlett Packard Gets Smaller in Separate Deals", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Michael Dell and Meg Whitman may be business competitors, but they can each claim a technology industry superlative. One has overseen one of the largest mergers in the tech industry. The other has engineered its biggest breakup.Different as they seem, both deals were in reaction to tough competition and declining markets. And so far, neither has provided a clear way for how a storied giant can survive changes like the rise of so-called cloud computing that are undermining the way they operate.On Wednesday, Mr. Dell, who 32 years ago started a personal computer business from his college dorm room, officially completed his giant $67 billion merger with EMC, a data storage company with interests in software and security. He also changed the name of his operation to Dell Technologies.Later in the day, Ms. Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, announced a sale of most of her company\u2019s software assets to a British outfit called Micro Focus for about $8.8 billion. H.P.E. also announced higher earnings in the company\u2019s most recent quarter, but a decline in revenue from the same period a year ago.Shares of H.P.E. moved down about 2 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday evening.H.P.E. itself is a $36 billion computing giant created last year from half of Hewlett-Packard, a record separation that ended one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most iconic companies and neatly mirrored Mr. Dell\u2019s move. The other half of the old company, which specializes in PC and printer sales, is now called HP Inc.With a constant mantra of building shareholder value, Ms. Whitman, who a year ago talked about growth strategies for H.P.E., has sold off big parts of the empire she took over five years ago. Last May, this involved selling off her services group, which employed 110,000 people. In an interview, Ms. Whitman said that after that sale, by the end of October, H.P.E. would have between 50,000 and 60,000 employees.\u201cWe have to understand our place in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are elements of our world that are shrinking.\u201dMr. Dell\u2019s move in the other direction has meant taking his company private, in the process taking on $33.4 billion in long-term debt at relatively little personal risk. He owns 70 percent of Dell Technologies, a company he is counting on to throw off a lot of cash to quickly repay the debt, even as the overall business computing industry shrinks.If his gambit succeeds, within a few years he could multiply by several times his personal fortune, already estimated at $18.5 billion, according to Bloomberg.Dell Technologies starts life with revenue of $74 billion and 140,000 employees, but in an interview on Wednesday Mr. Dell declined to say what those numbers might look like in two years.\u201cThings are going well on a relative basis,\u201d he said. \u201cMarket consolidation is definitely occurring.\u201dWith companies like Amazon Web Services and Google providing cloud computing services, corporations increasingly rent the use of computers they used to buy from Dell and H.P.E., for a lot less money. Other cloud companies, like Salesforce, rent software this way, something A.W.S. and Google also do.Along with the rise of mobile computing, cloud computing is radically altering the computer industry. According to IDC, global demand for traditional data storage fell 7 percent in the first quarter of this year. Server revenue fell 3.6 percent globally. Second-quarter PC sales were down 4.5 percent. In a market like that, big companies like H.P.E. and Dell can only hope for a bigger slice of a shrinking pie.Compare that with Amazon\u2019s fortunes. Since A.W.S. first disclosed its earnings in April 2015, Amazon\u2019s stock has nearly doubled, and despite a 40 percent increase in the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock market, shares of almost all the older business technology companies have barely budged.Cloud companies now get about 10 percent of all spending on business computing, and they are growing at a 30 percent annual clip, said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \u201cThat\u2019s 100 percent of the growth, maybe a little more\u201d of the whole business technology sector, he added. \u201cA year ago Meg talked about growth, but in the past six months it\u2019s all been about capital allocation and return to shareholders.\u201dCompared with many in the old guard, the H.P.E. and Dell strategies may be doing well. At least for now.Shares of H.P.E. have gained about 30 percent in the last year, largely in the last two months, as rumors spread that besides selling services and buying back shares, Ms. Whitman would sell the company\u2019s laggard software division.Pre-EMC, Dell was known mostly for PCs and computer servers. While the financial information released by the private company is limited, in the three months that ended April 29 it had revenue of $12 billion, down 2 percent. Operating income was higher, Dell said, using nonstandard accounting.Selling computers still throws off a lot of cash, which is good for paying debt. Mr. Dell said that Dell Technologies threw off $3.6 billion just in its most recent quarter. EMC also owns a software business, called Pivotal, which Mr. Dell is expected to take public soon.\u201cHe\u2019s betting that size and scale will help him gain share, not that the market will be great,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Computing, once the province of a few business tasks and consumer activities like video games, has with cloud computing attached itself to much of the world, making it possible to connect phones, tablets and sensor-equipped machines to huge computing resources.Both Dell and H.P.E. make the computers and related devices that amount to the infrastructure necessary to this new economy. Increasingly, however, the profit margins can be found above the computing guts, in particular with artificial intelligence technology that helps companies scour data to make smart decisions. Both Microsoft and IBM have invested heavily in both cloud computing and A.I.Mr. Dell said that he had spent $12.7 billion in research and development in the last three years and is gaining some A.I. technology in the EMC deal.In turn, when asked about its innovations, H.P.E. noted changes to its server and storage businesses, along with the acquisition of companies like Silicon Graphics, a high-performance computing company that peaked in the 1990s.An article on Thursday about the differing business strategies of Michael Dell and Meg Whitman misquoted Mr. Dell in one instance. Referring to the prospects of Dell Technologies, the company formed by the merger of his computer business and the data storage company EMC, he said: \u201cThings are going well on a relative basis,\u201d not \u201cThings are going well on a personal basis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Being a Black Female Math Whiz During the Space Race", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAMPTON, Va. \u2014 Growing up here in the 1970s, in the shadow of Langley Research Center, where workers helped revolutionize air flight and put Americans on the moon, Margot Lee Shetterly had a pretty fixed idea of what scientists looked like: They were middle class, African-American and worked at NASA, like her dad.It would be years before she learned that this was far from the American norm. And that many women in her hometown defied convention, too, by having vibrant, and by most standards, unusual careers.Black and female, dozens had worked at the space agency as mathematicians, often under Jim Crow laws, calculating crucial trajectories for rockets while being segregated from their white counterparts. For decades, as the space race made heroes out of lantern-jawed astronauts, the stories of those women went largely untold.\u201cThe thrilling thing to me about the book, and the movie, is this is an American story that we\u2019re getting to see through the faces of these women,\u201d Ms. Shetterly said during a recent visit to Hampton, which sits on the southeastern end of the Virginia Peninsula, surrounded by aquamarine waters and Navy ships. \u201cIt\u2019s just as American a story as if it were John Glenn or Alan Shepard telling it.\u201dMs. Shetterly happened upon the idea for the book six years ago, when she and her husband, Aran Shetterly, then living in Mexico, were visiting her parents here. The couple and Ms. Shetterly\u2019s father were driving around in his minivan when he mentioned, very casually, that one of Ms. Shetterly\u2019s former Sunday school teachers had worked as a mathematician at NASA, and that another woman she knew calculated rocket trajectories for famous astronauts.Ms. Shetterly remembers her husband perking up and asking why he had never heard this tale before. \u201cI knew women who worked at NASA as mathematicians and engineers,\u201d Ms. Shetterly said, \u201cbut it took someone from the outside saying, \u2018Wait a minute\u2019 for me to see the story there.\u201d(A book on a similar topic, Nathalia Holt\u2019s \u201cRise of the Rocket Girls,\u201d about women working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the \u201940s and \u201950s, was published in April.)Mrs. Darden and Mrs. Johnson still socialize, and on a recent summer day, made meltingly hot by a heat wave, met to play bridge at Mrs. Johnson\u2019s apartment. (Mrs. Johnson and her partner won.) Ms. Shetterly was visiting too, and presented both women with an early copy of her book. \u201cFantastic,\u201d Mrs. Darden said, as Mrs. Johnson, whose eyesight is failing, peered at the cover with a slight smile.Yet asked how she felt about the coming film, in which she is played by Ms. Henson, in the starring role, Mrs. Johnson became solemn. (Mrs. Darden is not portrayed onscreen, as the film focuses on the years preceding her arrival at NASA.)\u201cI shudder,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said. She had heard, she said, that the movie might stretch the facts, and that her character possibly came across as aggressive. \u201cI was never aggressive,\u201d Mrs. Johnson said.Ms. Shetterly reminded Mrs. Johnson of her persistence in the late 1950s, when she successfully pressed her supervisor into admitting her into traditionally all-male meetings. \u201cYou took matters in your own hands,\u201d Ms. Shetterly said. \u201cFor other women, it was a revelation.\u201dMs. Johnson said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t ever wait for something. I remember asking the question, \u2018Is there a law?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Let her go.\u2019 It was easier than arguing.\u201dListening in, one of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s health aides chuckled. \u201cYep,\u201d he said, \u201cThat\u2019s the Katherine Johnson I know.\u201dThough outwardly their stories are remarkable, both Mrs. Darden and Mrs. Johnson remained matter-of-fact when describing their careers, an attitude that seems to have prevailed among their peers. Ann Hammond, whose mother, Dorothy Vaughan, was one of the first black women to be hired by what was then called the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, in 1943, said her mother never wanted a pat on the back. Mrs. Vaughan died in 2005 at the age of 98, and is played in the film by Octavia Spencer.\u201cMy mother would\u2019ve probably said, \u2018I was just doing my job,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hammond, 80, said, speaking in the Hampton bungalow where she grew up with her five siblings.But what jobs they were. While military budget cuts and sequestration have hurt the economy here in recent decades, some 75 years ago the hungry wartime machine needed manpower, and womanpower, to fill its depleted ranks. This helped open the door for black female mathematicians, who were recruited through job bulletin boards and newspaper ads. Their job title? \u201cColored computers.\u201dMrs. Johnson, a math savant, graduated summa cum laude from what is now West Virginia State University at 18, and heard about the job through a family connection. Mrs. Darden, who went to college at Hampton Institute and earned a master\u2019s degree in math at Virginia State College, was hired to be a NASA data analyst out of graduate school in 1967, and went on to become an aerospace engineer.The military boom lasted for decades, allowing the women and their families to have what Ms. Hammond described as a good life, despite enduring the indignities of segregation in the early years \u2014 working, eating and using restrooms apart from white colleagues.Ms. Shetterly discovered in her research that the space agency\u2019s leaders were well aware of the negative effects of segregation. As Virginia began vigorously fighting public school desegregation in 1956, one higher up worried about the face that the United States, with its roiling racial problems, was presenting to the world, using words that still have resonance today.\u201cIn trying to provide leadership in world events, it is necessary for this country to indicate to the world that we practice equality for all within this country,\u201d NACA\u2019s chief counsel, Paul Dembling, wrote in a file memo that year. Two years later, the segregated computing pool was disbanded.Through it all, by most accounts, the black women at NASA held their heads high.\u201cHer whole life, my mother never felt superior and never felt less than anybody else,\u201d said Joylette Hylick, the eldest of Mrs. Johnson\u2019s three daughters. \u201cShe didn\u2019t let it get in her way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Islam Karimov Dies at 78, Ending a Long, Ruthless Rule of Uzbekistan", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Islam Karimov, a ruthless autocrat who ruled Uzbekistan for almost three decades, died on Friday in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent. He was 78.A joint statement by the cabinet of ministers and Parliament announced the death, saying he had a stroke that led to multiple organ failure.The announcement followed a long, strange interlude during which Uzbek officials refrained from confirming the death even while the leaders of Turkey and Georgia expressed condolences, mosque leaders were barred from offering prayers for the president\u2019s health, and funeral arrangements were being made very publicly. A respected opposition website posted pictures of cemetery workers in Samarkand, the president\u2019s hometown, digging a fresh grave in a prominent location.The likeliest reason for the official silence was that top government officials had been unable to decide on the succession and did not want to announce that Mr. Karimov was dead until they could also say who would replace him, at least temporarily.The official statement said that the prime minister, Shavkat Mirziyoev, who is widely deemed to be the president\u2019s likeliest successor, would lead the funeral on Saturday and that Mr. Karimov would be buried in Samarkand in accordance with Muslim rites.It is by no means certain that Prime Minister Mirziyoev, who is considered a Kremlin ally, will succeed Mr. Karimov. Rustam Azimov, a deputy prime minister and finance minister, is a possible technocratic alternative.Mr. Karimov\u2019s glamorous older daughter, Gulnara Karimova, had once been seen as having a promising political future, but those prospects disintegrated in a public soap opera involving charges of bribery, money laundering, physical violence and even sorcery.Mr. Karimov rose through the ranks of the local Communist Party until the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev named him first secretary and effectively Uzbekistan\u2019s chief in 1989. He won a presidential election after independence in 1991 and used Soviet methods to govern the country.\u201cHe is the state and the state is him, and it has been that way for at least 25 years,\u201d said Steve Swerdlow, the director of Central Asia research at Human Rights Watch.\u201cIt is a police state where the power belongs completely to the security services,\u201d said Daniil Kislov, the Moscow-based editor in chief of a website, Ferghana.ru. \u201cThe special services will not allow for any alternative on the succession.\u201dThe immediate succession is expected to follow the Constitution, which mandates that the head of the Senate run the country for three months until new presidential elections can be organized. Mr. Karimov repeatedly manipulated elections or referendums to extend his rule well beyond the two terms mandated by the Constitution.Mr. Karimov jailed or exiled his political opponents and muzzled the news media. Political prisoners were estimated to number in the thousands. Torture was rife. He brushed aside any criticism that managed to bubble up despite the oppression.\u201cI am one of those who is criticized for staying too long,\u201d he said in 2014. \u201cBut I want to keep working. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201dWith him gone, there was some question about whether the Islamic State or other groups might try to exploit the transition. \u201cWhether or not the Islamic State sees a succession as an opportunity to create risks for the much-hated Russians remains an open question,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, an expert on Russia and chairman of the Eurasia Group, a risk advisory firm based in Washington.In 1999, Mr. Karimov made his position toward radical Islam abundantly clear.\u201cI am prepared to rip off the heads of 200 people, to sacrifice their lives, in order to save peace and calm in the republic,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf my child chose such a path, I myself would rip off his head.\u201dMr. Karimov responded by expelling American forces from Karshi-Khanabad Military Base, an important link in the supply chain for the forces propping up the government in Afghanistan against the Taliban.Eventually, supply needs trumped human rights issues, and the United States restored relations, even giving the Uzbekistan forces hundreds of surplus armored vehicles as American forces in Afghanistan were being drawn down.Opposition websites alleged that Mr. Karimov beat his daughter in a fit of rage before jailing some of her associates and confining her to her home, where she remains incommunicado.\u201cKarimov first slapped her on the face and then really started to beat Gulnara,\u201d according to an account, attributed to an unidentified security service insider and published in 2013 on the website of the opposition People\u2019s Movement of Uzbekistan.Ms. Karimova took to social media at the time to accuse her mother and her younger sister of dabbling in witchcraft. \u201cThe other part of the family destroys and is friends with sorcerers,\u201d Ms. Karimova wrote in a post on Instagram.Mr. Karimov\u2019s wife and daughters survive him, as do four grandchildren.Some analysts attributed Mr. Karimov\u2019s reclusiveness and violent tendencies toward opponents as well as relatives and associates \u2014 he was known to pitch heavy marble ashtrays at senior aides \u2014 to his early years in a Soviet orphanage.Islam Karimov was born on Jan. 30, 1938, in Samarkand. His official biography said his father had been an office worker. Other accounts suggested that his parents, overwhelmed by a large family and meager resources, put him in an orphanage, at first temporarily, but eventually left him there.He studied to become an engineer, worked at an airplane factory and joined the Communist Party in the early 1960s. He married in 1964, and he and his wife had a son, Petr, but soon divorced. The son is believed to have moved to Moscow decades ago and never returned.Mr. Karimov joined Gosplan, the central Soviet economic planning agency, in 1966 and married for the second time in 1967. He rose to become the finance minister for the Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan in 1983.By all accounts Mr. Karimov hated the political jockeying by different groups in the initial burst of freedom after independence in 1991 and worked to destroy all autonomous political, media and human rights organizations.His antipathy toward Islamic groups is sometimes linked to an episode that same year. With Soviet authority crumbling, Islamic vigilante groups had established security and social services that were lacking in the Fergana Valley, and after one extremist group seized a building, Mr. Karimov went to negotiate with its representatives. He soon found himself humiliated when a young religious leader forced him to pray publicly. Later, he banned mosques from broadcasting the call to prayer.Over the years, Mr. Karimov also closed off the country to outside observers and put the news media under government control \u2014 one reason the circumstances of his death remain unclear.Mr. Karimov never lost his love of Soviet methods, be it for strengthening the domestic intelligence services or fostering a centrally planned economy, even if it kept much of the population mired in poverty. He once infamously criticized the millions of Uzbeks who had gone to take menial jobs in Russia just to survive, calling them \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to work at home.Every year, the government forced about one million students and others to join Uzbekistan\u2019s annual cotton harvest to meet government-established quotas.\u201cHe was a Soviet man to the end,\u201d Mr. Kislov, the web journalist, said.Oleg Matsnev and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Intel is still reeling from the shift away from PCs \u2014 it has struggled to drum up business in chips for cloud-type data centers.At the same time, the many smartphones, tablets and laptops reliant on the cloud all need one feature: security. Traditional virus scans are insufficient for modern threats. McAfee has said it will refocus on identifying potential threats on cloud networks.Dell and H.P.E. can, however, take some solace in the fact that they make some of the infrastructure necessary for the cloud-connected world.

For another building, multiple work permits are being sought from the city for renovations.The Displacement Alert Project Map mined several public databases to include more than 96,400 residential properties with more than three apartments that met at least one of three conditions: The building was sold in 2015, had obtained a work permit from the city\u2019s Department of Buildings since 2013 or contained at least one rent-regulated unit since 2007.Officials of the association said the volume of building permits could indicate renovations leading to rent increases and a high rate of tenant turnover. Building sales prices, they said, may signal speculative purchases in up-and-coming real estate markets.The map gives a high-risk score to buildings that have lost rent-regulated units since 2007, have sought renovation permits and were recently sold \u2014 about 500 buildings. But 24,766 properties had the highest risk score, shown in red, in at least one category, increasing the likelihood of a rent bump, Barika X. Williams, deputy director for the association, said.Housing activists said the information was meant to help tenant organizers identify buildings where tenants may be most vulnerable to landlord harassment and to help prevent illegal evictions. The data may also help city officials identify patterns and guide public policy to preserve the existing affordable housing stock, the activists said.\u201cThis sort of tool helps us get beyond the rhetoric,\u201d said Xavier de Souza Briggs, the vice president for economic opportunity and markets at the Ford Foundation, which helped finance the map project. \u201cBecause the picture is constantly changing, tools like this one help to focus precious time and resources.\u201dBut Jack Freund, executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord group, said that the majority of the city\u2019s rental housing stock was now more than 80 years old and \u201cin desperate need of improvement,\u201d so work permits were hardly a reliable barometer of buildings where tenants might be more vulnerable to displacement.The costs for improving buildings are usually paid by new tenants who pay higher rents, Mr. Freund said.\u201cThe effort to link apartment renovations with harassment and illegal evictions is simply wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cExisting tenants, their neighborhoods and the city\u2019s economy all benefit when landlords improve their buildings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Debate Over Pricing the Risks of Climate Change", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome companies, including Exxon Mobil, say the economics of climate change are too hard to predict for them to give investors hard numbers about the business impact of global warming.Federal regulators may disagree and are considering requiring Exxon to do just that for the value of its oil reserves.Now a long-shot legislative effort by a Florida congressman to prevent such a move by the federal government has become an unexpected flash point in the battle over disclosing climate-related risks \u2014 with potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in the balance.But at a time when many Republicans dispute the very notion of climate change, the Posey measure has focused the debate over whether it is reasonable \u2014 or even possible \u2014 to expect companies to put a price tag on the environmental impact of climate change.Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has called climate change \u201ca hoax\u201d and promises to slash environmental regulations to bolster economic growth.The issue is not limited to Exxon and oil companies. The Posey amendment would allow real estate companies to stay mum on the risks posed to waterfront properties by rising seas, for example, and let food companies leave the impact of future water shortages unaddressed.But some companies, including Exxon, contend that the economics of climate change are unpredictable and that global growth will continue to create demand for resources, making it even more difficult to come up with hard numbers.Representative Posey is among those who say the federal government has no business forcing businesses to try. He accuses the financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, of pursuing a political agenda by pressing companies to quantify climate risks.\u201cThese politically motivated and mandated disclosures are not about protecting investors, they are about shaming companies, or at least attempting to shame companies, into adopting their agenda,\u201d he said in July.George Cecala, a spokesman for Mr. Posey, did not respond to requests for further comment.\u201cHow could anybody tell the S.E.C. to ignore the climate?\u201d Ms. Lubber of Ceres said.The issue has been for investors, corporate executives and environmental leaders gathered in New York this week for Climate Week, an annual showcase tied to the opening of the United Nations General Assembly.Already, a shift in the global energy landscape, brought on partly by a surge in drilling in United States oil and gas shale fields, has brought about a slump in fuel prices, calling into question the viability of future oil projects in far-flung places like the Arctic and deepwater oceans.And scientists estimate that as much as three-quarters of the world\u2019s coal, oil and gas reserves must remain in the ground if the world has a shot at keeping carbon emissions under levels set by the Paris climate accord \u2014 unless there is a technological breakthrough in capturing carbon and keeping it out of the atmosphere.Exxon and its American oil industry peers have been reluctant to estimate the risks to their balance sheets. That contrasts with oil companies in Europe, which have been writing down the value of their assets over the last two years as oil prices plummeted.Energy experts say that is largely because international financial reporting standards require more detailed reporting on asset valuations than the standards in the United States. Last year, Statoil, the Norwegian oil giant, wrote down the value of its North American shale and oil sands assets by $4 billion. Royal Dutch Shell reported a write-down of more than $8 billion.\u201cThe rules are different, the relationships between the companies and governments are different, and Europe has clearer carbon policies,\u201d said Michael Webber, associate director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.Exxon Mobil, which has accumulated assets over decades, has long argued that its executives take a long view that includes periods of both low and high commodity prices that swing as a matter of normal course.In its filings to the S.E.C., Exxon Mobil has reported that it has stress-tested its major assets and expects that future cash flow could sustain even its most economically challenged oil and gas fields. The company has conceded that a future write-down of assets is possible if its projections change.Still, most oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, predict that oil and natural gas prices will recover over the next few years and that demand for those fossil fuels will continue to increase along with growing populations and middle classes in emerging markets.The companies also say that projections are difficult without knowing what future climate-change regulations will entail, or how new technologies might help curtail greenhouse gas emissions.\u201cThis is like being blindfolded, shooting in the dark at a moving target,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.The one certainty is that the United States oil industry is already under severe financial pressure.Last year, American petroleum producers wrote down $177 billion in assets, according to a recent report by IHS Energy. Exxon Mobil is in far better financial condition than most other companies in the industry. But this year the company, stretched by debt, lost its top-rung AAA credit rating.\u201cBanks are lending to fossil fuel projects, and ports and railroads are being built to handle coal, and that\u2019s not viable,\u201d Mr. Campanale said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a highly disruptive transition, and companies aren\u2019t properly disclosing what that transition will look like.\u201dThe board estimates that there are significant climate risks for most companies it tracks, which represent $27.5 trillion, or 93 percent, of United States stocks as measured by market value.Jean Rogers, chief executive of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, says more companies should acknowledge the threat.\u201cClimate risk is the most ubiquitous risk out there,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse anymore.

{"Headline": "Torn Over Donald Trump and Cut Off by Culture Wars, Evangelicals Despair", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRIMES, Iowa \u2014 Betty and Dick Odgaard used to own the tiny church next door to their home. They had built it over 13 years into an art gallery, bistro, flower shop and framing service. They even rented out the chapel, with its bright stained glass windows, for social events.But three years ago, the Odgaards refused to rent the quaint site to two gay men for a wedding, saying it would violate their religious beliefs about marriage. The men filed a civil rights complaint, and the Odgaards settled, paying a penalty because it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. After the controversy, regular customers stopped coming. Friends and family members stopped speaking to them. The Odgaards were vilified as bigots and haters.So, in a year when many voters see nothing but bad choices, many evangelicals feel deeply torn. Long part of a reliable Republican voting bloc, many are appalled to find Donald J. Trump their only alternative to Hillary Clinton. They say he has taken positions all over the map on same-sex couples and abortion and does not have the character to be president. Others are still bewildered that Mr. Trump defeated not only Mr. Cruz \u2014 a pastor\u2019s son who made \u201creligious liberty\u201d a signature issue \u2014 but also half a dozen other conservative Christian contenders they would have gladly supported.Nevertheless, polls show that the vast majority of evangelicals are now coalescing around Mr. Trump, largely out of fear that a President Clinton will appoint liberal Supreme Court justices.The change in America seemed to happen so quickly that it felt like whiplash, the Odgaards said. One day, they felt comfortably situated in the American majority, as Christians with shared beliefs in God, family and the Bible. They had never even imagined that two people of the same sex could marry.Overnight, it seemed, they discovered that even in small-town Iowa they were outnumbered, isolated and unpopular. Everyone they knew seemed to have a gay relative or friend. Mr. Odgaard\u2019s daughter from his first marriage disavowed her father\u2019s actions on Facebook, and his gay second cousin will not speak to him. Even their own Mennonite congregation put out a statement saying that while the denomination opposes gay marriage, \u201cnot every congregation\u201d or Mennonite does. Mrs. Odgaard, 64, the daughter of a Mennonite minister, was devastated.\u201cIt all flipped, so fast,\u201d said Mr. Odgaard, a patrician 70-year-old who favors khakis and boat shoes. \u201cSuddenly, we were in the minority. That was kind of a scary feeling. It makes you wonder where the Christians went.\u201dThe beginning of the end of the Odgaards\u2019 familiar life came Aug. 3, 2013, when Lee Stafford and Jared Ellars arrived at the Odgaards\u2019 gallery, G\u00f6rtz Haus. The couple were in a panic because the hotel they had booked for their wedding had gone bankrupt two months before the date, and they had already sent the invitations out. Mr. Odgaard spent about 45 minutes showing them the property and figuring out seating, flowers and how many guests needed gluten-free meals. It was only when Mr. Odgaard asked if it was a same-sex wedding that his tone changed, they said.\u201cI\u2019ll remember these words for the rest of my life,\u201d said Mr. Ellars, 35, a database administrator. \u201cHe looked at us and he said, \u2018I can\u2019t take your money, and we don\u2019t do anything for free.\u2019\u201dThe couple, together for 13 years, say they never wanted the Odgaards to go out of business. They say they wanted them to stop discriminating against gay people and never put another gay couple through the rejection they experienced. The case was settled in arbitration, and the Odgaards had to pay $5,000 to Mr. Stafford and Mr. Ellars, which they donated to an anti-bullying program for gay students.Their wedding was held in a barn, officiated by a minister with the Disciples of Christ church that Mr. Stafford attends. To this day, Mr. Stafford, who is 43 and a business systems analyst, is troubled that the debate over religious liberty appears to be \u201cso one-sided,\u201d he said.\u201cTheir religious beliefs say they don\u2019t approve of gay marriage, but my religious beliefs say that we can,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does their religion trump mine?\u201dMr. Jorgenson jumped at buying the Odgaards\u2019 picturesque property on the busiest street in Grimes, a suburb of Des Moines. He converted the lower floor, where the flower shop once stood, into a children\u2019s ministry, and installed soundproofing to insulate the children\u2019s ruckus downstairs from the electric guitars and drums of the church\u2019s worship band upstairs.He liked the symbolism of converting a landmark site that had represented a defeat for conservative Christians into an outpost for preaching \u201cGod\u2019s word, without apology,\u201d he said. The church now draws up to 300 on a weekend, and is already outgrowing the space. On a recent weekday, the secretary sat working on a stool in a hall closet. The staff was planning a conference to teach Christians how to evangelize to atheists, agnostics and Mormons.It is necessary to train believers to hold their own, the pastor said, because \u201cmainstream biblical Christianity is less and less mainstream.\u201d On Sundays, he notices that half of his neighbors do not even go to church.He expects that more and more Christians will, like the Odgaards, suffer \u201cpersecution\u201d for their beliefs. He regularly visits the Capitol in Des Moines to pray with and lobby legislators with the Family Leader, a conservative Iowa group.Mr. Jorgenson was among many Iowa pastors who publicly supported Mr. Cruz, though not from the pulpit, and he is not sure if he will vote for Mr. Trump in November, even though Mr. Cruz has now said he will vote for Mr. Trump. Mr. Jorgenson would not even consider voting for Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and said he did not know anyone in his church who would. But asked how much hope he had that Mr. Trump would protect the religious liberty of conservative Christians, Mr. Jorgenson held his two fingers a quarter-inch apart.\u201cMy hope is not ultimately in the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not of this world. Jesus is going to come back. He\u2019s going to bring the perfect government. Until then, we live in a world of sin.\u201dShe is an accountant, he a chemist, and they met in a Christian chat room. They had something in common, aside from their faith: Mr. Berkheimer is half-Japanese, and Mrs. Berkheimer had lived in Japan, and her children from her first marriage are half-Japanese.Over dinner at a steakhouse recently, the Berkheimers said they had nothing against gay people \u2014 a refrain the Odgaards also repeatedly sounded.\u201cMy brother was a homosexual,\u201d Mrs. Berkheimer said. Her brother became a born-again Christian before he died of complications from AIDS many years ago, and she named her son after him, she said.She said she became seriously alarmed about the nation in the past year as Congress failed to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood after an anti-abortion group released videos taken surreptitiously of the organization. The Berkheimers are in the \u201cNever Trump\u201d camp.\u201cI\u2019m worried for America if we don\u2019t turn away from abortion,\u201d said Mrs. Berkheimer, who is 48. \u201cI think our country is going to be punished, with a nuclear weapon. I don\u2019t think you can mock God forever.\u201dShe quickly added that she was worried she would sound crazy saying such things.Mr. McKoy steered the conversation to the Odgaards. He had quietly played a part in their story: When Mrs. Odgaard was in the depths of despair over a boycott of G\u00f6rtz Haus, she often called Mr. McKoy, and he prayed with her. He introduced the Odgaards to Mr. Jorgenson, the young pastor looking for a permanent place for his church.On air, the radio hosts suggested that the Odgaards\u2019 story showed that Americans were developing a double standard on the notion of tolerance. \u201cI just wish that this tolerance went across the board for Christian businesses,\u201d said one host, Frank Thomas Holzhauser, who on air calls himself Frank (the Verse) Thomas \u2014 a nod to his facility with Scripture.When the show ended, the hosts debated the election. Only Mr. Holzhauser said he was certain he would vote for Mr. Trump, but he admitted it had caused him to lose some friends who \u201ccan\u2019t stomach Trump.\u201dThe others said they had not decided how they would vote. None had supported Mr. Trump in the Iowa caucuses. Mr. McKoy and Chris Rohloff had supported Senator Marco Rubio, Mr. Holzhauser had favored Ben Carson, and Bob Monserrate had backed Mr. Cruz. Mr. Rohloff said he had thought that Mr. Trump was finished last year, the moment he said at a candidates\u2019 forum in Iowa that he had never asked God for forgiveness.\u201cEveryone in the room just went, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 Even if you\u2019ve never done it, you should at least know the right answer,\u201d Mr. Rohloff said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fundamental thing for Christians.\u201dBut by late September, Mr. McKoy said in a telephone interview that he and his co-hosts had decided to vote Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s the lesser of two evils. And I don\u2019t know by how much.\u201dSome evangelicals in Iowa said Christians who praised Mr. Trump were giving Christianity a bad name. They blamed evangelicals in the South or \u201cNascar Christians\u201d who go to church only when car races are not on.Some Republicans are working to lift evangelicals\u2019 enthusiasm.He sounded exasperated with Christians who disparaged Mr. Trump.\u201cI hope the good Lord shows more grace to me as a sinner than these people show to Donald Trump,\u201d he said.On a recent Sunday, the Odgaards walked into the church and sat in the rear, where Mrs. Odgaard, an artist whose paintings once filled the space, used to design frames for customers. The seats \u2014 stackable banquet chairs that the Odgaards had bought for their wedding business \u2014 were nearly full of mostly young worshipers. They rested their coffee cups on the hardwood floor that the Odgaards had stripped of carpet and sanded when they bought the place, spending a week on their knees. One Sunday in church, the memories were so raw that Mrs. Odgaard said she began to cry and left for home.\u201cIt\u2019s like losing a child,\u201d Mr. Odgaard said.Church members were invited to stay afterward for a quarterly meeting. Dylan Knudsen, a co-pastor, made a major announcement.Harvest Bible Chapel had just been approved for a loan to buy the Odgaards\u2019 tidy red brick house next door. The Odgaards were about to move to another town. But they planned to keep attending Harvest Bible Chapel, Mr. Knudsen said. There was brief applause.\u201cPlease thank them,\u201d Mr. Knudsen said, \u201cfor their sacrificial role.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Factory Activity Dips, but Economic Growth Seems Promising", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON (Reuters) \u2014 Factory activity contracted in August for the first time in six months as new orders and production tumbled, the Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday, but a low level of layoffs continued to point to a pickup in economic growth in the third quarter.While manufacturing remained constrained by the lingering effects of a strong dollar and lower oil prices, sustained labor market strength could push the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates this year.\u201cToday\u2019s disappointing number further weakens the case for a rate hike later this month, but we currently see no reason to change our Fed call and continue to anticipate a rate hike at the December meeting,\u201d said Harm Bandholz, chief United States economist at UniCredit in New York.The institute\u2019s index of national factory activity fell 3.2 percentage points to a reading of 49.4 last month. That was the first contraction since February.The index remains above the 43.2 threshold that is associated with a recession. Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the United States economy.The dollar\u2019s surge from June 2014 to December 2015 and weak global demand have crimped export growth. A collapse in oil drilling after a plunge in petroleum prices has also squeezed manufacturing by undermining business spending, leading to weak demand for heavy machinery.In addition, an inventory correction has resulted in factories receiving fewer orders.While surveys including the index of factory activity and several regional reports have pointed to manufacturing weakness, so-called hard data on oil drilling rigs, durable goods orders and industrial production have offered tentative signs of stability in the sector.Data on consumer spending and housing suggest the economy has regained speed after growing only 1 percent in thefirst half of the year, though manufacturing is lagging.In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 263,000 for the week ended Aug. 27. It was the 78th consecutive week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a robust labor market \u2014 the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,000 to 263,000 last week.\u201cDespite some seeming trouble in the manufacturing sector, the overall outlook for employment is positive,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays in New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Care.com Creates a $500 Limited Benefit for Gig-Economy Workers", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn one of the earliest moves to bring employee benefits to workers in the so-called gig economy, an online marketplace that connects millions of families with babysitters, nannies and caregivers announced on Wednesday that it would provide up to $500 a year for workers to use for health care, transportation or education expenses.The Care.com solution to this problem is to earmark a small portion of the transaction fee it charges many families toward the caregiver benefit and allow the contributions to accrue across jobs.\u201cAs freelance labor moves to work for different people, their benefits should move with them,\u201d said Sheila Marcelo, the founder and chief executive of Care.com. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anyone do what we\u2019re doing. We think it\u2019s groundbreaking.\u201dDespite the rising interest, however, there have been strikingly few accomplishments to date. In 2012, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a labor organization representing cabdrivers, persuaded the Taxi and Limousine Commission to require taxi medallion owners to deduct 6 cents per fare from the driver\u2019s credit card receipts to fund portable benefits for drivers, like health care services and disability coverage.The New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan struck down the regulation in 2014. (Corey Johnson, a member of the New York City Council, has said he plans to introduce legislation aimed at creating a similar fund.)Earlier this year, Uber reached an agreement with the regional branch of a prominent union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, to create an association to represent roughly 35,000 Uber drivers in New York City. The drivers association could eventually set up and administer a fund for benefits like paid time off.Some worker advocates said the Care.com development could help generate momentum on the issue.The new Care.com benefit will be funded by diverting two percentage points of the 12 percent transaction fee that it charges families who use its platform to pay their caregivers. The caregivers can accrue an unlimited amount of benefit money in a given year, but can spend only up to $500. The company said it arrived at this figure because it is equivalent to what a typical employee pays over six months for pharmacy benefits or vision insurance. Any amount the caregivers do not spend will be rolled over to the following year.Ms. Marcelo conceded that a large percentage of families do not use the Care.com platform to pay the more than nine million caregivers they find there, noting that the payment option is very recent. But she said she expected families to rely more on the company\u2019s payments feature in the future because their caregivers, mindful of the new benefit, would nudge them in that direction.\u201cThese workers a lot of times are living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all need to do what we can do to help these caregivers earn more and save.\u201dStill, some worker advocates were concerned by the development, arguing that any success in creating portable benefits for gig-economy workers could implicitly concede the fight over whether such workers should be classified as employees or independent contractors. Employees receive a variety of rights and protections, including minimum wage, overtime pay and a federally backed right to organize; contractors have very few.\u201cBenefits can make you a little less helpless,\u201d said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t fill that void.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Bid on a Houston Oil Refinery Is a Big Strategic Bet", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 The Saudi national oil company is making a bid to significantly expand its operations in the United States at a critical moment in the always uneasy relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia.The company, Saudi Aramco, aims to strengthen its position on the Gulf of Mexico coast by buying a large oil refinery in the Houston Ship Channel that LyondellBasell is putting up for sale.Four years ago Saudi Aramco completed a $10 billion expansion of a giant oil refinery in Port Arthur, Tex., in a joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell called Motiva Enterprises. The converted plant is now the biggest producer of gasoline, diesel and other petroleum products in the United States.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Saudi officials have denied any role in the attacks and have threatened to sell $750 billion in United States assets, including Treasury securities, held by the Saudi government if the congressional measure moves forward.But energy experts say the quiet bid by Saudi Aramco is designed to further protect its share of the United States oil market, even as Washington and American oil companies continue efforts to wean the country off foreign oil.Saudi Aramco did not respond to questions about the bidding. A spokeswoman for LyondellBasell said she had no comment.Saudi Aramco is in competition for the Lyondell refinery with Texas-based Valero, as well as two big Canadian companies, Suncor and Cenovus.Energy experts who have been briefed on the negotiations say that Saudi Aramco is a leading contender and that the price for the refinery could be as much as $1.5 billion.The Lyondell plant has a capacity to refine nearly 270,000 barrels a day of crude, which could increase Saudi Aramco\u2019s capacity to refine its oil on the Gulf coast by about 50 percent. The refinery produces not only gasoline and other fuels, but also can also produce feedstocks for petrochemical production.Imports of Saudi crude have been dropping in recent years, from 1.8 million barrels a day in 2003 to 1.1 million barrels a day this year, largely because of the shale drilling boom in Texas and North Dakota.\u201cIt looks like they are doubling down on their U.S. relationship,\u201d said David L. Goldwyn, who was the State Department coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration.\u201cIt makes economic sense,\u201d Mr. Goldwyn said, \u201cbecause they want to be a global petrochemical power. And it makes political sense because they see a long-term relationship with the U.S. as the kind of strategic assurance they will be seeking from the next administration.\u201dThe Saudi effort is part of an initiative to expand its refining empire as a way to protect its share of the global market.Saudi Aramco is also negotiating with C.N.P.C., the Chinese state oil company, for the joint construction of a giant refinery in southwestern Yunnan province. It has investments in other refineries in Japan, China, South Korea and Indonesia.The effort to focus more financial firepower on global refineries is also part of a larger strategy to diversify investments in areas other than drilling for crude oil on the Arabian Peninsula. A public offering of at least some refineries is being considered to bolster Saudi Aramco\u2019s financial position, even as the company is making a concerted effort to expand production of refined products, including gasoline and diesel.The Lyondell refinery, one of the largest in the United States, is designed to process low-quality, high sulfur crude oil. In recent years it has mostly processed Mexican crude and Canadian heavy oil from oil sands, but it could just as easily process low grade Saudi crude that refineries in Europe and Asia are not designed to refine.United States refineries get a competitive edge on world markets from the low costs of American natural gas that produces power for the plants.The possible purchase of the Lyondell refinery comes at a time when Saudi Aramco and Shell are going their separate ways, ahead of the planned disbanding of their Motiva joint venture early next year. The two companies are still working out the details, but Saudi Aramco is poised to gain complete control over the Port Arthur refinery as well as a chain of gasoline stations and storage facilities, while Shell will take over two smaller refineries in Louisiana \u2014 Convent and Norco \u2014 that were jointly owned.Middle East oil experts say the impending loss of a piece of those two refineries would make the acquisition of Lyondell refinery all the more essential to maintain Saudi Aramco\u2019s dominant market position along the Gulf of Mexico coast.\u201cAramco has a keen interest in maintaining its downstream market share in the U.S.,\u201d said Sadad I. al-Husseini, a former Saudi Aramco executive vice president. \u201cThe Lyondell refinery, because of its size and location will go a long way towards sustaining this strategy after the breakup of Motiva and the loss of the Convent and Norco refineries.\u201dSenior officials in the Saudi government have said they would like to sell a small stake in Saudi Aramco to investors over the next few years, and its refineries are among its assets that look most likely to be offered to investors.While investors may view refineries in Saudi Arabia as too risky because of political turbulence in the Persian Gulf, refineries in the United States could be seen as attractive investments. The proceeds from those public offerings could then go into expanding and modernizing petrochemical operations in the kingdom itself, energy experts said.\u201cIt could be a move to strengthen their downstream asset base as part of their ongoing restructuring and I.P.O. plans,\u201d said Badr H. Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum of the United Arab Emirates.Nevertheless, some energy and Middle East experts say the timing of the Saudi bid is somewhat surprising, coming just before a United States presidential election and given the kingdom\u2019s shaky reputation among the American people. But they say it shows that Saudi Arabia still looks to the United States as an ally in economic and political affairs, as well as a good place to invest.\u201cObviously it\u2019s a real indication that they don\u2019t have concerns about the U.S. as a safe haven for investment,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, an expert on Middle East energy at the University of California, Davis. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity purchase, not a necessity, so it shows a real confidence in the U.S. market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Expert on Chinese Medicine, but No New Age Healer", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBERLIN \u2014 One day in 1971, the doorbell rang at Paul U. Unschuld\u2019s apartment in Munich. He opened the door to find a young man, who laconically said in English: \u201cHi, I am James Quinn, C.I.A. Tell me about the military usage of acupuncture.\u201dSo began the German academic\u2019s rise from relative obscurity to his position as the West\u2019s leading authority on ancient Chinese healing practices. One of the first Western scholars to tackle Chinese medicine in a systematic and serious way, Dr. Unschuld has seen his subject more as a way to interpret Chinese civilization than as a New Age answer to modern medicine.Respected and sometimes resented for his scrupulousness in translating Chinese medical texts, Dr. Unschuld, a tall man of regal bearing, harks back to an era of scholarship, when people who engaged with China were called Sinologists \u2014 those who studied broad swaths of the Chinese world that reflected their wide-ranging interests.In his spare time, Dr. Unschuld has led German government delegations to China, and has written books on how medicine helps to explain China\u2019s rise to global prominence.\u201cIf there are two words I\u2019d associate with Unschuld, it\u2019s rigor and exactitude,\u201d said Phil Garrison, a teacher at the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in San Diego and at the Finger Lakes School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in Seneca Falls, N.Y. \u201cBut these qualities are a double-edged sword.\u201dBut this reflects a deep respect for the ancient authors the detractors of Chinese medicine sometimes lack. Dr. Unschuld hunts down obscure terms and devises consistent terminologies that are sometimes not easy to read, but are faithful to the original text. Almost universally, his translations are regarded as trailblazing \u2014 making available, for the first time in a Western language, the complete foundational works of Chinese medicine from up to 2,000 years ago.\u201cThere exist any number of critical editions of the works of Hippocrates or Galen\u201d from ancient Greece, said Don Harper, a professor at the University of Chicago, who studies ancient Chinese religious and medical texts. \u201cPaul is the first to provide anything comparable to the Chinese corpus.\u201dBut for many Western practitioners of Chinese medicine, Dr. Unschuld is an uncompromising guide to the Chinese classics. His books sell well, but many Westerners prefer more accessible translations that use more familiar terms.\u201cPeople were very threatened by what he said,\u201d said Z\u2019ev Rosenberg, an author, and a practitioner and teacher of Chinese medicine. \u201cHe said you need access to the sources and the terminology.\u201d\u201cExcuse me, but acupuncture and herbs can\u2019t help you there,\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cBut there are some health problems where these therapies may be beneficial, and, hence, I\u2019m not against it when someone uses it.\u201dThis was during the Kissinger-Nixon rapprochement with China, and the start of China\u2019s decades-long reopening to the outside world. Chinese medicine became part of the country\u2019s allure. Soon came the visit to Dr. Unschuld from Mr. Quinn, the C.I.A. agent; the opening of Chinese medical schools in the West; and a flood of books and translations about the exotic-sounding healing arts from the Orient.Dr. Unschuld\u2019s interest in medicine was not entirely unique in his family. His great-grandfather had treated the king of Belgium and other European nobility. Dr. Unschuld says he grew up in a household filled with vases and other chinoiserie donated by grateful patients. His father had been a pharmacist who collected pharmaceutical artifacts and pharmacopoeias of past centuries.Initially, Dr. Unschuld earned a degree in pharmacy in Munich along with his wife, Ulrike. But he had also been fascinated with foreign languages and had completed a parallel track in Chinese studies. In 1969, before what he assumed would be a career in the pharmaceutical industry, the couple went to Taiwan for a year to improve their Chinese language skills.His purely academic approach, however, makes him a difficult figure for China to embrace. While widely respected for his knowledge and translations, he has done little to advance the government\u2019s agenda of promoting Chinese medicine as soft power. Echoing other critics, he describes China\u2019s translations of the classics as \u201ccomplete swindles,\u201d saying they are done with little care and only a political goal in mind.\u201cIt is a metaphor for enlightenment,\u201d he says.In China, Dr. Unschuld said, \u201cMedicine and politics are similar: You don\u2019t blame others, you blame yourself.\u201d He added, \u201cYou ask: \u2018What did I do wrong? What made me vulnerable? What can I do against it?\u2019 This is why China has risen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Car\u2019s New Software Is Ready. Update Now?", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsTIRED of your vehicle and its aging, limited features? Don\u2019t trade it in just yet. Download new software instead.In some cases, that is already possible. And over the next few years, as the already extensive software on modern cars becomes even more feature-rich and upgradeable, manufacturers mean to step up the effort. They plan to offer many types of improvements or repairs through downloads that are beamed directly to the car via satellite, Wi-Fi or cellular signal, without the vehicle\u2019s having to be brought into the shop.Eventually, your car will be serviceable like a giant smartphone, with new features added periodically while you sleep.A leading proponent of the approach is Tesla, the maker of electric luxury cars, which has been sending updates to its cars\u2019 operating systems since 2012. The company is expected to announce an updated operating system next week. The chief executive, Elon Musk, has said via Twitter that the update will include improvements to the company\u2019s Autopilot automated driving system.But Tesla is by no means alone in the download department. General Motors has been offering services and upgrades via the cellular-delivered OnStar entertainment and roadside-assistance system since 2009. G.M.\u2019s Acadia sport utility vehicle can now receive new apps for its entertainment system over the air.Other manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, send wireless uploads to update various in-vehicle apps, including maps and entertainment offerings like Spotify and Pandora.The number of vehicles on United States roads that can accept infotainment software upgrades will increase to 34 million in 2022 from one million now, the consulting firm IHS Markit predicts.\u201cThe advantages for automakers of doing over-the-air updates are too great to ignore,\u201d said Egil Juliussen, automotive analyst for IHS Markit. \u201cThey can keep their functionality up-to-date and get rid of bugs.\u201dTesla\u2019s upgrades have included an updated digital instrument panel, a revised touch screen, faster acceleration, activation of Autopilot and the ability for the vehicle to enter and exit a garage without anyone being in the car.\u201cSoftware updates to my Tesla are like Christmas,\u201d said Ankur Pansari of San Francisco. \u201cWhen I get them, I have a new toy to play with.\u201dAnd the automaker can save money. With cars and trucks increasingly reliant on complex computer code to operate, manufacturers can cut costs if they can correct or improve a vehicle\u2019s functions without having to get the car into a dealership.In November 2013, Tesla issued a software update to electronically raise the ground clearance of the Model S after a vehicle\u2019s battery pack caught fire when it ran over an object. A subsequent update gave the driver the ability to change the clearance at will.\u201cSoftware updates are extremely important to me,\u201d said another Tesla owner, Scott Wolf, a software engineer in Naples, Fla. \u201cKnowing there are new features and they can fix the car without having to bring it in \u2014 that\u2019s very impressive for an owner.\u201dFord, which previously provided software updates to its Sync infotainment system using a USB memory stick, will soon send software uploads to deliver Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality to its 2016 models equipped with its Sync 3 infotainment system. CarPlay and Auto replicate certain iPhone and Android smartphone features on the vehicle\u2019s display.Ford delivers the updated software via Wi-Fi, installing it when the vehicle is restarted. The company will eventually switch to making updates via satellite.Sending uploads will enable Ford to reduce the number of versions of its software. Instead of creating baked-in variants for each country, for example, Ford will be able to upload interfaces in different languages.\u201cWe absolutely believe in the promise of software updates,\u201d said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director of connected vehicles.Manufacturers are also looking at software downloads as a new source of revenue, turning on features remotely if the owner pays a fee. It would be similar to the way most new cars come with the hardware for SiriusXM satellite radio but require owners to pay a subscription fee.Tesla has already incorporated fees-for-features into its business model. While late-model Tesla vehicles are equipped with cameras and sensors to enable semiautonomous driving, this feature \u2014 Autopilot \u2014 requires a $3,000 to $3,500 software download to make it work.Owners of the Tesla S60 are also able to increase their vehicle\u2019s range by about 40 miles if they pay Tesla $9,000 to activate the feature through a software download.Other automakers see similar opportunities. \u201cThere are potential situations where one could buy a Ford with a base configuration, and then we could deliver an update for an \u00e0 la carte fee, or on a subscription basis,\u201d said Mr. Butler of Ford.Jason Hughes, a Tesla Model S owner and computer programmer in Hickory, N.C., did not like the speed restrictions and the need to keep his hands on the wheel that Tesla requires when Autopilot is used on the streets.Hacking into the software, Mr. Hughes removed those safeguards. Tesla declined to comment on whether such activity would void an owner\u2019s warranty. But Mr. Hughes runs the risk of having the restrictions restored when the next update is beamed down.A direct communications link between an automaker and its vehicles means the company has the capability not only to upgrade software but to monitor vehicle systems as well. Location, driving style and serviceability can all be tracked.Since May, G.M. has offered its optional Smart Driver technology to the three million customers who own vehicles with 4G wireless capability. The system tracks and analyzes driving characteristics, suggesting ways to improve fuel economy and reduce wear and tear. The company will also suggest that drivers with strong scores seek insurance discounts.Remote software updates will become particularly crucial as vehicles become more capable of driving themselves.\u201cSoftware upgrades will be almost mandatory once we move up to higher forms of autonomous driving,\u201d said Richard Wallace, a director at the Center for Automotive Research. \u201cThe artificial intelligence underpinning self-driving will require constant upgrading to deal with novel situations.\u201dIn the future, vehicle manufacturers might even refuse to assume liability for an autonomous vehicle that causes a crash but whose owner did not bother to accept an upgrade, said Lars Reger, the chief technology officer at NXP Semiconductors, a supplier to the automotive industry.For all the issues and opportunities posed by the upgradeable car, one business consideration might seem crucial for automakers: Will the ability to continually improve features and performance make the idea of buying a new car less enticing?Here, too, the smartphone analogy could prove apt, carmakers say.\u201cUltimately, satisfied customers will want an ongoing relationship with us,\u201d said Mr. Butler of Ford. \u201cAs with an iPhone, at some point the hardware will no longer be upgradeable. It\u2019s part of the world we live in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No matter how universally charming or winning a movie or a performance might seem to be, there is always a chance that somebody, somewhere, will be able to resist it. For all I know that may be the case with \u201cQueen of Katwe,\u201d but if there is anyone out there capable of remaining unmoved by this true-life triumph-of-the-underdog sports story, I don\u2019t think I want to meet that person.Katwe is a poor township outside of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, and it is the hometown of Phiona Mutesi, a chess prodigy played by Madina Nalwanga in her film debut. Phiona lives with three siblings under the watchful, tired eye of their mother, Nakku Harriet (Lupita Nyong\u2019o), who has lost her husband and another child and who scratches out a living selling food on the street. The family never has enough money, and Uganda is depicted as a country of stark inequalities ruled by an unforgiving cash economy. Shelter, schooling, medical treatment and transportation to the hospital after an accident must be paid for up front. Harriet, her mouth a permanent frown, is nearly consumed by worry and fatigue. Her eldest daughter, Night (Taryn Kyaze), has taken up with an unsavory guy on a motorbike. The middle children, Phiona and her younger brother, Brian (Martin Kabanza), scarcely have enough to eat.Chess enters their world thanks to Robert Katende (David Oyelowo), who teaches the game to Katwe\u2019s children as part of a youth ministry. Robert, whose own youth was scarred by poverty and war, has an engineering degree but lacks the connections that would help land him a job working for the government or a private company. He is an inspiring coach \u2014 when Mr. Oyelowo wants to inspire you, you are darn well going to be inspired \u2014 and also a sly and cheerful class warrior. He fast-talks his way into a chess tournament held at a snooty private school, and proudly leads his charges into battle against opponents who are reluctant to shake their hands.\u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d is likely to be embraced by young viewers, and there is nothing here they won\u2019t be able to handle. Adults, meanwhile, can surrender to some old-fashioned melodramatic pleasures, as the busy plot takes in Harriet and Robert\u2019s struggles as well as Phiona\u2019s. But in the end it is Ms. Nalwanga who will rivet all eyes in the way that untrained, naturally charismatic screen performers sometimes can, especially when supported by actors with the technical expertise of Ms. Nyong\u2019o and Mr. Oyelowo.Ms. Nalwanga\u2019s watchful, quiet presence conveys both shyness and determination, a habit of humility in tension with an almost superhuman intelligence. Phiona\u2019s awakening sense of her talent is the engine that drives the main plot of \u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d and also what makes it an affecting character study. When she starts to learn chess, she can barely read, and her growing awareness of the powers of her mind is thrilling to watch. Ms. Nair makes this process as visible, as palpable \u2014 as irresistible \u2014 as any boxing match or soccer game.\u201cQueen of Katwe\u201d is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

{"Headline": "Can Trump Win on Native Soil?", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore setting off on Wednesday to visit Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the president of Mexico, Donald Trump appeared to be making a feint toward equivocation on immigration and trade. But with less than 10 weeks to go before Election Day, a blustering Trump told an expectant audience in Arizona that he wasn\u2019t reneging on his signature promise. After failing to address the issue with Pe\u00f1a Nieto in a serious way \u2014 bringing back nothing concrete and providing no further details \u2014 he blithely told a rally in Phoenix:We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for it.The election still must be won on native ground, though, and all flimflam aside, Trump still faces a narrow Electoral College pathway to 270 votes.The most striking thing about the less than impressive Trump rally in Manchester, N.H., I attended last week was the near complete absence of any of the state\u2019s prominent Republicans.In normal times, you could not keep ambitions politicians away from an opportunity to meet and greet 800-plus voters two weeks ahead of the state primary on Sept. 13, and with Election Day in sight.Other Republicans in tough races in New Hampshire have decided that sticking with Trump is a losing bet in a state that has moved from red to purple. They are keeping him at arm\u2019s length.Facing a tough challenge from Maggie Hassan, the Democratic Governor, Ayotte, who campaigned long and hard for Mitt Romney in 2012, has tried to describe what she calls a \u201cbig distinction.\u201dOn one hand, she said \u201cEveryone gets a vote, I do too.\u201d On the other, \u201can endorsement is when you are campaigning with someone.\u201dWhile this is just the kind of distinction without a difference voters are suspicious of, Ayotte is very clearly not campaigning with Trump.I am going to be doing what\u2019s best for my campaign and the voters who are putting their trust in me. Whatever happens on the campaign trail will be built around that.In contrast \u2014 at least before the latest Clinton foundation revelations \u2014 New Hampshire Democrats were solidly in Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp. The WBUR survey found that 86 percent of Democrats said they would vote for Clinton, while 4 percent would vote for Trump; 8 percent said they would vote for a third-party candidate and one percent said they were undecided.Even more troubling for local Republican candidates is the finding that independent voters favor Clinton over Trump by better than two to one, 49-23.A higher than average share of New Hampshire voters do not align with either party \u2014 pollsters estimate that 15 to 17 percent fall into this category \u2014 and they play a crucial role in determining the outcome of general elections.Democrats, for their part, are doing everything they can to turn Trump into a Republican albatross.New Hampshire, once one of the most reliably Republican states in the nation, began to shift in a Democratic direction in 1992. From 1992 to 2012, Democratic presidential candidates carried the state in every election except 2000. Democratic candidates have also won nine of the last 10 gubernatorial elections, which take place every two years.New Hampshire reflects many of the difficulties facing the Trump campaign.And if you look at New York, you look at Indiana, you look at Pennsylvania, you look at all of them \u2026 they all have one thing in common. No matter where you go, it\u2019s like 40 percent, it\u2019s like 50 percent, 60 percent, jobs are gone.Second, Trump\u2019s Manchester rally itself raises a basic question: Why was the Republican presidential nominee spending valuable time in New Hampshire, a state with a paltry four Electoral College votes? His trip here last Thursday was his second this summer and his fourth since he won big in the state primary in February.Joel Benenson, pollster and strategist for the Clinton campaign, said in a phone interview that New Hampshire reflects the national campaign:The dynamic here is that there is no state where Trump is forcing us to play defense in a state we wouldn\u2019t play in anyway. He is not pushing into our map. States like New Hampshire, he can\u2019t afford to lose, while we have opportunity states, like Virginia, Arizona and North Carolina. Real opportunities to expand the map.Another factor in Trump\u2019s decision to invest a chunk of time in New Hampshire last week is that he has no strong surrogates here to build momentum. With prominent Republicans shunning him, he has to do his own heavy lifting.Voters I talked to in downtown Concord expressed a strong distaste for both candidates, but generally tilted toward Clinton when pressed.A policewoman ticketing cars on North Main Street initially said she did not like either candidate \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m thankful I\u2019m wearing this uniform so I don\u2019t have to answer you.\u201d But as the conversation progressed, she acknowledged that she was almost certain to vote for Clinton. \u201cShe wants to help families, jobs, the middle class. There really is no other choice.\u201d As for Trump, \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word that comes out of his mouth.\u201dJeffery Wells, 51, who told me that he receives annual disability payments of roughly $22,000 for COPD and back trouble, captured the conflicted feelings of some Clinton supporters:Like her, no. But vote for her, yes. She\u2019s much more experienced, she\u2019s been everywhere, she has done a lot for families and children.Bill and Christine White are independent voters who moved to New Hampshire from Massachusetts 15 years ago after they retired. Ms. White, who recalled her support for George McGovern in 1972, said \u201cTrump is the worst candidate I can remember in my life.\u201d Her husband believes that \u201cHillary is just saying everything people want to hear.\u201d Both Whites plan to vote for a third-party candidate so that, as Bill White said, they can \u201cfeel morally right.\u201dThere are orthodox Republicans who do plan to support Trump.They argued that Trump would be more reasonable in the White House than he has been on the campaign trail, and that his experience in business would make him a good chief executive.\u201cHe\u2019s not crazy. You don\u2019t get where he is by being crazy,\u201d said David P. Currier, a former state senator who now is running the Henniker Brewing Company. \u201cHe says a lot of things for effect \u2014 he\u2019s a New Yorker.\u201dBob Nash, a state lobbyist for an insurance agents association, said that he is confident that Trump, once in the White House, would be constrained by the American system of government.\u201cI am a firm believer in the check and balances in our system,\u201d Nash said, adding \u201cTrump is an intelligent man, he\u2019s been a successful man all his life.\u201dNash said he voted for Clinton in the 2008 New Hampshire primary, but that as a veteran he is now firmly opposed to her bid because he believes she mismanaged the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi. \u201cI am absolutely convinced without a shadow of a doubt that she lied to those parents,\u201d he said.Leigh Bosse, 69, who publishes a weekly paper in Hillsborough, N.H., said he was voting for Trump, but with mixed feelings.\u201cI\u2019ve put my foot in my mouth many times, but he does it daily,\u201d Bosse said. \u201cTrump says some good things, but by God\u201d \u2014 Bosse paused to show his exasperation. He said he would vote for Gary Johnson if the Libertarian Party nominee had a chance of winning. But as a practical matter, Bosse said he will vote for Trump in large part because he finds Clinton anathema: \u201cI can\u2019t believe Hillary hasn\u2019t been indicted.\u201dTrump\u2019s uphill fight to win New Hampshire is likely to be made steeper by the Union Leader, the dominant paper in the state.Trump has shown himself to be a crude blowhard with no clear political philosophy and no deeper understanding of the important and serious role of President of the United States than one of the goons he lets rough up protesters in his crowds.The Trump-McQuaid dust-up illuminates some of the most important dilemmas facing the Trump campaign.Rothwell analyzed geographic and demographic characteristics of 87,428 adults asked in Gallup Daily Tracking surveys in July if they had favorable or unfavorable views of Trump.Rothwell found thatTrump\u2019s supporters are older, with higher household incomes, are more likely to be male, white non-Hispanic, less likely to identify as LGBTQ, less likely to hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher education, more likely to be a veteran or family member of a veteran, more likely to work in a blue-collar occupation, and are more likely to be Christian and report that religion is important to them.In addition, racial isolation increases the likelihood of Trump support:People living in ZIP codes with disproportionately high shares of white residents are significantly and robustly more likely to view Trump favorably.Trump\u2019s problem, in New Hampshire and elsewhere, is that his pockets of strength are not substantial enough to produce majorities. In the huge Gallup sample, 65 percent reported unfavorable views of Trump.The funny thing is that what would make a Trump victory most plausible is just the kind of un-American activity he has been campaigning against \u2014 in this case, a multiparty parliamentary system. For good or ill, many European electoral systems foster, rather than suffocate, candidates who can\u2019t win majorities but who have a shot at winning a plurality.It\u2019s not the kind of country Trump would want to live in, but it\u2019s the kind of country that might elect him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scenes From New England\u2019s Drought: Dry Wells, Dead Fish and Ailing Farms", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCENTER CONWAY, N.H. \u2014 The Saco River flows lazily here, from New Hampshire into Maine, ridged with sandy banks and lush forests, luring eager families in canoes and rowdy flotillas of young adults.But after a hot, dry summer, a 10-mile canoe trip to Fryeburg, Me., from Center Conway, N.H., this month was interrupted, time and again, by the scrape of boat on sandy riverbed, and the grudging acceptance that the only way to get the canoe across certain stretches of shallow river would be to drag it.The low river is one of countless signs of dry weather that has settled over much of New England. Conditions are even worse south of the Saco, with the United States Drought Monitor observing \u201cextreme drought\u201d conditions in much of the eastern half of Massachusetts, southeastern New Hampshire and the southern part of Maine.Some private wells have dried up. Farmers face millions of dollars in lost crops, and federal agricultural officials have declared much of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut a natural disaster area. Parts of rivers have withered into a series of ponds or wide stretches of stone, harming the ecosystems that depend on them. Bears and other wild animals are venturing into human habitats in search of food because there is little in their own.\u201cWe are not used to this in New England,\u201d said Maggie Hassan, the Democratic governor of New Hampshire. Officials in her state and in Massachusetts have issued dire warnings, urging an end to outdoor watering. Many cities and towns have issued restrictions, although not all are mandatory.Some rain is forecast this week, but the dry summer has taken its toll. A trip through the affected area shows how the region is coping with a dry spell that climatologists say is not expected to fully abate before the end of the year.Ms. Moore said she did not have the money to dig a new one. So she has lived without running water for more than a month, subsisting on the good will of friends and neighbors. She has perfected a series of small rituals to help her get by.\u201cYou get up. You boil water in the microwave to take your sink bath. You sometimes want to save that water to use it to flush it in the toilet,\u201d said Ms. Moore, who keeps antibacterial hand wipes by the sink and gives her laundry to her nephew.\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to learn to live this way until God gives us rain.\u201dKingston, a town of about 6,000 in this parched stretch of southeastern New Hampshire, has no public water supply. Residents who rely on private wells are strongly encouraged to conserve, but the town\u2019s selectmen, in a state that places a premium on individual rights, have not instituted a mandatory ban.The town has a spigot outside the fire station for families who no longer have running water. No one is tracking how many people use it, but over an hour on Wednesday night, three people came.Harry Fairbrother, 53, an engineer, filled a 330-gallon tank that he hooks up to his home. Samuel Mauro, 33, a toy salesman, filled up a few one-gallon water jugs. And Sherri Todd, 63, a cancer survivor with three jobs, filled up plastic buckets for the toilet, and big plastic bottles for drinking.\u201cTomorrow will be three weeks\u201d without water, Ms. Todd said, running her hands through her hair. \u201cI just came from my friend\u2019s house to shower, it felt so good.\u201dMr. Smith, 55, typically feeds roughly 160 cows with hay and corn from his fields. The corn has grown, but his hayfields \u2014 so dry \u201cit sounds like you\u2019re walking in potato chips,\u201d he said \u2014 have produced a small fraction of what he needs to get through the winter, and he guesses he will need to spend $300 or $400 per day on feed.\u201cThe expense of that is just astronomical,\u201d said Mr. Smith, who said he would consider selling some cows if he had to.Nineteen of New Hampshire\u2019s 120 dairy farms have already gone out of business this year, mostly because of low milk prices, and the drought has made it harder for those that survive.\u201cI know that there are several more farms that are kind of on the edge of the cliff right now,\u201d the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, Lorraine Merrill, said.Ms. Kippin, 75, is a retired microbiologist who ran the water system in this old coastal town from 1988 to 2008. She is the president of the Ipswich Garden Club, and when the town banned outdoor watering this summer, Ms. Kippin had a problem.\u201cI am in conflict as to whether I water my garden, or, if I\u2019m a responsible citizen, conserve water,\u201d Ms. Kippin said, but she decided she had to set an example.\u201cI had to let my garden go,\u201d Ms. Kippin said.Last summer, Ms. Kippin had blankets of black-eyed Susans, billowing hydrangeas and an English-style tumble of tall flowers along the edge of the lawn.This year, most of those flowers are crunchy dead heads. Her 30-foot cherry tree is dying. There are no azaleas to speak of.\u201cMost importantly was my rare, South African, blood-red rhododendron that I\u2019ve had in the ground for 45 years,\u201d Ms. Kippin said. It died.There is no flow over the dam near downtown Ipswich, and much of the riverbed below is exposed, a ribbon of dry rocks and brittle plants mottled with standing pools.\u201cThe river\u2019s now just a series of ponds and puddles,\u201d said Wayne Castonguay, the executive director of the Ipswich River Watershed Association, which measured record low flows in the river all summer.\u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cVirtually all the larger fish in the river have died.\u201d He added that he had counted 1,000 dead fish in a tributary this summer.Upriver, a popular canoeing area is now a pool of standing water \u2014 though outfitters say paddling is still possible on some stretches \u2014 with exposed, sandy riverbanks and empty shells of mussels that have long since died.\u201cFor people, there\u2019s less water to use and the water is of poorer quality,\u201d Mr. Castonguay said, adding that better conservation might have kept the river flowing.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that yellowish-brown,\u201d Bob Allen, an arborist, said. \u201cIt should be more of a vibrant reddish-orange.\u201dMr. Allen is in charge of vegetation management at Eversource, the local power company, whose crews are looking for drought-weakened trees as they trim branches around power lines. He pulled over next to a sweet birch tree, and looked at its pale green leaves, ringed with dry brown.\u201cThese leaves are showing a scorching effect from the drought,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really been able to be their full self this year, because of lack of water.\u201dFall foliage is a boon to New England\u2019s tourism economy, and while many trees are free of leaf-scorch, any hint of trouble with foliage brings economic anxiety. And drought-weakened trees are more likely to topple during storms, Mr. Allen said.\u201cThis year was three months, basically all summer long with no rain, and it caught us off guard,\u201d said Chris Kurth, the owner, during an interview at a farmer\u2019s market in Boston. \u201cAll told, we\u2019re looking at about a 50 percent crop loss.\u201dIn August, farmers in the state reported $13.6 million in lost crops since April; that number has most likely grown.Some crops, however, have done fairly well, and both farms\u2019 vibrant stands belie the challenge: At the Drumlin Farm, spinach, watermelon and winter squash did well, while tomatoes did well at Siena Farms.Some fields at Siena Farms sit empty because there is no way to irrigate and there is uncertainty about the forecast. Mr. Kurth is planning to scale back his planting next year, and he has taken the unusual step of asking his regular customers to contribute more to help the farm if they can.\u201cPlants have an amazing ability to survive in extreme conditions and not just give up and die,\u201d Mr. Kurth said. \u201cHopefully, us farmers have the same strength in us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John R. Coleman, Haverford President Who Explored Blue-Collar Life, Dies at 95", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn R. Coleman, a labor economist who as president of Haverford College in Pennsylvania became a national folk hero when, on sabbatical leave, he took a series of low-wage jobs and wrote about the experience in his book \u201cBlue-Collar Journal,\u201d died on Tuesday in Washington. He was 95.The cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease, his grandson William Coleman said.Mr. Coleman, known as Jack, became Haverford College\u2019s first non-Quaker leader when he was appointed president in 1967. In a period of student unrest and political activism across the United States, he emerged as a strong liberal voice, especially in his opposition to the Vietnam War. In 1969 he enlisted 78 other college presidents to sign a statement addressed to President Richard M. Nixon calling for an accelerated timetable for withdrawal from the conflict.While at Haverford, disturbed by the gulf between academic life and the world of manual labor, he took time off and worked, incognito, as a farm laborer, a ditch digger, a garbage man and a cook, keeping a diary. It evolved into \u201cBlue-Collar Journal: A College President\u2019s Sabbatical.\u201dA kind of precursor to Barbara Ehrenreich\u2019s 2001 book \u201cNickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America,\u201d \u201cBlue-Collar Journal\u201d was published in 1974 to enthusiastic reviews and made him a popular interview subject for print and television journalists.In his abbreviated career as a blue-collar worker, he concluded that academia was not quite as artificial as he had thought and manual labor not nearly as satisfying. Jobs, whether mental or physical, he decided, had \u201cfrustrations, joys, pains and dreams in just about the same mixture.\u201dThe book was made into a television movie, \u201cThe Secret Life of John Chapman,\u201d broadcast on CBS in 1976. Ralph Waite (John Walton Sr. on \u201cThe Waltons\u201d) played Mr. Coleman.\u201cI wanted to get away from the world of words and politics and parties \u2014 the things a college president does,\u201d Mr. Coleman told The New York Times in 1973. \u201cAs a college president you begin to take yourself very seriously and think you have power you don\u2019t. You forget elementary things about people. I wanted to relearn things I\u2019d forgotten.\u201dJohn Royston Coleman was born on June 24, 1921, in Copper Cliff, Ontario. His father, Richard, was a superintendent at a smelter operated by the mining company Inco. His mother, the former Mary Lawson, was a homemaker.After earning an economics degree in 1943 from Victoria University, part of the University of Toronto, he served with the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II, attaining the rank of commander.Soon after completing officers\u2019 school, he married Mary Norrington Irwin. The marriage ended in divorce, as did a second marriage. In addition to his grandson William, he is survived by two sons, John and Stephen; a daughter, Nancy Coleman; and six other grandchildren.He pursued graduate studies in labor economics at the University of Chicago, where he received a master\u2019s degree in 1949, and a doctorate in 1950, writing a dissertation on collective bargaining.After leaving Chicago, he taught economics and labor relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he became friends with George P. Shultz, later secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan. He and Mr. Shultz, an economist by training, collaborated on the book \u201cLabor Problems: Cases and Readings\u201d (1953).Mr. Coleman\u2019s other books include \u201cGoals and Strategy in Collective Bargaining\u201d (1951), written with Frederick H. Harbison, \u201cThe Changing American Economy\u201d (1967) and \u201cComparative Economic Systems: An Inquiry Approach\u201d (1968).In 1955 Mr. Coleman became chairman of the economics department at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie-Mellon University), where he later served as dean of the division of humanities and social sciences. His gifts as a lecturer led to the job of host of \u201cMoney Talks,\u201d a five-part series on CBS in 1962 in which he explained such basic concepts as gross national product and the Consumer Price Index.A year later, for the CBS project \u201cCollege of the Air,\u201d he taught an experimental course, \u201cThe American Economy,\u201d that was carried on 241 affiliate stations and 54 educational channels.In 1965 the Ford Foundation, for which he had done consulting work in New Delhi during a sabbatical, hired him as a director of economic development and administration. He was later its program officer for social development.While traveling around the country raising money for the school, Mr. Coleman collected want ads from local newspapers and, as part of his secret plan, applied for work. \u201cThere\u2019s a restlessness in me, a desire to walk in other people\u2019s shoes,\u201d he told The Associated Press in 1987.He dug ditches for sewer and water lines in Atlanta, picking up a rich new vocabulary of curse words; hauled trash in College Park, Md.; and made salads and sandwiches at the Union Oyster House in Boston, where his talent won him an offer to become assistant chef.His work schedule was compromised by his duties as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia, which held monthly meetings, requiring him to serve notice to his employers.In 1986 he opened a bed-and-breakfast, the Inn at Long Last in Chester, Vt., where he served as host and breakfast cook. He later ran a small local weekly, The Black River Tribune, and served as a justice of the peace, presiding over one of the first same-sex civil unions in Vermont in 2000.Mr. Coleman lost the battle but won the war at Haverford. In 1980, three years after he left, the school became coed and awarded him an honorary doctorate. Catherine Koshland, one of 39 women admitted to Haverford in 1969 as transfer students under a program he started, and who later became the chairwoman of the college\u2019s board of managers, told the college website, \u201cAlthough he was no longer the president, coeducation is perhaps Jack\u2019s most significant legacy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fast Response to \u2018Brexit\u2019 News: A Pop-Up Paper Finds Success in Britain", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe morning after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Matt Kelly ducked into a coffee shop on a graffiti-lined street in the trendy East London neighborhood of Shoreditch.The clientele lining up for their lattes, normally silent and aloof, had been drawn into an animated discussion about the vote and its consequences. The mostly 20- and 30-somethings, some from a variety of technology start-ups clustered nearby, seemed united in their dismay over the results.The New European, published by Archant, is part of a broad experimentation taking place in print.As publishers large and small struggle at a time of rapid digital transition, print is a costly challenge for the industry. In recent years, many large publishers have opted to scale back or exit print altogether. Others have tried to bolster its allure by packaging print with digital offerings, or using print to showcase exclusive content.Some midsize publishers have focused on portfolios of smaller-scale titles that can be produced using the same infrastructure of presses, distribution and marketing networks. Those economies of scale can significantly reduce the marginal costs \u2014 and the risks \u2014 of developing new print products.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Archant had the size and distribution network \u2014 it is Britain\u2019s fifth-largest regional newspaper publisher by revenue and by circulation \u2014 and staff.So it decided to experiment with what it calls pop-up publishing.By keeping its start-up costs low and its ambitions modest, The New European has thus far managed to avoid the fate of some prominent failures in the British newspaper market.Both experiments, aimed at general-interest audiences, failed to capture enough demand from readers and advertisers to justify their publishers\u2019 relatively modest initial investments.By contrast, The New European was conceived as a niche publication. The publisher targeted the 48 percent of Britons who voted on June 23 to stay in the European Union \u2014 a potential audience that included about 16 million like-minded readers. Since it was meant to be short-lived, Archant avoided spending huge sums on market research or publicity campaigns.\u201cWe never set out to actually create a long-term brand,\u201d said Jeff Henry, Archant\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe way we structured it was to make money on a four-week run.\u201dThe first edition, priced at 2 pounds, or about $2.65, sold more than 40,000 copies in Britain and generated significant social media attention as readers rushed to share images of their papers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Its front pages promote meaty essays by well-known British intellectuals, politicians and business leaders. The articles themselves are mixed with cartoons, infographics and lighter features on European sports, travel and culture.Archant\u2019s business plan for the newspaper is driven principally by cover sales. In the last few weeks, it has extended its newsstand presence to Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and Switzerland.While the company hopes that broader reach will increase The New European\u2019s appeal to advertisers, the publication\u2019s open-ended future \u2014 Archant commits to only four issues at a time \u2014 has made it a difficult sell with some companies interested in longer campaigns.In late August, Archant also experimented with an online auction for some of its premium ad space. But while more than 60 British and European companies participated, the bidding failed to generate significant additional revenue, the company said.Industry watchers have nevertheless been encouraged by The New European\u2019s staying power.\u201cThe New European has absolutely shown a way forward for print publishers to sample whether a new product works,\u201d said Steve Dyson, a media consultant in Birmingham. Mr. Dyson said he could envision successful pop-up titles linked to popular political or social movements, or major sporting events like last month\u2019s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.Its fervently pro-independence stance found an audience of as many as 60,000 daily readers, although that number has since dwindled to around 15,000. Still, subscription and newsstand sales are enough to sustain a small dedicated staff as well as a website that, in addition to Scottish politics, offers sports, culture and international news.The success of The New European suggests that, for all the industry\u2019s evangelizing about the need to embrace a digital future, publishers have yet to exhaust the possibilities of print.\u201cIt\u2019s very counterintuitive, but print can sometimes be more agile than digital,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cIf you are a newspaper business and already have a distribution mechanism and a team of designers, it is actually a very simple process, whereas if you want to do a bespoke digital product, that is much more involved.\u201dMoreover, \u201cprint is a very visible format,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go around London with your laptop open and say, \u2018Look at me, I\u2019m reading The New European.\u2019\u201dSo far, The New European, like the rest of Britain\u2019s newspaper industry, has managed to ride a wave of demand for news about the so-called Brexit, which could fade in the coming months as the initial shock of the vote wears off.Negotiations over Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union could drag on for years, Mr. Tjaardstra noted, and to remain relevant to its niche audience, The New European would eventually need to broaden its coverage to include other topics of interest.That\u2019s if it continues at all.Mr. Kelly insists that Archant holds \u201cno sort of sentimental attachment\u201d to The New European as a brand.\u201cIt needs to earn its keep,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole point of pop-up is that you are prepared to kill the product.\u201dFollow Nicola Clark on Twitter @_nicolaclark.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opposition Figure\u2019s Rise Could Pave Way for Female Leaders in Japan", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Among democracies in the developed world, Japan has one of the worst records of putting women in positions of political power.Yet if, as widely predicted, Renho Murata, a member of the upper house of Parliament, prevails in a leadership contest on Thursday and becomes the first woman to lead the opposition Democratic Party, she will be the third woman to assume a high-profile political post in Japan in less than two months.In July, Tokyo elected its first female governor, Yuriko Koike, and last month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appointed Japan\u2019s second female defense minister, Tomomi Inada. (Ms. Koike was the first.) Both are members of Mr. Abe\u2019s conservative party, the Liberal Democrats.A victory by Ms. Murata, 48, a former model and television news announcer who has served in Parliament for more than a decade, would hardly usher in an era of female dominance. Women still represent less than 15 percent of all seats in Parliament, and Mr. Abe was forced to concede last year that his government would not achieve its goal of placing women in 30 percent of management roles by 2020.Still, with three women in positions that could be steppingstones to the prime minister\u2019s office, it would be a noteworthy moment for Japan, which is far behind nations like South Korea, Taiwan, Britain and Germany, which have elected female leaders, and the United States, which has its first female major party candidate for president.Some analysts in Japan say elevating more women to leadership positions is long overdue.Japan has experienced such watershed moments before. Nearly 30 years ago, the Socialist Party, then Japan\u2019s largest opposition party, elected Takako Doi as its first female leader. Ms. Doi helped bring more women into Parliament, leading pundits to proclaim a \u201cMadonna Boom.\u201d But the trend did not last.Given this track record, Ms. Taniguchi said she was wary about predicting more progress. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being happy about \u2018the first woman something\u2019 forever,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I still welcome it if it will bring momentum for a new women\u2019s era.\u201dPolitical experts say that it has been difficult for women to gain traction in Japan because they have often been at the mercy of men who make token gestures of support but fail to follow up in the long run.\u201cUnless the political will is there to mentor the women who are already there,\u201d measures to promote women tend to be \u201cone-off,\u201d said Emma Dalton, a lecturer in Japanese at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cThe key problem is, people at the top are still men. So Renho becoming leader of the party will be quite significant if it happens.\u201dMs. Murata, who goes simply by the name Renho, is a member of the reformist wing of the left-of-center Democratic Party that favors cutting wasteful public projects. In campaigning to take the helm of the party, a combination of the legacy Democratic Party that dates from the 1990s and Ishin no To, another opposition party, she has not been shy about emphasizing that her election would make history.As of Wednesday, Ms. Murata had the support of nearly half the Democratic Party members in the Diet, as Japan\u2019s Parliament is known. She is running against two men: Seiji Maehara, a former leader of the party who served in cabinet positions during the party\u2019s brief stint in power from 2009 to 2012, and Yuichiro Tamaki, a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat who was elected to the Diet in 2009.Ms. Murata has assumed the lead in the race despite a haze of controversy that has dogged her because she is partly of Taiwanese heritage. Though she was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and a Taiwanese father, and grew up there, she was classified a citizen of Taiwan because Japan only granted citizenship to children with Japanese fathers at the time.She received Japanese citizenship in 1985, at the age of 17, when the law was changed. But she did not formally renounce her Taiwan citizenship, and nationalist critics have accused her of duplicity and disloyalty because Japanese law prohibits dual citizenship.Ms. Murata at first said that she had relinquished her Taiwan citizenship as a teenager.

{"Headline": "Who Hates Free Trade Treaties? Surprisingly, Not Voters", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Few issues in this campaign cycle seem as toxic as trade: Both major-party presidential candidates oppose President Obama\u2019s 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, and congressional leaders, having refused all year to vote on the trade accord until after the election, say they will not do so even then \u2014 potentially killing the largest regional trade pact in history.So that must mean voters are overwhelmingly opposed, right? Wrong.National polls continue to show that Americans either narrowly favor international trade generally, and the so-called T.P.P. specifically, or are split. Younger voters are especially favorable. But Republicans are not, reflecting the influence of the anti-trade nominee Donald J. Trump on his traditionally pro-trade party. And certainly trade remains more unpopular in battleground states like Ohio, where it is blamed for years of manufacturing job losses.Yet the level of support for trade agreements in general, and the pending Pacific pact in particular, stands in notable contrast to the toxicity of trade in an election season largely defined by anger among working-class voters. What matters to many politicians, however, is the fact that the opponents are the ones most motivated to vote based on the issue \u2014 just as they are on issues like immigration and gun restrictions that also have more support than divisive debates suggest.\u201cAt a very basic level they know it\u2019s a necessary thing for the United States to trade with other countries \u2014 that is clear as a bell throughout all the polling,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. But when asked about trade\u2019s impact on jobs, \u201cpeople are more inclined to think it\u2019s more of a negative than a positive.\u201dOn his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.Mr. Trump has had a measurable negative impact, the research center said. In a Pew poll a month before Mr. Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015, Republicans, by 51 to 39 percent, said trade accords had been good for the nation. By last month, after Mr. Trump was nominated, Republicans, by 61 to 32 percent, called past agreements a bad thing, a flip that has not been lost on Congress\u2019s Republican leaders.Democrats\u2019 views are little changed. Among registered voters surveyed by Pew, 55 percent of supporters of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said the Pacific pact would be a good thing (58 percent of Trump supporters said the opposite). And while Mrs. Clinton, under pressure from her anti-trade pact Democratic primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, came out in opposition to the T.P.P. in October, a Pew survey in March found that even 55 percent of Sanders supporters said trade agreements had been good for the country.\u201cThe public rates past trade agreements more positively than not, though many are unsure and few hold strong opinions,\u201d said a memo on the poll by Democracy Corps, a liberal nonprofit founded by the Democratic strategists Stanley Greenberg and James Carville.As for the T.P.P. specifically, 56 percent of voters were either unfamiliar with it or neutral, the group said. To build opposition, Democracy Corps recommended that opponents link the agreement to the influence over government by corporations and \u201cbig money.\u201dAmong the groups most supportive of trade are younger and highly educated voters.But strategists in both parties say those who are more supportive of trade are less likely to vote on that issue than are the opponents.He added: \u201cThose who support free trade are more \u2018lukewarm.\u2019 For them it\u2019s not a voting issue.\u201dAlluding to Mr. Obama\u2019s arguments that approving the T.P.P. is crucial for American influence in the Asia-Pacific region, Mr. Garin added: \u201cMost people don\u2019t really live in the world of geopolitics, and don\u2019t think very much about China\u2019s influence in the Pacific relative to our influence in the Pacific. But they do think about jobs and wages and whether corporations can be trusted to use these trade agreements for the greater benefit of the American people.\u201dPresidents do worry about geopolitics, and that alone could keep the Pacific deal alive. On Friday, after Mr. Obama met with business leaders and elected officials to coordinate their uphill campaign for the accord, the mayor of Atlanta, Kasim Reed, told reporters, \u201cPeople who run for office often campaign against trade, but people who become president of the United States end up supporting trade.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget Trump\u2019s Wall: For Mexico, the Election Is About Nafta", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOLUCA, Mexico \u2014 In this industrial city near the Mexican capital, workers gather outside the gates of a sprawling Chrysler plant for a late shift assembling Dodge Journey S.U.V.s. It\u2019s a sought-after job, with autoworkers in Mexico earning an average of about $5 an hour, compared with the nation\u2019s minimum wage of less than $4 for the whole day. Yet it is a fifth of what autoworkers make in Detroit, and that has helped Mexico become a global powerhouse in car production. The finished products can be seen in the parking lot: thousands of shiny new S.U.V.s, black, white, silver, red, waiting to be shipped around the planet, particularly to the United States, where Americans bought 100,000 Journeys last year.Scenes like this are at the heart of the populist, anti-trade rage driving Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. His central promise: to rewrite or scrap the 22-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blames for sending countless jobs overseas.How these attacks on trade translate into policy is one of the most important questions to come out of this election. The Nafta-bashing rattles Mexican businesses in a nation that has built its economy on the accord and depends on commerce with its northern neighbor for a third of its income. Last year, Mexico exported $316 billion worth of goods and services to the United States, a sizable chunk of the country\u2019s gross domestic product of $1.1 trillion. Amid the election, some companies have delayed related investments, a Mexican financial newspaper reported. And when Mr. Trump goes up in the polls, Mexico\u2019s peso sinks in value.In July, the polling company Buend\u00eda y Laredo asked Mexicans if they would like to leave Nafta altogether. A solid 52 percent said they were against a \u201cMexit\u201d from the trade bloc, but it was significant that 33 percent said they favored an out, despite how many jobs depended on it. The survey showed similar attitudes to those in Britain toward the European Union; those with the least education were the most against Nafta; college students were the most in favor.Nafta politics are as complex south of the border as they are in the north. Its advocates see it as a cornerstone of Mexico\u2019s opening to the world; its detractors, as a neoliberal tool of imperialist gringos. Some credit it \u2014 or blame it \u2014 for most of what has happened here over the last two decades, from the country\u2019s moving to a multiparty democracy, to millions trekking to El Norte, to violent drug gangs ravaging border towns.With the United States economy 10 times the size of Mexico\u2019s, the effects of Nafta are far greater on this side of the river. It has physically reshaped Mexico\u2019s landscape, from its growing industrial cities to its emptying farming villages. It rocket-boosted trade between the countries, from $104 billion in 1994 to $583 billion last year, representing everything from sparkplugs to airplanes to Christmas trees. Thanks to Nafta, Mexico has become the biggest carmaker in Latin America, overtaking Brazil in 2014.But despite these gains, the Mexican economy is sluggish compared with that of developing countries such as India and China. It has grown by an average of 2.5 percent a year since Nafta, a similar level to the decade before it, and below that of the boom years of the 1960s.Holding a magnifying glass to Nafta reveals other nuances. Mr. Trump likes to point out that Mexico sells more than it buys from the United States, by $58 billion last year. But many of the companies exporting from Mexico are American-owned, so much of the profit goes back north. Chrysler opened its factory in Toluca all the way back in 1968, aiming for the Mexican market, then invested $1 billion more in it in 2006 when it had access to American car buyers. And while American corn does flow south, Mexico exported more farm goods to the United States than it imported last year. Small farmers here may be losing out as much to large Mexican ranches as they are to American agribusiness, especially those small farmers harvesting the millions of avocados that Americans scarf up in their game-day guacamole.These nuances illustrate how interconnected the North American economy has become, and how difficult rewriting Nafta would be. Perhaps politicians will use the opportunity to add provisions on labor and the environment to the agreement, a longstanding demand by critics that could have a positive impact. But a major renegotiation that would satisfy the autoworkers, small farmers and other aggrieved groups in both countries would be a herculean task \u2014 assuming the next American president really goes there, whatever he or she promises at election time.Ioan Grillo is the author of \u201cGangster Warlords: Drug Dollars, Killing Fields and the New Politics of Latin America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Uber Drivers Decide How Long to Work", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ride-hailing company Uber is best known for upending the taxi industry. Now it may be making waves in the economics profession as well.For nearly 20 years, economists have been debating how cabdrivers decide when to call it a day. This may seem like a trivial question, but it is one that cuts to the heart of whether humans are fundamentally rational \u2014 in this case, whether they earn their incomes efficiently \u2014 as the discipline has traditionally assumed.In one camp is a group of so-called behavioral economists who have found evidence that many taxi drivers work longer hours on days when business is slow and shorter hours when business is brisk \u2014 the opposite of what economic rationality, to say nothing of common sense, would seem to dictate.In another camp is a group of more orthodox economists who argue that this perverse habit is largely an illusion in the eyes of certain researchers. Once you consult more precise numbers, they argue, you find that drivers typically work longer hours when it is in their financial interest to do so.The question has implications for other workers, like farmers and small business owners. And it has taken on added importance as the so-called gig economy grows, leaving more people in the position of deciding how many tasks to perform each day, from furniture assembly to tagging photos.Over all, there was little evidence that drivers were driving less when they could make more per hour than usual. But that was not true for a large portion of new drivers. Many of these drivers appeared to have an income goal in mind and stopped when they were near it, causing them to knock off sooner when their hourly wage was high and to work longer when their wage was low.(The hourly wage of cabdrivers typically reflects how busy they are; the rate they can charge doesn\u2019t change unexpectedly. For Uber drivers, the hourly wage reflects both busyness and rates, since Uber can increase prices when demand is high.)\u201cA substantial, although not most, fraction of partners do in fact come into the market with income targeting behavior,\u201d the paper\u2019s author, Michael Sheldon, an Uber data scientist, wrote. The behavior is then \u201crather quickly learned away in favor of more optimal decision making.\u201dIn effect, Mr. Sheldon was saying, the generally rational beings that most economists presume to exist are made, not born \u2014 at least as far as their Uber driving is concerned.The Uber evidence does highlight some points on which both sides of the debate already agreed, like the idea that drivers get better at wringing more money out of the hours they work as they gain experience.Professor Camerer and Richard Thaler, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the original paper, also posit a middle-ground position for which there is broader support: It may be that cabdrivers and other workers set goals like an income target and just are not fanatical about hitting them. They may simply ignore the target when their hourly wage lurches beyond a certain amount in one direction or the other.Still, the question of whether many drivers hew closely enough to an income target that they tend to work longer hours when driving pays less than usual, and shorter hours when it pays more, opened a crucial divide.The conventional view is that while people may fall short of what economics textbooks recommend, sometimes far short when they are just starting off at farming or repairing refrigerators or driving a cab, they usually do not act in the opposite of their self-interest, which is what sticking with an income target would cause them to do.The behavioralists, by contrast, have been much more open to this possibility, although they have moderated their views on the extent to which drivers do this.By finding evidence that many people defer to such an income target, if only until they gain more experience, the Uber study appears to have brought Professor Camerer and his co-authors a small measure of vindication after years of skepticism from fellow economists.(Other studies have affirmed the original paper\u2019s finding, but many relied on relatively crude data and were thus also vulnerable to criticism.)Professor Camerer noted that the Uber example is a special case that might not apply to all drivers, but that other drivers might be even more likely to fall back on an income target because they had less information about what they could earn if they kept driving.Professor Farber, for his part, proclaimed the Uber finding \u201cinteresting\u201d and said that \u201cfor the new drivers, it might mean that without information and a lot of experience, they use rules of thumb.\u201dStill, he said he did not find it particularly disturbing intellectually that many new Uber drivers would rely on counterproductive rules, and even less so if a portion of these drivers used the platform to earn extra income that they did not need to support themselves.\u201cI think I\u2019m coming around to the belief that people tend to leave money on the table when there\u2019s no question of survival, or market forces pushing them toward getting that money,\u201d Professor Farber said. He wanted to withhold final judgment pending more data and analysis. Uber generally does not make its data publicly available for proprietary reasons.As for Mr. Sheldon, the Uber paper\u2019s author, he attributed his finding to the adventurous nature of many Uber drivers, who were open to running headlong into unfamiliar territory. It\u2019s the sheer unfamiliarity of the Uber driving experience, he speculated, that may explain the initial bout of economically irrational behavior.Mr. Sheldon was less open to the idea that people who did not depend on Uber for their livelihood helped account for his finding. So far as Uber can tell from other research, he said, those who drive irregularly respond more to fare increases than more regular drivers, at any level of earnings.Whatever the case, the result seems to have one very obvious implication: Anyone trying to make it in the gig economy should probably pick a favorite platform or two and stick with them rather than constantly jump around from one type of gig to another.\u201cGreater experience is a win for the partners and the platform itself,\u201d said Mr. Sheldon. \u201cWe definitely want to keep these individuals engaged with the platform until they learn how to do it the best way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Airgas Was Finally Sold, for $10 Billion Instead of $5 Billion", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig shareholders do not always play nice.They strip away founders\u2019 responsibilities. They side with activist hedge funds. They vote for takeovers even when a board is resisting.Those are the types of shareholders that Peter McCausland encountered toward the end of his three-decade reign at the industrial gas distributor Airgas. By 2015, he could not take it anymore. He searched globally for a buyer.\u201cThe whole system is rigged toward transactions and turnover,\u201d Mr. McCausland said in a recent interview about the contentious battle for his company.\u201cI was spending a lot of time finding a buyer for a company that I didn\u2019t really want to sell,\u201d Mr. McCausland, 66, said.Sell he did. Air Liquide, based in Paris, acquired Airgas in May for $143 a share in a deal worth more than $10 billion. That was double the final bid of $70 a share that another company, Air Products & Chemicals, offered six years ago in one of the most bitterly fought hostile takeover battles.Mr. McCausland\u2019s critics had said he was too \u201centrenched\u201d in rejecting Air Products\u2019 proposals, but in the end, he sold for twice the value.Wall Street law firms now hold up Airgas as one of the best arguments for management\u2019s right to defend its company. Business schools around the country are seeking to turn the tale into a case study.In an unusually candid interview at his 450-acre property about 15 miles northwest of Philadelphia, Mr. McCausland explained what it was like to run a big, public company and how he decided to sell it.Mr. McCausland does not look like a corporate revolutionary. Known for his affinity for bow ties, he now wears a pink dress shirt, khakis and no socks in retirement.He lives in Florida but spends much of his time on his farm, just 10 miles away from Airgas\u2019s headquarters in Radnor, Pa. His wife, Bonnie, and son and daughter, both in their 30s, help tend to the dozens of sheep, horses and exotic cows with markings that resemble panda bears\u2019 on the estate.Among his first purchases was a company called Wolverine Gas Products, partly owned by Air Products. As part of the deal, Air Products would supply the gas, and Mr. McCausland\u2019s company would buy it in bulk, put the gas into cylinders and deliver those to customers.Soon after, Air Products started circumventing the contract by pushing up prices, Mr. McCausland said. In turn, Mr. McCausland built two air-separation plants to \u201csend them a warning.\u201d The tension heightened after Airgas bought Air Products\u2019 struggling packaged gas business in 2002 and managed to quickly turn it around.Air Products, which is based in Allentown, Pa., declined to comment for this article.The clash between the two Pennsylvania-based industrial gas foes peaked in the summer of 2009, when Mr. McCausland received a call from the chief executive of Air Products, who wanted to buy Airgas.\u201cBy going hostile, you end up accentuating whatever bad blood was already there,\u201d said Michael Harrison, a chemicals analyst with Seaport Global Securities, a brokerage firm.Airgas had two major defenses in its bylaws. The first was a so-called poison pill, which prevented anyone from acquiring more than 15 percent of the company without the directors\u2019 approval.Airgas also had a staggered board, meaning that only three directors (out of 11) were eligible for election each year. That meant Air Products needed to neutralize the pill by obtaining a majority of the board. And to achieve a majority of the board quickly, it needed to find a way to move Airgas\u2019s annual meetings closer together.Air Products asked Airgas shareholders to vote to move the annual meeting to January from September, so Air Products could nominate six directors in a four-month window.Mr. McCausland pleaded with shareholders to take his side, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. A majority of Airgas investors voted Mr. McCausland and two others off the board, replacing them with Air Products\u2019 nominees. Shareholders also voted to move up the next annual meeting.The two companies battled it out in Delaware Chancery Court in a case Mr. McCausland\u2019s lawyers gave him a slim chance of winning. At the same time, Air Products continued to increase its offer price.Despite the long odds, Mr. McCausland prevailed, by winning on appeal at the Delaware Supreme Court. The case preserved the ability of companies to defend themselves against hostile takeovers, without input from shareholders.The ruling was \u2014 and remains \u2014 controversial.\u201cThe court\u2019s case allowing the indefinite use of the poison pill for this purpose established an unfortunate precedent,\u201d said Lucian A. Bebchuk, director for the Program on Corporate Governance at Harvard Law School. \u201cThere is significant empirical evidence indicating that, on the whole, the current expansive use of takeover defenses is detrimental to the interests of shareholders and the economy.\u201dIn the end, Mr. McCausland stepped down as president and chief executive but held the post of executive chairman.Last year, Airgas was confronted with another challenge, when the activist investor Elliott Management emerged as a shareholder.Soon after Elliott acquired its stake, Mr. McCausland said he got a phone call from Air Products\u2019 new chief executive, Seifi Ghasemi. Mr. Ghasemi told him they had to meet, saying that \u201cit was an emergency.\u201dAt their meeting, Mr. Ghasemi said, \u201cElliott is going to destroy you. They say they have Fidelity with them,\u201d Mr. McCausland recalled. The message was that Fidelity Investments, and potentially other large investors, wanted a sale, so Mr. McCausland had better move quickly and sell to Air Products.Elliott declined to comment for this article.Not long afterward, over a dinner with Mr. McCausland, Mr. Ghasemi pulled out a banker\u2019s pitchbook to discuss an all-stock, zero-premium offer. He ripped out a page showing there was an 86 percent overlap between shareholders of Airgas and Air Products, meaning he could take the offer directly to Airgas investors, who would be inclined to accept (and would not want to pay a rich price because it would be coming out of their pockets).Mr. McCausland did not want to sell, but he really did not want to be forced into what he perceived to be a bad deal. So he sought what he hoped would be a better buyer before Air Products went public with the offer. He met with Koch Industries, Linde, ChemChina, Praxair and Air Liquide.The French company made an all-cash offer, which was announced on Nov. 17. Only five out of 17,000 Airgas jobs were lost integrating the two companies. Mr. McCausland netted almost $1 billion from his stake in the company.For those shareholders who invested at the time of Airgas\u2019s initial public offering in 1986, the company returned 13,000 percent. And in May, when Airgas\u2019s shares were last traded, Mr. McCausland got one last jab against his decades-old rival: His stock closed a dollar higher than Air Products\u2019.But like many entrepreneurs in his position, it was still hard to let go.\u201cWould I have been happier just becoming nonexecutive chairman and staying involved with Airgas? I think I probably would,\u201d he said. \u201cBut under the circumstances, we got the best result.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Arithmetic in Donald Trump\u2019s Jobs Plan Doesn\u2019t Really Work", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceMr. Trump would like to \u201cestablish a national goal of reaching 4 percent economic growth,\u201d as he told the Economic Club of New York. He says s his economic plan will generate 3.5 percent growth and 25 million new jobs over the next decade.Here\u2019s what he gets right. Growth in the United States (and the entire advanced world) has been well below its post-World War II norms since the turn of the century. From 1947 to 2000, the United States economy expanded at an average of 3.6 percent a year. Since then it has been 1.8 percent.It\u2019s probably true as a society that we\u2019ve become too accepting of sluggish growth, even if everyone has different theories of how to fix it. The problem is that when you dive into the math around jobs and G.D.P., it becomes clear how unlikely the country is to meet Mr. Trump\u2019s goals. And that\u2019s true even if you believe his agenda would be good for the economy.As a simple matter of arithmetic, G.D.P. boils down to how much people are working, and how much economic output is generated for each unit of work. Let\u2019s start with how many people will be working after Mr. Trump tries to make America great again, where he was most specific in his forecasts.The more workers you have, the more hours people will work and the more stuff you\u2019ll make. Demography is really important to shaping how high G.D.P. can grow. For example, those shiny growth numbers in the second half of the 20th century were helped along by millions of women entering the work force.Right now there are 152 million Americans working. The Congressional Budget Office projects that number will be 159 million in 2026, at the end of the 10-year window Mr. Trump talks about.The C.B.O. bases its forecasts on demographic modeling. If it\u2019s right, that\u2019s a rise of only seven million in employment, a far cry from the 25 million Mr. Trump envisions. So he would have to find huge numbers of extra workers somewhere.The most obvious source is to pull from the legions of adults who aren\u2019t in the labor force, who currently neither work nor look for work. And their numbers have soared since the 2008 recession. \u201cRight now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the work force, and not part of our economy,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to the prepared text of his speech. \u201cIt\u2019s a silent nation of jobless Americans.\u201dBut the problem with that number (it actually is 94 million, if he\u2019s referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics number for adults not in the labor force) is that it includes a lot of people who aren\u2019t working for good reason: They\u2019re high school and college students; stay-at-home parents; people who are disabled; retirees.When you look at how many of those people would be working in a completely healthy economy, the numbers look a lot smaller. For example, at the record high, the proportion of 25-to-54-year-old Americans who were working was 81.9 percent (that was in April 2000, when the economy was in an all-out boom). If we returned to that ratio immediately, from the current 77.8 percent, it would add about 5.2 million additional workers.In theory that rate could rise above its 2000 levels, but at any plausible level \u2014 meaning one that doesn\u2019t involve forcing unwilling people to work \u2014 you would need to look elsewhere to find those 18 million extra workers beyond the seven million that demographics alone are expected to produce.One option would be to encourage people to work until a much older age. Sorry, Grandpa, you may need to go back to work so President Trump can hit his employment target.But G.D.P. growth isn\u2019t just about demographics and work force trends. It also depends on how effective businesses are at converting human labor into economic output. In a word, productivity.Some simple arithmetic shows that to meet Mr. Trump\u2019s projection of 3.5 percent annual G.D.P. growth each year, even assuming the extraordinary addition of 25 million jobs, you\u2019d still need 2.2 percent annual growth in labor productivity, up from 0.9 percent in the time frame from 2008 to 2015 (assuming hours worked per worker remains constant).That would be terrific. And it\u2019s plausible (productivity growth was 2.4 percent from 1950 to 1973).But it\u2019s also the case that economists don\u2019t generally believe that presidents have much power, at least directly, over productivity growth. More common explanations focus on innovations that do or do not occur within businesses to make their processes more efficient. Think of the word processor and email making millions of secretaries unneeded, or robotics that reduce the number of human-hours needed to build a car.Maybe the burst of infrastructure spending and rollback of regulations Mr. Trump promises will unleash a new surge of productivity growth. Or maybe whatever happens to productivity in the coming years, good or bad, will happen regardless of who is president.Add it all up, and is Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of 25 million new jobs over the next decade and 3.5 percent annual economic growth possible? Only if a burst of innovation arrives that makes every worker\u2019s labor go further, and if millions of new immigrants arrive from overseas or the ratio of American adults who want to work rises far higher than it has ever been. Absent all that, the math just doesn\u2019t work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Plans Another Appeal for Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Deal", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama, beginning a final uphill push for a trade initiative that is opposed by both party\u2019s presidential candidates, will host an Oval Office meeting on Friday to showcase support among public figures in both parties.Expected attendees include Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a former contender for the Republican presidential nomination, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., who served as Treasury secretary under George W. Bush, as well as Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, a Democrat, and Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta, a Democrat.Michael R. Bloomberg, the financial news magnate and Republican-turned-independent former mayor of New York, and Virginia Rometty, the chief executive of IBM, will also attend, as will James G. Stavridis, the former NATO commander.On his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.The meeting is Mr. Obama\u2019s latest attempt, in his waning days in office, to make the case for the trade pact, the largest regional trade accord in history, which he has argued is an economic and national security imperative.Critics in both parties, including a majority of Democrats in Congress, are opposed. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has called the deal \u201ca rape of our country,\u201d while Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who pressed the initiative when she was secretary of state, has changed course and opposed it during her campaign for the White House.In the face of such headwinds, White House aides said Mr. Obama was eager to highlight the broad backing for the accord among national security leaders, business executives and elected officials.\u201cThe president is confident in the strong case he has to make that high-standards trade agreements like the T.P.P. are essential to ensuring that our workers can compete on a level playing field in an increasingly global economy, and guaranteeing that America is setting the rules for global trade in the decades to come,\u201d said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman.While the measure has substantial Republican backing, Speaker Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said last week that it did not have enough votes to pass the House. Mr. Obama is hoping that may change after the November elections, when lawmakers are less worried about the potential political fallout from backing it.Mr. Ryan, an ally on the issue, said he had no intention of bringing the accord to a vote in the lame-duck session of Congress, worrying that a public defeat this year would be worse than waiting until the political tide shifts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hong Kong and the Realities of China\u2019s Rise", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHONG KONG \u2014 I returned to my native Hong Kong in 1998 after more than two decades of working as a reporter in New York City. I was hired to start a journalism program at the University of Hong Kong, my alma mater, and train a new generation of reporters to tell the stories of Hong Kong, China and Asia. It was a big and timely beat.Hong Kong was handed over to China after 156 years of British rule 10 months before I returned. In an ingenious stroke designed to reassure the international community and Hong Kong people, China\u2019s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, devised the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement: Beijing would assume sovereignty, but Hong Kong would keep its rule of law and capitalist ways for 50 years.The political rules were written to ensure that pro-Beijing forces would control the local legislature, known as LegCo, and Hong Kongers were willing to accept an imperfect system in the hope that a more accountable government would evolve. Many were heartened in 1998 when, in the first post-handover LegCo election, the Democratic Party won 13 of the 50 seats and became the dominant opposition.As I caught up with friends from my college days, I shared their excitement about the city\u2019s future. Many veteran activists cherished the idea that cosmopolitan Hong Kong, where people enjoyed freedom of expression, could inspire democratic change in mainland China.The election results portend greater political stasis and polarization in Hong Kong. The calls for independence, as unlikely and impractical as that is, reflect growing resentment for how Beijing and its local representatives have governed the city and intervened in its affairs. Discontent is especially high among the youth.But the LegCo insurgents and their supporters in the general public are increasingly fighting a lonely battle as powerful forces around the world are scrambling to appease Beijing. In recent decades, the fortunes of the mainland and Hong Kong have turned.China has become an indispensable player in world politics, and sometimes throws its weight around, as in the South China Sea. It is also building an alternative world order: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the One Belt, One Road plan to network more than 60 countries spanning vast stretches of Asia, the Middle East and Europe are China-led efforts to offer balance to the United States.Meanwhile, Hong Kong has lost some of its luster. Once the gateway to China, it now contends with Shanghai as the mainland\u2019s top financial center. Its container port is losing ground to Shenzhen. Its economy is more dependent on the mainland.Although it\u2019s the young rebels who caught international attention in recent years, many Hong Kongers believe the city needs to seek accommodation with Beijing. These include people who appreciate how China has lifted hundreds of millions from poverty, while modernizing the country. There are also many Hong Kongers who enjoy growing personal, professional and business ties with China. In a recent poll, more than half of Hong Kong residents felt somewhat or strongly against the calls for independence.The fact is that the fate of Hong Kong has always been linked to China, an integral part of its destiny because of history, culture and geography.Independence is not an option for Hong Kong.Like the rest of the world, Hong Kong people will have to cope with the reality of a rising and more powerful China.My students will have to be prepared to tell stories of Hong Kong that have become darker and more complicated. They will have to navigate the tangled relations among Hong Kong, mainland China and the rest of the world. As citizens, they will have to struggle with the fact that Hong Kong might just be a pawn in the big global game among corporate interests and the great powers.Yuen Ying Chan is an honorary professor at the University of Hong Kong and a distinguished fellow at Civic Exchange, an independent public policy think tank in Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Home to High-Security Lab and Source of Rumors, Plum Island Faces Uncertain Future", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPLUM ISLAND, N.Y. \u2014 There have been comparisons to the H.G. Wells novel, \u201cThe Island of Dr. Moreau,\u201d a nod from Hannibal Lecter in \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d and a murder mystery called \u201cPlum Island,\u201d by Nelson DeMille, in 1997. When the carcass of an unidentified animal was found on a Long Island beach a few years ago, it became popularly known as the Montauk Monster, and local residents said it had come from \u2014 where else? \u2014 Plum Island.The site there is officially called the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. It is a federal facility, the nation\u2019s most important lab for combating infectious animal diseases.But the fact that the island is one and a half miles off Long Island, and that access to it is so highly restricted, has made the high-security lab the source of a cascade of science fiction scenarios and conspiracy theories, which proliferate in films, books and local lore, and include rumors about government experimentation with hybrid animals, Cold War biological weapons and even the outbreak of Lyme disease.On Tuesday, officials allowed a small group of reporters who had undergone an extensive background check a rare glimpse at this island of intrigue.But first, there was a morning ferry ride from Connecticut, carrying Plum Island workers. The commuters filed into a modern cinder block building; a poster above the security desk bore the heading \u201cBetrayed\u201d; listed below were \u201cTraditional Espionage Indicators.\u201dPlum Island has attracted controversy in recent years, and not because of what actually goes on there. In fact, the research center will be closed within the next decade, and federal officials are marketing the 840-acre island to potential developers. The move has spawned theories about the future of the island, whose research campus will be moved to Kansas.Could Plum Island really become a Trump golf resort? And what would a luxury development be named? Anthrax Estates?Located 100 miles east of New York City, with sweeping water views, the island has already drawn unsurprising interest from local real estate agents and developers, including, yes, Donald J. Trump.Many people in the area, however, want the island preserved as a nature sanctuary or perhaps a park. In July, a coalition of environmental groups and activists filed a federal lawsuit to stop the sale, and there is a similar legislative push in Congress.\u201cIt\u2019s a race against the clock,\u201d said Representative Lee Zeldin, who sponsored a recent bill to repeal provisions of a 2009 law requiring the government to sell the island to the highest bidder.Mr. Zeldin, a Republican who represents the eastern portion of Long Island, said he favored preserving part of the island as a public park, while keeping the labs active for other types of research.He expressed hope that the bill would be passed in the next few months. As for those working on the marketing and sales efforts, he said, \u201cI would encourage them to go as slow as possible.\u201dThe island has been overseen since 2003 by the Department of Homeland Security because of the research center\u2019s critical role in protecting the nation\u2019s livestock, and its importance to the food economy, said John Verrico, a spokesman for the agency\u2019s science and technology arm.Larry Barrett, the director of the center, put it in similar terms. \u201cFood security is national security,\u201d Mr. Barrett said, especially given that the center is the only place in the country where research is conducted with the live virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease.The key concern, he said, is ensuring that the infectious livestock disease samples used in the research labs are not employed for bioterrorism, or even accidentally introduced to the outside world, creating the possibility of a widespread outbreak, which could threaten livestock herds and impose an enormous cost on the national economy.Officials described painstaking steps taken to avoid an outbreak, such as stringent security clearances and background checks, the boiling of all water discarded from the lab and the requirement that anyone who works within the biocontainment lab must shower twice before leaving.As for the cattle, pigs and other animals used for vaccine and other kinds of testing, they are kept in indoor, secured living quarters, said Dr. Luis L. Rodriguez, who leads research at the center\u2019s laboratories.They are acquired as healthy animals, inoculated or infected for testing and ultimately euthanized and incinerated at the end of a testing trial, he said, emphasizing that the animals are treated as humanely and ethically as possible.Still, to avoid the possibility of the spread of disease, any deer that occasionally swim onto the island are killed and immolated.For similar reasons, officials have been reluctant to bring a dog to the island to help chase away geese.The security guidelines even complicate efforts to market the island, partly because arranging visits is an exhaustive process, and advance clearance is required for each visitor.There has been little, if any, preliminary assessment of the property by outsiders, officials said. Development cannot begin until after the research center is shut, since ferrying workers and equipment onto the island could compromise security guidelines, Mr. Verrico said.The guidelines were palpable even to journalists on the tour, which was organized to show the public that the island was, as officials said, \u201csecure but not secret.\u201dSecure it was. Federal officials asked for information from journalists interested in visiting Plum Island in July, and would consider only United States citizens. On Tuesday, armed guards searched reporters before both arrival and departure and shadowed the group wherever it went.Open food containers were prohibited, as was the use of laptop or tablet computers. Photography in unauthorized areas, most of them at the research center, which occupies a small portion of the island, was forbidden.The remainder of Plum Island is a largely untouched natural terrain of brush and trees. Paved and unpaved roadways cut through the overgrowth. The shoreline consists of pristine beaches with clear water, and there is a fresh water pond and wetlands near the ferry landing.Overlooking Orient Point and the Plum Gut Channel is a lighthouse built in 1869. Not far away is Building 257, a fortresslike bunker once used for munitions storage and, for a time, animal research.Farther down the shoreline is a complex of aging structures that were part of Fort Terry, a military post once used for guarding the entrance to Long Island Sound.The hulking brick barracks, now deteriorating, overlook Gardiner\u2019s Bay and the Hamptons to the south. On the rocky shoreline nearby, a group of seals frolicked, components of the island\u2019s diverse wildlife.Near the barracks is a helipad for the emergency delivery of disease samples.A rapid response is crucial during an outbreak, so when questionable diseases are detected in American livestock, samples are rushed by chartered jet to an airport in Suffolk County and then taken by helicopter to the island, said Dr. Fernando Torres-Velez, who heads the diagnostic work at the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory.The island falls under the jurisdiction of the Town of Southold on the North Fork, which has already put in place zoning that precludes resort or luxury home development on the island, said Scott A. Russell, the town supervisor.The zoning preserves most of the existing natural areas and stipulates that the center may be reconstructed only for a similar use, such as research, Mr. Russell said.\u201cIt\u2019s ironclad, it\u2019s cast in stone,\u201d he said of the zoning, though he acknowledged that it could still be legally challenged. \u201cAnyone seeking to develop the island would have to follow it.\u201dMr. Russell said Trump Organization officials had contacted him regarding the zoning.\u201cThey said they wanted to build a world-class golf course and resort,\u201d he said, adding that he told them the zoning did not seem to fit their vision.The existing research center could be used to study environmental energy, he said, adding, \u201cWe have infrastructure that we would like to keep there, and you got wind, you got solar, you got tidal there.\u201dMr. Verrico noted that the government was still under a congressional mandate to sell the island, and said the sale was really the purview of the General Services Administration. A spokesman for that agency said he could not comment because of the lawsuit filed in July.The groups who filed the suit maintain that the government wrongly called for the auction of the island and failed to detail the cleanup required at the research labs.Many of them agree with Representative Zeldin and favor the preservation of a portion of the island as a public park while keeping the labs active for other types of research.The congressman said that even a brief visit to Plum Island revealed its unique place in such a densely populated region.\u201cYou feel like you are at a location thousands of miles away from home,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wells Fargo\u2019s John Stumpf Has His Wall St. Comeuppance", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong before he ran Wells Fargo, one of the nation\u2019s largest banks, John Stumpf grew up on a dairy and poultry farm, one of 11 children. He started his career as a community banker in Minnesota and married the local banker\u2019s daughter.Over the years, Mr. Stumpf has cultivated his image as a community banker and that of his bank as the antithesis of a giant global lender.While its rivals were mired in mortgage and trading scandals, Wells boasted that it was helping small businesses and families prosper in what Mr. Stumpf called the \u201creal economy.\u201dBut now Mr. Stumpf, 63, is having his own Wall Street moment. On Tuesday, the Wells Fargo chief executive will face questions from the Senate Banking Committee over the creation of as many as 1.5 million phony bank accounts \u2014 a widespread scandal that has cost 5,300 Wells employees their jobs and raised questions about a broad failure of oversight inside the bank.In the years immediately after the financial crisis, a congressional grilling was a sort of rite of passage for bank chief executives or top Wall Street traders.\u201cThat said, I accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices in our retail banking business,\u201d Mr. Stumpf plans to say in testimony.He adds, \u201cI am deeply sorry that we failed to fulfill our responsibility to our customers, to our team members and to the American public.\u201dAs the scrutiny of Wells intensifies, there is a particular feeling of schadenfreude on Wall Street and in certain circles of Washington, where Mr. Stumpf was seen as portraying Wells as being different than the risky global investment banks behind the mortgage crisis.While his star was rising on Wall Street and he became the industry\u2019s highest-paid banker, Mr. Stumpf criticized the \u201cplethora of new regulations\u201d on banks.\u201cI think we have gone too far\u201d in terms of regulation, he told an interviewer in 2013, the same year he was named Banker of the Year by The American Banker, a trade publication.It was also the same year that the creation of the sham bank accountants hit their peak, as did the firings of lower-level employees responsible for creating them.\u201cThis is a particular reversal for him,\u201d said Barney Frank, the former congressman from Massachusetts who co-wrote Dodd-Frank, the 2010 legislation that overhauled the financial industry. \u201cHe regarded himself as the best person situated to criticize what some people regarded as regulatory excess.\u201dAt the same time that Mr. Stumpf assailed some of the new regulations ushered in during that era in interviews and opinion pieces, officials at other banks said that Wells seemed reluctant to be associated with Wall Street\u2019s lobbying efforts in Washington.Wells\u2019s head of government relations is based not in Washington, where all the regulations were being hashed out, but in Minnesota. A bank spokeswoman said that members of the government relations staff are based in the nation\u2019s capitol.This year, Wells Fargo departed the industry trade group Financial Services Forum, which has been working to improve the banking industry\u2019s image, particularly in this election year.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the bank decided to leave the forum because \u201cother trade associations are more closely aligned to our business model and our footprint, which is concentrated in the United States.\u201dFor all the apple-pie image that Mr. Stumpf has sought to project over the years, his compensation is hardly humble.From 2011 to 2015 \u2014 the time during which regulators are focusing their investigation into the fake accounts \u2014 Mr. Stumpf\u2019s compensation in cash, stock and other benefits totaled roughly $103 million.Indeed, he was paid more than any of the chief executives at the traditional Wall Street firms like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, according to an analysis by Equilar, an executive research firm.Analysts say Mr. Stumpf\u2019s compensation was higher than that of his rivals because Wells\u2019s stock price and profits generally outperformed those of other banks during that period.Mr. Stumpf\u2019s first job was as a baker in his hometown, Pierz, Minn., which has a population of about 1,400.After attending St. Cloud State University, he began his banking career in the 1970s as a \u201crepo\u201d agent charged with collecting defaulted debt for a small bank in Minnesota.In 1982, he joined Norwest, a large Minneapolis bank, where he worked under Richard M. Kovacevich, the bank\u2019s larger-than-life chairman.Norwest and Wells Fargo merged in 1998. The newly merged bank adopted the Wells name and its stagecoach label, commemorating its history as a delivery service across the American West.Mr. Kovacevich is credited as the architect of Wells Fargo\u2019s intense push to \u201ccross-sell\u201d customers as many accounts and services as they could.\u201cKovacevich is really the person who created what Wells is today,\u201d said Fred Cannon, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \u201cStumpf is his heir.\u201dMr. Stumpf became chief executive of Wells Fargo in 2007, as the broader financial system began to swoon from the trillions of soured mortgage debt on bank balance sheets.As other banks\u2019 profits were weighed down by the costs of settling government investigations over their mortgage practices, Wells\u2019s auto and energy lending was booming. The bank also took advantage of a wave of home refinancings to become the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lender.With its recent success, Wells had grown to become the nation\u2019s largest bank by market capitalization. But the scandal over the sham accounts \u2014 which resulted in a $185 million settlement with regulators \u2014 has knocked Wells\u2019s stock price down by as much as 7 percent.\u201cBanks are built on trust, and this is a chink in that armor,\u201d Mr. Cannon said. \u201cIt is still early days in how this plays itself out. We have a long way to go.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about John G. Stumpf, chief executive of Wells Fargo, whose company is facing a scandal over sham accounts set up by bank employees without customers\u2019 knowledge, misidentified the industry trade group that Wells Fargo departed this year. It is the Financial Services Forum \u2014 not the Financial Services Roundtable, which lobbies for the financial industry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Chile", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real Estate23 PhotosA SEVEN-BEDROOM HOUSE IN CHILE\u2019S WINE COUNTRY$4.5 MILLIONThis 99-acre property with a 13,000-square-foot house and 67 acres of vineyards is in the Casablanca Valley, about a 45-minute drive from Santiago, the capital of Chile. The estate is on a country road about five miles off Route 68, the main highway linking Santiago to the coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Valparaiso.The current owner of this estate is growing primarily sauvignon blanc, with smaller plots for pinot noir and merlot.The one-story, U-shaped colonial house, with seven bedrooms and five and a half baths, was built in 2009. The living room, dining room and kitchen are in the center of the house; the bedrooms are in the wings. The double-height ceilings are made from bamboo, in a traditional style, supported by hardwood beams. There is terra-cotta tile flooring throughout the house. The walls are reinforced concrete.The long, rectangular dining room is large enough for a 10-chair table. The kitchen is described as \u201ccountry-style,\u201d with silestone countertops and space for a dining table. There is a 300-square-foot wine cellar, in addition to a laundry area, a maid\u2019s room and a large office. The furniture is not included in the price, but is available for sale, according to Matt Ridgway, the owner of Chile Investments, a consultancy marketing the property.The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court. The backyard has a large lawn and a grove of olive trees. Two small homes are on the outskirts of the property for staff. The sale price includes subterranean water rights, which are essential for agricultural land, Mr. Ridgway said.It is rare for this type of property to be offered for sale publicly, Mr. Ridgway said. \u201cProperties within this market and price range typically don\u2019t come onto the market, but change hands privately,\u201d he said.The town of Casablanca, population around 25,000, with shops and restaurants, is about a 15-minute drive from the property. There are also several excellent restaurants in the wineries in the area, Mr. Ridgway said. The Santiago International Airport is about 40 minutes away.MARKET OVERVIEWThe Chilean economy has slowed in recent years, partly because of a steep drop in the price of copper, a key industry for Chile. After hitting a high in 2013, the gross domestic product has been declining since.Demand has remained strong for high-end properties, but sales have slumped for mid- and lower-priced homes, agents said. This year the government also imposed stricter lending requirements, capping loans at 80 percent of the value of a home, which has dampened the domestic market, agents said.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a market trending toward more of a rental market than a sales market,\u201d said Jorge Mira Olivos, the head of real estate at Engel & V\u00f6lkers Chile, the property agency.In 2016, rentals handled by the Engel & V\u00f6lkers office have increased 30 percent from a year earlier, while the number of sales has dropped more than 5 percent, Mr. Olivos said.Sales in Santiago are down as much as 30 percent to 40 percent, Mr. Ridgway said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still demand for good, well-located properties,\u201d he said.Despite the recent slowdown , the market is \u201cstable,\u201d says V\u00edctor Dan\u00fas, general manager of ProUrbe Chile, a real estate company.Over all in Santiago, the average price of an apartment is about $203 a square foot ($2,183 per square meter), and for a house it is about $152 a square foot ($1,637 per square meter), he said. But prices can rise to more than $300 a square foot for a house in more exclusive communities at the foot of the Andes, such as Vitacura or Lo Barnechea.A new law imposing value-added tax on the sale of new properties has made older properties more attractive, he said. The new VAT, which went into effect on Jan. 1, can add from 4 percent to 11 percent to the price of a new property, he said.Wine country properties are hard to value, Mr. Ridgway said. There are few large properties for sale, and few of the larger vineyards have homes comparable to this property, he said.WHO BUYS IN AND AROUND SANTIAGOIn Santiago, foreign buyers are rare, agents said. But in wine country, where this house is, foreign buyers account for as much of 80 percent of sales, Mr. Dan\u00fas said. Most of the foreign buyers come from Brazil, Argentina and the United States.Wine country also attracts retirees, drawn by the mild climate, Chile\u2019s diverse recreational activities and home prices that are lower than those in some other South American countries. The vineyard properties are often converted into boutique hotels or bed-and-breakfasts, agents said.The weakening of the peso against the dollar has made Chilean real estate more affordable for United States citizens, Mr. Ridgway said. While the 10-year average is about 550 pesos to the dollar, the current rate is closer to 670 pesos, and earlier this year it reached 730 pesos to the dollar, a recent high.BUYING BASICSReal estate prices are typically listed in Unidad de Fomento (UF), a form of currency tied to the Chilean peso, but adjusted for inflation to provide more consistent prices.There are no restrictions on foreigners owning property, except in border areas. But it is almost impossible for a nonresident to obtain a mortgage; most foreigners buy in cash, agents said.Over all, it is \u201ca really simple process,\u201d Mr. Olivos said.

{"Headline": "California Today: Is This the End for Movies?", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).It\u2019s Friday! Let\u2019s talk movies.To help us understand what to make of cinema\u2019s dirge, I turned to two of The Times\u2019s most thoughtful Hollywood watchers: Brooks Barnes, the neighborhood beat reporter based in Los Angeles, and A.O. Scott, one of our chief film critics.He cited evidence that suggests people may be shunning spontaneous treks to the theater in favor of plopping on the couch for a Netflix binge. This trend also coincides with a summer flush with big studio flops: \u201cSequelitis and an overload of event movies have been blamed for much of the carnage.\u201dBut, he argues, these trends don\u2019t spell doom for the medium.\u201cIt pops up almost every summer \u2014 \u2018nothing but blockbuster drivel!\u2019 he said in an email. \u201cFor more than 40 years, summer has been when studios roll out their lumbering parade floats aimed at the out-of-school set.\u201dIn the fall, the studios shift to more sophisticated fare, Mr. Barnes said. \u201cComing up are movies that will blow people away.\u201d\u201cThe death of cinema has been going on for most of a century,\u201d he said, \u201cand I expect it will last for at least another hundred years.\u201dHe wrote: \u201cWhatever the state of the industry or the prevailing winds in the culture and the digital economy, the integrity and specificity of cinema is a fact.\u201d\u201cThis is big, and I hope it sends a message across the country.\u201d Mr. Brown said at a signing ceremony in a Los Angeles park.The two measures require the most populous state to cut emissions from vehicles, factories and utilities to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.Supporters overcame strong opposition from the oil industry and many Republican lawmakers to pass the legislation.The New York Times Magazine sent Nico Young, a particularly talented student photographer, on an assignment to show what life is like at his high school.There is still gold to be found in the Sierra Nevada foothills.Mr. Espinoza, 40, said he was in Woods Creek, a waterway in Jamestown known for bearing gold, when he pushed aside a big rock and spotted it, pinched in the bedrock.\u201cIt was just amazing,\u201d he said of the 17.9-ounce nugget. \u201cI was waiting to wake up anytime.\u201dFrank Powell, a guide at the company, said California\u2019s 120-mile Mother Lode continues to provide a livelihood for many lone prospectors.It\u2019s grueling work, he said, requiring strenuous digging to get down to bedrock where the gold is hiding.For Mr. Espinoza, who has two daughters, prospecting has provided a precarious livelihood since he took it up almost four years ago.In a typical week, he makes between $200 and $300, he said. Some days he goes home empty-handed.\u201cThere are times when it drains you, not only economically, but physically and mentally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to get back up and try again after you failed so many times.\u201dAs word started to spread about his discovery, he said he has fielded three serious offers.Mr. Espinoza is not saying how much he wants for it, but the owner of Gold Prospecting Adventures suggested that with its historical significance it ought to fetch up to $70,000.Mr. Espinoza said he plans to wait for the right offer.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "T.P.P. Faces Rough Road in Congress", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama, reaching Asia on Friday, will reassure allies of his determination to win congressional approval of the far-reaching Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord, but back home in congressional races, his party is on the air and online slamming it as a bad deal \u2014 and hitting Republicans for supporting it.So dicey are the politics that Republican congressional leaders have been unwilling to commit to a vote even in the postelection lame duck Congress. Without approval by the United States, the accord liberalizing trade among Pacific Rim countries representing 40 percent of the global economy cannot take effect. Both major-party candidates to succeed Mr. Obama oppose it.On Thursday, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. circulated on social media the words of its president, Richard Trumka, about the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, at a news event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor: \u201cI\u2019ve looked her squarely in the eye and we\u2019ve talked about T.P.P. I\u2019ve known her for 30 years, and there\u2019s never been one time when Hillary Clinton gave me her word that she didn\u2019t follow through on.\u201dWhite House officials insist that Democratic efforts against the trade pact are misguided. \u201cIt\u2019s apparent that some members of Congress might be a little behind the curve when it comes to the politics of the president\u2019s strategy around trade policy,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday.Especially in several manufacturing states that are crucial to the Democrats\u2019 quest to recapture the Senate, Republicans are caught in a vise between Democrats\u2019 attacks and fear of alienating Mr. Trump\u2019s antitrade, working-class voters \u2014 damned if they endorse the T.P.P. and damned as flip-floppers if they oppose it.\u201cI\u2019m seeing Democrats use it as an attack almost across the board,\u201d said Jennifer E. Duffy, a senior editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cSo I think you\u2019ve just seen Republicans get spooked.\u201dDemocrats have had Republican senators on the defensive on trade in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri. The Senate race in Pennsylvania recently has been a prime example.In Illinois, where Senator Mark S. Kirk is fighting for re-election, his Democratic rival, Representative Tammy Duckworth, has a new television ad on trade that does not mention T.P.P. specifically and focuses on China, which is not a party to the agreement. She is shown telling steelworkers at a union hall: \u201cMark Kirk describes himself as an \u2018ardent free-trader,\u2019 and that is a fundamental difference between us. I am a fair trader.\u201dHis Democratic opponent, Missouri\u2019s secretary of state, Jason Kander, told the paper that \u201cdeals such as T.P.P. have the potential to devastate local economies across the state, replacing well-paid manufacturing jobs with low-paying jobs.\u201dOn his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.In Wisconsin\u2019s rematch between Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, and former Senator Russ Feingold, a Democrat, Mr. Feingold is berating Mr. Johnson for declining to take a position \u201con the disastrous trade deal.\u201dThe Republican incumbent who had perhaps the most to fear from the trade issue was Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, whose portrait hangs in the Washington office of the United States trade representative, the job he held under President George W. Bush, who began negotiations toward the Pacific trade deal. Soon after it was concluded in October, Mr. Portman announced his opposition, despite his trade pedigree.Democrats \u201cwere landing some blows,\u201d said Nathan L. Gonzales of the nonpartisan Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report. But, he added, citing recent polls showing Mr. Portman ahead of the Democratic candidate, former Gov. Ted Strickland, \u201cthey weren\u2019t winning the overall fight.\u201dMr. Portman\u2019s lead is not the only evidence that a pro-trade stance is not necessarily perilous \u2014 as the president has argued.With the victory on Tuesday of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida\u2019s Democratic primary elections, all 28 House Democrats who last year supported trade promotion authority for the president have come through party primaries with little or no competition, despite threats from liberal antitrade groups.Mr. Earnest pointed that out to reporters aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, as the president began the trip that will take him to the summit meetings in Asia where T.P.P. will be a main topic.Democratic campaign committees do tend to attack Republicans\u2019 flip-flops on trade rather than the agreement itself. \u201cRepublican senators are hitting the panic button and flip-flopping on T.P.P. in a blatant and desperate effort to cover up their records,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, communications director at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.Yet Republicans see a contradiction, too \u2014 between the president\u2019s legacy-minded promotion of the economic and geopolitical benefits of the Pacific accord and the attacks by some in his party on \u201cjob-killing trade agreements.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re trying to have their cake and eat it, too,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, communications director at the National Republican Senatorial Committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a New Novel, an Indian Woman Tracks Her Abuser", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The striking opening section in Anuradha Roy\u2019s Booker-longlisted novel \u201cSleeping on Jupiter\u201d is a model of economy. In brisk, almost breakneck strokes, Roy depicts the violence of a war that suddenly engulfs the citrus-scented birthplace of its central character, Nomi, brutally claiming her father, then her brother and mother, and leaving Nomi to be consigned by boat to an unknown future.The next section is even more arresting. Three older ladies strike up a conversation with a young woman on a train from Kolkata, then watch in horror as she tries to escape the lustful advances of two men on the platform outside at a stop. Their last glimpse, of one of the men closing in as the train pulls away, conjures all the ghastly headlines of violent sexual assault against women in India.The rest of this compulsively readable novel follows a series of intersecting stories set in the train\u2019s destination of \u00adJarmuli, a fictional temple town on the Bay of Bengal. The young woman is Nomi, who after growing up as an adopted child in Norway has returned (under cover of a documentary assignment) to look for the ashram where the boat deposited her many years ago. Perhaps this will help her achieve closure with the scarring abuse she suffered at the hands of its pedophile leader, Guruji.The seniors have their own demon \u2014 age \u2014 which one of them, Latika, fights with burgundy-dyed hair and another accepts by serenely wading toward dementia. The third has a son caught up in a privileged-class existentialist funk, who, unbeknown to her, is also visiting Jarmuli at the same time. Rounding out the socioeconomic scale are Badal, the temple guide, who has developed an \u00adall-consuming crush on the tea boy \u00adRaghu, and Raghu\u2019s employer, the enigmatic tea seller, who may or may not be a figure from Nomi\u2019s past.The book deftly captures an India where women encounter harassment at every turn, and a female teacher might appear with mysterious wounds and lips \u201clike two swollen rubber chilies\u201d in class one day. \u201cIf you fish a woman out of the water you can lay her or sell her or set her to work,\u201d a fisherman declares, summing up a view too much of the country\u2019s population still shares.Roy\u2019s central theme is oppression, and the opportunistic violence that accompanies it, aimed not just at women, but anyone vulnerable \u2014 particularly children. Nomi and her fellow orphans are \u00adsubjected to such extreme atrocities that the author spaces them out, in escalating doses. Raghu and Badal bond over the merciless thrashings each has endured; even a stray dog is beaten with a cricket bat until it is \u201ca mess of broken bones held together by bloodied fur.\u201dBut Roy\u2019s Jarmuli is also evocative of love and beauty and deep longing, of memories of emerald paddies and guava trees that float across the beach in the tea seller\u2019s song. Possibilities for intimacy are always kindling \u2014 be it the future Badal imagines with Raghu or the flirtation Latika indulges in with her driver \u2014 and though these must eventually die, they ward off the darkness of past disappointments at least temporarily.One of the pleasures of this book is Roy\u2019s prose. A saucepan is \u201cleathery with old layers of burnt grease,\u201d underpants are \u201cgray beyond the powers of detergent,\u201d the day\u2019s heat is described as \u201cgathering ferocity somewhere on the horizon.\u201d A scene where Badal steals a kiss from Raghu is written with such lyrical precision that it leaves one breathless, able to discern the \u201csalt and sea and rust\u201d Badal tastes on the boy\u2019s lips.Out of a host of complex, skillfully realized characters, Badal stands out in particular. By making him an enormously sympathetic foil to Guruji, possessed of all the humanity and self-doubt the god-man isn\u2019t, Roy forces us to ponder an uncomfortable parallel. Nomi and Raghu have \u201ctwo halves of the same face\u201d \u2014 yet, Raghu would clearly be better off under Badal\u2019s loving patronage than Nomi was under Guruji, with more prospects possible than those of a frequently thrashed tea boy. Does that make his exploitation defensible? What if this is the best future a developing country like India is able \u2014 or willing \u2014 to offer him?The book is not without flaws. Sometimes, Roy allows herself to be overwhelmed by symbolism: Nomi sees \u201cfoaming blood\u201d in the sea, then is \u00adblinded by \u201csheets of falling blood\u201d in her hotel, then claims \u201cthe juice inside poured out in red spurts\u201d from a melon at breakfast the next morning. (Note to tourists: Beware the notorious spurting melons of Jarmuli!)More perplexing are omissions in the narrative, presumably in deference to conciseness. For instance, after raising reader anxiety and emotional engagement to a fever pitch at the end of the book\u2019s second section, there is no further mention of the thug chasing Nomi \u2014 we must make do with the bland information that she boarded the train. In Jarmuli, Nomi neither follows up on newspaper articles about a denounced Guruji, nor tries to track a beloved fellow orphan through formal means \u2014 she is content to root around for sentimental artifacts in the \u00adruins of the ashram instead.And then there are the coincidences \u2014 perhaps forgivable, since there are so many unruly strands to tie together. But the author seems to get a bit addicted to them.These quibbles fade in the radiance of Roy\u2019s accomplishment. The world she creates is ambitiously imagined, her characters possessed of an inner verity. They remind us how strongly our identities are forged by our experiences, how difficult it is to counter the gravitational pull of our own lives and escape to new realms.Manil Suri is the author of \u201cThe City of Devi.\u201d He is working on a book that combines fiction with mathematics.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018A Truck Full of Money\u2019 and a Thirst to Put It to Good Use", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesBefore the sensibility of Tracy Kidder\u2019s new book clearly emerges, and before its subject, Paul English, becomes endearingly familiar, you may be tempted to put it down. The first few chapters of \u201cA Truck Full of Money: One Man\u2019s Quest to Recover From Great Success\u201d have the sound of a glossy business-magazine hagiography \u2014 so much so that readers may wonder why the book isn\u2019t blushing.Decency? Generosity? Why, this man has them in spades. He\u2019d need a whole wall of shelving to fit all that decency and generosity. And brains! Well, for those he\u2019d need to sprout a second head.But it\u2019s a mistake for Mr. Kidder to strike such a gushing tone as he introduces us to this man. There\u2019s been far too much slobbering over barons of the new economy in the last 15 years for readers to understand that this narrative may be slightly different.If Mr. Kidder was hoping for an airport business-book best seller, I don\u2019t think this is it.There is, however, an element of Mr. English\u2019s story that\u2019s quite striking, one that makes \u201cA Truck Full of Money\u201d feel very much like a Tracy Kidder book.In his 20s, Mr. English was told he had bipolar disorder. For a long time, he kept his diagnosis a secret. But today, he is wonderfully open and courageous about it.Many of Mr. Kidder\u2019s subjects are coiled with enough energy to launch a missile, of course, but Mr. English has a psychiatric diagnosis to go with it. The questions Mr. Kidder raises \u2014 Are Mr. English\u2019s manic spells responsible for his entrepreneurial boldness? Or does he succeed in spite of them? \u2014 are well worth probing, and Mr. Kidder\u2019s portrayal of living with manic depression is as nuanced and intimate as a reader might ever expect to get. On a good day, Mr. English\u2019s mind is gaily swarming with bumblebees. On a bad one, though, he\u2019s \u201cGulliver imprisoned by the tiny Lilliputians, laid out on his back, tied to the ground with a web of tiny ropes.\u201dMany of the features of Mr. English\u2019s biography fit a familiar pattern. He was a low-achieving student with a high-watt intelligence. He discovered computer programming in middle school and was instantly smitten; today, he thinks fluently in layers of code \u2014 \u201ceach hanging from the one above, like a Calder mobile\u201d \u2014 and his brain is a regular popcorn maker of ideas. (Though some kernels never open: Among the domain names Mr. English purchased years ago was Snapcab, which predated Uber by five years. He never did a thing with it.)But the high-amplitude sine curve of manic depression has also complicated Mr. English\u2019s life in all kinds of unforeseen ways.When he\u2019s \u201con fire\u201d (his term), he grows irritable with the slow dial-up connection of other people\u2019s brains. He exaggerates. He slurs his words. His ideas range from extremely creative to flat-out wackadoo. (One, which he partly fulfilled, was to create Blade, a business incubator by day and psychedelic disco by night. The disco part didn\u2019t quite take off.) And he spends his money on the darnedest things: He once bid $500,000 on an abandoned lighthouse in Boston Harbor and instantly regretted it. Someone, thank heavens, bid more.But one of the more admirable aspects of Mr. English\u2019s character is his attitude toward money. He grew up without it, in a family of nine in South Boston. His modest roots could have made him jealously guard his millions with his life. But he quickly realized that giving them away \u2014 to the homeless in his native city, to the sick and dispossessed in Haiti \u2014 was a great form of therapy, which he\u2019s self-aware enough to admit: \u201cI knew that one way to get rid of any depression was to do something for somebody else.\u201dOver the years, Mr. English has tried a Lazy Susan of medications to subdue his highs and avert his lows. Many left him feeling listless and without affect. Being bipolar meant constantly weighing the merits of instability versus a denatured, drained sense of self.A Truck Full of MoneyOne Man\u2019s Quest to Recover From Great SuccessBy Tracy Kidder259 pages.

{"Headline": "Can You Have a Good Life if You Don\u2019t Have a Good Job?", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSHOULD the goal of public policy be to ensure that all Americans can have good jobs \u2014 or good lives? Politicians of both parties say one thing. Policy experts of both parties say another.Far from the campaign stops, in university and think tank offices, the emerging consensus is quite different: Americans should be able to enjoy good lives, even if they have \u201cbad\u201d jobs \u2014 jobs with low wages, irregular hours and no employer-provided benefits. Bipartisan experts tend to agree that the decline in employer-provided benefits and the rise of unconventional work arrangements are trends that should be accommodated, by reforms including new portable benefits and expanded income maintenance programs, like tax credits for low-income workers.For several decades, this consensus has been reflected in what legislators have actually been doing. Slowly, incrementally, Americans have been moving away from a system in which a good job with a generous employer was the key to having a good life to a new system in which even people with low-wage jobs can have access to the basic goods and services that define a decent life in a modern society.This huge government sector is made up of tax credits, federal grants-in-aid to the states and low-interest loan programs like student loans. Many of these indirect programs, like entitlements and tax breaks for health care, retirement and housing, are not counted as part of the conventional federal budget. This allows Congress to stealthily expand the size of government while pretending not to. The individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, for example, is a tax, though an unusual one, as the Supreme Court found when upholding its legitimacy in 2012.Preserving the fiction of a small federal government by relying on the hidden welfare state to deliver benefits sometimes comes at a cost. For example, unemployment insurance is not a simple, straightforward, uniform federal program, but a hodgepodge of separate state programs financed partly by the federal government and partly by the states. During economic downturns, this design often creates crises, because the federal government can more easily borrow money in recessions than state governments bound by balanced budget provisions in their state constitutions. And as Suzanne Mettler has pointed out, the importance of indirect benefits in America creates political problems, too. Middle-class American voters often underestimate how many government benefits they receive, while overestimating the cost of means-tested welfare for the poor. Unfortunately, the preference of American policy makers for what the political scientist Steven Teles calls \u201ckludgeocracy\u201d \u2014 indirect, complex, off-budget mechanisms rather than simple public programs financed through higher taxes \u2014 seems likely to persist.Looking back over the last half-century, we can discern a long-term trend in which the United States government at all levels has been gradually responding to the decline of high-wage, high-benefit jobs, by methods such as gradually socializing benefits (state-run retirement plans) and partly subsidizing wages (the earned-income tax credit). Is this a trend to be welcomed or feared?One criticism is that the growing socialization of wages and benefits, combined with the decline of employer-provided benefits, transfers responsibility for the well-being of workers from employers and their customers to taxpayers. But any welfare state of any design allows employers to pay somewhat lower wages, because workers do not have to pay for goods like retirement security or health care entirely from their after-tax earnings.But the political problem remains. Even if center-left and center-right policy wonks agree that the goal should be good lives for all workers, even those with bad jobs, many Americans do not agree, to judge from the rhetoric of politicians, who know their audiences well. The replacement of a world in which one or a few lifetime jobs in a paternalistic company that provided benefits during your working life and a pension after your retirement by a future in which individuals struggle to survive by piecing together \u201cgigs\u201d and \u201ctasks\u201d with a bewildering variety of federal, state and local social programs may strike many workers as a dystopian nightmare. The price of increased flexibility may be increased stress.The emerging policy agenda tends to shift administrative burdens from employers to the least-educated and worst-paid workers in America. Members of the professional class who are well-remunerated freelancers and can hire tax preparers have a quite different experience of the new economy than high school dropouts who, between part-time shifts, struggle with the paperwork for the earned-income tax credit, Section 8 housing vouchers, food stamps and other benefits.The unelected policy experts who envision a future of multiple job types and a greater, if hidden, role for government in maintaining minimum incomes and providing health and retirement benefits are essentially right. The elements of a \u201cgood job\u201d \u2014 adequate income, health insurance and retirement benefits \u2014 that were once combined in the package that a Detroit automobile manufacturer provided to a unionized male steelworker in 1950 are likely to be provided, for most American workers now, by some combination of employer and government.Until most American workers are persuaded that they will not be worse off in a system characterized by flexible work arrangements and partly socialized benefits, they may continue to make unrealistic demands that 21st century politicians restore something like the occupational structure of the 20th century. Politicians should tell working Americans what they need to hear, not what they want to hear.

{"Headline": "Angela Merkel\u2019s Problems in Germany Could Challenge Europe, Too", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Even Angela Merkel, the usually unruffled veteran of European crises after almost 11 years as chancellor of Germany, had to admit it last week: \u201cThe world finds itself in a critical condition,\u201d she said, and there is no point \u201cin painting anything rosier than it is.\u201dThe outlook for Ms. Merkel is not especially rosy, either.After years of broad and deep support at home, bolstering her as she grew to become the Continent\u2019s most powerful leader, she is heading toward national elections next year more politically vulnerable than at any time since her early days in office, with implications that extend far beyond Germany\u2019s borders.When she arrives in Slovakia on Friday for a summit meeting of leaders from 27 European Union nations \u2014 all save Britain, which voted in June to leave the bloc \u2014 her ability to navigate her troubles at home will hang over the gathering.Since Britain\u2019s decision, other European governments have done little to respond to the surge in populism and nationalism across the Continent or to reassure their citizens that the European Union can be a force for good in their lives.With Ms. Merkel\u2019s attention split between strengthening her domestic position and addressing Europe\u2019s woes, the task of developing a united and effective response could become that much harder.Her continued defense of her decision to admit more than a million migrants to Germany last year has left her increasingly isolated from other leaders coping with anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim sentiment in their electorates, especially after terrorist attacks.With growth across the eurozone still \u201ctilted to the down side,\u201d as the European Central Bank chief, Mario Draghi, said on Thursday, Ms. Merkel\u2019s new vulnerability may undercut Germany\u2019s ability to impose its austerity-based economic policy on the bloc and fuel calls for more government spending from countries still struggling with high unemployment and slow growth.And an inward turn by Germany as it debates its response to the migration crisis and holds elections in a year\u2019s time could create a further leadership void in Europe at a critical moment.Already, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France is all but a lame duck, deeply unpopular and a long shot for re-election next year, and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy remains politically fragile, struggling to push through constitutional changes and to assert himself on the European stage.And the rift between the more pluralistic nations of Western Europe and governments in Central and Eastern Europe, some of which are increasingly authoritarian, has heightened the challenge of keeping the Continent knit tightly together.In the middle of all this, as ever, is Ms. Merkel, whose political peril in Germany remains hard to judge \u2014 especially, her supporters emphasize, while the country\u2019s economy remains relatively strong.It was the first time Ms. Merkel\u2019s bloc of Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, had been overtaken on the right in any such election in modern Germany. That the result came a year to the day after she threw open the country\u2019s borders to admit migrants trapped in Hungary, and that it occurred in her political home state, which shelters very few refugees, accentuated the loss.\u201cAngela Merkel is wobbling,\u201d said Wolfram Weimer of the news channel N-TV. \u201cHer aura of winner is destroyed, and her image as farseeing, clever strategist of power along with it.\u201dTalk of the twilight of Ms. Merkel\u2019s time in office may be exaggerated, said Tina Hildebrandt of the influential weekly Die Zeit, \u201cbut that so much is open is spectacular enough.\u201d\u201cMerkel\u2019s loss of reputation is immense,\u201d Ms. Hildebrandt added. \u201cHer situation almost reminds us of the beginning of her career,\u201d when the distinctly un-chic Ms. Merkel, a physicist from the Communist East, was much criticized for her style \u2014 and much underestimated in her ability and will to get to the top.The chancellor showed that grit on Wednesday with a spirited speech to Parliament, defending her policy at home and the controversial pact she negotiated with Turkey to stop Middle Eastern migrants from crossing to Greece and into Europe.Since that agreement was signed, she said, almost no migrants have drowned in the Aegean Sea, compared with hundreds in the two months before.\u201cIn that situation, you can\u2019t just look on,\u201d said Ms. Merkel, the daughter of a Lutheran pastor. \u201cYou must work with another country and find a way forward.\u201dBut as politicians scramble ahead of German national elections next fall, that limit on immigration is becoming a litmus test for her conservative Bavarian sister party, and even for the center-left Social Democrats, with whom Ms. Merkel governs nationally in a coalition.Ms. Merkel has met almost every European leader ahead of the summit meeting in Bratislava, where the 27 nations are expected to agree on stronger security measures and try again to stimulate economic growth and jobs for the young.Daniela Schwarzer, a senior director of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, said she saw the chancellor as still very much in charge.\u201cI would not say that she has lost control, or the capacity to lead Germany,\u201d Ms. Schwarzer said. \u201cBut she will have to take into account that there are vocal people in populist parties and critical voices in her own camp.\u201dThe far-right Alternative for Germany party now has seats in nine of the country\u2019s 16 state legislatures and seems likely to win more when the city-state of Berlin votes on Sunday.The chancellor might turn with relief to the next item on her calendar: a Sept. 19 summit meeting at the United Nations, hosted with President Obama, on the global crisis of up to 60 million migrants, many of them in Africa.Ms. Merkel wants vastly more aid and action to prevent sub-Saharans from surging through Niger and Mali to Libya and then to Europe.Mr. Obama may be more sympathetic to her challenges than many of Ms. Merkel\u2019s compatriots.\u201cPerhaps because she once lived behind a wall herself,\u201d Mr. Obama said on a visit to Germany in April, \u201cAngela understands the aspirations of those who\u2019ve been denied their freedom and who seek a better life.\u201dHe added, \u201cI know the politics around this issue can be difficult in all of our countries.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Battlefield\u2019 Explores the Silence After the War", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree decades ago, this hushed and hallowed place was a theater of war. Surviving witnesses still speak with awe of what they heard and saw then \u2014 of flights of white-feathered arrows and vaulting bodies, and the ever-rising din of voices in eternal conflict.The cast of \u201cBattlefield,\u201d which opened on Wednesday and runs through Oct. 9, consists of a mere four performers. The work in which they appear lasts barely over an hour (and, for the record, the seats are now cushioned). Their movements and language are stately and simple.And though their characters have just endured the destruction of their civilization and the slaughter of most of their families, voices are seldom raised in agony or lamentation. \u201cBattlefield\u201d is steeped in the echoing silence that follows the end of a world when no one knows quite where to go from here.At the play\u2019s center is Yudhishthira (Jared McNeill), the scion of the Pandava family, who has emerged triumphant from battle and is poised to become king. \u201cThis victory is a defeat,\u201d he tells his mother, Kunti (Carole Karemera), when he learns from her that his archenemy, whom he has slain, was his brother. Yudhishithira now wants only to walk away from the damage. But that, it seems, is not his destiny.That we know because Destiny is a character in \u201cBattlefield,\u201d as are Time and Death, who at one point argue about their respective responsibility in the demise of a child by snake bite. This conversation among cosmic forces occurs in one of many parables \u2014 and parables within parables.A life-loving worm about to be crushed by a chariot, a king who sacrifices pounds of his own flesh to save a pigeon he has vowed to shelter, a river that bewails the death of her son before returning to her bed \u2014 these figures are given graceful life here by a cast memorably rounded out by Ery Nzaramba and Sean O\u2019Callaghan.Any sense that such scenes, with their homiletic wisdom, are ripe for parody is forestalled by the acting. It is a style of eloquent economy, which embraces wit as well as solemnity.Similarly, it would seem that the takeaway from \u201cBattlefield\u201d is hardly joy and sunshine. The stories it tells are rooted in the cyclical inevitability of war, of human self-destructiveness and the omnipresence of death, which claims its own whenever it chooses.Mr. O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s blind king Dritarashtra pretty much sums up the nature of this existence in the imprecations that begin \u201cBattlefield\u201d: \u201cAll the woes that we suffer in this life arise from the state of humanity!\u201dYet within \u2014 and beyond \u2014 this strife is the serenity that comes with distance, with the perspective of the long view and the patterns it reveals. In recent years, Mr. Brook, who is 91, has been moving toward an increasingly literal interpretation of his often cited idea of theater as an empty space, toward a distillation of spectacle into simplicity.Still, there remains a sort of wondrous spectacle in \u201cBattlefield,\u201d in its actors\u2019 use of cloaks and shawls (by Oria Puppo) to transform themselves into gods and animals; in the lushly saturated lighting of Phillippe Vialatte that conjures dawns and sunsets and conflagrations. Above all, there is the sound of the drumming by Toshi Tsuchitori, who was part of the original \u201cMahabharata,\u201d which comes to suggest the ineffable rhythm of life itself.You may be heartened to hear that the mystery of life \u2014 so brief, so cruel and so infinitely cherishable \u2014 is explained. Well, not to you. It\u2019s a secret that is shared on the stage. But somehow the rapt silence that follows this unheard revelation is deeply, warmly comforting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers Paid by Card Will Gain Protections in New York State", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorkers in New York State who receive their wages on prepaid cards will gain consumer protections next year that advocates say are among the strongest in the nation. The new rules are intended to guarantee that employees do not have to pay any fees to gain access to their paychecks.Under the new rules, released on Thursday by the New York State Department of Labor, employees who are paid on debit cards must be allowed to make unlimited, free withdrawals from their cards from at least one A.T.M. located \u201ca reasonable travel distance\u201d from their home or work.What qualifies as \u201creasonable\u201d will be left to employers and the Labor Department to interpret, according to an official in the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The rules also prohibit a host of incremental fees, including charges for monthly maintenance, account inactivity, overdrafts, checking a card\u2019s balance or contacting customer service.The cards are prevalent in the retail and service industries \u2014 Walmart and McDonald\u2019s are among the large companies that use them \u2014 and card issuers say they can be beneficial for employees who lack bank accounts by giving them a safer, more secure way to store their accrued wages and spend them.\u201cThese tough new standards protect some of our most vulnerable New Yorkers from predatory practices that seek to deny them a fair day\u2019s pay for a fair day\u2019s work,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s a more restrictive rule than we think is necessary,\u201d said Kenneth J.

By 2017, Aite predicts, more employees will be paid through payroll cards than paper checks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Few Expect China to Punish North Korea for Latest Nuclear Test", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe decision on Friday to publicly ignore stark evidence of Pyongyang\u2019s expanding nuclear capabilities illustrated the embarrassment that North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, poses for his patrons in Beijing.But although North Korea remains nearly 100 percent dependent on China for oil and food, Chinese analysts say Beijing will not modify its allegiance to North Korea or pressure the country to curtail its drive for a full-fledged nuclear arsenal, as the United States keeps requesting.\u201cThe United States cannot rely on China for North Korea,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cChina is closer to North Korea than the United States.\u201dChina sees living with a Communist-ruled nuclear-armed state on its border as preferable to the chaos of its collapse, Mr. Shi said. The Chinese leadership is confident that North Korea will not turn its weapons on China, and that China can control its neighbor by providing enough oil to keep its economy afloat.The alternative is a strategic nightmare for Beijing: a collapsed North Korean regime, millions of refugees piling into China and a unified Korean Peninsula under an American defense treaty.The American-supplied missile defenses in South Korea, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, have effectively killed any chance of China\u2019s cooperating with the United States, they said.\u201cChina is strongly opposed to North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons but at the same time opposes the defense system in South Korea,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, an assistant professor of international relations at Renmin University. It is not clear which situation the Chinese leadership is more agitated about, he said.Beijing interprets the Thaad deployment as another American effort to contain China. The system reinforces China\u2019s view that its alliance with North Korea is an integral part of China\u2019s strategic interests in Asia, with America\u2019s treaty allies Japan and South Korea and tens of thousands of American troops close by, Mr. Shi said.Washington insists that the Thaad system, due to be installed in 2017, is intended to defend South Korea against North Korean missiles, and is not aimed at China. The system \u201cdoes not change the strategic balance between the United States and China,\u201d President Obama said after meeting with Mr. Xi in Hangzhou, China, a week ago.But China is not persuaded. Chinese officials argue that the Thaad radar can detect Chinese missiles on the mainland, undermining its nuclear deterrent.So despite what Chinese analysts describe as the government\u2019s distaste for Mr. Kim and his unpredictable behavior, China\u2019s basic calculus on North Korea remains firm.Mr. Xi is expected to continue to ensure that North Korea remains stable. The Chinese leader, 63, has shown disdain for the much younger Mr. Kim, 32. He has not invited him to China, and has authorized only sporadic visits by Chinese officials to Pyongyang. The two militaries remain largely uninvolved with each other.But the personal and professional antagonisms do not alter Beijing\u2019s goal of preventing a unification of North and South Korea under an American defense arrangement.The longstanding fear that punitive economic action would destabilize North Korea makes it very unlikely that Beijing will cooperate with the United States on more stringent sanctions at the United Nations, according to Chinese analysts.In March, after considerable hesitation, China agreed to Washington\u2019s appeals and signed on to tough United Nations sanctions that included a ban on the export of North Korean coal.Meanwhile, the sanctions imposed in March have been enforced in only a desultory fashion, trade experts said.A loophole in the sanctions allows North Korean coal to be sold if the proceeds are used for humanitarian purposes, and that opening seems to have been exploited, said Stephan Haggard, a Korea expert at the University of California, San Diego.The sale of coal since the sanctions came into force was down 12 percent from the same period last year, a marginal amount, he said.On its own, the United States imposed so-called secondary sanctions on business entities that do business with North Korea and in the United States. But North Korean businesses have found Chinese partners or are creating front companies to use smaller Chinese banks, Mr. Haggard said.There are differing opinions in China about whether an oil embargo \u2014 an unlikely punishment \u2014 would result in Mr. Kim\u2019s giving up his weapons.If China stopped the flow of oil, North Korea would face a severe economic crisis in about one year, and then face a choice between keeping its economy going or maintaining its nuclear program, the former senior official said.It is possible that at that point, Mr. Kim would negotiate, the former official said.But others disagree, saying the Chinese government would not dare cut the oil supply, knowing that North Korea would be able to get supplies from Russia and elsewhere.\u201cThe fundamental reason for not cutting oil is they don\u2019t want to sacrifice the buffer zone, and they also know if they cut off the oil supply, it will not force Kim Jong-un to surrender his weapons,\u201d Mr. Shi said.Mr. Shi questioned why China would want to risk making North Korea into an enemy by cutting off the oil supply. \u201cIf you cut off the oil, there is a 50 percent possibility North Korea will not surrender their weapons, and they will hate China even more,\u201d he said.China\u2019s continued support of North Korea is a fundamental reason the United States should stop relying on China for progress on reducing the North Korean nuclear threat, said Joel Wit, a visiting scholar at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. Mr. Wit is among a group of American North Korea experts who believe the United States should take the lead and negotiate with the North.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a visiting scholar at the U.S.-Korean Institute at the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

{"Headline": "U.S. Suspends Construction on Part of North Dakota Pipeline", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBISMARCK, N.D. \u2014 The federal government on Friday temporarily blocked construction on part of a North Dakota oil pipeline, an unusual intervention in a prairie battle that has drawn thousands of Native Americans and activists to camp and demonstrate.In announcing the pause, the government acknowledged complaints from the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribal nations that their concerns had not been fully heard before federal overseers approved a pipeline that the tribe said could damage their water supplies and ancestral cultural sites. The Justice Department and other agencies called for \u201cserious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes\u2019 views on these types of infrastructure projects.\u201dThe tribe in a statement called the federal order \u201ca game changer.\u201dThe government said it would invite tribes to attend formal consultations about how they might work together on federal decisions on tribal lands and on whether future legislation is needed.In a joint statement from the Departments of Justice, the Interior and the Army, the government announced that the pause applied to the pipeline\u2019s path across a sliver of federal lands and under a dammed section of the Missouri River known as Lake Oahe. The lake, created by government-built dams a half-century ago, is a water source for the Standing Rock Sioux and a focal point of the dispute.The Army Corps of Engineers intends to review its previous decisions under federal environmental and other laws that had given approval for the pipeline. The government also urged the company building the pipeline to \u201cvoluntarily pause\u201d all construction for 40 miles around Lake Oahe. The rest of the pipeline construction would not be affected.Tribal leaders said they were heartened by the government\u2019s move and relieved that, for the time being, the Dakota Access pipeline would not be allowed to cross under their water supply. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a wrong that keeps continuing to happen, it\u2019s O.K. to stand up against that wrong. That\u2019s all we did,\u201d said David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful that agencies are starting to listen.\u201dFor supporters and opponents of the pipeline, it was a day of high-tension whiplash.The tribe had been bracing for a defeat in the courtroom. But the government\u2019s intervention surprised so many that the tribe and its supporters sent out news releases condemning the ruling as soon as it was handed down, and sharply reversed course once they realized that the government-ordered pause had scrambled the situation here.Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the MAIN Coalition, a pro-infrastructure group supporting the pipeline, hailed the judge\u2019s decision, but said the government\u2019s move was \u201cdeeply troubling and could have a long-lasting chilling effect on private infrastructure development in the United States.\u201d\u201cShould the administration ultimately stop this construction, it would set a horrific precedent,\u201d Mr. Stevens said in the statement. \u201cNo sane American company would dare expend years of effort and billions of dollars weaving through an onerous regulatory process receiving all necessary permits and agreements, only to be faced with additional regulatory impediments and be shut down halfway through completion of its project.\u201dThe company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, did not respond to a request for comment.It was unclear whether the company would heed the government\u2019s request to pause construction 20 miles to the east and west of Lake Oahe. After protests swelled recently and flared into violence last Saturday, construction work was halted near the site of the protest camp and the fields about a mile up the road where the pipeline is set to be buried.The company has previously said it has complied with every state and federal rule and gotten all the necessary permits to build the $3.7 billion pipeline. It has said the Dakota Access pipeline would create jobs, pump millions into local economies and provide a reliable way to transport oil from western North Dakota to pipeline networks in Illinois that was safer than hauling oil on trucks or trains.In his ruling, Judge James E. Boasberg of Federal District Court in Washington focused on efforts by the Army Corps to meet with the Standing Rock Sioux and others to work through possible issues with the pipeline, since \u201cthe Corps appears to have had little involvement in Dakota Access\u2019s early planning,\u201d the judge wrote, but \u201cThe writing was on the wall, however, that many DAPL permitting requests would eventually land in the Corps inbox.\u201dThe judge described a series of attempted meetings and missed communications between government and tribal officials; the judge suggested that the lack of cooperation was mostly on the part of the tribe, while \u201cthe Corps has documented dozens of attempts it made to consult with the Standing Rock Sioux from the fall of 2014 through the spring of 2016\u201d on the pipeline plan.Two days after the Corps approved what are known as preconstruction notifications on the pipeline, the tribes filed suit demanding that the permits be withdrawn.The judge said the efforts to obtain cooperation from the Standing Rock tribe were exhaustive, with dozens of attempts documented by the Corps to bring them to the table for discussion of Lake Oahe and other points of water crossings. The judge then wryly added: \u201cTo the reader\u2019s relief, the Court need not repeat them here. Suffice it to say that the Tribe largely refused to engage in consultations.\u201dThe meetings that the Corps was able to arrange, he wrote, \u201csufficed\u201d under the law.\u201cToday\u2019s news is a stunning development,\u201d said Jan Hasselman, a lawyer with Earthjustice, an environmental legal group that is representing the Standing Rock Sioux. \u201cIt vindicates what the tribe has been saying form the beginning: The process was wrong, and the legal standards for projects like these need reform.\u201dIt was unclear on Friday how long the government-ordered pause in construction around Lake Oahe might last, or whether the move had given the Standing Rock Sioux any greater odds of prevailing. But on Friday morning, tribal members said they had lived on the land for generation upon generation, and were prepared to stay through the fall, the winter and beyond.\u201cThey\u2019ll be here for years,\u201d said Jana Gipp, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, as she surveyed the camp\u2019s tents and teepees from a grassy bluff. \u201cThey won\u2019t give this up.\u201dJack Healy reported from Bismarck, and John Schwartz from New York.Advertisement"}

For one thing, she said, \u201cin addition to the risk-on rally in small stocks and emerging markets, there\u2019s also been a rally in \u2018risk off\u2019 assets lately.\u201d Long-term government bonds, for example, have returned double digits since the end of 2015, as have some of the most defensive sectors of the market that aren\u2019t economically sensitive, such as utilities.In fact, the outperformance of small stocks and emerging-market shares could be explained just as much by a desire to be cautious as aggressive.Take small-company stocks.Small-capitalization stocks are known for outperforming the broad market in the early-to-mid stages of an economic expansion \u2014 typically when growth expectations really begin to heat up \u2014 but not in the seventh year of a recovery.Small-company American stocks also have another characteristic, one that explains their popularity right now: \u201cThey are one of the purest ways to invest in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world,\u201d said Lewis J. Altfest, a New York financial planner.Small domestic companies tend to be far less reliant on foreign sales than large multinational corporations. Small stocks \u201care likely to have 80 to 85 percent domestic exposure,\u201d said Christopher S. Beck, chief investment officer for the small-cap and midcap value equity team at Delaware Investments. \u201cMidcap stocks are usually around 65 to 70 percent domestic. And large stocks are right around 50 percent.\u201dWhy is this important?Despite the underwhelming rate of economic growth domestically, the economy is still growing significantly faster in the United States than in other parts of the developed world. Gross domestic product in the United States, for example, is expected to grow 2.4 percent next year, according to I.H.S. Global Insight. By comparison, the economy in the eurozone is projected to advance just 1.2 percent in 2017, while Japan\u2019s G.D.P. is forecast to rise 0.7 percent.So a bet on the United States economy could be interpreted as a way to try to play it safe.Moreover, Mr. Beck said, \u201cWhen we came into this year, people were expecting anywhere from two to four interest rate hikes.\u201d That hasn\u2019t happened so far, and it has worked out well for small-company stocks.One reason is that rising rates in the United States typically prompt demand for the dollar as global investors seek higher yields. A strengthening dollar is often bad for American corporate profits, because it makes goods produced in the United States more expensive for foreign buyers.Mr. Beck said investors may have added to their stake in small stocks \u2014 while reducing their exposure to large multinationals \u2014 as a hedge against a potential rise in the dollar earlier in the year. But when the Fed decided against raising rates even as the economy showed modest signs of improvement, investors felt comfortable leaving that bet in place, he said.The Fed\u2019s decision to hold off on rate increases so far this year also helps explain the jump in emerging market equities.Central banks around the world have been lowering rates this year, \u201cincentivizing investors to seek out risky assets,\u201d said Brian D. Singer, head of the dynamic allocation strategies at the asset manager William Blair. The Fed\u2019s delay in raising rates has helped this cause.But Mr. Singer describes the rally in emerging market equities this year as a \u201creluctant, not euphoric, embrace of risk.\u201dHe noted that one reason emerging market stocks had done so well was that \u201cinvestors have run out of places to go.\u201d In their favor, volatile emerging-market shares have already been beaten up for several years and trade at relatively cheap valuations compared with American or other developed-market foreign equities.The question is, how will these assets react if the Fed begins to lift rates sometime this year?Investors may have gotten a hint on Friday, when the markets sold off after a few comments from Fed officials were interpreted as a sign that rates could rise soon. Small stocks sank 2.8 percent, versus a drop of 2.1 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average.Widespread expectations that the Fed will finally start to move could shift investor psychology, said Jason Brady, chief executive at Thornburg Investment Management.By keeping short-term rates near zero, the Fed has been suppressing overall market volatility while making assets like emerging-market stocks more desirable. If the market is convinced that the Fed might soon raise rates, it could hurt riskier asset classes that have been benefiting from the relative calm in the broad market, Mr. Brady said.\u201cPerhaps things won\u2019t evolve the same way as they did in December through January,\u201d he said. He was referring to the Fed\u2019s 0.25 percentage point increase in the benchmark Fed funds rate last December, which precipitated a 12 percent loss for small stocks from mid-December to late January and a 13 percent drop for emerging-market shares. The markets have since recovered, and investors may have forgotten the pain of those declines.\u201cI suspect,\u201d Mr. Brady said, \u201cthat at the least, we will continue to learn the lesson that the Fed funds rate matters a lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Love for Putin: a Presidential Role Model", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 What is striking about Donald J. Trump\u2019s latest effusion of admiration for Russia\u2019s stony-faced leader, Vladimir V. Putin, is how similar it is to the way Mr. Putin is portrayed in Russia: as a necessary foil for an aggressive and flawed American leadership.\u201cHe\u2019s been a leader,\u201d he said of Mr. Putin, \u201cfar more than our president has been a leader.\u201dNot surprisingly, Hillary Clinton, campaigning to be Mr. Obama\u2019s Democratic successor, sharply criticized the remarks on Thursday. So did some fellow Republicans, including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, who listed many of the reasons Mr. Putin amounts to an adversary of the United States, not a potential ally.But Mr. Trump\u2019s view of the Russian president is not uncommon among those who have used him as a measure of Mr. Obama\u2019s standing in the world \u2014 or more generally the United States\u2019 standing as the world\u2019s dominant superpower.In Russia, it is at the heart of the depiction of Mr. Putin as the bulwark against a conspiring United States. It underlies Mr. Putin\u2019s attractiveness to nationalist parties in Europe dismayed by what they view as feckless leadership in the face of economic difficulties and the challenge of immigration. And it is shared by those in the Middle East who see Russia\u2019s intervention in Syria on behalf of its embattled president, Bashar al-Assad as decisive, and not hesitant and convoluted, as American policy has been.In 2013, when Mr. Putin brokered an agreement to collect and destroy most of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons, thus averting American-led airstrikes that Mr. Obama had threatened, Matt Drudge of the conservative Drudge Report called Mr. Putin, perhaps archly, the \u201cleader of the free world.\u201d The editors of Forbes magazine ranked him as the most influential world leader, a purely symbolic honorific he has lost and regained since \u2014 but one that is trumpeted inside Russia.\u201cI think he genuinely admires Putin as a strongman who gets things done,\u201d said Angela E. Stent, a professor at Georgetown University, referring to Mr. Trump.What achievements of Mr. Putin\u2019s does Mr. Trump admire? \u201cEverybody pays attention to him,\u201d Ms. Stent said, adding that Russia\u2019s military operations in Syria since last year have put him back in the center of international diplomacy.Mr. Trump emphasized in his interview with NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer that he did not necessarily endorse the political system Mr. Putin has erected, but again used the line of questioning to talk about the United States being a divided country because of comparatively weak leadership.Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international studies and associate dean at the New School, noted a shared characteristic in the two men: that of a tough authoritarian leader, or put another way, a schoolyard tough refusing to back down from a fight (an image Mr. Putin himself has used to describe his childhood).\u201cWanting to be a firm and powerful leader who can stare people down like Putin is clearly something Trump aspires to,\u201d Ms. Khrushcheva said.Mr. Trump, as before, ignored the many issues that divide the United States and Russia, and it is far from clear that a Trump presidency, pleasantries aside, would augur a significant warming of relations between the two countries.Mr. Trump instead repeated an offhand comment the Russian had for Mr. Trump. In unscripted remarks in December Mr. Putin used a Russian adjective \u2014 \u201cyarki\u201d \u2014 that Mr. Trump has said means brilliant, though it can also mean colorful or flamboyant. \u201cIf he says great things about me, I\u2019m going to say great things about him,\u201d he said.After referring to the photograph of the staring match, Mr. Trump noted that Russia wanted to defeat the Islamic State as badly as the United States does. \u201cIf we have a relationship with Russia, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we could work together on it and knock the hell out of ISIS,\u201d he said.Mr. Putin would certainly welcome a more agreeable administration in Washington, though he has offered no concessions that might encourage a change in policy in Syria or anywhere else. But his views of the American election and the two main candidates seem more nuanced than the favorable treatment Mr. Trump receives in the Kremlin-controlled news media.Mr. Myers is the author of \u201cThe New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin.\u201dJennifer Steinhauer and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Industrial Farms Are Good for the Environment", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorStillwater, Okla. \u2014 There is much to like about small, local farms and their influence on what we eat. But if we are to sustainably deal with problems presented by population growth and climate change, we need to look to the farmers who grow a majority of the country\u2019s food and fiber.Large farmers \u2014 who are responsible for 80 percent of the food sales in the United States, though they make up fewer than 8 percent of all farms, according to 2012 data from the Department of Agriculture \u2014 are among the most progressive, technologically savvy growers on the planet. Their technology has helped make them far gentler on the environment than at any time in history. And a new wave of innovation makes them more sustainable still.There are legitimate fears about soil erosion, manure lagoons, animal welfare and nitrogen runoff at large farms \u2014 but it\u2019s not just environmental groups that worry. Farmers are also concerned about fertilizer use and soil runoff.That\u2019s one reason they\u2019re turning to high-tech solutions like precision agriculture. Using location-specific information about soil nutrients, moisture and productivity of the previous year, new tools, known as \u201cvariable rate applicators,\u201d can put fertilizer only on those areas of the field that need it (which may reduce nitrogen runoff into waterways).GPS signals drive many of today\u2019s tractors, and new planters are allowing farmers to distribute seed varieties to diverse spots of a field to produce more food from each unit of land. They also modulate the amount and type of seed on each part of a field \u2014 in some places, leaving none at all.Many food shoppers have difficulty comprehending the scale and complexity facing modern farmers, especially those who compete in a global marketplace. For example, the median lettuce field is managed by a farmer who has 1,373 football fields of that plant to oversee.For tomatoes, the figure is 620 football fields; for wheat, 688 football fields; for corn, 453 football fields.How are farmers able to manage growing crops on this daunting scale? Decades ago, they dreamed about tools to make their jobs easier, more efficient and better for the land: soil sensors to measure water content, drones, satellite images, alternative management techniques like low- and no-till farming, efficient irrigation and mechanical harvesters.Today, that technology is a regular part of operations at large farms. Farmers watch the evolution of crop prices and track thunderstorms on their smartphones. They use livestock waste to create electricity using anaerobic digesters, which convert manure to methane. Drones monitor crop yields, insect infestations and the location and health of cattle. Innovators are moving high-value crops indoors to better control water use and pests.Before \u201cfactory farming\u201d became a pejorative, agricultural scholars of the mid-20th century were calling for farmers to do just that \u2014 become more factorylike and businesslike. From that time, farm sizes have risen significantly. It is precisely this large size that is often criticized today in the belief that large farms put profit ahead of soil and animal health.But increased size has advantages, especially better opportunities to invest in new technologies and to benefit from economies of scale. Buying a $400,000 combine that gives farmers detailed information on the variations in crop yield in different parts of the field would never pay on just five acres of land; at 5,000 acres, it is a different story.These technologies reduce the use of water and fertilizer and harm to the environment. Modern seed varieties, some of which were brought about by biotechnology, have allowed farmers to convert to low- and no-till cropping systems, and can encourage the adoption of nitrogen-fixing cover crops such as clover or alfalfa to promote soil health.Herbicide-resistant crops let farmers control weeds without plowing, and the same technology allows growers to kill off cover crops if they interfere with the planting of cash crops. The herbicide-resistant crops have some downsides: They can lead to farmers\u2019 using more herbicide (though the type of herbicide is important, and the new crops have often led to the use of safer, less toxic ones).But in most cases, it\u2019s a trade-off worth making, because they enable no-till farming methods, which help prevent soil erosion.Improvements in agricultural technologies and production practices have significantly lowered the use of energy and water, and greenhouse-gas emissions of food production per unit of output over time. United States crop production now is twice what it was in 1970.That would not be a good change if more land, water, pesticides and labor were being used. But that is not what happened: Agriculture is using nearly half the labor and 16 percent less land than it did in 1970.Instead, farmers increased production through innovation. Wheat breeders, for example, using traditional techniques assisted by the latest genetic tools and information, have created varieties that resist disease without numerous applications of insecticides and fungicides. Nearly all corn and soybean farmers practice crop rotation, giving soil a chance to recover. Research is moving beyond simple measures of nitrogen and phosphorus content to look at the microbes in the soil.New industrywide initiatives are focused on quantifying and measuring soil health. The goal is to provide measurements of factors affecting the long-term value of the soil and to identify which practices \u2014 organic, conventional or otherwise \u2014 will ensure that farmers can responsibly produce plenty of food for our grandchildren.Over the past century, there has been a notable shift in Americans\u2019 connection with food production. In 1900, about 40 percent of the United States population was on the farm, and 60 percent lived in rural areas. Today the respective figures are only about 1 percent and 20 percent. From the 1940s to the 1980s, the number of farms fell by more than half, and average farm size tripled. A result is that romantic, pastoral images of farming from yesteryear are far from representing reality.Big problems face farmers and consumers. Climate change, food waste, growing world population, drought and water quality are just a few.There are no easy answers, but innovation, entrepreneurship and technology have important roles to play. So, too, do the real-life large farmers who grow the bulk of our food.Jayson Lusk, a professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, is the author of \u201cUnnaturally Delicious: How Science and Technology are Serving Up Superfoods to Save the World.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Official Says She Favors \u2018Prudence\u2019 in Raising Interest Rates", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor and a leading proponent of the Fed\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy, said in a speech on Monday that she still favored \u201cprudence\u201d in raising interest rates despite recent signs of economic progress.The remarks reinforce expectations that the Fed will not raise its benchmark interest rate when its policy-making committee meets on Sept. 20 and 21, and investors celebrated accordingly. Stocks rose and interest rates fell, reversing much of the market movement on Friday, when investors worried the Fed might move toward a rate increase.The Fed also faced new pressure from Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who said on Monday on CNBC that the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, was keeping rates low \u201cbecause she\u2019s obviously political and doing what Obama wants her to do.\u201dMs. Yellen \u201cshould be ashamed of herself,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of Ms. Yellen and the Fed breaks with the general practice of presidents and presidential candidates in recent decades to refrain from criticizing the Fed\u2019s conduct of monetary policy. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, castigated Mr. Trump last week for similar remarks.\u201cWords have consequences,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told reporters. \u201cWords move markets. Words can be misinterpreted. Words can have effects on people\u2019s 401(k)\u2019s, their pension funds, their stock portfolios.\u201d\u201cHe should not be adding the Fed onto his long list of institutions and individuals that he is maligning,\u201d she added.Fed officials insist they will not consider the political consequences of increasing rates. They may, however, hesitate to act before the November election out of concern for the economic consequences of political turbulence, the same way they hesitated before Britain\u2019s referendum in June on its membership in the European Union.Ms. Brainard said recent economic data raised some questions about the strength of growth, and there was certainly no sign of resurgent inflation. \u201cIn the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market,\u201d she told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.She added that the context in which the Fed operates had also changed. A global decline in market interest rates means that the force of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign has been reduced even without a rate increase. Moreover, she noted that the weakness of the global economy continued to weigh on the United States, contributing to an environment of persistently low growth and low inflation.Finally, she said that she remained more concerned about moving too quickly than waiting too long. The Fed has few tools to ward off fresh weakness in the economy, while it can easily respond to an inflationary resurgence.\u201cThis asymmetry in risk management in today\u2019s new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation,\u201d Ms. Brainard said. \u201cI believe that this approach has served us well.\u201dDaniel Tarullo, another Fed governor, said in a CNBC interview on Friday that he too favored patience. Mr. Tarullo described himself as a member of the \u201c\u2018show-me\u2019 camp\u201d that wants to see evidence of stronger inflation before raising rates. So far, he said, there is not enough. \u201cFrom my personal perspective, I think we have an opportunity to continue to get employment gains,\u201d Mr. Tarullo said.Other officials argue that inflation always follows stronger growth; if the Fed waits for the inevitable increase, they warn, the Fed may need to raise rates more sharply, causing a recession.Mr. Tarullo said in the interview, however, that officials who took this view should still have hesitations about the outlook for growth. He described the recent economic data as a mixed bag.Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \u2014 and, like Mr. Rosengren, one of the 10 Fed officials with a policy vote this year \u2014 has expressed concern that low rates are encouraging excessive speculation, birthing future financial crises.Fed officials still could coalesce around a late-year rate increase, as they did last year. After September, the Fed has two more meetings on the calendar, in November and December.Asked what it would take to win her vote, Ms. Brainard said she would like to see more inflation. She also noted recent weakness in some economic measures like corporate profits and investment.\u201cIt would be important, I think, to see some of those spending indicators starting to really move in a more positive direction going into the third and fourth quarter,\u201d Ms. Brainard said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bangladeshi Traffic Jam That Never Ends", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf all the dysfunctions that plague the world\u2019s megacities, none may be more pernicious than bad (really, really bad) traffic. Sitting still in Dhaka, where bad design takes on epic proportions.I WAS IN DHAKA, which is to say I was stuck in traffic. The proposition might more accurately be phrased the other way around: I was stuck in traffic, therefore I was in Dhaka. If you spend some time in Bangladesh\u2019s capital, you begin to look anew at the word \u201ctraffic,\u201d and to revise your definition. In other cities, there are vehicles and pedestrians on the roads; occasionally, the roads get clogged, and progress is impeded. The situation in Dhaka is different. Dhaka\u2019s traffic is traffic in extremis, a state of chaos so pervasive and permanent that it has become the city\u2019s organizing principle. It\u2019s the weather of the city, a storm that never lets up.Dhakaites will tell you that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t understand traffic, that the worst traffic jam in Mumbai or Cairo or Los Angeles is equivalent to a good day for Dhaka\u2019s drivers. Experts agree. In the 2016 Global Liveability Survey, the quality of life report issued annually by the Economist Intelligence Unit, Dhaka ranked 137th out of 140 cities, edging out only Lagos, Tripoli and war-torn Damascus; its infrastructure rating was the worst of any city in the survey. Like other megacities of the developing world, Dhaka is both a boomtown and a necropolis, with a thriving real-estate market, a growing middle class and a lively cultural and intellectual life that is offset by rampant misery: poverty, pollution, disease, political corruption, extremist violence and terror attacks. But it is traffic that has sealed Dhaka\u2019s reputation among academics and development specialists as the great symbol of 21st-century urban dysfunction, the world\u2019s most broken city. It has made Dhaka a surreal place, a town that is both frenetic and paralyzed, and has altered the rhythms of daily life for its 17.5 million-plus residents. Not long ago, the Dhaka-based Daily Star newspaper published an article titled \u201c5 Things to Do While Stuck in Traffic.\u201d Suggested activities included \u201ccatching up with friends,\u201d reading and journaling.The first chapter of my own Dhaka journal begins in March of last year, on a highway that runs south from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport into the center of town. If you do a web search for this stretch of road, you may come across a Facebook page titled \u201cHighway to Hell, Airport Road.\u201d Photographs posted online reveal the nature of the hell, aerial shots capturing a scrum of automobiles strewn at odd angles across eight lanes of road. It looks like a Matchbox set that has been scattered by an angry toddler: the morning commute as a cosmic temper tantrum.These images had me prepared for the worst. Yet on my flight to Dhaka I was told that the traffic in the city would be unusually light. For weeks, Bangladesh had been gripped by a hartal, a nationwide general strike and \u201ctransportation blockade.\u201d The hartal, called by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, was an effort to pressure Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina into holding new elections. The strike had disrupted everyday life in the capital, with street demonstrations and sporadic violence causing Dhaka\u2019s denizens to curb their normal routines. It had accomplished the seemingly impossible, breaking the logjam on Dhaka\u2019s streets. A Bangladeshi on my flight explained the situation. \u201cIn Dhaka, you have either horrible traffic or really horrible traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the hartal, there will be almost no traffic. Traffic will be O.K.\u201dHorrible traffic, really horrible traffic, almost no traffic, O.K. traffic \u2014 it takes just a few minutes in Dhaka to realize that these are not scientific terms. When my plane touched down I caught a taxi, which exited the airport into a roundabout before making its way onto the infamous highway. There, unmistakably, was a traffic jam: cars and trucks, as far the eye could see, stacked up in a configuration that bore no clear relationship to the lanes painted on the blacktop. My cab nosed into the convoy. Whereupon a crawl commenced.The traffic rolled south for 20 seconds. The traffic stopped. My cab idled for a couple of minutes at a dead standstill. Then, for mysterious reasons, it crept forward again. Occasionally, the traffic would flow unimpeded for a minute or so, reaching a clip of perhaps 15 miles per hour. But soon we\u2019d lurch to a halt again. It was the kind of stop-and-go routine I\u2019d experienced on American interstates, the \u201cbumper-to-bumper\u201d conditions that traffic reporters describe on news radio, shouting something about a jackknifed tractor-trailer over thumping helicopter rotors. In this case, though, the problem was not an accident. The problem was Dhaka.It was hot and I was jet-lagged. I dozed off. When I snapped awake, about an hour later, the congestion had thickened and the scenery had turned frantic. We were in the heart of the city now, penned in by surging pedestrians and hundreds of vehicles competing for space on a wide road called Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue. There were passenger cars and puttering three-wheeled auto-\u00adrickshaws. There were buses so vacuum-packed with passengers that many riders were forced onto the exterior, clinging to open doorways and crouched on rooftop luggage racks. There were cargo tricycles, known locally as \u201cvans,\u201d heading to markets bearing heaping payloads of bamboo, watermelons, metal pipes, eggs, live animals. And, of course, there were the iconic Dhaka passenger vehicles, bicycle rickshaws. Officially, rickshaws are banned on major thoroughfares like Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, but there they were, in vast phalanxes, their bicycle bells pealing above the roar of the traffic jam.Eventually, my taxi reached a roundabout, and we turned left onto another thoroughfare, the Panthapath Tejgaon Link Road. There, the cabdriver executed a U-turn and a tricky sequence of maneuvers to win a place in a feeder lane that permitted entrance to the driveway of my hotel. The lane was empty: our final hundred yards of terrain to travel, and our first stretch of open road. The distance from airport to hotel was eight and a half miles. The trip had taken two and a half hours. We wheeled into the hotel\u2019s driveway and the cabby spun around to offer his verdict. \u201cSome traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cNot so bad.\u201d\u201cBANGLADESH IS NOT so much a nation as a condition of distress,\u201d wrote the journalist William Langewiesche in 2000. It sounds like an overstatement, but to behold the gridlocked streets of Dhaka is to see distress in action, or rather, in inaction. The stalled traffic in the capital city is symptomatic of the nation\u2019s broader woes, in particular population growth, which is moderate by the standards of the developing world, but disastrous given the size of Bangladesh.Fundamentally, traffic is an issue of density: It\u2019s what happens when too many people try to squeeze through too small a space. Bangladesh is the 12th most densely settled nation on earth, but with an estimated 160 million citizens it is by far the most populous, and the poorest, of the countries at the top of the list. To put the matter in different terms: The landmass of Bangladesh is one-118th the size of Russia, but its population exceeds Russia\u2019s by more than 25 million.Bangladesh\u2019s density problem is magnified in Dhaka, in part because, practically speaking, Dhaka is Bangladesh. Nearly all of the country\u2019s government, business, health care and educational institutions, and a large percentage of its jobs, are concentrated in Dhaka. Each year, 400,000 new residents pour into the capital, a mass migration that has made Dhaka the world\u2019s most densely settled megacity, and one of the fastest growing.The town that those millions inhabit almost completely lacks the basic infrastructure and rule of law that make big cities navigable. There are just 60 traffic lights in Dhaka, and they are more or less ornamental; few drivers heed them. The main problem with Dhaka\u2019s anarchic streets, though, is that there aren\u2019t enough. The Daily Star has reported that just 7 percent of Dhaka is covered by roads. (In places like Paris and Barcelona, models of 19th-century urban planning, the number is around 30 percent.) Footpaths are also an issue. There are too few sidewalks in Dhaka, and those that exist are often impassable, occupied by vendors and masses of poor citizens who make their homes in curbside shanties.The usual solution to congestion in cities like Dhaka is to move commuters under the streets rather than over them. But Dhaka has no subway, and no concrete plans to build one. The problem is compounded by the growing status-symbol appeal of private transport: a vogue for automobiles among Dhaka\u2019s middle classes that is adding tens of thousands of new vehicles to the city\u2019s streets every year.By the government\u2019s own estimate, Dhaka\u2019s traffic jams eat up 3.2 million working hours each day and drain billions of dollars from the city\u2019s economy annually. Traffic takes another kind of toll on the lives and minds of Dhakaites. \u201cThe city is atomized,\u201d says Sarwar Jahan, a professor of urban and regional planning at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. \u201cPeople cannot socialize because of the traffic problems. You can only occasionally go to a friend\u2019s house or relatives. It simply takes too long.\u201dIt is wrong, in other words, to speak of Dhaka\u2019s traffic as an inconvenience; even \u201ccrisis\u201d is too mild a term. Adnan Morshed, an associate professor of architecture and planning at the Catholic University of America, has called Dhaka\u2019s congestion \u201ca vast urban pathology\u201d that \u201ccontinues to kill.\u201d Bangladesh\u2019s thriving textile industry has given the nation\u2019s economy a jolt, but analysts warn that if the capital cannot solve its traffic and infrastructure problem, such gains will prove fleeting \u2014 that progress itself may grind to a standstill. Jammed-up roads are the indelible image of Dhaka\u2019s agony. They may also be its single greatest cause.DHAKA\u2019S TRAFFIC OVERLOAD is a sensory overload. You can smell and taste it: The exhaust fumes tickle your nostrils and coat your mouth, leaving an acrid taste on your tongue. You can \u2014 often, you must \u2014 reach out and touch the traffic, executing defensive hand-check maneuvers to ward off vehicles and fellow pedestrians as you scramble across packed streets.But the traffic hits you most forcefully in your ears. Some historians claim that the city\u2019s name derives from the dhak, a big drum with a clattering sound. True or not, there\u2019s no mistaking the pounding that the city gives to your auditory nerves. Traffic is Dhaka\u2019s deafening music, a dissonant theme song of shouting drivers, rumbling engines and, leading the attack, honking horns: vocals, bass, ill-tuned brass.That din is the sound of aggression. Dhaka\u2019s drivers may be the most brutish and pitiless on earth. They may also be some of the best, if your idea of skillful driving is expansive enough to include the lawlessness and daredevilry that Dhaka demands.One afternoon I hailed an auto-rickshaw near the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium and took a long, meandering journey through some of the city\u2019s most heavily trafficked streets. Dhakaites call auto-rickshaws \u201cCNGs,\u201d because they run on compressed natural gas. They\u2019re the kind of vehicles you find all over urban Asia, essentially small metal boxes, propped atop three wheels and divided into two tiny compartments, one for the driver, and another, slightly larger but still a tight squeeze, for passengers. In Dhaka, they\u2019re painted forest green, nearly all of them are dirty and dinged up, and they make a lot of loud, unpleasant noise snarling through the streets. They\u2019re scruffy, ornery little machines, the piratical cousins of golf carts.My CNG was piloted by an unsmiling man who looked to be in his late 20s. On the road, he was relentless. He vied for every centimeter of roadway in thick traffic and sped as fast as possible when congestion eased. We were in one of the busiest parts of town now, on Bir Uttam Rafiqul Islam Avenue, a wide street lined with malls and crammed with shoppers. Another mall, of a sort, had sprung up on the road itself. In Dhaka, a traffic jam is an economic opportunity: Vehicles are descended on by vendors hawking bottles of water, peeled cucumbers, books. Crime is an issue, too. Once, CNGs had no doors, but wire doors were added as protection from muggers who prey on riders in stalled traffic. Enterprising thieves have been known to drop in on passengers, clambering on top of CNGs and slicing through their canvas roofing to gain entry. The weapon of choice for some muggers is Tiger Balm, the heat rub, which they smear on victims\u2019 eyes to disable them.My driver\u2019s modus operandi was to keep his CNG in motion no matter what, even in chock-a-block conditions. When he couldn\u2019t push the thing forward vertically, he moved horizontally, crossing lanes of traffic by beating out a nattering pattern on his horn, nosing his way in between vehicles and forcing other drivers to budge in turn, even if the only movement possible was an inch or two. He kept repeating two syllables, barking at fellow commuters in between horn blasts: \u201cAs-tay!\u201d he cried. \u201cAs-tay! As-tay! As-tay!\u201d Later, I asked a friend who speaks Bengali to translate the word for me. Aste, it turns out, means \u201cslowly, gently.\u201dThere is one form of transportation in Dhaka that might be deemed gentle, at least by the city\u2019s hard-as-nails standards. Bicycle rickshaws are the quaintest and most ubiquitous of all the vehicles on Dhaka\u2019s streets. No one is certain about the size of the city\u2019s rickshaw fleet. (Only a fraction of the vehicles are officially licensed.) Most estimates put the number upward of 200,000; some reckon there are several times that many.Arguing about rickshaws is as big a pastime in Dhaka as riding them. There have been many proposals to ban the machines, but the efforts have always been beaten back. Some contend that rickshaws are the vehicles best-suited to traffic-choked roads, and the most environmentally friendly. Others say that they are inefficient, that four rickshaws rolling abreast on a Dhaka street take up the square footage of a bus while transporting just eight passengers.One thing that everyone agrees on is that Dhaka\u2019s rickshaws look great. They have been called \u201cmoving museums.\u201d They\u2019re elaborately appliqu\u00e9d with tinsel and tassels; their frames bear colorful paintings of flowers, movie-star portraits, heroic images of Bangladesh\u2019s 1971 war of independence, pastoral and urban scenes. Scrutinize the cityscapes painted on rickshaws and you will note an irony. Invariably they show a dreamily placid city, with swooping birds and sunsets blazing behind turreted towers. As for the roads depicted in the paintings: They are tidy, tranquil, serenely traffic-free.FOR THE FORESEEABLE future, those rickshaw paintings are the closest thing to orderly street scenes that you\u2019ll find in Dhaka. When experts are asked about solutions to the city\u2019s woes, they recite a familiar litany. They talk about traffic lights, dedicated rickshaw lanes, arterial roads, light rail. They speak of decentralization, of easing the burden on Dhaka by developing secondary cities like Chittagong and Khulna. The government, for its part, is touting the 12-mile-long, $1.14 billion Dhaka Elevated Expressway, whose construction began in August of 2015. But skepticism about such projects runs deep in Dhaka, where progress has so often been stymied by government ineptitude and corruption.In the meantime, the capital\u2019s roadways seethe. It takes just a few days in Dhaka to acclimate, and to develop an affection for the city\u2019s impregnable streets. For a greenhorn, the traffic offers a novel perspective on an alien city. I learned to appreciate the way that 360 degrees of stacked-up traffic transformed sight lines, collapsing space and perspective, shattering Dhaka\u2019s scenery into Cubist shards: splashes of color; a flash of a painted sign on a wall; a glimpse of a driver\u2019s beard in his truck\u2019s rearview mirror; a pile of corrugated metal siding, surreally floating a dozen feet in the air, the payload of an unseen cargo tricycle.I knew, of course, that it was unseemly for a visitor from one of the world\u2019s richest cities to aestheticize the chaos and dysfunction of one of its poorest. Traffic in Dhaka is not just a nuisance. It is poverty, it\u2019s injustice, it\u2019s suffering.Yet nearly everyone I met in Dhaka spoke of the traffic as a trial by fire, a test of mettle, a horror that is also a perverse source of pride. One woman, a lifelong Dhaka resident, told me she \u201cmissed the jams\u201d when she lived abroad: In the big cities of Europe and America, the relative lack of congestion unnerved her. When you make it through a day in Dhaka, when you make it across a snarled intersection, you have triumphed against the odds, and over the gods. The town puts you in a philosophical frame of mind. Dhaka teaches that travel is hell, but it also reminds you of the primitive wonder of travel, the truth that, to complete any journey, no matter how quotidian, is to conquer space, and \u2014 depending just how awful the congestion is on the Mirpur Road \u2014 to subdue time.When the day came for my return to New York, I\u2019d been in Dhaka long enough to have learned its golden rule of commuting: Leave early. So I arranged for a wake-up call and at 4:45 a.m., more than five hours before my flight\u2019s boarding time, I staggered into a waiting taxi. The cabdriver assured me that the traffic at that hour would not be so bad.Lo and behold, he was right. The sun hadn\u2019t yet risen, and the taxi went hurtling through the black streets of central Dhaka. There was no traffic \u2014 zilch. We gained the Airport Road, and whizzed faster still. I watched the kilometers tick off on the dashboard speedometer and I rolled down my window. As the taxi revved past 50 miles per hour, we seemed to be flying.Then, a mile or so south of our destination, a formation of cars and trucks and CNGs pressed up against us, the taxi slowed and suddenly we were earthbound again: on a jammed-up road in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We stopped, we started, we stopped again. The cause of the congestion was unclear, but it was obvious that I\u2019d have no trouble making my flight. So I relaxed: I was going to relish the madness one last time. Eventually, the speedometer nudged a hair above five miles per hour, and as we started to crawl forward again, a thought stole into my mind, proof that Dhaka had done its work on me. You call this traffic? C\u2019mon. This isn\u2019t traffic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Port Chester Wants to Grow, but Exactly How Is the Question", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetPORT CHESTER, N.Y. \u2014 The mayor of this compact, working-class village bordering Connecticut can\u2019t resist the comparison. Like so many boosters of their own towns, he invokes a New York City borough\u2019s name as he describes changes to Port Chester over the last few years. Yes, he calls it \u201cthe Brooklyn of Westchester County.\u201d\u201cMillennials are moving here from the outer boroughs and other places because of the bang for the buck,\u201d said the mayor, Dennis G. Pilla. \u201cThe village is going through a transformation.\u201dBut the gentrifying of this former industrial center is also generating tension, particularly as the village considers its biggest development proposal yet. Starwood Capitol Group, of neighboring Greenwich, Conn., wants to build a $300 million, mixed-use development on an abandoned hospital campus at the edge of downtown and near Interstate 287.\u201cThis is a gateway project for Port Chester, which is really an up-and-coming urban place in the county,\u201d said Ken Narva, a managing partner at Street-Works Development, Starwood\u2019s lead consultant on the project.\u201cWe say, \u2018If you want to be able to double the size of your project, what does the community get out of it?\u2019\u201d said Christopher Calabrese, an organizer for the Communications Workers of America Local 1103, based in Port Chester, and a founder of the alliance.Among the group\u2019s other members are the Metallic Lathers and Reinforcing Iron Workers Local 46, the Building and Construction Trades Council of Westchester and Putnam Counties, the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. and a local Presbyterian church.Community benefits agreements, or contracts between a developer and community-based organizations, are more common on the West Coast than the East, but they have been tried with varying degrees of success in New York City.Julian Gross, a lawyer in San Francisco who specializes in community benefit agreements, said they are becoming more common in urban areas in blue states. He recommended that they be broadly beneficial to be effective.\u201cCities are completely within their rights to decide what kind of project they want to see if they\u2019re going to be giving tax breaks and increasing density,\u201d said Mr. Gross, who advised New Rochelle. \u201cThe density is a tremendous increase in concrete economic value for the developer.\u201dMr. Narva of Street-Works Development said that in his experience, separate agreements usually become unaffordable for the developer. In this case, he said, he believes the alliance \u201cis pursuing a goal that is focused on the needs of one segment of that population, which most likely isn\u2019t even Port Chester-based: organized labor.\u201dStarwood has not yet agreed to meet with the alliance. In the meantime, the group has been pressing its case for stronger community benefits in public hearings and written comments on the plan. As part of its development plan, the company has proposed a one-time, upfront payment of $1 million to a fund for job training, housing or some other community need in return for the density increase. A consultant hired by the village to review the plan has recommended $2.4 million to $3.4 million.Also proposed are reimbursement fees to the school district if the number of school-age children living in the development exceeds the number projected.The company is seeking some tax breaks from the village\u2019s industrial development authority, including a 20-year payment-in-lieu-of-taxes program to help compensate for what it has said are \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d redevelopment costs. The village\u2019s consultant agreed that some reduction in property tax payments is warranted for the project to be financially feasible.Starwood estimates the project will generate some 1,800 construction jobs, and after completion, 970 continuing jobs.That could be a much-needed boost for Port Chester, which has a population of 29,000 and has struggled for several decades. The median household income is around $56,000 \u2014 less than half of that in neighboring Greenwich \u2014 and about three-quarters of the students in the Port Chester-Rye School District participate in the free-lunch program, according to the village\u2019s comprehensive plan. (Port Chester is within the town of Rye.)Once home to major manufacturers like Life Savers and Arnold Bread, Port Chester began to decline in the 1970s as the factories moved out. \u201cIn the 1980s, urban decay set in,\u201d Mr. Pilla said. \u201cA lot of storefronts closed.\u201dA new wave of immigrants subsequently poured in, mainly Hispanic, and their influence now defines Port Chester\u2019s downtown, which is dominated by restaurants serving Central and South American cuisine, as well as salons, small groceries and fish markets. As revitalization has become more evident, outside investors have become increasingly interested in Main Street property, but many longtime building owners are holding out, said Michael Rackenberg, a commercial broker in the Rye office of Houlihan Lawrence.\u201cThe building owners think they\u2019re sitting on gold, and the investors, while bullish, are not going to pay exorbitant amounts,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s kind of a stalemate there.\u201dLooming in the background, toward the southern end of Main Street, along the Byram River, is the Waterfront, a large complex of big-box stores and a cineplex that represents an earlier effort at revitalization. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the village used eminent domain to condemn dozens of properties and free up land for the project\u2019s developer.Joan Grangenois-Thomas, an alliance member and spokeswoman who has lived in Port Chester for 27 years, said she regrets that she did not pay attention when that project was under discussion. Now, she said, she is concerned that the focus on creating housing to bring in millennials is overshadowing the housing needs of existing residents. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Brooklyn,\u201d she added.Geoffrey D. Smith, a lawyer in White Plains and a consultant for the alliance, noted that tenants who were still living in an affordable-housing development for hospital workers on Starwood\u2019s project site were relocated by the developer to allow for demolition. Given the loss of those units, he said, and the village\u2019s \u201cserious problem with overcrowding and substandard housing,\u201d it is reasonable to ask Starwood to include some below-market-rate units in its project.The village board of trustees has ultimate approval authority over the project, but has been advised by legal counsel to stay out of the discussion about a community benefits agreement, said Mr. Pilla, who sits on the board. However, he said, he has been talking with alliance members and thinks that some of their ideas, like local hiring and work force housing incentives, are worth considering adopting as village policy for future projects.Advertisement"}

He said the firm had a policy of taping all meetings \u201cfor everybody to see so that there\u2019s no spin.\u201d\u201cSome people absolutely hate it, and some people could never work anywhere else,\u201d he said.Mr. Dalio also weighed in on the global economy and markets, speaking alongside Timothy F. Geithner, the former Treasury secretary, during a morning panel at the conference. Mr. Dalio said he took issue with Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who said on Monday that it was time for the Federal Reserve to begin raising interest rates on a regular basis. Mr. Dalio said it would be wrong to raise rates now because of the overall economic weakness in the world economy.\u201cThe risks are so much more on the downside,\u201d Mr. Dalio added.A large number of Bridgewater employees are dedicated to studying the impact of geopolitical events on the economy, and the firm publishes a daily research note for clients called Daily Observations with its assessment of macroeconomic trends and the impact on the markets. The note is said to be read by investment professionals as well as officials in Washington.Sounding the alarm, Mr. Dalio said central banks and policy makers had run out of options to stimulate growth, adding that there was no precedent for today\u2019s global economy.\u201cWe\u2019re out of ammo at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the idea that you should raise rates to replenish the arsenal and slow the economy, that\u2019s a weird argument to make.\u201dOther billionaire investors at the conference also took issue with the performance of central bankers in the United States and around the world.Bridgewater\u2019s flagship Pure Alpha fund, which makes broad bets on global economic trends, is down 9.4 percent, and its All Weather fund, which the firm contends will \u201cperform well across all environments,\u201d is up 13.5 percent.Last year, the performances were reversed: The All Weather fund lost 6.9 percent, and Pure Alpha gained 4.7 percent.Optimal is flat so far this year.Bridgewater is misunderstood, Mr. Dalio said, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve sort of kind of kept it behind the scenes in a sense.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Evidence to Support Trump\u2019s Attacks on the Fed", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump attacked the Federal Reserve on Monday night before the largest audience he has yet addressed, telling the millions of people watching the first presidential debate that the nation\u2019s central bank is acting as an arm of the Democratic Party at the expense of the economy.It is an extraordinary accusation, backed by no evidence, that plows across a bipartisan line. Since the 1970s, presidential candidates and presidents have avoided publicly criticizing the Fed\u2019s decisions about raising and lowering interest rates.Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said that Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, was \u201cdoing political things\u201d by holding interest rates at low levels. He said that the American economy was in a \u201cbig, fat, ugly bubble\u201d that would pop when the Fed started raising rates. Ms. Yellen, he said, was waiting until President Obama left office.This accusation, which Mr. Trump has leveled several times in recent weeks, is roundly rejected by Fed officials \u2014 including those who agree it is time to raise interest rates. It is also rejected by a wide range of independent observers.\u201cThere is simply no evidence that the Yellen Fed is doing anything at all partisan, or with an eye toward influencing elections,\u201d said Peter Conti-Brown, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studies the Fed. \u201cIt is simply a falsehood.\u201dEven Fed critics, like R. Glenn Hubbard, a former chairman of George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and an adviser to Mitt Romney in 2012, would not back Mr. Trump.\u201cI disagree with the current stance of and approach to the conduct of monetary policy by the Fed,\u201d Mr. Hubbard said on Tuesday. \u201cHaving said that,\u201d he added, \u201cI do not believe for a moment that Janet Yellen is acting for a political purpose as opposed to doing what she believes is right.\u201dHillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks as inappropriate and potentially disruptive to financial markets. \u201cHe should not be adding the Fed to his long list of institutions and individuals that he is maligning,\u201d she said.The Fed is not independent. It is an arm of the federal government, chartered by Congress to maximize employment and minimize inflation. But politicians and economists in the United States and other developed nations have generally concluded that central banks operate most effectively when they are insulated from short-term political pressures.Mr. Conti-Brown said that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were a dangerous attack on that independence. He said the Fed was navigating a difficult economic environment in which it needed the freedom and flexibility to experiment. \u201cIf Trump succeeds, then the Fed simply won\u2019t have this freedom of movement to experiment,\u201d he said.In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson shoved William McChesney Martin, the Fed chairman, against a wall at his Texas ranch and demanded that the Fed keep interest rates low.When Arthur Burns became the Fed chairman in January 1970, President Richard Nixon said at the swearing-in ceremony, \u201cI respect his independence. However, I hope that independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed.\u201d15 PhotosMr. Burns got the message. Rates stayed low during Mr. Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign.Gradually, under Jimmy Carter and his successors, presidents began to leave the Fed alone. The Obama administration says it does not comment on monetary policy.Monetary policy decisions are made by a committee composed of the board and presidents of the regional reserve banks, who are not presidential appointees.A recent review by Goldman Sachs economists found \u201cthere is no sign of an election influence on policy decisions in election years,\u201d although the authors added that the Fed did seem to avoid changing policy at its final meeting before an election.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s critiques have resonated with some conservatives.\u201cTrump is correct to criticize the Fed,\u201d said Terry Schilling, the executive director of the American Principles Project, a conservative advocacy group. \u201cOur broken monetary policy is one of the biggest problems holding our economy back.\u201dIt is not clear, however, that the Fed could significantly increase interest rates. The economy remains relatively weak, and rates are low in every developed nation. When the Fed raised rates in December, for the first time since the financial crisis, it drove up the price of American exports, weakening the domestic economy.Mr. Trump himself acknowledged this reality earlier in the presidential campaign. In May, he said on CNBC, \u201cIf we raise interest rates and if the dollar starts getting too strong, we\u2019re going to have some very major problems.\u201d A few weeks later, Mr. Trump told Reuters, \u201cI\u2019m not a person who thinks Janet Yellen is doing a bad job.\u201dNow, however, Mr. Trump says he has made up his mind. \u201cI used to hope that the Fed was independent,\u201d Mr. Trump said during another of his appearances on CNBC. \u201cAnd the Fed is obviously not independent. It\u2019s obviously not even close to being independent.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Life Got Better Under Obama, According to Gallup", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the years since President Obama first took office, more Americans are thriving, exercising and enjoying a high standard of living.The rates of health insurance coverage are up, too, but the share of Americans who say they are in excellent health is declining.The analysis represents an attempt at understanding how American well-being has changed during the Obama presidency. Generally, people reported their lives had improved even though they gave poorer assessments of their health.\u201cIf you stick strictly to physical well-being, it\u2019s a real mixed picture, and I think probably more negative than it is positive,\u201d said Dan Witters, research director of the nearly decade-long effort, which has a mouthful of a name: the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.\u201cIf you broaden it, though, and look at things like declining uninsured rates, declining food insecurity, improving life evaluation, improving perspective on standard of living, those things are all trending up,\u201d he added.It is, of course, hard to credit or blame presidents with every change that occurs during a presidency. Many large forces are simply out of their control. Nonetheless, it is hard to find one individual who has more power to shape American life than a president.The analyses, published throughout last week, therefore offer some insight, fair or not, into how Mr. Obama may be judged.Here\u2019s a brief look at what Gallup found.When Mr. Obama was elected in late 2008, the nation was in the middle of a historic recession, and Americans were divided on what the future would hold.But as the economy improved, so, too, did attitudes. By the first seven months of this year, the share of Americans who felt their standard of living was improving rose to 62 percent. Only 22 percent said it was getting worse.It wasn\u2019t just attitudes about the future that improved; appraisals of life in the moment brightened, too. The share of Americans who said they were satisfied with their current standard of living \u2014 all the things they can buy and do \u2014 rose from 73 percent to 80 percent over those years.The ratings improved regardless of income level, with the improvement most dramatic for non-Hispanic black Americans, followed by Hispanics and then non-Hispanic whites.Gallup largley credits the across-the-board improvement to the fact that the economy, and attitudes, had nowhere else to go.\u201cThe increase in perceived standard of living over the past seven-plus years reflects in large part the low starting point when Obama took office during the aftermath of a crippling recession,\u201d Gallup notes.Those who rated themselves closest to that ideal were deemed to be \u201cthriving,\u201d with the share that qualified as such rising from 48.9 percent in 2008, the year before Mr. Obama took office, to 55.4 percent today.In the short-term, ratings appear to have been affected by ideology and race. Life evaluations during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term rose for blacks, especially Democrats, and declined for white Republicans.\u201cThere\u2019s pretty good evidence that both race and political identity had kind of a short-term impact on how people were thinking about and evaluating their lives,\u201d Mr. Witters said.During the president\u2019s second term, however, the inverse was true: life ratings declined some for blacks and improved for whites, driven, Mr. Witters said, by the economic rebound.The success of one of Mr. Obama\u2019s landmark achievements, the passage of the Affordable Care Act, rests largely on whether it improves the accessibility, affordability and quality of health care.On those measures, the results so far are mixed, Gallup found.At the same time, a smaller share of Americans than at any point in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency report having had trouble paying for their family\u2019s health care or medicines.The share who describe their health as \u201cexcellent\u201d fell from 22.6 percent in 2008 to 19 percent in 2016, according to the surveys conducted for the well-being index.Ratings dropped among whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and all age groups, except those aged 65 and older, whose ratings of \u201cexcellent\u201d health increased slightly.That decline is supported by some other measures.Obesity and diabetes rates continued their long-term climb, while the share of Americans who report having been diagnosed with high blood pressure and cancer remained unchanged.The Gallup analyses drew from multiple polls based on anywhere from hundreds of thousands to more than 2 million telephone interviews.Advertisement"}

But they\u2019re desperate for change.Supported byParis, Ky. \u2014 After Bill Bissett, the president of the Kentucky Coal Association, told me that \u201cPresident Obama cares more about Paris, France, than he does about Paris, Kentucky\u201d \u2014 a sentiment that seems broadly shared around here \u2014 I decided to check out this little town with a big name set amid the verdant undulations of picket-fenced Kentucky horse country. Soon enough I ran into Cindy Hedges, whose boot store stands on Main Street and whose hours, as described by a sign on the door, are: \u201cIf I\u2019m here, I\u2019m here. If I ain\u2019t, I ain\u2019t.\u201dStraight talk, the way the people of this particular Paris like it, is the kind of talk they recognize in Donald J. Trump. Hedges is a garrulous woman who says she\u2019s \u201cnever met a stranger.\u201d But recent times have tried her affability. Her business has been slow. Her husband, Mitch, lost his job as the coal business collapsed, she has been withdrawing money from savings, and the couple are struggling to afford health insurance. All of which has led her to the conviction that the country is off track and needs \u201csomebody spectacular to get us halfway straight.\u201dFor her, that somebody is Trump. She voted for Barack Obama in 2008, and says her political choices are gut-driven rather than party-driven. \u201cI have never been this political,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThis is the most fired-up I\u2019ve ever been for a candidate.\u201d She believes Trump will get business going, revoke trade deals she sees as draining domestic jobs, and \u201cclean up the mess Obama has left us.\u201d But what, I ask, of Trump\u2019s evident character flaws? \u201cSure, he\u2019s kind of a loose cannon, but he tells it the way it is and, if elected, people will be there to calm him down a bit, tweak a word or two in his speeches. And I just don\u2019t trust Hillary Clinton.\u201dKentucky voted twice for Bill Clinton before going solidly Republican in presidential elections. Now Kentuckians are clambering aboard the Trump train \u2014 and to heck with its destination. Obama is blamed for the collapse of coal, particularly in eastern Kentucky, and the ever more stringent standards of the Environmental Protection Agency. Beyond that, the blame is aimed at airy-fairy liberals more concerned about climate change \u2014 often contested or derided \u2014 than about Americans trying to make their house payments.The number of Kentucky coal jobs has plunged to fewer than 6,500 from about 18,000 when Obama took office; the number fell 6.9 percent between this April and June alone. Hillary Clinton\u2019s words in Ohio \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business\u201d \u2014 echo on Republican radio ads, plucked out of context from her pledge to replace those jobs with opportunities in clean, renewable energy. By contrast, Trump declared in West Virginia in May that miners should \u201cget ready, because you are going to be working your asses off!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe Obama has a white board on how he\u2019s going to torture us, but he has,\u201d Bissett told me at his office in Lexington. \u201cI cannot tell you how rabid the support for Trump is.\u201dThat support is proving resilient. The post-convention Trump free fall has run into the obstinacy of his appeal \u2014 an appeal that seems to defy every gaffe, untruth and insult. The race is tightening once again because Trump\u2019s perceived character \u2014 a strong leader with a simple message, never flinching from a fight, cutting through political correctness with a bracing bluntness \u2014 resonates in places like Appalachia where courage, country and cussedness are core values.\u201cTrump\u2019s appeal is nationalistic, the authoritarian shepherd of the flock,\u201d Al Cross, an associate professor at the University of Kentucky, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s why evangelical Christians are willing to vote for this twice-divorced man who brags about the size of his penis. There\u2019s a strong belief here still in America as special and exceptional, and Obama is seen as having played that down.\u201dBut the Trump magnetism goes deeper than resentment at Obama\u2019s regretful tone from Havana to Hiroshima. It seems to go beyond the predictable Republican domination in this part of the country. There\u2019s a sense, crystallized in coal\u2019s steady demise, that, as the political scientist Norman Ornstein put it to me, \u201cSomebody is taking everything you are used to and you had\u201d \u2014 your steady middle-class existence, your values, your security. It\u2019s not that the economy is bad in all of Kentucky; the arrival of the auto industry has been a boon, and the unemployment rate is just 4.9 percent. It\u2019s that all the old certainties have vanished.Far from the metropolitan hubs inhabited by the main beneficiaries of globalization\u2019s churn, many people feel disenfranchised from both main political parties, angry at stagnant wages and growing inequality, and estranged from a prevailing liberal urban ethos. I heard a lot about how Obama has not been supportive enough of the police, of how white lives matter, too, and of how illegal \u2014 as in illegal immigrant \u2014 means illegal, just as robbing a bank is. For anyone used to New York chatter, or for that matter London or Paris chatter, Kentucky is a through-the-looking-glass experience. There are just as many certainties; they are simply the opposite ones, whether on immigration, police violence toward African-Americans, or guns. America is now tribal, with each tribe imbibing its own social-media-fed ranting.The Clintons were feted here in the 1990s, but two decades on Hillary Clinton is viewed with cool suspicion. That\u2019s because both the economy and values have moved on, too. Jobs went south to Mexico or east to Asia. Somewhere on the winding road from whites-only bathrooms to choose-your-gender bathrooms, many white, blue-collar Kentucky workers \u2014 and the state is 85.1 percent white \u2014 feel their country got lost. The F.D.R. Democrats who became Reagan Democrats and then Clinton Democrats could well be November\u2019s Trump Democrats.America is no longer white enough for that to be decisive, but it is significant. To these people, Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is not the empty rhetoric of a media-savvy con artist from Queens but a last-ditch rallying cry for the soul of a changing land where minorities will be the majority by the middle of the century.Hazard, set in the mountains of eastern Kentucky, is a once bustling town with its guts wrenched out. On Main Street, the skeleton of a mall that burned down last year presents its charred remains for dismal contemplation. Young people with drugged eyes lean against boarded-up walls on desolate streets. The whistle of trains hauling coal, once as regular as the chiming of the hours, has all but vanished. So have the coal trucks spewing splinters of rock that shattered windshields. In the age of cheap natural gas and mountaintop removal mining, a coal town is not where you want to be.Hazard is in Perry County, where unemployment is above 10 percent. On a bench opposite the county courthouse, on the Starbucks-free Main Street, I found Steve Smith and Paul Bush. Smith used to work underground at the Starfire mine. He earned as much as $1,500 a week, but was laid off a while ago. His unemployment has dried up and he has four children to feed. His family scrapes by on his wife\u2019s income as a nurse. He\u2019d been in court over a traffic offense; now an idle afternoon stretched away.\u201cTrump\u2019s going to get us killed, probably!\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I\u2019ll vote for him anyway over Hillary. If you vote for Hillary you vote for Obama, and he\u2019s made it impossible to ship coal. This place is about dried up. A job at Wendy\u2019s is the only thing left. We may have to move.\u201d\u201cYeah, another year without change and they\u2019ll be shutting Hazard down,\u201d Bush suggested.He was awaiting his son, in court on a drug charge for the painkiller Percocet. A retired operator of heavy equipment for the Road Department, Bush said his son did nothing, \u201cjust a few odd jobs.\u201d He continued: \u201cObama\u2019s probably never known hardship. He and Hillary don\u2019t get it. At least Trump don\u2019t hold nothing back: If he don\u2019t like something, he tells you about it.\u201dHis son\u2019s girlfriend emerged from the courthouse. \u201cThey locked him up,\u201d she said.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHe failed one of the drug tests.\u201d\u201cWell, ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 we can do about it,\u201d Bush said.There are people here who are not resigned, people thinking about what can be done about a post-coal Hazard. Self-reliance remains an important Appalachian value even if many people are \u201con the draw.\u201d An initiative backed by Congressman Hal Rogers, a Republican, to bring broadband access to rural areas in Kentucky has been announced.Jenny Williams, an English teacher at Hazard Community and Technical College, told me it\u2019s past time to get over divisions between \u201cFriends of Coal\u201d \u2014 a popular movement and bumper sticker \u2014 and anti-coal environmentalists to forge a creative economy around agriculture, ecotourism, education and small-scale manufacture. Coal, she observed, was never going to last forever. \u201cHow could any idiot support Trump?\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve been on $70,000 a year in coal mines, and your life\u2019s pulled out from under you, who else can you be mad at but the government?\u201dThat anger simmers. It\u2019s directed at Obama, and by extension Clinton, and by further extension a Democratic Party that, as the former Democratic senator Jim Webb from Virginia told me, \u201chas now built its constituency based on ethnic groups other than white working people.\u201d The frustration of these people, whether they are in Kentucky, or Texas, or throughout the Midwest, is acute. They are looking for \u201csomeone who will articulate the truth of their disenfranchisement,\u201d as Webb put it. Trump, for all his bullying petulance, has come closest to being that politician, which is why millions of Americans support him.Bissett, the Coal Association president, made clear to me that he did not dismiss the emissions concerns about coal; what bothers him is what he sees as Obama\u2019s and the E.P.A.\u2019s refusal to seek a reasonable balance between the economy and the environment. The administration, he argues, has moved the goal posts to kill coal. It is this that feels punitive. For example, the E.P.A.\u2019s Clean Power Plan, first presented in 2014 with no backing from Congress, requires every state to submit proposals for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2018. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, blocked the initiative early this year. But that was just before Justice Antonin Scalia died. \u201cWe need Trump for a reasonable Supreme Court and an E.P.A no longer skewed against fossil fuels,\u201d Bissett argued. \u201cA lot of jobs here still depend on coal and cheap electricity. That\u2019s why Clinton is toxic right now.\u201dAt Jabo\u2019s Coal River Grille, a popular restaurant in Hazard, I met Phillip Clemons, known as \u201cJabo\u201d (\u201cperhaps because I used to box\u201d). He owns the Locust Grove mining company, with 15 employees, down from 150. As a hedge, he opened the restaurant, where he was working a shift to keep payroll down. He called the election a \u201cterrible choice,\u201d but he\u2019s with Trump, because he believes that, as a businessman, Trump will respect the need to \u201cbalance the books,\u201d past bankruptcies notwithstanding. \u201cObama just hates coal,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t dislike people because of their color. I liked Herman Cain a lot. I can tell you the only black person who\u2019s ever been mean to me is Barack Obama.\u201dWhat\u2019s happened to eastern Kentucky is devastating, but far from unique. At France\u2019s diner, another popular Hazard hangout, Daniel Walker, who works from home for a medical software company, told me: \u201cLook, I lived for a while in Mansfield, Ohio, and General Motors moved its stamping plant there to Mexico, with the loss of thousands of factory jobs. The decent middle-class life is gone.\u201d There are many places, here and abroad, where people feel shoved aside by technology and cheap global labor, leading them to seek radical political answers. Trump is one of those answers; Brexit, the surprise British vote to leave the European Union, was another; the fall of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany next year could be a third, after she trailed an anti-immigrant party in a local election this month.Trump can\u2019t reverse globalization. Nor is he likely to save coal in an era of cheap natural gas. His gratuitous insults, evident racism, hair-trigger temper and lack of preparation suggest he would be a reckless, even perilous, choice for the Oval Office. I don\u2019t think he is a danger to the Republic because American institutions are stronger than Trump\u2019s ego, but that the question even arises is troubling.Still, in a climate where disruption is sought at any cost (whether political in Hazard or economic in Silicon Valley), it would be foolhardy to suggest that Trump cannot win. He can; and he can in part because of the liberal intellectual arrogance that dismisses the economic, social and cultural problems his rise has underscored. Whatever happens in November, these problems will persist, and it will take major public and private investment and an unlikely rebirth of bipartisanship in Washington to make any dent in them.Back in Paris \u2014 the Kentucky one \u2014 I sit down in a coffee shop with Cindy Hedges and her husband, Mitch. He worked for more than 30 years as a welder and then a supervisor in a factory that refurbished mining equipment. It was dirty work \u2014 coal is black, grease is black, hydraulic oil is black \u2014 but it was a good living. He lost his job in February, before returning on a temporary contract a couple of weeks ago, and when I ask him why his full-time employment disappeared, the answer is by now familiar: the E.P.A. and Obama, for whom, like his wife, he voted in 2008. But when I turn to this political season, he springs a surprise.\u201cLook, there\u2019s nobody to vote for,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump is an idiot, he pisses everyone off, he\u2019s scary, he\u2019ll pump his mouth off to some foreign country and we\u2019ll be at war. He\u2019s a billionaire on a power trip with as much reason to be president as I have. If Trump had shut up, he\u2019d win the election. So do you vote for the one who\u2019s going to lie, or the one who takes you to war? I\u2019m leaning Hillary.\u201d\u201cOh, come on, Mitch!\u201d says Cindy.\u201cWhat? With Bill Clinton the economy was rolling. I was working a 50-hour week and my 401 (k) outperformed my salary. He\u2019s going to be advising Hillary, suggesting she needs to do this or this.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t get along, Mitch.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m scared of Trump.\u201d\u201cI guess we\u2019ll cancel each other out then,\u201d says Cindy.At the boot store, Carrie McCall, a FedEx driver, appears with a package.\u201cI love Trump,\u201d she declares. \u201cHe shoots from the hip.\u201dBut, I ask, isn\u2019t that dangerous?\u201cI don\u2019t care. After all we\u2019ve been through, I just don\u2019t care.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New National Poll Shows Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Essentially Tied", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA national poll released Tuesday shows that Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton are entering the final stretch of the presidential race essentially tied, and the survey revealed a country deeply divided on a racial and gender lines ahead of the November election.The poll suggests that the post-convention bounces have subsided and that Mr. Trump has weathered a difficult August, in which he shuffled staff members, insulted a Gold Star family and confused voters about his immigration policy. But Mrs. Clinton continues to face questions about her honesty, and new revelations about her email practices as secretary of state have cast a shadow over her campaign.Mrs. Clinton was leading most national and state polls after the Democratic National Convention in late July, but Mr. Trump has gradually been gaining some ground in recent weeks. She still has the upper hand in most of the crucial swing states, such as Pennsylvania and Florida, that will likely decide the election.The contours of the race remain relatively unchanged, according to the CNN poll. Mrs. Clinton continues to hold large leads with women, minorities and voters with college degrees. Mr. Trump does best with men, white voters and those who did not go to college.On issues, Mr. Trump is seen as the strongest candidate to manage the economy and handle terrorism, while Mrs. Clinton wins on foreign policy and has an edge on immigration.Voters view Mr. Trump as being the more honest candidate, but they prefer Mrs. Clinton\u2019s temperament when it comes to being best suited to be commander in chief. Last week, Mr. Trump engaged in a Twitter spat with the president of Mexico, raising questions about his ability to deal with other world leaders.But Mr. Trump, who has been moderating his positions recently, has also gained an advantage over Mrs. Clinton when it comes to appealing to independent voters. Nearly half of those queried say they would vote for the Republican nominee, while 29 percent say they would vote for Mrs. Clinton.Although the poll does not indicate whether Mr. Johnson is pulling voters from either candidate, his supporters tend to be younger and more highly educated \u2014 suggesting that they would be more likely to be potential backers of Mrs. Clinton.The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Depression Radically Changed the Way Americans Ate", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionThe Depression brought all that to an end. And as Jane Ziegelman and Andrew Coe show in their engaging and often moving cultural history, \u201cA Square Meal,\u201d those years also changed the way America thought about food. We are what we eat \u2014 or in the case of the Depression, didn\u2019t.As in other respects, the gastronomic effects of Black Tuesday were not immediate. Warring reports and \u201cslippery\u201d statistics made the full impact of the stock market crash hard to gauge, and long into the crisis, the Hoover administration remained staunchly optimistic. In New York, increased numbers of people in the city\u2019s bread lines were an early bellwether. The institution of the bread line dated back to the turn of the 20th century, when tourists would journey to the Bowery to gawk at the seasonal workers who queued up for \u201cpromenade breakfasts\u201d of dry bread and coffee in the winter months. The official city charity \u2014 the dreaded \u201cMuni\u201d \u2014 imposed punitive \u201cwork tests\u201d on its clientele and was regarded as a last resort. However, even the private bread lines carried a distinct whiff of the moralistic English poor laws: to ensure that only the most desperate benefited, officials generally distributed these meager meals in the middle of the night.In the spring of 1930, the bread lines did not disperse as usual. They grew. As increasing numbers of urban workers were laid off and agricultural laborers began flooding the city in search of employment, makeshift bread lines popped up all over New York; by 1931 they were serving some 85,000 meals a day. The socialite Marian Spore handed out Y.M.C.A. meal tickets on the Bowery, while William Randolph Hearst funded \u2014 and publicized \u2014 two Army trucks serving hungry men sandwiches and crullers.Hoover and his advisers had an unshakable faith in the spirit of private philanthropy and a constitutional aversion to any form of direct relief. But as the months passed and the waves of financial collapse reached farther, it became clear to city administrators that a more organized system was needed. The bread lines, with their dubious nutritional standards and uncertain supplies, had never been intended as more than a stopgap. On the right, critics charged that the ready food was making able men soft and encouraging freeloaders to flood the city. Social workers complained that amateurish handouts diverted funds from more organized efforts. Because it was socially unacceptable for young women to patronize bread lines, \u201cbusiness girls\u201d often went hungry.The suffering was not, of course, limited to the cities. Despite Hoover\u2019s 1931 claim that \u201cnobody is actually starving,\u201d the country was desperately hungry. As the Depression deepened, for most Americans the question became not whether one suffered, but in what way. Ziegelman and Coe draw on a range of primary sources to produce grim pictures of subsistence diets across the country. An Arkansas widow and her seven children were found by a relief worker to have little more than \u201ca pint of flour and a few scraps of chicken bones\u201d in the larder; out-of-work West Virginia coal miners were limited to \u201cpotatoes, bread, beans, oleomargarine.\u201d In the Dust Bowl, families \u201cpared back their daily diet to the bare minimum of flour, lard and potatoes,\u201d often supplemented by Russian thistle \u2014 better known as tumbleweed. Pellagra, rickets and other diseases of malnutrition were rampant. The effects of vitamin deficiency could be felt into the war years, when a startling number of young draftees failed their physicals.Today, the official responses can seem almost unbelievably callous. Despite Hoover\u2019s urging, the Red Cross refused to provide direct food aid to starving Appalachian communities, while in 1932 the chief statistician of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company opined that \u201cas a people, we are given normally to overfeeding . .\u2008.\u2008. I would not be surprised if, under the present conditions of enforced moderation, many have enjoyed better health than ever before.\u201dInevitably, and increasingly, local governments were forced to intervene. Often, administrators wielded their power to enforce local prejudice: Black sharecroppers \u2014 already living at a bare subsistence level \u2014 were routinely given fewer rations than their white counterparts and illegally forced to do street repairs or perform other work tests. In Tennessee, \u201cthe better farmers\u201d in the county seats regarded the famine as a natural means of culling the \u201cmore or less subhuman\u201d hill folk; a New Jersey administrator declared that \u201cEyetalians\u201d didn\u2019t need meat.Indeed, what is most striking about Ziegelman and Coe\u2019s account is the clash of ideology and reality. Theories were tested in real time for the highest imaginable stakes, whose failures exacted an immediate human toll. Hoover had been by all accounts an energetic and often effective public servant. As president, he found himself paralyzed by his own aversion to what he considered fundamentally un-American values. While Franklin Roose\u00advelt also harbored grave reservations about the role of welfare, he proved more adaptable. Even if his programs were hit-or-miss, he recognized the desperate necessity of experimentation.Among the few real winners of the Depression, from a gastronomic perspective, were the home economists \u2014 the mostly female corps of domestic scientists, recipe testers, efficiency experts and nutritionists who sought to educate America\u2019s housewives. This was their shining moment, and the cascade of federally funded classes, recipe pamphlets, dietary recommendations and public-service positions elevated the domestic sciences to national importance. Eleanor Roosevelt was a zealous proponent of scientific eating and, in concert with her housekeeper, Henrietta Nesbitt, kept the sybaritic president on a dreary austerity diet of, among other things, watery soup and prune pudding.Since the beginning of the century, there had been a move toward greater scientific purpose in eating; now, with the country in desperate need of nutrition and a sweeping new school lunch program, home economists had an unprecedented opportunity to change America\u2019s attitude toward food. While much of this work was both necessary and useful, it\u2019s also true that this moment was crucial in drawing a line between pleasure and nutrition. Even when kitchen advice was dispensed by a friendly mascot named Aunt Sammy (presumably Uncle Sam\u2019s thrifty wife), emphasis was less on enjoyment \u2014 \u00addismissed as \u201cflavor satisfaction\u201d \u2014 than on economy, the provision of vitamins and something derived from one of \u201cthe hardest-working adjectives in American culinary history\u201d: wholesomeness. And citizenship. In the interests of homogenization, immigrant cuisine was discouraged in favor of \u201cfoods found in the ordinary American dietary.\u201d This translated to a great deal of milk, oceans of white sauce and a taste for white bread.Despite its vast scope, \u201cA Square Meal\u201d is often heartbreaking in its human specifics. An earnestly planned New York school lunch menu, the enormous appetite of a hungry man at a New Jersey transients\u2019 camp or a grimly inventive recipe for liver loaf can move the reader to tears. Less often, the shifts in focus can prove distracting, as when the perspective moves from a general survey of the state of federal aid to the narrow lens of a Michigan social worker. It is not always entirely clear what Ziegelman and Coe mean for us to take away from their eloquent work of historical summation. Then again, that may be a good thing. The larger question of America\u2019s shifting attitudes toward federal aid is a prodigious topic to digest. And the universal experience of eating is a wholesome place to start.Sadie Stein is a contributing editor at The Paris Review.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Value of Exercise? $2,500", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPhys EdFor people still struggling to make time for exercise, a new study offers a strong incentive: You\u2019ll save $2,500 a year.The savings, a result of reduced medical costs, don\u2019t require much effort to accrue \u2014 just 30 minutes of walking five days a week is enough.The findings come from an analysis of 26,239 men and women, published today in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Researchers from a number of universities and hospitals around the country, including Baptist Health South Florida, Yale, Johns Hopkins, Emory and Baylor, decided to see if they could determine what being active or inactive costs each of us annually in health care spending.Scientists and health policy experts have known for some time that inactivity is expensive at the public health level. Sedentary people are more likely than physically fit people to develop a number of diseases.The study concluded that inactivity costs the world economy almost $68 billion annually in medical expenses and lost productivity. In the United States alone, the total was almost $28 billion. Most of the global costs were borne by governments and businesses, the authors write, but almost $10 billion worldwide was paid out of the pockets of individuals.But those kinds of aggregate numbers, while concerning, are also abstract. They don\u2019t tell us how much each of us, individually, might be paying out or saving in future health costs when we decide either to go for that walk at lunchtime or skip it.So for the new study, the researchers set out to quantify the value of exercise for each individual.To do so, they first turned to a huge storehouse of data about what we spend on health care. The annual Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which is conducted by federal agencies, asks a large, representative group of Americans what they have spent on health care in the past year. The survey includes detailed questions about insurance coverage, prescription costs, doctor visits, hospitalizations, medical devices, other out-of-pocket spending, reimbursements, and so on.It also asks about health, such as any diagnosed illnesses.A separate part of the survey covers lifestyle issues, such as the person\u2019s income, educational level, and whether he or she smokes, as well about physical activity, and how often the person engages in moderate or vigorous exercise. (Moderate activities, according to the survey, would include brisk walking, bicycling gently, or raking leaves; vigorous exercise would be running, strenuous cycling or other activities that significantly increase heart rate and sweating.)For the study, the researchers pulled data from the 2012 survey.Because they wanted to look at costs related to inactivity, the researchers decided to focus on expenses among this group related to cardiovascular disease, since its incidence and severity are known to be affected by whether someone exercises.They also stratified the people into two broad groups: those who did or did not meet national exercise guidelines, which recommend that someone work out moderately for 30 minutes five times per week.Then they looked at how much each person had spent on health care in 2012 and whether being physically active had changed that outlay.It turned out that it had, substantially. On average, someone who met the exercise guidelines paid $2,500 less in annual health care expenses related to heart disease than someone who did not walk or otherwise move for 30 minutes five times per week.Those numbers included annual savings of about $400 on prescription medicines and far fewer emergency room visits and hospitalizations for people who regularly exercised.The researchers arrived at these figures after controlling for insurance coverage, meaning that people with good insurance who did not meet the exercise guidelines paid more annually for their health care than those with skimpier coverage who regularly exercised.The costs declined for exercisers even if they had been given a diagnosis of heart disease or had multiple risk factors for heart disease \u2014 such as high blood pressure and poor cholesterol profiles. If they met the exercise guidelines, they generally spent significantly less on annual health care than someone with heart disease or multiple risk factors who rarely worked out.Overall, the data strongly suggest that \u201cbeing physically active is good for your wallet,\u201d says Dr. Khurram Nasir, a preventive cardiologist and director of the Center for Healthcare Advancement and Outcomes at Baptist Health South Florida hospital in Miami, who oversaw the study, which was funded by Baptist Health South Florida.He also pointed out that this study focused only on expenses related to cardiovascular disease and that the actual annual cost savings from being physically active could be substantially higher than $2,500.Of course, this was an associational study, meaning that it cannot directly prove that working out causes someone to spend less on health care, only that the two are linked.But Dr. Nasir says he hopes that people who are reluctant to exercise might now consider the possibility that not moving is costing them money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modi Retains Broad Support in India Despite Criticism, Poll Finds", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 More than two years into his tenure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to have broad support in India, despite criticism over stalled economic reforms and religious and caste tensions in the country, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center.The report, which was published on Monday, found that 81 percent of Indians had a favorable view of Mr. Modi in 2016, down from 87 percent the year before. It also found that, even among supporters of the Indian National Congress party, the main opposition group, a majority had a positive view of Mr. Modi and of his Bharatiya Janata Party.\u201cWhen I talk to Indian elites, including the press, there\u2019s this sense of frustration that Modi hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations,\u201d Bruce Stokes, the author of the report and the director of global economic attitudes at the Pew Research Center, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t really see that in public opinion.\u201dRather, he said, \u201cit seems that the public is still enamored of Modi.\u201dMr. Modi swept into power in 2014 on a wave of public support for his development agenda and on disaffection with the previous governing coalition, led by the Congress party. Though economic changes have been intermittent, partly because of lack of support in Parliament from other parties, eight in 10 Indians have a positive view of the economy, and about two-thirds are satisfied with the way things are going in India generally, according to the survey.\u201cPeople are not willing to give up on him on the economy so quickly,\u201d said Shekhar Gupta, a journalist and political commentator, adding that Mr. Modi\u2019s frequent speaking engagements may have helped bolster his popularity. \u201cAfter a long time, Indians have a leader who\u2019s speaking to them directly and speaking to them all the time.\u201dThe pollsters interviewed 2,464 randomly selected adults from April 7 to May 24 in 15 states and in New Delhi, the capital. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.Though many expressed support for Mr. Modi and for his party, increasing polarization between backers of Bharatiya Janata and those of the Congress party was apparent in the survey. Those differences were particularly stark on domestic issues like corruption, unemployment and help for the poor, where support from Congress party backers for Mr. Modi\u2019s efforts has fallen since last year.But such episodes, while provoking criticism among the country\u2019s intellectuals, appear to carry less weight with the public, according to the survey.

Mike Pence came to Capitol Hill on Tuesday on a mission to promote Republican unity, attacking Hillary Clinton for describing many supporters of the G.O.P. ticket as bigoted \u201cdeplorables\u201d and urging Republicans to rally behind their nominee, Donald J. Trump.It was a noticeable break in stride for the Trump campaign, which had zeroed in on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remark at a Manhattan fund-raiser Friday night \u2014 one for which she expressed regret the next day \u2014 running a new commercial and dispatching surrogates to attack her for what Mr. Trump has termed a \u201cslander\u201d of his \u201cwonderful, amazing\u201d followers.Congressional Republicans were even blunter in private.An otherwise friendly morning meeting with House Republicans turned awkward when Mr. Pence was pressed by Representative Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska about Mr. Trump\u2019s difficulties with women, said two House Republicans who relayed the conversation. Mr. Fortenberry told Mr. Pence that his young daughter had come to him and said, \u201cDaddy, Donald Trump hates women,\u201d according to one of the lawmakers, who both insisted on anonymity to recount a private conversation.\u201cIt\u2019s just not true,\u201d Mr. Pence shot back, arguing that Mr. Trump was improving with women, the two House Republicans said.Mr. Pence faced resistance again when he met privately with Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, neither of whom has endorsed Mr. Trump. Mr. Lee pressed the governor on his reluctance to denounce Mr. Duke and the so-called alt-right movement more explicitly, stressing \u201cthat Republicans must identify David Duke\u2019s racism as deplorable,\u201d according to Conn Carroll, a spokesman for Mr. Lee.People are motivated to vote by a combination of individual priorities, group culture, candidate outreach, and how easy or hard it is to cast a ballot.Mr. Pence was greeted warmly by Senate Republicans when he joined them for a lunch of Chick-fil-A sandwiches, but received a firm rebuke from John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Calling Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, \u201ca thug and a butcher,\u201d Mr. McCain said Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of the autocratic ruler was unacceptable, according to a Republican official present who also insisted on anonymity.Mr. Pence insisted that he and Mr. Trump were trying to belittle President Obama rather than to laud Mr. Putin.Congressional Republicans said they were pleased that the presidential race was tightening and that Mr. Trump appeared more viable, partly because their own prospects depend on his being competitive enough that Republicans still bother to vote.With his modest uptick in the polls, Mr. Trump may have forestalled an outright break with Republicans in Congress. As recently as a few weeks ago, party leaders and strategists in Washington were preparing to take emergency measures, having their candidates disavow Mr. Trump and present themselves to voters as a counterweight to a President Clinton.Republicans may still activate those plans if Mr. Trump stumbles badly against Mrs. Clinton in the final stretch of the race. But for now, the party has adopted a middle-ground approach, with most Republicans in Washington nominally supporting Mr. Trump while advancing campaign messages that differ widely from his in almost every respect.That distance was on display when congressional Republicans refrained from echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s indictment of Mrs. Clinton over her saying that half his supporters were bigots, sexists and homophobes.Few Republicans want to confront thorny follow-up questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, and fewer still want to make matters of race, gender and sexual orientation central to their campaigns. The silence about what has for the last three days been at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign also underscored a more fundamental gap: Republicans on Capitol Hill have their own agenda and intend to run their campaigns apart from Mr. Trump \u2014 not as a unified ticket.So Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to use his news conference with Mr. Pence to promote his own \u201cBetter Way\u201d proposals on the economy, military and poverty, which were formulated separately from the Trump campaign.David Winston, a Republican pollster who advises congressional leaders, said lawmakers were right to focus on their own political interests.\u201cThat\u2019s a Hillary Clinton statement, and that\u2019s who Trump is running against,\u201d Mr. Winston said of the \u201cdeplorables\u201d debate. \u201cFor a lot of these members, what they\u2019re trying to do is define their view of the future in contrast to what they\u2019re facing. These are members representing individual districts with specific concerns.\u201dThat Mr. Pence had to assume a Willy Loman-meets-Henry Kissinger role and sell elected Republicans on Mr. Trump\u2019s merits less than two months before Election Day illustrates the unique challenges Republicans are facing.By contrast, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, is spending much of his time appealing to voters in swing states \u2014 not pleading with recalcitrant Democrats in Senate cloakrooms to endorse their nominee.Mr. Pence was plainly unable to win over Republican holdouts. Representative Carlos Curbelo, a first-term Florida congressman who has said he will not vote for Mr. Trump, was left pining for an alternative reality.\u201cThe country would probably be more pleased with the vice-presidential candidates than the two candidates at the top,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said with a grin.Representative Lee Zeldin of New York, a Long Island Republican who supports Mr. Trump, said it was widely accepted that some Republicans would seek distance from the national ticket and focus on a congressional agenda.But Mr. Zeldin urged Republicans to take sides in the presidential race, and said he planned to talk \u201cnot only about issues impacting the next Congress, but also understanding that who is in the White House is important.\u201d\u201cThere are people watching this race as if there\u2019s another option that\u2019s going to win on Nov. 8,\u201d Mr. Zeldin said. \u201cIt\u2019s Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton versus Ronald Reagan arriving as a white knight and becoming a substitute and winning.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns from New York.Advertisement"}

Chief Lagarde Calls Trade Restrictions \u2018Economic Malpractice\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Lagarde spoke at Northwestern University, in what was billed as a kickoff for the fund\u2019s annual fall meetings to be held in Washington next week.\u201cRestricting trade is a clear case of economic malpractice,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said, making the case that workers and families would be worse off if global trade were restricted.Ms. Lagarde\u2019s comments come in the midst of a polarizing election in the United States, where the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates have both criticized trade deals as hurting, not helping, American workers.The Republican presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, has been most vocal in this regard, calling the North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada the \u201csingle worst trade agreement\u201d ever approved in the country.Since the end of World War II, when it was formed, the I.M.F. has been the most vocal global proponent of free trade policies in which countries around the world agree to trade with each other and keep impediments such as tariffs or quotas to a minimum.This doctrine lies at the root of all the advice that it parcels out to its member countries, and liberal trade policies are one of its major conditions when the fund lends money to a country in crisis.One reason for the slowdown, the report concludes, has been a steady rise in protectionist rules and regulations over the last three years.\u201cIf we were to turn our backs on trade now, we would be choking off a key driver of growth at a point when the global economy is still in need of every good piece of news it can get,\u201d Ms. Lagarde warned.During the Greek crisis, for example, European leaders did not heed her insistent counsel to reduce Greece\u2019s debt burden, as a recent study from the fund\u2019s watchdog lays out in detail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gridlock in Spain", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialSpain has effectively been without a government for eight months now, its politicians unable to form a majority in Parliament after two inconclusive elections. Curiously, the economy has not suffered \u2014 Spain\u2019s credit rating is healthy and the stock market has withstood Brexit better than much of the rest of Europe. That may be great fodder for jokes about the uselessness of politicians, but no country can remain in political limbo for long without risk. Among other challenges that require serious attention from Madrid is the separatist drive in Catalonia. There is also too much turmoil in the European Union for Spain to sit on the sidelines.He\u2019ll get that majority if enough Socialists abstain, which they should. There\u2019s little chance they would improve their position in December. Further, even under a minority government, the Socialists would have considerable say in any legislation or reform.Abstaining won\u2019t be easy for the Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. The alternative, however, is four more months of interim government, which means no budgets, no new ministers and most likely no legislation.A minority coalition government involving factions as hostile as the Socialists and the far-left Podemos hardly promises effective government. But a messy government is better than no government, and at least Spanish voters have not followed other Europeans who have lurched to the far right in their uncertainty and fears.The political deadlock in Spain was created by voters\u2019 demanding better and more honest government. Both Mr. Rajoy (should he get the chance to form a real government) and Mr. S\u00e1nchez (should he allow it), as leaders of the two parties that bore the brunt of voter dissatisfaction, must understand that the way out of the gridlock is to demonstrate that they have heard the message.Advertisement"}

But he coupled the praise with a warning against \u201cillegal actions\u201d by the United States.He complained that American restrictions on banking and dollar transactions with Iran, which were unaffected by the nuclear agreement, have discouraged many banks from engaging with the country because they worry about possible penalties from the United States.\u201cThey\u2019re frightened, the big banks,\u201d he said at the news conference, accusing the Americans of \u201ccreating a lot of doubt.\u201dImpounding these assets, Mr. Rouhani told reporters, was \u201can international heist, to be quite frank with you.\u201dFacing re-election next year, Mr. Rouhani is under enormous domestic political pressure to show the beneficial consequences of the nuclear agreement.He said that \u201cany failure on the part of the United States in implementing it would constitute an international wrongful act and would be objected to by the international community.\u201dWhile the lifting of nuclear sanctions has enabled Iran to produce and sell far more oil, and its economy is growing faster than in other oil-exporting countries, the nuclear accord has not led to a trade and investment boom in Iran as Mr. Rouhani had forecast.Hard-line anti-American elements of Iran\u2019s hierarchy have also been highly critical of the nuclear deal, and stand to benefit politically at Mr. Rouhani\u2019s expense should it fail.Mr. Rouhani, who has advocated improved relations with the United States and other Western powers, said nothing about his own political prospects. But he said any failure in implementing the nuclear agreement \u201cwill further erode the credibility of the United States in the world.\u201dRick Gladstone reported from New York, and Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toasting and Roasting Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWashington \u2014 Scott Evertz thought it would be appropriate to watch the first presidential debate at a Teddy Roosevelt-themed bar.Mr. Evertz, who served as the director of the White House office on national AIDS policy during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, has voted for the Republican presidential nominee every four years since 1980. But not this year. Mr. Evertz is planning to vote for Hillary Clinton in November. He thinks Donald J. Trump, is \u201cdangerous,\u201d \u201creckless,\u201d and a liar.\u201cThe party of Teddy Roosevelt is gone,\u201d he said, nursing his first Scotch of the night.The bar was hosting a debate watch party, complete with all of Washington\u2019s sterile charm. The special menu for the debate included two $11 cocktails: one called Hillary\u2019s Inbox (an electric blue concoction) and another named Trump Tower (a twist on a Negroni).\u201cBlech!\u201d Mr. Evertz wrote in response, adding an emoji of a face sticking its tongue out.At the bar later that night, Mr. Evertz was joined by Matthew Lipina, a 22-year-old Republican and a recent graduate of Marquette University in Milwaukee. He said he was supposed to receive his absentee ballot from Wisconsin in the mail on Tuesday, and didn\u2019t know what he would do with it.\u201cDo I vote for what I\u2019ve been voting for, or do I vote for what I believe in?\u201d he said. Perhaps the debate would lend some clarity.The audio being piped throughout the bar was out of sync with the flat-screen televisions, meaning that it looked like Mr. Trump\u2019s words were coming out of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s mouth, or vice versa. Had Jill Stein been at the bar, she would have used it as a tortured metaphor about our broken two-party system.Mr. Trump began the debate the same way he began his presidential run, by saying that American jobs are \u201cfleeing\u201d to countries like Mexico.\u201cMexico! Drink!\u201d said a young man sitting at a nearby table, holding his drink aloft.In this crowd, even Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lamest zingers went over like gangbusters. \u201cI call it \u2018Trumped up\u2019 trickle-down economics,\u201d she said, and the crowd went wild.Later in the debate, Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump for talking about profiting off the 2008 housing crisis. \u201cThat\u2019s called business, by the way,\u201d Mr. Trump interrupted. The debate watchers in the bar groaned.\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mr. Evertz said, shaking his head in disbelief. \u201cThat speaks to who he is. My interests are most important, but you want to be president?\u201dAfter the debate ended and the bar cleared out, Mr. Evertz and Mr. Lipina chatted, nursing the rest of their drinks.Mr. Evertz said the debate solidified his support for Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Lipina still felt torn.\u201cWho do I believe in? Gary Johnson,\u201d he said. \u201cWho do I hope will win? Donald Trump.\u201dHe said that while his own political philosophy aligns more with Mr. Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate, he wants anyone but Mrs. Clinton to win because he finds her untrustworthy.The two Republicans, old and young, agreed not to stage their own mini-debate at the bar, but instead bonded over their mutual love of Mr. Johnson and scorn for entitled millennials. Soon after, they departed into the night to start tending to their debate hangovers; just three more nights like this to go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress Votes to Override Obama Veto on 9/11 Victims Bill", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats in large numbers joined with Republicans to deliver a remarkable rebuke to the president. The 97-to-1 vote in the Senate and the 348-to-77 vote in the House displayed the enduring power of the Sept. 11 families in Washington and the diminishing influence here of the Saudi government.The new law, enacted over the fierce objections of the White House, immediately alters the legal landscape. American courts could seize Saudi assets to pay for any judgment obtained by the Sept. 11 families, while Saudi officials have warned they might need to sell off hundreds of billions of dollars in holdings in the United States to avoid such an outcome.The override comes at an already freighted moment in America\u2019s relations with the kingdom. The Saudi government has vigorously denied that it had any part in the Sept. 11 attacks, and the commission investigating the plot found \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d Al Qaeda, the terror group that carried out the attacks. But the commission left open the possibility that some Saudi officials may have played roles.Mr. Obama angrily denounced the outcome, saying lawmakers had been swayed to cast a political vote for legislation that set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d with implications they did not understand and never debated.\u201cI think it was a mistake, and I understand why it happened,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a CNN town hall-style meeting with military personnel in Fort Lee, Va. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of why sometimes, you have to do what\u2019s hard, and frankly, I wish Congress here had done what\u2019s hard. I didn\u2019t expect it, because if you\u2019re perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an election, not surprisingly, that\u2019s a hard vote for people to take. But it would have been the right thing to do.\u201dThere were swift complications. Within hours of their vote, nearly 30 senators signed a letter expressing some reservations about the potential consequences of the law, including the prospect that the United States could face lawsuits in foreign courts \u201cas a result of important military or intelligence activities.\u201dThe White House and some lawmakers were already plotting how they could weaken the law in the near future, although there was general pessimism on Wednesday that Congress would agree to any changes. \u201cYou got to find consensus,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, after the vote. \u201cThen you need a vehicle.\u201dIt is unclear whether the Saudis will make good on warnings that the kingdom could unload hundreds of billions of dollars worth of assets inside the United States, and some economists have said that such a sell-off would do far more damage to Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy than America\u2019s.But legal experts say there is cause for concern in Riyadh.The law allows families of the Sept. 11 victims to alter lawsuits already underway \u2014 or file new suits \u2014 to directly sue Saudi Arabia and to demand documents and other evidence. It amends a 1976 law that grants foreign countries broad immunity from American lawsuits. Now nations can be sued in federal court if they are found to have played any role in terrorist attacks that killed Americans on United States soil.\u201cFrom there, the ball goes squarely into the Obama administration\u2019s court,\u201d said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law.As Mr. Vladeck noted, a little-discussed provision of the bill allows the attorney general to intervene in the lawsuits and get a judge to stay any settlement as long as there are continuing discussions with the Saudis about a possible resolution.The provision was added earlier this year to soften the legislation \u2014 preserving the executive branch\u2019s purview over foreign policy while still giving family members a path to sue.But the prospects of such discussions ever beginning are uncertain. The Saudi government has long denied any role in the Sept. 11 plot, and any negotiation with the United States could be viewed as acknowledging culpability.At the same time, lawyers for the families will no doubt push for judges to carefully scrutinize any attempt by the attorney general to delay court proceedings.\u201cThe families would of course expect that in the event the provision is invoked, that the courts exercise their inherent authority to assure good faith negotiations are in fact taking place and that the courts not simply rubber stamp executive branch requests for delay in resolution of their claims,\u201d said Allan Gerson, who is part of a team representing many of the Sept. 11 families.Mr. Gerson filed a lawsuit against Libya on behalf of families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103, which was brought down by a bomb as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.In recent days, Mr. Obama, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all wrote letters to Congress warning of the dangers of overriding the veto.John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director, released his own statement saying, \u201cAny legislation that affects sovereign immunity should take into account the associated risks to our national security.\u201dYet even most of Mr. Obama\u2019s strongest allies on Capitol Hill turned against him.\u201cThis is a decision I do not take lightly,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, one of the legislation\u2019s authors. \u201cThis bill is near and dear to my heart as a New Yorker, because it would allow the victims of 9/11 to pursue some small measure of justice, finally giving them a legal avenue to pursue foreign sponsors of the terrorist attack that took from them the lives of their loved ones.\u201dOnly one senator, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, sided with the president.The bill succeeded not with significant congressional debate or intense pressure from voters, but rather through the sheer will of the victims\u2019 families, who seized on the 15th anniversary of the attack and an election year to lean on members of Congress. That effort was aided by lawmakers\u2019 waning patience with the kingdom in recent years.The override also represents a White House miscalculation about Capitol Hill, where it was slow to pressure members and see the cracks in its firewall against the bill.Then this month, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who had encountered families of the Sept. 11 victims at a fund-raiser on Long Island, decided to put the bill on a fast track. The House voted overwhelmingly in favor, sending it to Mr. Obama\u2019s desk.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, gave voice to the unusual ambivalence that many members of Congress have expressed since they passed the bill.\u201cI do want to say I don\u2019t think the Senate nor House has functioned in an appropriate manner as it relates to a very important piece of legislation,\u201d said Mr. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cI have tremendous concerns about the sovereign immunity procedures that would be set in place by the countries as a result of this vote.\u201d Still, it was a vote he cast.An article on Thursday about the Congressional override of a bill allowing families of those killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the plot referred incorrectly in some editions to the attack on Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, which prompted lawsuits against Libya. The flight was brought down by a bomb as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland; it was not shot down.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "God Loves Donald Trump. Right?", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvangelical Christians may not approve of Trump, but they are among his strongest constituencies in this year\u2019s campaign. The Christian right has found common ground with Trump\u2019s less devout supporters on a wide range of matters.This country is the equivalent of that hijacked plane right now. We\u2019re headed to a disaster, unless we can get control of the cockpit again.Ladies and gentlemen, this is a Flight 93 election. This may be our last shot. It\u2019s time to roll. It\u2019s time to run down the aisle and save Western civilization.In April, P.R.R.I. asked voters: do you agree or disagree with the statement \u201cSociety as a whole has become too soft and feminine.\u201d The results demonstrated the overlap between the views of the religious right and the Trump electorate:Among religious groups, white evangelical Protestants stand out as the only one in which a majority, 53 percent, agree that society has become too soft and feminine.Along parallel lines, the survey found that 68 percent of Trump supporters agree that society is too soft and feminine, far more than supporters of any other candidate, Republican or Democrat.A second illuminating question P.R.R.I. posed to voters was whether this statement accurately described their feelings: \u201cIt bothers me when I come in contact with immigrants who speak little or no English.\u201dAgain Trump voters and the religious right agree. Compared to backers of all the other candidates, Trump voters expressed the highest level of discomfort, 77 percent. Among religious groups, white evangelical Protestants voiced the highest levels of distress, 64 percent, when they find themselves around immigrants who speak little or no English,.There are a host of other measures on which Trump supporters and the religious right are in accord.Take responses to a third P.R.R.I. statement: \u201cToday discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.\u201dA solid 57 percent majority of white Americans whom P.R.R.I. surveyed agreed, but two groups stood out: Trump supporters at 81 percent and white evangelical Protestants at 68 percent.The opinion overlap does not end there, P.R.R.I. found:No group of Americans is more nostalgic about the 1950s than white evangelical Protestants. Seven in ten (70-29) white evangelical Protestants believe that American culture and way of life has mostly changed for the worse since the 1950s.Donald Trump has successfully transformed evangelical voters from so-called \u201cvalues voters\u201d into \u201cnostalgia voters.\u201dSimilarly, according to P.R.R.I.,Republican and Republican-leaning independents who supported Trump during the primary are far more likely to say that American culture and way of life has gotten worse (68 percent) than to say it has improved (32 percent).Many conservative Christians consider enactment of religious liberty legislation crucial to the survival of their movement.Here is Deckman on the idea of \u201creligious liberty\u201d:Fearful that the government will make our pastors perform same-sex marriage? Fearful that our children will be placed in danger because they will have to use bathrooms that are gender neutral? Fearful that \u201cun-American\u201d Muslims will immigrate to the United States and enact sharia law? Religious liberty is a concept that encapsulates these concerns. Fear is always a powerful motivator in American politics.Yet another area of commonality between Christian conservatives and the Trump campaign is their shared belief in the duty of the strong to lead the weak \u2014 the importance of leadership built on strength, authority and discipline.Dobson\u2019s thinking on the topic of strength and authority is dominated by a single theme:If the strong-willed child is allowed by indulgence to develop \u201chabits\u201d of defiance and disrespect during his early childhood, those characteristics will haunt him and his parents for the next twenty years.As a case study for handling defiant children, Dobson describes his own method for dealing with a six-year-old pet Dachshund, Siggie, who refused Dobson\u2019s order to go to sleep in \u201ca permanent enclosure.\u201dThe only way to make Siggie obey is to threaten him with destruction. Nothing else works. I turned and went to my closet and got a small belt to help me \u201creason\u201d with Mr. Freud.What developed next is impossible to describe. That tiny dog and I had the most vicious fight ever staged between man and beast. I fought him up one wall and down the other, with both of us scratching and clawing and growling and swinging the belt. Inch by inch I moved him toward the family room and his bed. As a final desperate maneuver, Siggie backed into the corner for one last snarling stand. I eventually got him to bed, only because I outweighed him 200 to 12!To a power-hungry tyrant of any age, appeasement only inflames his or her lust for more power.Dobson\u2019s story about Siggie gives us a glimpse of how the views on authority of some on the right match up with Trump\u2019s views on what it takes to be an effective leader.Failed leaders \u2014 Trump\u2019s Republican opponents in the primaries, Republicans who continue to reject his bid and, most of all, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 are endlessly \u201cweak:\u201dOn Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire Republican Senator:On Clinton:On Obama:Weak leaders, in Trump\u2019s view, encourage adversaries to defy American authority. In this context, weakness and permissiveness are interchangeable.The list of humiliations goes on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea.For years, secular progressives have said that evangelical social action in America is not about religious conviction but all about power.This year, Moore noted, Christian leaders who in the 1990sgave stem-winding speeches about \u201ccharacter\u201d in office during the Clinton administration now minimize the spewing of profanities in campaign speeches, race-baiting and courting white supremacists, boasting of adulterous affairs, debauching public morality and justice through the casino and pornography industries.In backing Trump, Moore concluded, \u201ca group of high-profile old-guard evangelicals has proven these critics right.\u201dI would run from that candidate as far as possible, because the Sermon on the Mount was not given as a governing principle for this nation.In practice, Jeffress said:Nowhere is government told to forgive those who wrong it, nowhere is government told to turn the other cheek. Government is to be a strongman to protect its citizens against evildoers. When I\u2019m looking for somebody who\u2019s going to deal with ISIS and exterminate ISIS, I don\u2019t care about that candidate\u2019s tone or vocabulary, I want the meanest, toughest, son of a you-know-what I can find, and I believe that\u2019s biblical.In other words, key leaders of the Christian right want a president who will treat recalcitrant nations and people in the way that Dobson dealt with Siggie \u2014 \u201cthe meanest, toughest, son of a you-know-what I can find.\u201d It\u2019s little wonder that these same leaders are willing to overlook the bottomless list of Trump\u2019s personal and business failings.Clyde Wilcox, a political scientist at Georgetown who has written sympathetically about the religious right, emailed me his take:In the end it is partisanship and not religion that drives them nearly 40 years after the formation of the Moral Majority.The religious right was never about the advancement of biblical values. The modern, politically conservative evangelical movement we know is a movement rooted in the perpetuation of racial segregation, and its affiliation with the hard-right fringes of the conservative movement in the late 1970s produced a mutant form of evangelicalism inconsistent with the best traditions of evangelicalism itself. Since then, evangelicals have embraced increasingly secular positions divorced from any biblical grounding, and supporting Donald Trump represents the logical conclusion of that tragic aberration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Obama Is Right on Clean Energy", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsLast year, President Obama took aim at the nation\u2019s largest source of carbon dioxide pollution, announcing a plan that would reduce these climate-changing emissions from the country\u2019s power plants by one-third by 2030, from 2005 levels.Over the last 45 years, the nation has built a successful, durable legal framework to protect public health and the environment. This is the result of two factors: first, a clear, essential delineation of responsibilities between the federal government and the states; and, second, laws written sufficiently broadly to anticipate new threats to public health. Those critical elements came together in 1970 with the passage of amendments to the landmark Clean Air Act and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency by President Richard M. Nixon.The Clean Air Act of 1970 gave the new E.P.A. the duty to set national ambient air-quality standards for six major air pollutants to protect public health. The law also deliberately and explicitly gave states the authority to devise and implement their own plans to meet the E.P.A. standards.State responsibility was crucial to the legislative compromise that resulted in the amendments\u2019 passage by overwhelming majorities in both houses. Congress recognized that states were closer to the problems they faced, and often had a better understanding of how solutions could be tailored in more cost-effective ways. That consideration has defined virtually all subsequent public health legislation that the E.P.A. administers.Although states were given the primary responsibility to meet the standards, Congress gave the E.P.A. the power to implement plans of its own if states failed to act. The clear and unmistakable message from Congress to the E.P.A. was to protect the health of Americans.We have always viewed the E.P.A. first and foremost as a public health agency. In our time running it, both of us faced unanticipated threats to public health. The broad terms of the Clean Air Act gave us authority to act sooner rather than later.That model \u2014 federally set national standards coupled with state planning and implementation \u2014 is the bedrock of the legal structure that is now in place to protect public health. The Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Superfund all operate under that framework.The current challenge to the E.P.A.\u2019s power-plant rule once again thrusts the role of the states front and center. Principles of states\u2019 rights and responsibilities are at the core of the agency\u2019s approach. The E.P.A. has granted maximum flexibility to states to make the emissions reductions in ways tailored to address their specific circumstances.Given the explicit deference to state authority embedded in the Clean Air Act, the charge by opponents that this rule amounts to \u201cone of the most aggressive executive branch power grabs,\u201d as one state attorney general put it, simply ignores the law and its success over 45 years.The debate about whether the climate is changing is over. The consequences will be drastic if the United States and other countries do nothing. Climate change has no boundaries. It confronts all of us with the reality that what happens anywhere on the planet can affect all of us everywhere.The actions this country is taking to reduce greenhouse gases exemplify American exceptionalism. Our leadership is indispensable to international progress. Failure to accept and assert that responsibility guarantees that future generations of Americans will face a world markedly different from today\u2019s and bear a cost far in excess of addressing the challenge now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All Impeachments Are Political. But Was Brazil\u2019s Something More Sinister?", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterWASHINGTON \u2014 Was the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff as the president of Brazil on Wednesday a coup?Technically, the answer is no. Although there is no single definition of what constitutes a coup, it is at its core an illegal seizure of power. The Brazilian Senate\u2019s 61-to-20 vote to remove Ms. Rousseff was the culmination of a legal process set forth in the Brazilian Constitution, and it simply does not meet that standard.But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued for months that the effort to oust her was in fact a coup engineered by a small group of elites.They are not bothered by strict legal definitions. Rather, \u201ccoup\u201d has become shorthand for accusing Ms. Rousseff\u2019s political opponents of exploiting the law to subvert democracy.There is truth to that. But it is rooted in problems that afflict Brazil\u2019s entire political system, not just its right or its left.Any opposition party anywhere stands to gain from the downfall of the governing party\u2019s leader. In Brazil, that was heightened by the fact that members of the opposition had been caught up in a major corruption scandal.Ms. Rousseff was impeached on what analysts near universally described as minor charges: concealing a budget deficit by borrowing from a state-owned bank \u2014 illegal, but not a criminal offense.Amy Erica Smith, an assistant political science professor at Iowa State University who studies Brazil, said these charges \u201cdon\u2019t rise to the level of the kind of accusations that would merit impeachment,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not a legitimate use of the impeachment proceedings.\u201dThis is why Ms. Rousseff and her allies argued that the politicians pushing impeachment were not trying to protect the integrity of Brazilian democracy, but, rather, to manipulate it to serve their own ends. Calling the impeachment a coup became a way to question the motives of opposition leaders and to argue that impeaching Ms. Rousseff would be contrary to democracy.Normally, following the law \u2014 which the impeachers were indeed doing \u2014 by design serves democracy. But, in Brazil, there is currently just enough corruption and just enough rule of law for political elites to play the two against each other.Corruption, Professor Smith explained, is so endemic in Brazilian politics that it most likely implicates the entire governing class. The country also has a powerful judiciary that is actively working to investigate and prosecute corruption \u2014 an unstable combination.This gives political elites both a means and an incentive to expose their rivals, knowing it will probably ruin them.After all, if everyone is corrupt, everyone is vulnerable. But while that serves individual politicians, it weakens the wider political system by introducing instability.And because Brazil\u2019s economy is doing so poorly, the public is, understandably, angry at the government and eager to see corruption punished.So while Ms. Rousseff\u2019s supporters might see this impeachment as a cynical ploy, her opponents see a symbolic blow against a corrupt system \u2014 even if that corruption extends across party lines.There is also an important class dimension playing out.Ms. Rousseff led the left-leaning Workers Party, which positions itself as a champion of the poor.The opposition Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, which pushed for Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster and took power after she was suspended from office in May, is seen as a champion of business interests.\u201cWhen people talk about \u2018coup mongers,\u2019 \u201d said Professor Smith, \u201cthey\u2019re often implicitly thinking about, you know, a rich white woman who is upset that her maid now is entitled to labor protections that limit what this rich white woman can ask her maid to do.\u201d.So it is not the case, as some have argued, that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment was a coup in the sense that a handful of elites subverted the popular will. Nor have they, in these proceedings, gone outside the law. Rather, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s political opponents have done something subtler: They exploited the popular will and the letter of the law to serve their own interests, rather than the interests of democracy.Of course, in all countries, politicians act out of self-interest. And impeachment proceedings are always political \u2014 something that any American who lived through President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment hearings can tell you. But the particular nature of Brazil\u2019s system at this moment makes its politics particularly unstable, and gives individual politicians greater power to leverage democracy toward ends that are not so democratic.Advertisement"}

The last 14 years have been a period of decline, with the largest losses concentrated among the poor. To a certain extent, the large moves at the bottom of the distribution reflect that the poor earn very little to begin with, so even small changes in the level of income resulted in major percentage swings.With the incomes of the top 1 percent, on the other hand, it takes considerable increased income to get the same percentage gains. That makes those percentage changes in income for each state even more eye-popping.What\u2019s also intriguing about these charts is that between 1990 and 2014, the states that we tend to think of as economic engines for the country -- like New York, California and New Jersey --  are the ones where inequality has grown the most. By contrast, states that have lagged economically -- like Arkansas and Mississippi -- are the ones where economic inequality has narrowed the most.\u201cThe geography of U.S. inequality has really changed,\u201d Mr. Milanovic said. \u201cThe most unequal places are no longer the South but the West, the Southwest and New York.\u201dIt some ways, it makes sense that some of America\u2019s most productive states have become its most unequal. As the country\u2019s competitive advantage leans ever more heavily on highly skilled services, the returns for those skills grow greater. And as those skilled workers gravitate toward urban areas where they can be most productive, the states with those urban areas are going to have a class of people whose incomes grow out of touch with everyone else\u2019s.What about the South? How did it become so much more equal? One reason is that the poor in the South were very poor indeed. \u201cIn terms of income levels, we\u2019re one of the poorest,\u201d said Greg Albrecht,  chief economist for Louisiana\u2019s legislative fiscal office. \u201cBetween us and Mississippi, we fight for the bottom.\u201dThat means that federally funded social programs will have a greater impact on the lower percentiles of income in the South in percentage terms. And in fact, between 1990 and 2000, the two states with the greatest reductions in poverty rate were Mississippi at 10.8 percentage points and Louisiana at 6.4.\u201cHigher-income coastal areas are the slowest growing, while inland areas are by and large our faster-growing areas,\u201d Mr. Sisney said. \u201cThat frames how we think that income distribution has shifted.\u201dFor Louisiana, the migration story is reversed. According to Mr. Albrecht, Hurricane Katrina displaced many people, most of them poor. They moved to other cities like Houston or Atlanta and never came back. \u201cKatrina took low-income-percentile people out of the state and left us with higher-income-percentile people,\u201d Mr. Albrecht said.Other states literally struck oil. North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana, for example, have ties to a shale oil boom that has done a lot to reduce inequality. In the case of South Dakota and Montana, it has reduced the decline of incomes that other states experienced between 2000 and 2014. In North Dakota, in the heart of shale mining country, it generally made everyone richer.Advertisement"}

Electric cars, or even hybrid gas-electric models, were still seen as outliers.This year, the automakers at the Paris show will be highlighting their diesel alternatives \u2014 cars powered by gasoline engines, electric motors or hybrids of the two.Mercedes-Benz is rushing an all-electric sport utility vehicle to the show, the first of four new electric vehicles the German automaker plans to produce by 2020.Mitsubishi will introduce a range of gas-electric hybrids and all-electric vehicles. General Motors\u2019 Opel unit plans to unveil the Ampera-e, the European equivalent of the Chevrolet Bolt.Toyota will show off new Prius models with enhanced electric operation. Nissan\u2019s Infiniti luxury flagship brand will demonstrate a new 2-liter, 4-cylinder gas engine described as providing V6 power and diesel-caliber fuel economy.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.And even Volkswagen wants to demonstrate how fast it can shift marketing gears, by introducing new electric vehicle technologies at the show.Existing diesel engines will not be immediately relegated to the scrap heap, of course. Most high-volume models, especially those from the French automakers, will still be available with a range of diesel engine options. But there will be new emphasis on gasoline-engine equivalents, despite significantly higher prices for gasoline compared with diesel fuel in Europe.Even Paris, which has hosted the Mondial de l\u2019Automobile, as the show is officially known, since 1898, is turning its back on diesel.To address Paris\u2019s notoriously bad air quality, the municipal government since July 1 has banned cars that were registered before 1997 from operating on the streets weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The target of the ban was primarily older diesels.By 2020, environmental activists predict, all diesels might be banned from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saad Hariri: Iran Must Stop Meddling in Arab Affairs", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOn Feb. 14, 2005, a massive bomb killed the former prime minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri, my father, along with 22 other Lebanese. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon at The Hague identified five Hezbollah operatives as suspected collaborators in the murder. If proved, that would mean his assassination was carried out by Iran\u2019s allies in Lebanon, who are financed and controlled by the regime in Tehran.Three years later, in 2008, Hezbollah moved to occupy Beirut, and after many years of promising that its vast, Iranian-supplied arsenal was intended only to protect Lebanon from Israel, turned its weapons against the Lebanese people.More recently, Hezbollah has prevented Lebanon from electing a new president and has imposed a devastating gridlock on the country\u2019s government in order to blackmail the citizenry into accepting its demands.Meanwhile, Hezbollah has sent thousands of young Lebanese men to fight and die in Syria to defend the odious regime of Bashar al-Assad, the brutal dictator condemned in the United Nations and around the world for presiding over the deaths of at least a quarter million of his own people. Mr. Assad \u2014 with the help of Iran; its Revolutionary Guards and its proxies; Hezbollah and militias in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 has created the worst refugee problem since World War II, ruthlessly displacing millions of people into neighboring countries and Europe.We Lebanese are all too familiar with the violence, discord, sectarian hatred, brutality and terrorism that Iran and its allies inflict on other countries, whatever Iranian officials might try to claim to the outside world. Iran has been the world\u2019s greatest state sponsor of terrorism since the late 1970s.We have not forgotten the taking of Americans, and other Westerners, as hostages in the 1980s by Iranian proxies in Lebanon. We have not forgotten the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut airport, which killed 241 United States Marines, sailors and soldiers. The amnesia in much of the world about these events, let alone what is happening today in Syria and elsewhere, leaves us dumbfounded.In Syria, the disaster that has befallen its people began when Iran and its allies intervened to prop up the brutal dictatorship of Mr. Assad against a popular, and originally nonviolent and nonsectarian, pro-democracy uprising. The Syrian people were merely asking for the reform of a vicious and corrupt system by a government that rules by brute force. Now Lebanon is overwhelmed by some 1.3 million Syrian refugees driven from their homes by this remorseless regime.The tragedy in Yemen, too, began when the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel militia began its battle against its own people in a coup condemned by the United Nations Security Council. They did this simply to menace and threaten the stability of Saudi Arabia and the other Persian Gulf Arab states.In Iraq, Iran has promoted and funded brutal proxy militias that have spread sectarian hate in the country and are now undermining efforts to defeat the Islamic State.As Lebanon was trying to rebuild its economy after the civil war, Saudi Arabia stepped in with crucial assistance to the Paris conferences for the financial reconstruction of Lebanon, contributing more than $1.5 billion in aid.How many schools and hospitals has Iran built in Lebanon? How much help has it provided for Lebanon to rebuild itself? The answer, of course, is little to none, and any such Iranian aid is structured entirely to the political benefit of Hezbollah.Iran has a unique opportunity to help those who are really fighting extremism in the Arab world. But to do that, it must stop meddling in Arab affairs, from Yemen and Bahrain to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. It must stop feeding Sunni resentment, which only encourages a fringe minority to think terrorism is the answer. And Iran can force militias from Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Iran to leave Syria. That would be a great first step to clear the last tactical hurdle facing those who are really fighting extremism in the Muslim world.Iran can be part of the solution. But it must accept the extended Arab hand, led by Saudi Arabia, for normalized, neighborly relations, allowing Sunni Arabs to get down to the real task of getting rid of extremism.Saad Hariri is a member of the Lebanese Parliament and served as prime minister between 2009 and 2011.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On High-End Flights, Amenity Kits Worth Keeping", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateOnboard amenity kits for first- and business-class passengers on international flights are becoming hot-ticket items. While carriers may be stripping away perks for economy customers, they are lavishing them on the front-of-the-plane set.Some airlines are commissioning luxury fashion labels like Ferragamo to design the bags, while others are tapping local artisans for the job. And the toiletries go beyond the basics with products from high-end brands like Bulgari and La Prairie.Here, a look at the luxe kits seven airlines have created for their international first- and business-class passengers.

{"Headline": "Mexico City\u2019s Organ Grinders, Once Beloved, Feel Shunned", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMexico City JournalMEXICO CITY \u2014 Business was not going well for Mois\u00e9s Rosas. A saxophonist was down the street, making decent money. A young woman was loudly hawking eyeglass repair services. And Super Mario, stationed at the entrance to the pedestrian path, was drawing a crowd.Mr. Rosas\u2019 portable organ was no match. Even in the center of a busy thoroughfare, the crowds flowed past as a river might a rock, parting to avoid him and then rejoining seamlessly.\u201cThis is a dying art,\u201d Mr. Rosas said as he turned the dull metal lever of his instrument, wrenching out a troubled squawk. \u201cThe youth don\u2019t really value us.\u201dSo it goes for Mexico City\u2019s organ grinders, among the city\u2019s more curious class of street performers. For years, they were beloved by residents, but now they are in a gloomy mood, convinced that their art \u2014 and a central part of the city\u2019s culture \u2014 is fading away.Interviews with a dozen organists around town turned up mostly grievances, but their numbers tell a different story. According to their union president, there are more organ players now than there were at any time in the last 30 years.\u201cThese guys moan no matter what is happening,\u201d Luis Rom\u00e1n Dichi Lara, the head of the organ players\u2019 union, said recently. \u201cToday is a Tuesday. If you interview them tomorrow, which is usually a slow day, you won\u2019t believe the complaints you will hear.\u201dIn truth, he said, business is booming. Including nonunion members, whom he refers to as pirates, organ grinders number about 500, thanks to a lack of opportunities in other sectors of the economy. That is up from 350 when he started a few decades ago, Mr. Dichi Lara said.But the organists say that while their numbers may be growing, their wallets feel much lighter \u2014 a fact that union officials acknowledge.They are losing fans. Many young people, forced to listen to their music while out at a restaurant or in a square, pay them to leave. The ranks of older patrons, who recall the organ grinders with nostalgia, are thinning.Then there is the competition, which has multiplied in recent years. There are break dancers, mimes, movie characters, musicians, artisans and the afflicted, all vying for spare change.Worse, there are the superheroes.\u201cDon\u2019t even get me started on them,\u201d Mr. Dichi Lara said. \u201cYou place yourself in the perfect spot, start your music and, boom, here come Thor, Batman and Spider-Man.\u201d\u201cThey intimidate us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s like 15 of them. They just kick you out.\u201dCompetition aside, many residents said they thought that the organs themselves sounded awful. Some of the machines are more than 50 years old and sound every bit their age.\u201cThese songs, they play them over and over,\u201d said Javier Hern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, who runs a stall by the Z\u00f3calo, the city\u2019s central square, where the organ grinders perform. \u201cNo one likes them, but we can\u2019t get rid of them.\u201dIt is true that the organs have enjoyed staying power in Mexico. They first arrived in the country in the 1800s, making the trans-Atlantic journey from Germany into the parlors of the wealthy and privileged class, as well as in circuses. At that time they were made in Germany; today\u2019s organs come from Guatemala or Chile.By the mid-1900s, the organs had grown more popular, and players began to switch from German polkas to Mexican music \u2014 songs of love and nostalgia that appealed to older generations.These days, if a player does not own his instrument, he can rent one for about $80 a week, the union says.For a variety of reasons \u2014 the cost of proper maintenance, the lack of repair know-how and overuse of the instruments \u2014 the melodies are often horribly off key. A cloud comes over diners\u2019 faces when an organist pops up and begins cranking, forcing them to wait out the auditory assault.There is also a skill that newcomers do not appreciate, the older players say. It is a craft. An organist does not just turn the lever and let the instrument do its business. One must crank consistently, which is not so easy given the instrument\u2019s weight. The tempo must differ from song to song.This knowledge is often passed down from one generation to the next.Daniel Ch\u00e1vez, 40, works alongside his father on a bar-lined cobblestone street in the historical center of Mexico City, where he is slowly learning the trade.\u201cMy father is the best one I know,\u201d he said, pausing on a recent weekday to admire the older man, who has been playing for nearly 60 years.If there was a difference in the way his father played, the crowd did not seem to notice.Beyond tradition, locations are also handed down by generation, which can give the business a Mafia-like air.Mr. Rosas, for instance, often works with his wife. His sister-in-law works another prime location outside the cathedral in the historical center, which she inherited from her mother. Mr. Rosas\u2019 son, Oscar, fills in for her when she is unable to work a shift.And the head of the union, Mr. Dichi Lara? His brother-in-law is Mois\u00e9s Rosas.\u201cWhat can I say? We come from an organ-playing family,\u201d Mr. Dichi Lara said. \u201cBut to be honest, Mois\u00e9s\u2019 organ is pretty badly out of tune.\u201dOscar\u2019s, too.On a recent day, the 20-year-old mopped sweat from his brow as he played in his aunt\u2019s fixed location, in front of the soaring cathedral. He is passionate about his work.\u201cMy dream is to one day earn enough money to buy one of these, to conserve this part of our culture on our own,\u201d he said.This desire to preserve the culture seems to motivate donors as well.On a recent evening, Carlos Mart\u00ednez dropped a few coins in the hat of Sergio P\u00e9rez, an organist midway through his evening shift.\u201cNot many people help them,\u201d said Mr. Mart\u00ednez, 44, an office worker. \u201cI don\u2019t really like to listen to them that much, but if no one gives them money, they won\u2019t survive.\u201dPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foreign Reporters in China Face More Restrictions Now, Report Says", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cOf course, we can\u2019t compare this to the pressures felt by Chinese writers,\u201d Ms. Nossel said. \u201cBut we are dependent on the critical link that foreign correspondents play. They are an important piece of the puzzle of understanding China.\u201dThe report cited several areas of concern, including increased harassment of foreign journalists working in sensitive places, like Tibet and Xinjiang, an autonomous region in northwest China. Reporters interviewed said they were often videotaped while on assignment, and sometimes followed so closely that they could not interview residents.Although the report\u2019s findings are most likely consistent with the experiences of many foreign correspondents, some said it did not put the encounters in a longer-term perspective.In the 1990s, most trips outside the capital involved being accompanied by minders from the provincial government. Foreign correspondents also had to live in housing compounds that were guarded by soldiers. Although by the late 1990s and early 2000s these rules were increasingly ignored, they were still used to punish correspondents and separate them from local society.\u201cIt depends on their definition of recent,\u201d said Melinda Liu, who opened Newsweek\u2019s bureau in 1980 and is its current bureau chief. \u201cThere have been times when it was better but also times when it was much, much worse.\u201dChina eased restrictions in the prelude to the 2008 Summer Olympics. But after the Games, the country ramped up enforcement of regulations amid broadly tighter controls over Chinese civil society. Visa processing became more bureaucratic and sometimes restrictive, while the government was less willing to accept criticism of its leaders or policies.The report also critiques the lack of information provided by government ministries, a problem that dates back decades. Some journalists said they got less information from officials than in the past, especially routine statistics.\u201cThey impact the public opinion of our stakeholders globally,\u201d he said, including companies and their shareholders, governments, nongovernmental organizations like think tanks and volunteer groups, and the public.Despite the crackdown in civil society, in some ways more policy information is available than in the past because of the internet and social media. And despite heavy monitoring, Chinese discussion groups circulate trenchant critiques of government policy, even on delicate issues such as the Cultural Revolution. Although government officials rarely make themselves available for interviews, many of their policies and positions are clearer now than in past decades.One area of concern highlighted in the report is the government\u2019s exploitation of the division between media companies\u2019 business and news-gathering operations. Most media organizations say they insulate news-gathering operations from business strategies, but this has been harder to maintain as those companies seek opportunities in China.The report said a number of news organizations did not publish some stories in Chinese that were critical of China. Quoting anonymous journalists, it also said the news service Reuters had tightened its standards in a way that led to fewer news articles about human rights, though the report noted that the organization still covered the topic in ambitious news projects.The allegations could not be independently verified. A Reuters spokeswoman said, \u201cWe are extremely proud of our accurate, fair and independent reporting in China and around the world.\u201dThe report said The New York Times Chinese site did translate similar articles in full, although the site is blocked in China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Troubles Raise Fear of Global Shock", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Germany\u2019s largest bank appears in danger, sending stock markets worldwide on a wild ride. Yet the biggest source of worry is less about its finances than a vast tangle of unknowns \u2014 not least, whether Europe can muster the will to mount a rescue in the event of an emergency.In short, fears that Europe lacks the cohesion to avoid a financial crisis may be enhancing the threat of one.The immediate source of alarm is the health of Deutsche Bank, whose vast and sprawling operations are entangled with the fates of investment houses from Tokyo to London to New York.Deutsche is staring at a multibillion-dollar fine from the Justice Department for its enthusiastic participation in Wall Street\u2019s festival of toxic mortgage products in the years leading up to financial crisis of 2008. Given Deutsche\u2019s myriad other troubles \u2014 a role in the manipulation of a financial benchmark, claims of trades that violated Russian sanctions and a generalized sense of confusion about its mission \u2014 the American pursuit of a stiff penalty comes at an inopportune time.It heightens the sense that Deutsche \u2014 whose shares have lost more than half their value this year \u2014 needs to secure additional investment, lest it leave itself vulnerable to some new crisis.The biggest worries center on what happens if Deutsche falls apart to the point that it threatens the globe with a financial shock \u2014 and whether new rules and buffers put in place since the last crisis will keep the pain from spreading.Regulations that took effect this year in the European Union standardize how member countries are supposed to handle the potential implosion of a large financial institution. Banks, too, have put aside more money to deal with potential losses.Deutsche could pose the first test of the new arrangement. Recent challenges have underscored concerns about the limits of solidarity in Europe.From the chaos of the sovereign debt crisis to the acrimony over an influx of refugees, European authorities have proved something less than an exemplar of coordinated government action. The European Union has become a focus of populist anger, further constraining options. And Germany has opposed bailouts for lenders in other lands, making a Deutsche rescue politically radioactive.All of which adds to worries that Deutsche amounts to a fire burning, one that might yet become an inferno, while the fire department is consumed with existential arguments over its purpose. If the alarm sounds, no one can be sure what, if anything, will happen.In the worst case \u2014 now highly unlikely \u2014 the bank could collapse, inciting a scramble to pull money from markets around the globe. Institutions that trade with Deutsche would feel an urge to collect their cash immediately. Given the scale of the bank\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 1.8 trillion euros, or more than $2 trillion \u2014 that inclination is likely to spread to every crevice of finance. Economies would grind to a halt. Jobs and fortunes would disappear.Despite murmurings in pundit quarters that this sort of situation may be unfolding, provoking comparisons with the catastrophic bankruptcy of the American investment banking giant Lehman Brothers eight years ago, most economists dismiss such talk as overwrought and overblown.Deutsche is sitting on cash reserves worth \u20ac240 billion, or about $269 billion. It has sold bonds that can be converted to equity should the need arise. The Justice Department\u2019s proposed fine of $14 billion is viewed as the opening of a negotiation that could cost Deutsche a fraction of that amount \u2014 thinking that sent the stock surging on Friday.Not least, Deutsche Bank is a classic example of the species of financial animal known as Too Big To Fail.\u201cWe saw what happened with Lehman,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at LUISS, a university in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that the authorities would let something like that happen again. It has ties with all the banks in the world. It is highly leveraged. A disorderly default would be very, very difficult for the entire financial system.\u201dOn both sides of the Atlantic, the financial crisis prompted the construction of new regulatory authorities and requirements that banks set aside more funds in reserve against troubles.\u201cThe system is much more robust and resilient because of the buffers,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels. \u201cThere are pockets of fragility, but broadly speaking, the system is better prepared.\u201dBut the markets do not appear to fully buy that the defenses are secure.Deutsche is heavily involved in the trading of derivatives, the exotic financial instruments that were at the center of the 2008 crisis. Derivatives can be so mind-bendingly complex that no one fully grasps who owes what to whom until someone big enough to rattle markets suddenly cannot pay.Then, fear takes over, and investors dump holdings indiscriminately. This lowers the value of even solid assets on bank balance sheets, giving rise to further cause for concern.Because Deutsche has been dominated by its investment banking operations \u2014 meaning it is not sitting on a large pile of plain deposits as a cushion \u2014 it is especially vulnerable to such volatility.Fear, in other words, is not just a symptom of trouble but also a cause.A collapse may be exceedingly unlikely. Yet the beginning would probably feel something like recent days.Friday morning, Deutsche\u2019s chief executive officer, John Cryan, released a letter to his staff offering assurances that the bank boasted \u201cstrong fundamentals.\u201d The stock recovered slightly on those comments, but the sense remained that the need for reassurance attested to concerns.The biggest form of insurance against panic is confidence that larger players \u2014 in this case, European authorities \u2014 stand at the ready to mount a rescue, should one be required.But confidence is not something Europe has proved terribly skilled at instilling. Its abilities to marshal a bailout are dubious. New rules introduced to discourage reckless investments by large financial institutions bar taxpayer-financed bailouts.Germany has been adamant that these strictures be applied, rebuffing a recent attempt by the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to secure an exemption allowing him to inject taxpayer money into the Italian banking system. The optics of Germany seeking a way around the rules for its largest lender would be especially problematic.More broadly, Germany has been the most fervent voice that reckless economic pursuits should be punished, no matter the human toll.As Athens has negotiated with European authorities and the International Monetary Fund for a series of bailouts, Germany has demanded deep cuts to Greek public spending, sharply cutting pension payments to retirees. The Greek government used much of the bailout money to pay back debts to German banks.Against this backdrop, a German bailout of its largest bank would reinvigorate accusations that it uses the European Union as a cover to pursue its own national interests.This dynamic has force in the markets, presenting another factor that investors must absorb as the evaluate they risks of holding Deutsche\u2019s debts and shares.\u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t know the reaction of the authorities is a factor of uncertainty,\u201d said Mr. Veron of Bruegel.Here is a feedback loop that amplifies the risks. The likelihood that Deutsche needs a rescue appears small, yet the possibility that a rescue could be forged seems close to nil. That tightens the pressure on Deutsche.And yet Deutsche\u2019s stature may provide the decisive form of insurance. In event of emergency, the authorities might have to act, whatever the politics.\u201cDeutsche Bank is so big and so systemically important that the rules will be bent,\u201d Mr. Borri said. \u201cIf I were an investor, I would assume that the rules would be bent.\u201dFollow Peter S.

{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Newest Technology Innovation: Priest Delivery", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAKAI, Japan \u2014 The stubble-haired Buddhist priest lit incense at a small, cupboardlike altar just as members of his order have done for centuries. As the priest chanted sutras, Yutaka Kai closed his eyes and prayed for his wife, who died last year of complications from a knee replacement.Mr. Kai, 68, set aside his family\u2019s devout Buddhism when he left his rural hometown decades ago to work in a tire factory. That meant Mr. Kai did not have a local temple to turn to for the first anniversary of his wife\u2019s death, a milestone for Japanese Buddhists.Cue the internet. In modern Japan, a Buddhist priest can now be found just a few mouse clicks away, on Amazon.com.\u201cIt\u2019s affordable, and the price is clear,\u201d said Mr. Kai\u2019s eldest son, Shuichi, 40. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about how much you\u2019re supposed to give.\u201dThe priest at Mrs. Kai\u2019s memorial, Junku Soko, is part of a controversial business that is disrupting traditional funeral arrangements in Japan. In a country where regulations and powerful interests have stymied much of the so-called gig economy \u2014 Uber, for instance, is barely a blip here \u2014 a network of freelancing priests is making gains in the unlikely sphere of religion.But the priests and their backers say they are addressing real needs. They assert that obosan-bin is helping to preserve Buddhist traditions by making them accessible to the millions of people in Japan who have become estranged from the religion.\u201cTemples will sell you 10 yen candles for 100 yen,\u201d said Mr. Soko, 39. \u201cThey\u2019re protecting their own interests.\u201dSuch arguments will be familiar to anyone who has watched e-commerce companies upend other parts of the economy, from book publishing to airlines, taxis and hotels.Yet religion may prove to be an exception. It is so opaque \u2014 and so removed from the day-to-day lives of many modern Japanese \u2014 that a little technological disruption may prove welcome.The stakes are material as well as spiritual. As with religious institutions in many other countries, temples in Japan receive generous tax breaks.As with adherents of many religions, Buddhists typically give donations to priests for their services. Proponents of obosan-bin argue that conventional temples already operate like businesses \u2014 ones that put customers at a disadvantage though murky pricing. The amount is left up to the donor, a custom that leads many to overpay, Mr. Soko said.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to make things clear,\u201d he said.Much of the reaction in Japan to obosan-bin has been positive, for equally familiar reasons: It offers convenience and low, predictable prices.\u201cThere has been fierce criticism from the Buddhist world, but these days many people are abandoning religious funerals altogether,\u201d said Noriyuki Ueda, an anthropologist who studies Buddhism at Tokyo Institute of Technology. \u201cAt least people using obosan-bin think having a priest is necessary.\u201dMr. Kakubo of the Buddhist federation conceded that many temples had done a poor job of adapting.\u201cWe need to reflect on the fact that we\u2019ve created this situation where people feel that they have to turn to the internet,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAre we protecting our vested interests? Yes, obviously.\u201dThe process of booking a priest on Amazon can feel disconcertingly secular. Users click on one of several options and add it to a virtual shopping cart, the same way they would a juicer or a pair of shoes. Prices are fixed. A basic memorial ceremony at the home of the deceased costs \u00a535,000, or about $344.The most expensive package, with a second service at a cemetery and the granting of a special posthumous Buddhist name, costs \u00a565,000.The company has added another 100 priests to meet demand generated by its new partnership with Amazon, said Jumpei Masano, a spokesman. It expects bookings to increase by 20 percent this year, to around 12,000.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have any connection with a temple, so they don\u2019t know where to turn or what to do when they have to arrange a funeral,\u201d Mr. Masano said. \u201cWe saw there was a need.\u201dAmazon declined to comment. In a written reply to the Buddhist association in April, reported by Japanese news media, it said its goal was \u201cto provide as much information as possible\u201d to its users so they \u201ccan make their own decisions.\u201dWhen Mr. Kai\u2019s wife, Chieko, died, her funeral was held at a secular funeral parlor. But for the anniversary, Mr. Kai decided he wanted a priest.\u201cWe had a big altar in the house where I grew up, but not here,\u201d he said, gesturing around his small, tidy apartment in a public housing complex.He said he rarely thought about religion until his wife\u2019s death. In the years after World War II, rural dwellers like Mr. Kai poured into places like Sakai, an industrial suburb of Osaka. Relatively few bothered to put down new religious roots in the city.Today, 70 percent of Japanese identify themselves in surveys as nonreligious or atheist, though many said they still followed traditional religious customs such as going to a Shinto shrine at New Year or periodically visiting their ancestors\u2019 graves.Mr. Kai\u2019s daughter-in-law found Minrevi\u2019s website. Her only request was that the priest should belong to the order to which the Kai family had belonged in his hometown, in Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku.Mr. Soko fit the bill. At the ceremony, which took place in Mr. Kai\u2019s apartment, Mr. Soko delivered a short homily about faith and remembering the dead.The Kais seemed satisfied: They said they would request Mr. Soko for the next important death anniversary, in two years\u2019 time.Mr. Soko said innovations like obosan-bin are vital to Buddhism\u2019s survival. Most temples\u2019 dues-paying congregations are shrinking as a result of social change and rural depopulation.Incomes are shrinking, too. Revenue at temples and other religious institutions has fallen by a third in the last 20 years, mostly because of a drop in regular donations from long-term members, according to the government\u2019s Agency for Cultural Affairs.\u201cIn the seminary, they teach you to chant sutras, but they don\u2019t tell you anything about how to manage a temple,\u201d Mr. Soko said. \u201cWe have to try new things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some analysts have even said they might take a decade.But perhaps what they lack most of all is a game plan.Beneath the fog lie fundamental questions about how much economic pain Britain should risk to restore powers to its national Parliament and to curb immigration from the European mainland.For example, ministers must decide whether, to gain the restrictions they want on immigration, they are willing to endanger the health of London\u2019s financial center, which contributes billions in tax revenues, by sacrificing its unfettered access to European markets.The three men do not like one another much and, perhaps mischievously, Mrs. May has instructed them to share the use of Chevening, a 115-room country mansion in Kent, southeast of London, that is normally assigned to the foreign secretary but that is now nicknamed Brexit Towers.Tensions stemming from the turf wars surfaced in a leaked letter in which Mr. Fox asked Mr. Johnson\u2019s Foreign Office to surrender economic diplomacy functions to the Trade Department.Because Britain\u2019s trade deals are currently negotiated by European Union officials, the British government is chronically short on expertise and has had to call in expensive external consultants while starting to recruit its own specialists.In a statement after Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Mrs. May\u2019s office said there was a clear view among ministers that there should be a \u201cunique\u201d deal for Britain, with \u201ccontrols on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services.\u201dNone of the trading relationships enjoyed by neighbor nations outside the bloc, like Norway, Switzerland or Turkey, seem to fit Britain, suggesting that a tailored trade deal with the European Union \u2014 \u201cenhanced third-country status\u201d in the jargon \u2014 may be the best option.Legally, however, no global deals can be struck until Britain leaves the European Union, a process that will create economic losers at home. As a member of the bloc, Britain has access to Europe\u2019s $19 trillion integrated economy of more than 500 million citizens.Britain also pays into the European Union budget, money that many advocates of withdrawal have argued should be spent at home, particularly on the hard-pressed National Health Service.Supporters of leaving the bloc say that Britain\u2019s economic muscle will allow it to negotiate a better deal. (Mr. Johnson has said that his \u201cpolicy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\u201d) But there is no sign yet that the European Union will breach its principles by allowing Britain full market access without the usual quid pro quos on issues like freedom of movement.One British strategy would be setting political objectives \u2014 like regaining national sovereignty, rejecting free movement and renouncing the right of the European Court of Justice to trump British law \u2014 and fitting the economy around such aims.For the financial sector, a central issue is retaining \u201cpassporting\u201d \u2014 the right that banks and finance companies based in London currently have to offer services throughout the European Union.British businesses, like carmakers, want to avoid export tariffs, and many employers want the flexibility to continue recruiting European workers.\u201cWhat is interesting, is how little Theresa May has said,\u201d said Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIt would be good to get some sense of whether the government wants absolutely no free movement of workers or is willing to accept some free movement; do they want to retain passporting? Is the priority to avoid a situation where there are tariffs on cars?\u201dSome wonder how useful access to the single market would prove in the long run, even if it could be negotiated. That is because Europe\u2019s market is not written in stone but is the sum of various European laws, many of which are updated regularly.For example, the passporting rights prized by London\u2019s financial sector are based on at least nine separate pieces of European legislation, any of which can be amended.When Britain quits the bloc, it will have no vote on how those laws are updated or how new ones are framed, and legislation could easily be skewed to favor competitors in Dublin, Frankfurt, Milan or Paris. That fear has prompted British banks to press for legal agreements to prevent unilateral European changes to any new rules on market access \u2014 a clear sign of the risks they face.\u201cThe single market is dynamic and not static,\u201d said Mr. Grant, adding that countries like France and Germany \u201cwould say, \u2018We will listen to your views, but we will write the rules.\u2019 \u201dOver all, Mr. Grant said that for Britain, \u201cthe trade-offs will be painful, and that\u2019s why the government has said very little: It doesn\u2019t want to admit that it is in a pickle.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "If Trump Gets His Way, Real Estate Will Get Even More Tax Breaks", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIt\u2019s hard to imagine a tax code more favorable to real estate developers than the one we already have.Donald Trump has come up with one.But Mr. Trump\u2019s new tax proposal doesn\u2019t just preserve those breaks, it piles on new ones for real estate developers like Mr. Trump himself \u2014 at an estimated cost of more than $1 trillion in tax revenue over a decade.Moreover, this doesn\u2019t count Mr. Trump\u2019s more general tax cuts, which deliver the biggest windfalls to the highest earners. Many real estate developers would reap further gains from those provisions if they became law.Even conservative Republican tax experts have denounced the specific real estate measures Mr. Trump has outlined.Let\u2019s start with carried interest, a much-criticized tax loophole that allows private equity operators, hedge fund managers and real estate partners to convert ordinary income into capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.Wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity partners like the former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have attracted much of the criticism for exploiting the loophole, but the concept originated with real estate developers long before hedge funds were commonplace.Instead of taking a fee for their management services (which would be taxed as ordinary income) people who earn carried interest take a percentage of assets under management and a percentage of the eventual profits, a formula often described as \u201ctwo and twenty.\u201d The percentage of profits is taxed at the lower capital gains rate.In what at first might seem a laudable effort to put the public interest ahead of his own financial gain, Mr. Trump called for abolishing the loophole. \u201cWe will eliminate the carried interest deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers,\u201d Mr. Trump said in Detroit on Aug. 7.But his fellow real estate investors and the Wall Street interests he lambastes needn\u2019t worry. He\u2019s offering them an even better tax break that renders carried interest irrelevant.Mr. Trump has proposed a new rate \u2014 15 percent on all corporate and business income \u2014 that is lower than the current capital gains rate of 20 percent on profits from the sale of assets, which is already well below the top tax rate on ordinary income of around 40 percent. The new lower rate would apply to \u201cpass-through entities,\u201d according to Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, \u201cTax Reform That Will Make America Great Again.\u201dWhile they can be found in all sectors of the economy (including private equity and hedge funds), they are especially prevalent in real estate. Mr. Trump identified 564 separate business entities in his financial disclosure forms, most of them L.L.C.s and partnerships.That amounts to a huge tax cut even for people who had been paying taxes on carried interest at the preferential rate, \u201csince most carried interest is generated by a business entity,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation\u2019s Center for Federal Tax Policy. The center warned last year, before Mr. Trump\u2019s latest revisions, that his overall plan could cost over $10 trillion in reduced tax revenues over 10 years, depending on how it is calculated.\u201cThe rich who already benefit from carried interest will get a big tax cut,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin agreed.The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that lowering the rate on business income from pass-through entities to 15 percent would cost $1 trillion over 10 years.Mr. Trump already benefits from enormous depreciation benefits, which allow active real estate developers like him to use paper losses to offset other earned income. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals go even further, allowing for immediate write-offs rather than spreading them over several years.\u201cWe will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments,\u201d he said in Detroit.The idea of immediately expensing capital investments rather than writing them off over time has many supporters among tax experts, including the Tax Foundation and Mr. Holtz-Eakin. Among other things, it simplifies the calculations and in theory would promote capital spending at a time it\u2019s been lagging.But few, if any, support expensing capital investments while also allowing an interest expense deduction.That\u2019s because the combined deductions provide a reason to borrow even when it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. As a simple example, consider a landlord\u2019s $1,000 investment in a new garage door for a rental property. Someone who borrows $900 at 5 percent would spend just $100 out of pocket, but could deduct $900 plus interest, or $945, generating a large tax loss. Even assuming Mr. Trump\u2019s favorable business tax rate of 15 percent goes into effect, the tax benefit ($142) is greater than the cash spent, creating a purely tax incentive.Here\u2019s what the 2005 President\u2019s Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform under President George W. Bush concluded: \u201cAllowing both expensing of new investments and an interest deduction would result in a net tax subsidy to new investment,\u201d the report found. \u201cProjects that would not be economical in a no-tax world might become viable just because of the tax subsidy. This would result in economic distortions and adversely impact economic activity.\u201dEvery other proposal to expense business investments, including the House Republican plan, limits interest deductions.Eliminating the interest deduction \u201cwill generate an enormous amount of kvetching out of highly leveraged investors, real estate developers among them,\u201d said Mr. Holtz-Eakin. \u201cI have no sympathy for that. If your business model depends on interest deductibility, that\u2019s not a business, it\u2019s a tax shelter.\u201dMr. Trump hasn\u2019t explicitly addressed whether interest payments should remain deductible, as they are now, but various advisers have said he supports maintaining the deduction. (The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to my requests for comment.)\u201cTrump is a debt king,\u201d said Mr. Rosenthal. \u201cHe\u2019s made a living from deducting interest. He\u2019s never going to give that up.\u201dThe changes and inconsistencies in Mr. Trump\u2019s tax reform proposals have left many experts scratching their heads. \u201cTrump has no overarching principle that I can identify,\u201d said Mr. Holtz-Eakin. \u201cI want a tax code to express values. It should be about something,\u201dThat leaves it open to speculation that Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is mostly about himself and other wealthy real estate developers. It\u2019s hard to tell for sure, since he hasn\u2019t released his tax returns.If, as I\u2019ve suggested, he pays little or no tax because he can use the existing tax code to reduce his taxable income to near zero, or even a loss, his proposals that extend even more breaks to developers might have relatively little impact on his own tax obligations.Still, to the degree they would reduce his tax rate to 15 percent and accelerate depreciation while maintaining the interest deduction, they would ensure that Mr. Trump \u2014 and most of his friends on Wall Street who would be well positioned to exploit his new loophole \u2014 would never pay anything close to the 33 percent top rate he\u2019s now proposing for his fellow Americans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debate Night Message: The Markets Are Afraid of Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewWall Street fears a Trump presidency. Stocks may lose 10 to 12 percent of their value if he wins the November election, and there may be a broader economic downturn.These conclusions arise from close analysis of financial markets during Monday\u2019s presidential debate, which provides a fascinating case study of the complex interconnections between American politics and economics. The market\u2019s judgment stands in sharp opposition to Donald J. Trump\u2019s claims that his presidency would be good for business.Decoding these market signals is no easy task because it is difficult to disentangle correlation from causation. Ideally we would observe stock prices in parallel universes with identical economic conditions, with a single exception: In one, Mr. Trump has a good shot at becoming president, while in the other, his chances are low.During the debate, the overnight futures markets rallied, raising the value of broad stock market gauges like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index by two-thirds to three-quarters of a percentage point. This was a consequential move, and because it was driven by the reduced chance of a Trump presidency, it reveals that the market believes that stocks would be worth more if he were to lose the election. Four pieces of evidence support this interpretation.First, the rally played out in virtual lock step with Mr. Trump\u2019s debate performance. When Mrs. Clinton pummeled him over his tax returns, stocks rose. And this pattern of stocks rising in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s miscues continued through the evening.Second, the rally occurred between 9 and 11 p.m. on a Monday, typically a fairly tranquil time and, in this case, a stretch in which there was no other important economic or financial news. This suggests that the rally was not driven by other factors. Lisa Brown, principal at Gorgon Capital Research, said, \u201cThe only thing going on that would move markets in this time frame would be the debate.\u201dThird, the rise in stock prices was unusually large for that particular time period \u2014 larger than during the same window on all but one of the 200 previous Mondays. It appears to be a statistically significant move, not one caused by mere chance.All told, it appears that Mr. Trump\u2019s apparently declining political fortunes drove stocks higher. This implies that the market expects better times if Mrs. Clinton becomes president. If Mr. Trump stages a comeback in the next debates, expect stocks to fall sharply.How much better would the market perform under a President Clinton than a President Trump?Consider the rise in stock futures. At first blush, an increase of less than 1 percent doesn\u2019t sound like much. But it points to something much bigger. After all, if a relatively small decline in the likelihood of a Trump presidency led to a modest stock rally, then a larger decline in Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral fortunes would most likely lead to a larger market reaction. A surprise win for Mr. Trump would probably set off a substantial market correction.Putting the pieces together (multiplying that 16 by the percentage point rise in the S.&P. 500 value), this suggests that the market expects stock prices to be 10 to 12 percent lower if Mr. Trump wins than they will be if he loses.This is a big difference.What does it all mean? When economists conduct \u201cevent studies\u201d like this, they typically do so in the hope that movements in stock prices reflect the informed bets of traders trying to assess the future profitability of the businesses they\u2019re buying or selling. If that\u2019s right, then Wall Street is telling us that if Mr. Trump is elected, it expects the profitability of America\u2019s largest businesses to be about 10 to 12 percent lower on average in the future.This is all the more remarkable because it occurs despite Mr. Trump\u2019s having promised an enormous profit-raising corporate tax cut. Either the markets don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll deliver on these tax cuts, or they believe that the rest of his economic program will do enough harm to more than offset the benefits of lower taxes.Assessing what this means for the broader economy requires a bit of guesswork. It all depends on the extent to which Wall Street\u2019s worries are also worries for Main Street.If the Trump stock discount reflects expectations of lower earnings and if the rest of the economy performs like publicly traded companies, the math suggests that overall national income would fall substantially, perhaps by as much as 10 to 12 percent over coming decades. If only big publicly traded companies were to suffer, the decline would be less; if the rest of the economy were more vulnerable, there would be a greater decline.Some of the market\u2019s aversion to Mr. Trump probably reflects the assessment that the world would simply be riskier under him. Traders are so unsure of what the future would hold that they\u2019re reluctant to invest in stocks without a huge discount.Typically, we found that no candidate moved the market by more than a couple of percentage points. Moreover, it was somewhat more common for the stock market to rise slightly on the election of a Republican than of a Democrat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At BlackRock, a Wall Street Rock Star\u2019s $5 Trillion Comeback", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Laurence D. Fink, the leader and founder of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, had come home.A Bruin to the bone \u2014 class of 1974 \u2014 he had a story to tell the 5,000 giddy graduates packed into the cavernous basketball arena at the University of California, Los Angeles. Once upon a time he was a rock star on Wall Street. He had big hair and flashed turquoise jewelry, and making money had never seemed so easy.Until it wasn\u2019t.\u201cI screwed up,\u201d Mr. Fink declared, recalling the $100 million he blew thanks to failed mortgage trades in 1986. \u201cAnd it was bad.\u201dFor the graduating millennials, the morality tale resonated not least because it came from a U.C.L.A. grad who had ascended, fallen from and again scaled Wall Street\u2019s treacherous peaks. But it was his description of why he stumbled that truly explained his evolution from down-on-his-luck bond trader to master of a firm that has its eye on a sum about equal to the $16 trillion United States economy.\u201cI had become complacent \u2014 too sure of what I thought I knew,\u201d Mr. Fink said. \u201cI believed I had figured out the market. But I was wrong because while I wasn\u2019t watching, the world had changed.\u201dOver the last decade, no other financial firm has gone further in challenging the classic Wall Street moneymaking model for investment banks and traditional mutual fund companies: Hire \u2014 and handsomely pay \u2014 hotshots to make big bets with other people\u2019s money.The future of finance, Mr. Fink has argued, lies with rules-based, data-driven investment styles such as exchange-traded funds, which track a variety of stock and bond indexes or adhere to a set of financial rules. The idea is that such an approach eliminates at least some of the potential for human error, while lowering costs.It is this notion of using technology to root out investment risks that lies at the heart of BlackRock\u2019s investing strategy. Putting this into practice is the firm\u2019s risk-mitigation platform, Aladdin, which enjoys a ubiquity within the firm \u2014 it tracks everything from bond trades to head count \u2014 that evokes HAL 9000, the sentient computer in the movie \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d Some employees even use Aladdin as a verb, as in, \u201cHas the new portfolio manager been Aladdinized yet?\u201dBut in today\u2019s world of violent price swings and cash-starved markets, those with near infinite buying power \u2014 central banks, sovereign wealth funds and the largest money manager in the land \u2014 have become the new arbiters of flow. \u201cWe have never seen a paradigm shift like this,\u201d said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr., an analyst with the Tabb Group, which analyzes the structure of financial markets. \u201cIt is not about the flow of securities anymore, it is about the flow of information and indications of interest.\u201dBlackRock\u2019s strategy was forged, and ultimately empowered, by two market calamities over the last three decades. The first, of course, was Mr. Fink\u2019s experience at First Boston in 1986, when he bet big on mortgages without assessing how the securities would trade in a period of extreme stress.But BlackRock became the behemoth it is today only after the events of 2008. That is when a souped-up, toxic variety of the securitized mortgages that Mr. Fink helped design years earlier at First Boston imploded \u2014 setting off a chain of bank failures and the deepest global economic downturn since the Great Depression. Chastened investment banks were forced to exit these businesses under pressure from regulators.And in stepped BlackRock. Its assets under management swelled as investors \u2014 starved for higher returns \u2014 piled into the company\u2019s E.T.F.s, which tracked the highflying markets.\u201cThe balance of power is now with firms like BlackRock because they have the \u2018bid,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Perrotta of Tabb, using Wall Street argot to describe the buying power of large asset managers.The power shift was on display this spring, when Mr. Fink took the stage at an investor conference alongside John Cryan, recently charged with reviving the sagging fortunes of Deutsche Bank, one of the global investment firms that was minting money before the markets collapsed in 2008. While the event was billed as a cozy exchange of ideas between two Wall Street heavy-hitters, it played out instead as a series of slightly peevish questions posed by Mr. Cryan to Mr. Fink.\u201cYou are effectively becoming the supplier of liquidity of last resort \u2014 beyond the central banks,\u201d Mr. Cryan said to Mr. Fink.The assertion bordered on the impudent \u2014 suggesting that BlackRock and its $5 trillion stash of assets had become the new guarantor of stability because of its ability to buy and sell stocks and bonds in times of duress. Investment banks, which previously aspired to this duty, have been complaining for years that the financial system has become riskier because BlackRock and similar firms cannot perform such a market-making function.But to say as much to Mr. Fink directly \u2014 and in a room full of investors, no less \u2014 was highly unusual. Mr. Fink was clearly irritated by the query. \u201cWell that is not our role \u2014 we won\u2019t play that role,\u201d he replied stiffly.It was not the most convincing of replies.Over the last 10 years, Mr. Fink has transformed BlackRock from a bond shop catering to pension funds and insurance companies into an asset-gathering machine that uses advanced technology to reimagine how investors buy, sell and assess the risks of a wide variety of securities. Via its $1 trillion-plus in exchange-traded funds, BlackRock has been instrumental in creating newly liquid markets in high-yield and corporate bonds \u2014 a direct attack on the business model of banks like Deutsche Bank.And through its big data-mining risk platform, Aladdin, or Asset Liability and Debt and Derivatives Investment Network, BlackRock says it has developed the market\u2019s most highly evolved framework for stress-testing how securities will respond to certain situations \u2014 such as a sudden rise in interest rates or what happens in the event of a political surprise, like Donald J. Trump being elected president.Staffed by 2,300 of BlackRock\u2019s 13,000 employees, Aladdin promises to help firms trade, analyze and keep a compliant eye on the assets they manage. In an era of severe regulatory scrutiny, the service has become quite popular. Seventy-five firms \u2014 including Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management unit and Freddie Mac \u2014 managing a total of $10 trillion, now use it.Mr. Fink maintains a grueling schedule, mixing regular bicoastal trips in the United States with frequent client jaunts to China and the Middle East. \u201cThis job requires an enormous commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pace is relentless. There will be a day when I wake up one day and say I just can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201dThat day remains well in the future, he says. Still, with BlackRock\u2019s growth in size and sway, the issue of who, if anyone, from within the firm is qualified to succeed Mr. Fink has become an existential question for the company\u2019s board of directors.The problem is typical when replacing a founder: Mr. Fink has increased assets to $5 trillion from zero, and the imprint of his domineering personality has become so profound that virtually anyone will suffer to some degree in comparison, considering his track record.After all, in 1983, he structured one of the first collateral mortgage obligations, and along with Lewis Ranieri at Salomon Brothers made it possible for large investors to enter the market for mortgages. A quarter of a century later, Mr. Fink recognized that the time was right for E.T.F.s and \u2014 in the depths of the financial crisis \u2014 bought Barclays\u2019s iShares business, a deal analysts consider one of the shrewdest in recent Wall Street memory.And beyond a soaring stock price, there are few better ways for a financial chief to command the respect of his peers than to slip through the grasp of regulators. So when Mr. Fink and his high-powered lobbyists in Washington were able to make the case, after the 2008 financial crisis, that major fund companies like BlackRock posed no risks to the markets because of their size, it only added to his aura.That, more or less, is what Mr. Fink told Dexter Senft, his computer expert at First Boston in 1982. \u201cWe are bringing the computer onto the trading floor, Dexter,\u201d Mr. Fink recalls saying at the time. \u201cIf we can do this, it will change our business forever.\u201dNot only would Mr. Fink and his bond wizards be able to sell billions of dollars of new securities, giving birth to today\u2019s market for asset backed mortgages, they could also analyze how these securities would trade in certain situations.The immense losses at First Boston in 1986 taught a lesson that eventually shaped BlackRock. Mr. Fink realized that his clients on the \u201cbuy side\u201d (the fund managers, insurance companies and pension funds shopping for investments) had become dependent on the ability of the \u201csell side\u201d (the Wall Street investment banks) to analyze mortgages. That was because few buy-side clients had invested in computers and technology to the level First Boston had.Most money management firms highlight their investment returns first, and risk controls second. BlackRock has taken a reverse approach: It believes that risk analysis, such as gauging how a security will trade if interest rates go up or down, improves investment results.That is where Aladdin comes in. Aladdin is a network of code, trades, chat, algorithms and predictive models that on any given day can highlight vulnerabilities and opportunities connected to the $15 trillion the firm tracks \u2014 $10 trillion of which belongs to outside firms that pay BlackRock a fee to have access to the platform.Aladdin fills the monitors of most BlackRock employees. One portfolio manager even went so far as to hang a nearly cinema-size screen on his office wall in order to get the full Aladdin experience. And at the company\u2019s investor day in June, Mr. Fink and other top executives mentioned Aladdin 82 times \u2014 more than any other business line \u2014 even though the platform represents just 5 percent of the $11.3 billion in revenues BlackRock took in last year.From Mr. Fink\u2019s early days on Wall Street, his ambition has been stoked by a sense that he has not been receiving the proper credit for his achievements. At First Boston, even though he was among the earliest to popularize trading in mortgage securities, his peers including Mr. Ranieri and others drew more public attention as innovators and moneymakers.As a successful, albeit mostly anonymous, bond manager at BlackRock in the 1990s and 2000s, he saw acclaim, pay and influence go to the chief executives of Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. That began changing only in 2009, when he bought Barclays\u2019s E.T.F. business. Last year he was among a small circle of Wall Street executives to attend the state dinner at the White House for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.A part of Mr. Fink \u2014 a fervent Democrat today \u2014 believes he would make a pretty good Treasury secretary, say people who have discussed politics with him. Although he recently persuaded Cheryl Mills, one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest advisers, to join the board of BlackRock, the view is fairly strongly held that if Mrs. Clinton becomes president, there is little chance that she will tap a Wall Street insider for the Treasury job.With BlackRock\u2019s stock having more than doubled since 2011, far outpacing the likes of Goldman and JPMorgan and trading close to its record high, it seems that the market has come around to Mr. Fink\u2019s financial worldview: that a low cost, systematic style of investing will, over time, grow faster than the costlier \u201cactive investing\u201d model in which individuals, not algorithms, make stock, bond and asset allocation decisions.And the numbers in that regard are arresting. Through July, E.T.F.s and traditional index funds made up 30 percent of total mutual fund assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, a ratio that has doubled in just under 10 years.Of course, with close to $1.5 trillion in actively managed funds, Mr. Fink is not ready to write off a segment of the industry that even after years of outflows clocks in at $11 trillion. And he underlines the importance of being able to offer the best of both active and passive investing styles to BlackRock clients.But inside the firm and out, there is little doubt that he is betting the ranch on E.T.F.s and similarly themed investments choices. These include so-called factor strategies, in which a bet is made on a certain investment outcome \u2014 like value stocks outpacing growth stocks, or a basket of low-volatility equities beating the broader indexes.In San Francisco, a team of equity investors deploys data analysis to study the language that a chief executive uses during an earnings call. Does he seem unusually bearish this quarter, compared with last? If so, maybe the stock is a sell.\u201cWe have more information than anyone,\u201d Mr. Fink said.Some analysts, in fact, argue that BlackRock should be valued as a technology company, as opposed to an asset manager.Mark Wiedman, 45, a BlackRock executive who is on the short list to succeed Mr. Fink, believes that bond E.T.F.s, in particular, are creating a liquid market where a new generation of bond investors can freely buy and sell.For years, he and Mr. Fink have been pitching insurance companies and pension funds to stop buying individual bonds (from the likes of Deutsche Bank) and instead choose a BlackRock bond E.T.F. Now it\u2019s happening.\u201cI think of E.T.F.s as technology,\u201d Mr. Wiedman said, as he leaned back in a swivel chair in his office. \u201cIt is a product that bundles up a bunch of securities, puts them on a screen and makes them easier to trade.\u201dLike many top executives here, Mr. Wiedman can get a bit manic when discussing the subject: Midway through an interview, he felt the need to somewhat violently undo his tie and cast it aside.Regulators are less enthusiastic. Global watchdogs like the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have described these bountiful flows into and out of BlackRock bond E.T.F.s as a liquidity illusion. Which means, according to Ken Monaghan, an investor in high-yielding corporate bonds, that easy-to-trade E.T.F.s have lured \u201ctourist\u201d investors \u2014 people seduced by the rich yields, but who may not be able to stomach a sustained market reversal.And if they all leave at once, watch out.\u201cE.T.F.s do not create liquidity,\u201d said Mr. Monaghan, of the global fund manager Amundi Smith Breeden. \u201cThese new investors are not permanent.\u201dAside from Mr. Wiedman of BlackRock, the short list to succeed Mr. Fink includes Robert S. Kapito, 59, a founding partner and current president of the firm who is seen as the top choice if a handover occurs sooner rather than later. Other candidates are Rob Goldstein, the 42-year-old chief operating officer and driving force behind Aladdin\u2019s growth; Mark McCombe, 50, a former HSBC executive who looks after the firm\u2019s big clients; Rich Kushel, 50, who oversees multi-asset investment strategies for clients; and Gary Shedlin, 52, the chief financial officer. There is also Mark Wiseman, a new hire who joined the firm this month to oversee its equity business.It is a long list, and purposely so. For Mr. Fink, recommending a successor to his board is probably the weightiest decision he will make as BlackRock chief. He has taken pains to not tip his hand. \u201cI want to make sure that the day after I leave, the firm is better off without me,\u201d he said.This spring, Mr. Fink called together more than 100 of the firm\u2019s most senior executives for two days of meetings in Barcelona, Spain. BlackRock was approaching its 30th anniversary and Mr. Fink was in a nostalgic mood. Yet there was an edge to his remarks.Yes, BlackRock was thriving because of its focus on low-risk, low-cost funds and the all-seeing wonders of Aladdin. But now was not the time to coast.Nor was this a time to sit fat and happy on a big pile of assets and let the fees roll in, an indirect slap at actively managed giants such as Franklin Templeton and Pimco, where assets under management have recently been declining.Never before, he said, had the fund management industry been so competitive and changing. \u201cIf you think you know everything about our business, you are kidding yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest question we have to answer is: \u2018Are we developing the right leaders?\u2019\u201dAnd then, looking out over the striving BlackRock executives gathered before him, he put it to them directly. \u201cAre you,\u201d he asked, \u201cprepared to be one of those leaders?\u201dAdvertisement"}

But not too good.\u201cIt confirms that the economy is performing well, but does not provide the threat of overheating that might have caused an interest-rate increase sooner rather than later,\u201d said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust.Republicans and Democrats mined the report for evidence that supported the economic arguments they will make through the November election. How to handle a recovery that has delivered steady but less than spectacular growth has not only been a flash point among Fed bankers \u2014 who will next meet on Sept. 20 and 21 \u2014 but also between the presidential candidates Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton.\u201cThe latest economic numbers from the past day paint a bleak picture,\u201d said Curtis Ellis, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump.At the same time, Democrats have pointed to the positive signs in the overall economy, highlighting sturdy job growth in the private sector that has lasted a record 78 months, and a low jobless rate.Some economists say that a recovery as modest and uneven as this one would normally add to the problems for the incumbent political party, but the unorthodox nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy could help Mrs. Clinton overcome the odds.\u201cA kind of ho-hum status quo economy might not have been good enough for Clinton against a normal Republican candidate,\u201d Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, said. \u201cBut against Trump maybe it will be enough.\u201dThe jobless rate, based on a separate survey of households, stayed at 4.9 percent, roughly half of what it was seven years ago, and consumer spending remains healthy. But a broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged and underemployed workers is nearly twice that figure.Wages have only recently begun to climb. The 12-month increase was a modest 2.4 percent in August, slower than in the previous month but a pace that keeps most workers ahead of inflation.Earlier, monthly job gains flip-flopped, plummeting to 24,000 in May and swelling to more than 10 times that number in June and July.As Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez said, \u201cSometimes the porridge is really hot; sometimes the porridge is really cold; this one is in between.\u201dEconomists, who estimate that the nation needs about 100,000 new jobs every month to keep up with population growth, say it is natural for the jobs machine to slow as the pool of unemployed workers gradually dries up.Still, large numbers of prime-age workers remain out of the labor market altogether, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots and depressing wage gains.\u201cA lot of people are still on the bench that could come into the labor market,\u201d said Ken Esch, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC, an accounting and consulting network. \u201cUntil more people are participating, I don\u2019t see the inflationary pressures, and our data says we don\u2019t expect to see much over the next 12 months.\u201d\u201cThe tide has begun to turn,\u201d William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said when the report was released. \u201cFor the first time in quite a while, we are seeing gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide.\u201dIn his view, older workers who were able to delay retirement when the recession hit did so, blocking more junior employees from moving up the pipeline. That clog is finally beginning to clear.\u201cThat leads me to the conclusion that it is not caused by technology but is a result of institutional and policy choices we\u2019ve made as a country,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cFor women, we do very little to subsidize child care or make workplaces flexible. When it comes to men, we spend very little money to train people for jobs or find jobs.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter:@PatcohenNYTAlan Rappeport contributed to this article.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Yahoo\u2019s Data Breach Could Affect Its Deal With Verizon", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorA material adverse change is specifically defined to include any:circumstance, event, development, effect, change or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate . . . has had, or would or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties, results of operation or financial condition of the business, taken as a whole.For those with the patience to read through this lawyer language, you will note that it defines a MAC not very helpfully as a \u201cmaterial adverse effect.\u201d Given the redundancy here, the true definition of a such a clause has been explained by the Delaware courts, the place where any dispute over the Yahoo deal will be litigated.In Huntsman\u2019s case, there was no material adverse change to its business. Huntsman\u2019s 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, its so-called Ebitda, was only 3 percent below its 2006 Ebitda, and its 2008 figure was estimated to be only 7 percent below 2007. Judge Lamb found that since Ebitda is independent of capital structure, it is a better measure of the operational results of a business for determining a material adverse change.But this may be the exception. This is a significant issue for Yahoo, and it will likely be long term and durational. The only question is what the actual impact will be and whether it will surpass the impact of the numbers in the Huntsman case. Yahoo will most likely argue that the impact is minimal and that users are still happily using its site, albeit in somewhat declining numbers. But Verizon can claim that this is likely to have a material impact. In other words, this data breach is something that is tailor-made for litigation.If nothing else, this gives Verizon significant leverage to renegotiate the price, because of the peculiar dynamics of a MAC clause. The clause is a way for the parties to allocate risk in an acquisition. When a company agrees to be acquired, there is almost always a period from the execution of original acquisition agreement to its completion. A MAC clause is a means for the parties to contractually allocate who will bear the risk of adverse events during this time.During the most recent financial crisis, MAC clauses were invoked in deals to acquire Genesco, Huntsman, HD Supply, Sallie Mae and Accredited Home Lenders, among others. The buyers asserted the clauses to justify not completing their deals because of adverse events. In large part, these acquirers succeeded in terminating or renegotiating their deals, with many coming to litigation over the matter.These assertions were really part of the negotiation dynamic among the parties as the financial crisis took hold. A buyer can invoke a MAC clause to try to drive down the price of an acquisition by taking advantage of either changed market conditions or adverse events affecting the target company.And that is what Verizon can do here. Yahoo is so tired out at this moment that it may be willing to agree to something. The alternative is to detail in court how bad the company was hit by the information breach. That is never a palatable outcome.So bring on the litigators and stay tuned. The long national nightmare of Yahoo may not be over.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With No Edge on the Economy, Clinton and Trump Focus Elsewhere", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis year, it\u2019s not the economy. And actually, there\u2019s nothing stupid about that.In 1992, with President George Bush weakened by recession, Bill Clinton made \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d his campaign mantra. Since then, the phrase has stood for the idea that winning candidates focus on pocketbook concerns.In 2016, however, neither Donald J. Trump nor Hillary Clinton has established a clear advantage when it comes to the economy. So while voters tell pollsters that the economy remains their most important issue, the candidates focus on other subjects.That reflects the unique contours of the race this year and the middling state of the United States economy.Businesses have added 15 million jobs since 2010, the start of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in United States history. Unemployment has fallen to 4.9 percent after peaking at 10 percent after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession.Those gains silenced the cries of \u201cWhere are the jobs?\u201d that helped Republicans recapture the House of Representatives in 2010. They undercut claims of \u201cjob killing\u201d consequences from the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s health care plan, which helped Republicans win the Senate four years later.Now Republicans are focusing on lackluster economic expansion, citing the 1.1 percent annual growth rate in gross domestic product in the second quarter of this year. Government data shows that the recovery from this recession has been the most sluggish of any since World War II.That only tells part of the story. The economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart, leading experts on the effects of financial crises, say the United States economy has recovered better than those of nearly all other advanced countries since the global economic disaster of 2008, and more rapidly than the historical average after previous meltdowns.Yet President Obama himself calls economic progress inadequate, which helps affirm the Republican critique. So did a Democratic primary campaign in which Mrs. Clinton competed with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont over proposals to curb income inequality and lift long-stagnant wages.The candidates\u2019 backgrounds further complicate attempts to seize the economic issue.Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth and business career award him a presumption of economic competence from some voters. His denunciation of international trade agreements resonates with those who\u2019ve lost ground in the era of globalization.But Mr. Trump evinces little interest in economic policy specifics beyond his pledge to make \u201cgreat deals.\u201d He revamped his tax-cut plan in response to criticism that his first version would balloon the federal budget deficit.Mrs. Clinton benefits from memories of prosperity during her husband\u2019s presidency. She offers detailed plans to increase infrastructure spending, expand child care for working parents and encourage companies to share profits with workers without increasing the deficit.Yet she inherits accumulated discontent with the party that has held the White House since Mr. Obama took office in 2009. By publicly renouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal she once heralded as \u201cthe gold standard,\u201d she has broken with Mr. Obama and with her husband\u2019s free-trade legacy.So Mr. Trump emphasizes his signature issue of immigration. That has gained him fervent support among voters who feel most aggrieved by America\u2019s changing demography, particularly white voters without college educations.As the self-described law-and-order candidate, Mr. Trump casts immigration largely as an issue of personal safety. In assailing Mrs. Clinton, he focuses on her vulnerability surrounding issues of trustworthiness.Mrs. Clinton levels the broadest possible attack on Mr. Trump, calling him \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d for the White House. Vowing to be \u201ca president for all Americans,\u201d she accuses him of fostering racial and ethnic \u201cprejudice and paranoia.\u201dHer invocation of race represents a landmark shift in circumstances. For her husband, economic appeals offset Democratic weakness on cultural issues within an electorate that in 1992 was 87 percent white.The nonwhite electorate has more than doubled since then. For a Democrat in 2016, emphasizing cultural issues isn\u2019t stupid at all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada to Join China-Led Bank, Signaling Readiness to Bolster Ties", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Canada said on Wednesday that it had applied to join China\u2019s version of the World Bank, breaking with previous leaders who had shared United States officials\u2019 skepticism of the new Beijing-led lender.The move came during a five-day trip to China by the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, who is seeking to burnish trade, business and political ties with Beijing. China\u2019s relationship with the previous Canadian government had been lukewarm.The previous Canadian government, led by Stephen Harper, hesitated in joining the bank, saying that it wanted to ensure that the institution\u2019s financial and environmental standards were sound. The Obama administration expressed similar reservations, and during the genesis of the bank, it advised several allies, including Australia and South Korea, not to join.Both countries eventually ignored Washington and became founding members of the bank that is intended to both compete and cooperate with existing lending institutions. Britain also broke with the United States over the new bank and became an inaugural member along with France, Germany and Italy.American officials have since softened their criticism and have encouraged the Chinese to finance projects with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank as a way of ensuring what they consider acceptable standards of environmental and lending practices.Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Li Keqiang, China\u2019s premier, said that the case would be looked at according to Chinese law and that Mr. Garratt would be treated humanely.For Canada, joining the bank could help strengthen its relationship with a country that is increasingly important to its economy. \u201cCanada\u2019s membership will create commercial opportunities for Canadian companies and create jobs for the middle class,\u201d said Canada\u2019s finance minister, Bill Morneau, at a news conference with the bank\u2019s president, Jin Liqun.Mr. Jin said he interpreted Canada\u2019s application for membership as a \u201cvote of confidence.\u201d Canada is a leader in environmental matters and had a record as a \u201cclean\u201d government, attributes that match the bank\u2019s efforts to be \u201clean, green and clean,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have zero tolerance of corruption,\u201d he said.Mr. Jin acknowledged that one of the bank\u2019s five vice presidents, Hong Kyttack, a former finance official in South Korea, had taken a six-month leave after allegations that he had been negligent in giving loans to Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering during his tenure at the Korean Development Bank.Mr. Hong had served as the chief risk officer for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the bank was now seeking a replacement, Mr. Jin said.The bank said Canada and other new members are expected to join early next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Fined $185 Million for Fraudulently Opening Accounts", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, Wells Fargo employees secretly issued credit cards without a customer\u2019s consent. They created fake email accounts to sign up customers for online banking services. They set up sham accounts that customers learned about only after they started accumulating fees.On Thursday, these illegal banking practices cost Wells Fargo $185 million in fines, including a $100 million penalty from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the largest such penalty the agency has issued.Federal banking regulators said the practices, which date back to 2011, reflected serious flaws in the internal culture and oversight at Wells Fargo, one of the nation\u2019s largest banks. The bank has fired at least 5,300 employees who were involved.In all, Wells Fargo employees opened roughly 1.5 million bank accounts and applied for 565,000 credit cards that may not have been authorized by customers, the regulators said in a news conference. The bank has 40 million retail customers.Some customers noticed the deception when they were charged unexpected fees, received credit or debit cards in the mail that they did not request, or started hearing from debt collectors about accounts they did not recognize. But most of the sham accounts went unnoticed, as employees would routinely close them shortly after opening them. Wells has agreed to refund about $2.6 million in fees that may have been inappropriately charged.Wells Fargo is famous for its culture of cross-selling products to customers \u2014 routinely asking, say, a checking account holder if she would like to take out a credit card. Regulators said the bank\u2019s employees had been motivated to open the unauthorized accounts by compensation policies that rewarded them for opening new accounts; many current and former Wells employees told regulators they had felt extreme pressure to open as many accounts as possible.\u201cUnchecked incentives can lead to serious consumer harm, and that is what happened here,\u201d said Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Wells said the employees who were terminated included managers and other workers. A bank spokeswoman declined to say whether any senior executives had been reprimanded or fired in the scandal.\u201cWells Fargo is committed to putting our customers\u2019 interests first 100 percent of the time, and we regret and take responsibility for any instances where customers may have received a product that they did not request,\u201d the bank said in a statement.One Wells customer in Northern California, Shahriar Jabbari, had seven additional accounts that he did not consent to, according to a lawsuit he filed against the bank last year in federal court.When Mr. Jabbari called the bank asking what he should do with three new debit cards he did not authorize, a bank employee told him to dispose of them, according to the lawsuit.Mr. Jabbari said in the lawsuit that his credit score had suffered because unpaid fees on the unauthorized accounts had been sent to a debt collector.Banking regulators said the widespread nature of the illegal behavior showed that the bank lacked the necessary controls and oversight of its employees. Ensuring that large banks have tight controls has been one of the central preoccupations of banking regulators after the mortgage crisis.Such pervasive problems at Wells Fargo, which has headquarters in San Francisco, stand out given all of the scrutiny that has been heaped on large, systemically important banks since 2008.\u201cIf the managers are saying, \u2018We want growth; we don\u2019t care how you get there,\u2019 what do you expect those employees to do?\u201d said Dan Amiram, an associate business professor at Columbia University.It is a particularly ugly moment for Wells, one of the few large American banks that have managed to produce consistent profit increases since the financial crisis. Wells has earned a reputation on Wall Street as a tightly run ship that avoided many of the missteps of the mortgage crisis because it took fewer risks than many of its competitors. At the same time, Wells has managed to be enormously profitable, as other large banks continued to stumble because of tighter regulations and a choppy economy.Analysts have marveled at the bank\u2019s ability to cross-sell mortgages, credit cards and auto loans to customers. The strategy is at the core of modern-day banking: Rather than spend too much time and money recruiting new customers, sell existing customers on new products.Wells Fargo markets itself as the quintessential Main Street lender, stressing the value of creating long-term relationships with customers over earning a quick buck.But that apple-pie approach was undercut, regulators say, by a compensation program that encouraged employees to push the limits.\u201cIt is way out of character for one of the cleanest banks around,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. \u201cIt\u2019s a head-scratcher why so many employees felt comfortable crossing the line.\u201dIn many cases, customers took notice only when they received a letter in the mail congratulating them on opening a new account.Many of the questionable accounts were created by moving a small amount of money from the customer\u2019s current account to open the new one.Shortly after opening the sham account, the bank employee closed it down and moved the money back, according to regulators.But Wells employees were still most likely able to get credit for opening new accounts in meeting their sales goals, the regulators said.In addition to the fine from the consumer protection bureau, Wells paid $35 million to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and $50 million to the City and County of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles city attorney worked with banking regulators on the case.On Thursday, the bank stressed that the refunds have been relatively small \u2014 averaging about $25. The bank hired an independent consultant that reviewed tens of millions of accounts from May 2011 through July 2015.The bank said it refunded money to customers if there was even the slightest possibility they were charged improperly because of unauthorized accounts.\u201cAs a result of our customer-first methodology, we believe we included accounts that were actually appropriately opened and authorized by a customer,\u201d the bank said in a statement.Even regulators concede that the financial harm to consumers was not large. But the more troubling aspect, they said, was how the behavior reflected a broader culture inside Wells\u2019s retail operations.\u201cConsumers must be able to trust their banks,\u201d said Mike Feuer, the Los Angeles city attorney. \u201cConsumers must never be taken advantage of by their banks.\u201dStock of Wells Fargo, which is the largest bank in the country by market capitalization but fourth-largest by assets, rose 13 cents on Thursday, to $49.90 a share.Advertisement"}

Pounces", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans from the presidential ticket on down pounced Saturday on Hillary Clinton\u2019s remarks that half of Donald J. Trump\u2019s supporters fit into a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d saying it showed she was out of touch with an economically hard-hit electorate.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments Friday night, which were a variation of a sentiment she has expressed in other settings recently, came at a fund-raiser in Manhattan.\u201cYou know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?\u201d she said to applause and laughter. \u201cThe racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic \u2014 you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.\u201dSpeaking at the Values Voter Summit, a gathering of Christian conservatives in Washington on Saturday, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, said: \u201cHillary, they are not a basket of anything. They are Americans and they deserve your respect.\u201dBy Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Clinton had acknowledged her stumble. \u201cLast night I was \u2018grossly generalistic,\u2019 and that\u2019s never a good idea,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI regret saying \u2018half\u2019 \u2014 that was wrong.\u201dShe then used the opportunity to double down on her criticism of her opponent. \u201cIt\u2019s deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia,\u201d she said, \u201cand given a national platform to hateful views and voices, including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks flipped, for a day at least, the familiar script of the 2016 campaign, in which Mr. Trump slights a large group of people and she quickly rebukes him.They were also out of character given her usual studied care in choosing words. Her campaign slogan is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d and she has built her message around inclusiveness, in contrast to denigrating comments Mr. Trump has made about Mexicans, Muslims, women and other groups. Much of her ad campaign is built around using Mr. Trump\u2019s comments to portray him as an unsuitable leader.But Mrs. Clinton devoted much of August to fund-raising in the moneyed enclaves of the Hamptons and Martha\u2019s Vineyard. At some of these events, which were closed to the press, she uses the \u201cbaskets\u201d characterization of Trump voters.After barring the press from most fund-raisers, the Clinton campaign has tried to be more open in the post-Labor Day sprint. Aides allowed a small group of reporters in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s regular press corps to cover the Friday event, which took place at Cipriani on Wall Street and for a contribution of $1,200 to $10,000 included performances by Barbra Streisand and Rufus Wainwright.A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Jason Miller, said what made Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments particularly off-putting was that she made them \u201cin front of wealthy donors\u201d and that the setting and statement, \u201crevealed just how little she thinks of the hard-working men and women of America.\u201dMrs. Clinton made a similar remark on Israeli television on Thursday, saying \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a kind of paranoiac, prejudicial element within our politic.\u201d But she did not specify how many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters fit into that category.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remark, which she delivered lightheartedly, also harked back to Mr. Obama\u2019s gaffe at a San Francisco fund-raiser in 2008 that economically struggling Americans \u201cget bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy towards people who aren\u2019t like them.\u201dThat time, it was Mrs. Clinton who seized on her opponent\u2019s comment to paint him as elitist as the two Democrats battled before the Pennsylvania primary, which she went on to win by nine percentage points.16 PhotosHer remarks on Friday were a more pointed version of her earlier criticisms of the movement her opponent has spurred.Other aides and supporters jumped to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defense, noting that after describing the \u201cdeplorables,\u201d Mrs. Clinton went on to sympathetically weave another rhetorical basket of Trump voters: \u201cPeople who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures. And they\u2019re just desperate for change.\u201d\u201cThose are the people,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have to understand and empathize with.\u201dIn talking points given to surrogates on Saturday, and obtained by The New York Times, the campaign advised anyone speaking about the \u201cdeplorable\u201d issue in the news media to reiterate that while Mrs. Clinton intended to say \u201csome\u201d instead of \u201chalf,\u201d Mr. Trump, as she had pointed out in the past, \u201chas clearly brought the alt-right\u2019s hate into his campaign and into the mainstream.\u201dThe talking points advised that anyone who is pressed on the \u201cdeplorable\u201d remarks should assert that the news media was holding Mrs. Clinton to a different standard than Mr. Trump, with this suggested rejoinder: \u201cAre they going to make more out of this story than they made out of the racist, misogynistic Trump comments that got us here in the first place?\u201dProf. Jennifer Mercieca, an expert in American political discourse at Texas A&M University, said in an email that the \u201cdeplorable\u201d comment \u201csounds bad on the face of it\u201d and compared it to Mr. Romney\u2019s 47 percent gaffe.\u201cThe comment demonstrates that she (like Romney) lacks empathy for that group,\u201d Professor Mercieca said. \u201cTo be fair, she has characterized the group as homophobic, xenophobic, racist, and etc., and those qualities are not ones that we celebrate in America.\u201dIt sounded, Professor Mercieca said, as if Mrs. Clinton had written off a large chunk of Trump voters as ones who would never vote for her, a view that might be accurate.\u201cIt likely won\u2019t help her \u2018likability\u2019 with undecideds, but it may help her to mobilize Clinton supporters to more actively participate in her campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that was the goal.\u201dAn excerpt from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks Friday night:I know there are only 60 days left to make our case \u2014 and don\u2019t get complacent, don\u2019t see the latest outrageous, offensive, inappropriate comment and think well he\u2019s done this time. We are living in a volatile political environment.You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic \u2014 you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people \u2014 now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric.Now, some of those folks \u2014 they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America. But the other basket \u2014 and I know this because I see friends from all over America here \u2014 I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Carolina and Texas \u2014 as well as, you know, New York and California \u2014 but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they\u2019re just desperate for change. It doesn\u2019t really even matter where it comes from.They don\u2019t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. They won\u2019t wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroin, feel like they\u2019re in a dead-end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Republicans Lost Their Best Shot at the Hispanic Vote", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "FeatureThree years ago, the G.O.P.-led House was close to reaching a compromise on immigration \u2014 one that might have neutralized the issue for the 2016 election. This is the inside story of what went wrong.Supported byThe immigration bill was supposed to be a relatively straightforward en\u00addeavor \u2014 not politically painless, by any means, but a clear win for all the parties involved, enough so that it came much closer to happening than most people think. \u201cI\u2019ve never been involved in an issue where there\u2019s no organized opposition to it,\u201d Representative John Yarmuth of Louisville, Ky., one of Labrador\u2019s Democratic colleagues in the Group of 8, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre when you have the business community, organized labor, the faith community, law enforcement, you name it, everybody\u2019s for it. Come on \u2014 how can you have something everybody\u2019s for and not get it passed?\u201dBut the bill did not pass. And its failure revealed how fully the Republican Party had boxed itself in in Congress \u2014 the degree to which it had been paralyzed by its own extremity and tactical logic, and the degree to which this intransigence had produced a cynicism among Demo\u00adcrats that amounted to a self-fulfilling prophecy. In retrospect, Congress left itself open to the rise of someone like Trump, who, with his blend of nativism and anti-Washingtonism, was able to draw on resentment of undocumented immigrants themselves and resentment of Washington\u2019s inability to come up with a solution for the problem.I didn\u2019t bring up Trump in my conversation with Labrador, but Labrador did. In the midst of talking about the collapse of the immigration-reform effort he had been part of, he broke off and said, matter-of-factly: \u201cThe reason we have Donald Trump as a nominee today is because we as Republicans have failed on this issue.\u201dSeeking to secure lasting Hispanic support for Republicans, Bush in 2007 threw his support behind a bipartisan push for comprehensive immigration reform on the Hill. But the legislation failed amid a talk-radio-fueled backlash over \u201camnesty\u201d \u2014 granting legal status to many immigrants who arrived in the country illegally \u2014 as well as a lack of political capital on Bush\u2019s part and ambivalence among many Democrats and organized labor about the bill\u2019s provisions.In late 2007, after that effort foundered, Representative Xavier Becerra, a Los Angeles Demo\u00adcrat, approached Representative Sam Johnson, a Republican from the northern suburbs of Dallas. Becerra, the American-born son of Mexican immigrants, had grown up hearing his father talk about seeing \u201cNo dogs or Mexicans\u201d signs in windows. By his estimate, his district held more noncitizens than any other in the country, and it seemed to him that his entire career in Congress had been defined by the fight to bring clarity for those people and their families.Johnson, a retired Air Force colonel who spent nearly seven years in a North Vietnamese prison after being shot down during the Vietnam War, was staunchly conservative but not doctrinaire; Becerra was easygoing and well-liked by many of his Republican colleagues. The two congressmen had worked together in the past. \u201cI said, \u2018Sam, I betcha you and I, we\u2019re about as opposite as you can get, but if you and I sat down, we could figure this out,\u2019\u2009\u201d Becerra says. \u201cHe said, \u2018You know what, partner, you\u2019re probably right.\u2019\u2009\u201dBecerra and Johnson invited colleagues to expand the conversation, and by the 2008 election, the group had grown to 16. They met often, for hours at a time, and always behind closed doors, to protect the Republicans participating \u2014 memories of the 2007 backlash lingered. By 2010, they had the bones of a bill. \u201cIt became clear that there were a whole bunch of R\u2019s that wanted to get this done,\u201d Becerra told me.The essential elements of any comprehensive reform package had been clear for some time: improving enforcement for those overstaying their visas; tightening border security; easing the route for legal entry to reduce future illegal immigration and supply the work force; and coming to a disposition for the millions already in the United States. In early 2010, the group worked through the usual tension points \u2014 how many guest workers to allow for agriculture and other seasonal employment, what kind of compliance to demand from employers, how many visas to grant for high-tech workers from abroad, how long the path to citizenship for those granted legal status should be and so on.They made real progress that year, but outside the room, the climate was deteriorating. House Republicans had mounted party-line opposition to Obama\u2019s economic-stimulus package, climate legislation and Obamacare. There also simply wasn\u2019t the necessary time or attention available, the secretary of homeland security at the time, Janet Napolitano, told me. \u201cThe energies of the administration were focused on the economy, and we were still in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d she says.That fall, Republicans swept the House, deposing many of the Democrats involved in the immigration effort, and the talks came to an abrupt end. The lesson was plain: Bipartisan huddles were well and good, but they meant little in the absence of will on the part of party leaders.The following day, Guti\u00e9rrez was at the House of Representatives\u2019 gymnasium when he spied the Republican Party\u2019s most famous gym rat: Representative Paul Ryan, who was readjusting to normal life in the Capitol after the Romney campaign. \u201cHey man, I did everything I could to be sure you couldn\u2019t be vice president,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez told him. \u201cJust joking.\u201dRyan took the gibe in stride, then got down to business. He told Guti\u00e9rrez that he\u2019d seen him the night before on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do it to take it off the table, Luis,\u2019\u2009\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez told me. \u201c\u2009\u2018I don\u2019t want to do it because it\u2019s politically expedient. I want to do it because it\u2019s the right thing to do, because I\u2019m Catholic, and my Christian values say we cannot have millions of people in second-tier status.\u2019 I was like, Brother, you and I are going to get along just fine.\u201dThe Republican National Committee, for its part, had convened the Growth and Opportu\u00adnity Project, a wide-ranging overhaul \u2014 the commentariat called it the party\u2019s \u201cautopsy\u201d \u2014 that, among other things, aimed to determine how the party could fare better with Hispanic voters. In December, Ryan was at the Capitol Hill Club, the Republican social organization a block from the Capitol, when he spotted Ali Noorani, executive director of the nonpartisan National Immigration Forum. Ryan \u201ctalked my ear off\u201d about immigration reform, Noorani recalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re going to do a conservative, five-bill package, with a different coalition of members for each bill.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe White House and congressional Democrats were eager to take the Republicans up on their new resolve. Obama had incurred the wrath of immigrant advocates by presiding over hundreds of thousands of deportations \u2014 making an ex\u00adplicit exception only for immigrants brought to the country as children \u2014 precisely in order to build up credibility with Republicans for this moment. And Congress wouldn\u2019t be starting from zero; they still had the groundwork laid by Becerra and Johnson\u2019s aborted post-2007 effort. In December 2012, Becerra approached Johnson again. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Barack Obama for another four years,\u201d he told him. \u201cThink we can start talking again?\u201dAfter the 2012 election, Diaz-Balart instructed his chief of staff, Cesar Gonzalez, to open a back channel to the Obama administration. Gonzalez tried to reach the White House domestic-policy adviser Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, the daughter of Bolivian immigrants and a longtime immigrant advocate who was the administration\u2019s point person on the issue, to set up a meeting at an exurban Starbucks where no one would recognize them. After some prodding, Mu\u00f1oz agreed instead to call Diaz-Balart one day in January. Gonzalez told her that any time would work, except for one 20-minute window in which his boss was meeting with a foreign minister. Mu\u00f1oz called during that window.After that, Gonzalez pleaded with Mu\u00f1oz to coordinate better and asked if the administration had any big moves planned on immigration. Mu\u00f1oz said it did not. Shortly after Gonzalez hung up the phone, news broke that Obama planned to give a speech in Las Vegas demanding that Congress pass immigration reform. Gonzalez got the message: He and Diaz-Balart were on their own.As that episode suggested, the Obama administration and Democratic congressional leadership did not see eye to eye with the House immigration group. In the administration\u2019s view, the path to immigration reform ran not through the House but through the Senate, where an\u00adother bipartisan group was at work on the issue. The Senate was still under Democratic control and could be counted on to produce legislation closer to the administration\u2019s ideal.The Democrats\u2019 ambitions for a more liberal bill also reflected how much, and how quickly, the politics of immigration had shifted \u2014 a shift that occurred mostly within the Democratic Party. In Pew\u2019s regular polling on the issue, the share of Republicans saying that immigrants strengthened the country had dipped slightly since 2006. But the percentage of Democrats saying so had soared to around 70 percent. Reform would eventually need the approval of the House, of course, where Republicans held a 33-seat edge. But the administration was proceeding on the assumption that legislation based on the Senate bill, when it was passed, would be able to clear the lower chamber with the backing of most Democrats and some Republicans. Obama\u2019s staff had counted the votes and felt sure they were there.This plan, however, hinged on one assumption: that Boehner would be willing to hold a vote on the legislation. Dennis Hastert, the previous Republican speaker, had formalized a Republican custom \u2014 now known as the Hastert rule \u2014 by which the speaker would not bring up a bill for a vote if it did not command support from a majority of the party\u2019s caucus. Boehner had held to the Hastert rule in all but a few cases.But in early 2013, Boehner was speaking often with Obama about immigration and giving every indication of being very serious about doing whatever it took to pass legislation. So the White House focused its efforts on shaping the Senate bill, while limiting its House considerations mainly to building the outside coalition \u2014 supporters from law enforcement, the evangelical community, small businesses and corporations \u2014 that would provide cover for an eventual vote.The administration\u2019s focus on the Senate did not dissuade the House group from forging ahead. The lawmakers began holding marathon meetings again, switching locations among House offices to throw the press off the scent, with members taking turns picking up the dinner-catering tabs. The four Republicans were Johnson, Diaz-Balart, Labrador and Representative John Carter, a former judge from central Texas. The Democrats were Becerra, Guti\u00e9rrez, Yarmuth and Representative Zoe Lofgren of San Jose, Calif.The group was under no illusions that it would be easy to get the bill through the House. Diaz-Balart says that Boehner was all along telling him that whatever bill they came up with should ideally command a majority of Republican support, thus conforming to the Hastert rule. Getting a majority did not seem out of the question to Diaz-Balart. A small core of Republicans would be viscerally opposed to any immigration bill. But this group, by Diaz-Balart\u2019s reckoning, was not much larger than the group firmly in favor of reform, and the great mass of House Republicans, he thought, was not out of reach.This last group was wary of immigration \u2014 uncertain on the policy details, uncomfortable talking about it and oversensitive to the calls they got from constituents and activists opposed to it, despite the fact that very few members had ever actually been threatened over the issue by a primary challenger. But this mass operated with a herd instinct. With safety in numbers, it could potentially be moved. \u201cMost people realize the system we have is broken,\u201d Diaz-Balart told me.In April 2013, as the Senate and House groups were plugging along with their bills, Paul Ryan joined Guti\u00e9rrez at a Chicago City Club luncheon to push immigration reform. Guti\u00e9rrez was also seeing what seemed like encouraging signs from Boehner. But he was starting to get worrisome signals from the Democratic leadership in the House, the Senate and the White House \u2014 a sense that they weren\u2019t taking the House group\u2019s effort seriously. They, along with reform advocates, were focusing all their attention on the Senate bill to a degree that he found nonsensical.The R.N.C.\u2019s Growth and Opportunity report, ordered up after Romney\u2019s loss and released on March 18, did not mince words. \u201cWe must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d it argued. \u201cIf we do not, our party\u2019s appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.\u201d Democratic leaders essentially took that language at face value, assuming House Republicans were under orders to deal with the issue. They were wagering that they could get a better bill by ignoring the House group\u2019s work; if that project failed, then the Democrats could simply press the more liberal Senate bill upon the House. \u201cIt was clear to me that no matter what I negotiated, they didn\u2019t want me to really reach an agreement, because they wanted to go with the Senate version,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez says.To Guti\u00e9rrez, this was borderline delusional; it ignored both the House\u2019s longstanding resentment of being seen as subordinate to the Senate and the weak position of Republican leaders, whose edicts about demographic imperatives carried only so much weight with members in safe districts with few Hispanic voters. Guti\u00e9rrez told me that when he pointed out to Senate Democrats and immigrant advocates all the House Republicans who had sworn they wouldn\u2019t accept the Senate bill, they waved off his concerns: \u201c\u2009\u2018Don\u2019t worry, Luis. Whatever you do, we\u2019re going to overwhelm them with such a huge vote in the Senate\u2019\u2009\u201d \u2014 with lots of Republicans \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018that they will take the Senate bill.\u2019 It was not a plan for success.\u201dThe Republican contingent had its own icono\u00adclast in the form of Ra\u00fal Labrador. The Idahoan had worked for 15 years as an immigration lawyer, which made him a natural addition to the House group \u2014 a perfect liaison to the new Tea Party-aligned wing of the caucus who also had a professional understanding of the issue.To his Democratic colleagues, Labrador\u2019s assertive good cheer belied his doctrinaire conservatism. \u201cLabrador,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez told me, \u201cis the kind of guy, if your car broke down, he\u2019d come by and help you fix your tire and get you back on the road \u2014 and if it was too late, you\u2019d stay at his house. But don\u2019t expect him the next day, you know?\u201d Labrador\u2019s mantra was that any legislation had to avoid repeating the failures of the 1986 immigration law signed by Ronald Reagan, which Labrador argued provided inadequate enforcement alongside its amnesty provisions. \u201cThe principle is you cannot make the mistake of Reagan,\u201d Labrador told me.Labrador arrived with a list of conservative criticisms of what the group was drafting. As the group worked through issues he raised, there was something that bothered him: the way the Democrats kept having to seek approval of agreements the group had reached with the office of the top House Democrat, Nancy Pelosi. \u201cThe four Republicans,\u201d he told me, \u201cwere told by the speaker and the people in charge, \u2018You come up with a deal.\u2019\u2009The Democrats did not have that independence. They had to run everything by their leadership.\u201dLabrador soon discovered that there was one point on which the Democrats in the group were particularly sensitive. The group that met in 2010 agreed that immigrants seeking legal status would need to pay for the cost of their own health care. The Affordable Care Act had complicated this requirement by eliminating the cheap catastrophic health care plans that low-income immigrants could most easily afford.In negotiations, Labrador insisted that undocumented immigrants would need to be made explicitly ineligible for any health care subsidies whatsoever \u2014 that, as he put it to me, \u201ctaxpayers are not going to be stuck with a dime.\u201d He even questioned the status quo of hospitals\u2019 paying for emergency treatment for undocumented immigrants with federal funds for indigent care, demanding that the immigrants be required to pay off their bills over time.House Democratic leaders, including Pelosi, argued that this could have the effect of sending people into bankruptcy, forcing them to leave the country. If the Democrats were so worried about immigrants\u2019 ability to meet the requirement, Labrador countered, they could carve out an exception to Obamacare, allowing catastrophic plans.Labrador\u2019s demands created a bind for the Democrats \u2014 especially Xavier Becerra, who helped found the group back in 2007. Among the Democrats, Becerra was now often the most wary of tentative agreements within the group, saying they needed to be run past Pelosi. (Becerra says he was simply concerned about the language being \u201cunworkable.\u201d) \u201cHis attitude changed dramatically,\u201d Diaz-Balart says. \u201cGuti\u00e9rrez had been a straight shooter \u2014 \u2018I can\u2019t go any further than this.\u2019 You know where he stands.\u201d Becerra, he said, \u201chad been fine, and then it was like a switch, wham. ... It was like, whoa.\u201dThe mind-set that Guti\u00e9rrez was contending with among Democratic leaders was hardly incomprehensible. They had for years faced total Republican intransigence on any bill that might be of political value to Obama. The notion that the House could now muster legislation on so thorny an issue was hard to credit; in my conversations with White House and Senate Democratic staff members, their estimation of the House\u2019s efforts on immigration oozed condescension verging on scorn. House Republicans had become trapped in a cage of their own making: On the one side they were hemmed in by a constituency and far-right contingent opposed to compromise on principle. On the other side were Democrats who, even when many Republicans did want to pass a law \u2014 one the Democrats wanted, too \u2014 responded with a collective eye roll.Soon enough, Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s warnings to Democratic leaders proved prescient. In mid-April, the Senate group introduced its bill, whose generally liberal provisions \u2014 a path to eventual citizenship for most of those in the United States illegally, generous levels of visas for family reunification and fewer guest-worker permits than many businesses wanted \u2014 and association with Sena\u00adtor Chuck Schumer of New York, the dominant Democrat in the group, predictably riled House Republicans. Labrador and the two Texans, John Carter and Sam Johnson, started coming under pressure for their involvement. On May 15, Carter delivered an ultimatum: If there wasn\u2019t resolution at the group\u2019s next meeting, the next day, he was out. For the first time, the meeting\u2019s location in one of the House office buildings was leaked to the press. A couple dozen reporters massed outside the room, ready to pounce if Carter or anyone else walked out.Inside, Lofgren proposed new language on health care. Her colleagues gathered to read it over her shoulder on her new iPad Mini. It was very vague, essentially stating that immigrants would need to pay for their own health care and that if any government entity provided them with services, they would be ineligible for permanent residence. Everyone seemed provisionally in favor of it \u2014 except for Becerra. The Republicans were exasperated. \u201cF Becerra,\u201d Gonzalez, Diaz-Balart\u2019s chief of staff, emailed a colleague. \u201cUgh. Now I\u2019m looking for window.\u201dThe group broke into separate rooms, Demo\u00adcrats in one and Republicans in another. When the group reassembled, the Republicans said they were fine with the language. Then Becerra said he would have to run it by Pelosi.Carter exploded. \u201cI don\u2019t have to check it with John [Boehner], why do you have to check with Nancy?\u201d he said, according to Gonzalez and others in the room. \u201cI\u2019m making a decision here \u2014 why can\u2019t you?\u201dThe group left the meeting saying they had a tentative agreement, but in the days that followed, the Democrats backed away. At a meeting with the group\u2019s Democrats, Pelosi loudly scolded Guti\u00e9rrez for having strayed too far from his brief on immigration. Guti\u00e9rrez himself was furious that health care had assumed such importance. At the next meeting of the group, Guti\u00e9rrez asked the staff members to leave, which was unusual, and berated Becerra for having made things so hard.It was the Republicans, however, who finally broke first. On June 5, 2013, Labrador announced he was leaving the group, saying the health care issue had become insurmountable and that he would focus on crafting Republican-only legislation instead. It was a grievous blow to the group, coming after it had gone to great lengths \u2014 falling behind the Senate in drafting its bill \u2014 to address Labrador\u2019s complaints on multiple fronts. Democrats I spoke to viewed his protestations as fundamentally cynical, an excuse to kill a bill he was ambivalent about by placing it in conflict with the other party\u2019s most treasured recent legislative accomplishment. \u201cIf people want to get to an outcome, they can get to an outcome,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said, and sighed. \u201cLook, there\u2019s a reason why no bill ever got introduced. Had a bill been introduced, the pressure to bring it through the process would have been very, very high, which was why they never introduced it.\u201dLabrador\u2019s exit provided some relief at first. \u201cHe\u2019s a very emotional guy, and everybody was like, whew,\u201d Lofgren says. \u201cIt was easier to have discussions that were productive with Labrador out, because people could focus and not go off on tangents.\u201d The group also kept getting encouragement from Boehner. He surprised Lofgren by inviting her to a private meeting. \u201cHe said: \u2018Keep this going. This is really important. This is the best chance we have.\u2019\u2009\u201dWhat legislation, immigration reformers wondered, was Boehner talking about? The Group of 8 had not yet produced a draft. The support that Paul Ryan had communicated so enthusiastically to Guti\u00e9rrez in late 2012 was also proving elusive. On Sept. 10, Diaz-Balart hosted an evening meeting at his apartment to discuss a path forward on immigration, with Ryan, Labrador and a handful of staff members. But the evening wore on with barely any mention of the issue. It was the night of Obama\u2019s speech announcing that he had asked Congress to postpone its vote on authorizing airstrikes on Syria. The group watched the speech, hung around for a while and then dispersed.Ten days later, Sam Johnson and John Carter announced that they, too, were officially leaving the bipartisan group, rendering it defunct. They were under increasing pressure for participating, and since Labrador had left and taken with him the group\u2019s line to the House\u2019s Tea Party contingent, the project\u2019s efficacy was in doubt. After all the years spent haggling together in small rooms, the news of the Texans\u2019 departure reached the other remaining members via news release.Boehner\u2019s No. 2 and likely successor, Eric Cantor, was even more wary. \u201cHe was one of the most hard-ass guys we dealt with,\u201d Diaz-Balart says. \u201cHe was always fair but very tough on us.\u201d On May 12, Boehner was in Laredo, Tex., on the Mexican border, during a fund-raising tour, when he ran into Ali Noorani, the immigration-reform advocate. Noorani asked Boehner where things stood. \u201cIn all my years in public service, I\u2019ve seen weird issues, but this is the weirdest,\u201d Boehner said, according to Noorani. \u201cMy own guys\u201d \u2014 his fellow party leaders \u2014 \u201caren\u2019t even with me on this.\u201dDiaz-Balart and Gonzalez, meanwhile, were making a last-ditch effort to salvage the group\u2019s work. For months, they had quietly pitched to House Republicans an idea for a bill that would combine heightened border security and visa enforcement with legalization for many of the 11 million but, unlike the Senate\u2019s bill, would offer no dedicated path to citizenship. They were getting moral support from Ryan, who saw their proposal as in keeping with what he had outlined to Noorani in late 2012, the central plank in a series of bills. They got clearance from Boehner, if no direct aid from his leadership staff, on one condition: \u201cYou get the majority of the majority.\u201dThey assembled their own team of a dozen or so representatives, including several ardent conservatives, to assist in approaching members. They brought together small groups of members to review results from two different pollsters showing surprisingly strong support from Republican voters and to watch a focus group where voters backed the language they were settling on. They tracked members\u2019 likelihood of support, on a 1-to-5 scale, on an Excel spreadsheet.Guti\u00e9rrez assured them that they could get sufficient Democratic support even without a special path to citizenship, on the assumption that millions could eventually attain citizenship even without such a path; he had briefed Pelosi on the proposal and she had not waved him off it. Diaz-Balart even finally got a call from Obama. It felt perfunctory, but at least it was something. Gonzalez had become so desperate to reach Mu\u00f1oz by early 2014 that he emailed her during a visit to the White House Easter Egg Roll asking if he could come in and see her.They were gathering when, around 7 p.m., Diaz-Balart got an email from another member. The colleague had seen some worrying numbers coming out of Virginia, where polls had just closed in the Republican primary. Eric Cantor was defending his seat against David Brat, a conservative economics professor who had mounted a challenge inveighing against Cantor\u2019s Wall Street ties, his inattention to his district and his support \u2014 grudging as it was \u2014 for immigration reform. Diaz-Balart dismissed it as early noise. \u201cWe were going to toast,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden. ... \u201dIt wasn\u2019t even close. Cantor lost by 11 points. When one top Democratic Senate immigration aide found out, she burst into tears, knowing that reform opponents would seize on Cantor\u2019s loss as a referendum on the issue, regardless of Cantor\u2019s ambivalence on it. Guti\u00e9rrez called Diaz-Balart. \u201cLuis,\u201d Diaz-Balart told him. \u201cWe lost the whole thing. It\u2019s over.\u201dReform advocates scrambled together an emergency effort to counter the spin, promoted by opponents like the talk-show host Laura Ingraham, that Cantor had lost because of immigration, but it was to no avail. \u201cPeople got concerned, and we didn\u2019t have the ability anymore to keep the numbers,\u201d Diaz-Balart says. \u201cThey came to me on the floor the next day and said, \u2018Hey, man, I know I whipped, but this is not the time.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe administration read the writing on the wall, too. Two weeks later, with a surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America giving more fuel to reform opponents, Obama said his staff would start drafting executive action on immigration in lieu of legislation.When Diaz-Balart held a news conference shortly afterward, he was so upset that he had trouble speaking. He singled out Guti\u00e9rrez for his help and his \u201cwillingness, when necessary, to take on Republicans, Democrats and the president.\u201d\u201cIt is highly irresponsible not to deal with the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were sent here by the American people precisely to tackle difficult issues and not to take the easy way out.\u201dHe said that he had been the one who first encouraged bipartisan talks on immigration reform years earlier, and that the House group \u201cessentially had an agreement.\u201d Yet, he said, the compromise was undone by his party. \u201cThere was no way the votes were there in the House to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, I tried a dozen times to bring immigration reform to the floor. I got slapped down by my colleagues, slapped down by other leaders.\u201d The failure to pass immigration reform, he said, was \u201cone of my greatest disappointments.\u201dBy early 2014, Boehner was already planning to retire; if there had ever been an opportunity for statesmanship at little personal cost, this was it. And yet he could not bring himself to press forward with a legislative effort that he believed was in the best interest of his party and the country. \u201cOur problem was not a substantive problem \u2014 it was a political problem,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz, at the White House. \u201cIn the end, the coalition on the Hill which could pass a bill was going to consist of a lot of Democrats and probably not a majority of the Republicans. And the speaker never got to a place where that felt comfortable.\u201d She added, \u201cIt takes a little bit of courage to overcome the political obstacles on the Republican side, and that courage did not manifest itself.\u201dBut the administration and Democratic leaders made their own miscalculations. They had underestimated both the likelihood and the value of having a bipartisan bill emerge from the House. Their strategy had been informed by the ace they had waiting in their pocket: the executive action that Obama could, and did, authorize in the event of a stalemate on Capitol Hill. But this was a rickety scaffolding on which to build an immigration policy. In February 2015, a federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of that state\u2019s challenge of the executive order. After the eight sitting Supreme Court justices split on the case in June, the judge\u2019s injunction stands, and millions of families remain in limbo.Not long before Boehner\u2019s Stanford talk, I attended a Republican Party dinner at a Holiday Inn in Butler County, Ohio, Boehner\u2019s home base in the Cincinnati exurbs, where the former speaker was making his postcongressional debut. As Boehner strode through a back hallway to the ballroom, I asked if he would care to take a few questions on immigration reform. \u201cOh, God, no,\u201d he said. After the speech, he escaped through the kitchen to avoid any more encounters.The top candidates to take Boehner\u2019s seat were at the dinner. One had come out against birthright citizenship. Another had secured the endorsement of Butler County\u2019s sheriff, Rick Jones, who is virulently opposed to illegal immigration; he posted a sign reading \u201cIllegal Aliens Here\u201d outside his jail and sent Mexico a $900,000 bill for immigrants he was holding there.Sheriff Jones was at the event himself, with his brown dress uniform and walrus mustache. He had threatened to run against Boehner in the past. But Boehner was gone now, replaced as speaker by Paul Ryan, who was forced to swear off pursuing immigration reform as a condition for winning support from conservative members for his ascension.The party had not merely failed to address the existential crisis laid bare by the 2012 election; it had lurched in the opposite direction, embracing Donald Trump, a nominee whose idea of Hispanic outreach was tweeting a picture of himself with a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo. Speaking with Trump supporters in Ohio, I was struck by how thoroughly he had managed to fuse anxieties about border security and terrorism \u2014 my questions about immigration were often answered with references to ISIS and Syrian refugees rather than Mexicans. But what also struck me was the extent to which their frustration was aimed at Washington\u2019s inability to get anything done, rather than at Republicans\u2019 having conceded too much. Unwilling to risk a backlash against a controversial step forward, the party had ended up with a backlash against its own fecklessness.At the Holiday Inn, Jones was excited to tell me about his role the next day as the introductory speaker at a rally just a mile away, for Trump. There, Jones would tell the crowd about his three trips to inspect the Mexican border. \u201cLaw enforcement, chiefs of police, we\u2019re fed up, we get no help,\u201d he would say. \u201cDrugs are pouring in from the border.\u201dJones had his own ideas for how to fix the problem, he said, but those weren\u2019t needed just yet. \u201cMy job,\u201d he told me, \u201cis to get the crowd fired up.\u201dAn article on Page 52 this weekend about efforts in the House of Representatives to reach a compromise on immigration reform misidentifies the birthplace of Representative Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, Democrat of Illinois, who helped draft legislation. He was born in Chicago, not Puerto Rico.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Afghan War Quagmire", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialLasting peace, Mr. Obama said, would depend on not only defeating the Taliban but helping \u201cAfghans grow their economy from the bottom up.\u201d He added, \u201cWe cannot lose Afghanistan to a future of narco-terrorism.\u201dNow, at the twilight of his presidency, these goals are receding further into the distance as America\u2019s longest war deteriorates into a slow, messy slog. Yet despite this grim reality, there has been no substantive debate about Afghanistan policy on the campaign trail this year. Neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton has outlined a vision to turn around, or withdraw from, a flailing military campaign.The war in Afghanistan has cost American taxpayers in excess of $800 billion \u2014 including $115 billion for a reconstruction effort, more than the inflation-adjusted amount the United States spent on the Marshall Plan. The Afghan government remains weak, corrupt and roiled by internal rivalries. The casualty rate for Afghan troops is unsustainable. The economy is in shambles. Resurgent Taliban forces are gaining ground in rural areas and are carrying out barbaric attacks in the heart of Kabul, the capital. Despite an international investment of several billion dollars in counternarcotics initiatives, the opium trade remains a pillar of the economy and a key source of revenue for the insurgency.\u201cIt does not appear that the Afghan forces in the near future will be able to defeat the Taliban,\u201d said a senior administration official who spoke about the White House\u2019s appraisal of the campaign on the condition of anonymity. \u201cNor is it clear that the Taliban will make any significant strategic gains or be able to take and hold on to strategic terrain. It\u2019s a very ugly, very costly stalemate.\u201dThe administration\u2019s current strategy commits the United States to keeping roughly 8,400 troops in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future and spending several billion dollars each year subsidizing the Afghan security forces. The goal has been to coax the Taliban to the negotiating table by beating them on the battlefield, a prospect that now seems remote.The next American president may be tempted to adopt the Obama policy and hope for the best. That would be a mistake. At the very least, the next administration needs to carry out a top-to-bottom review of the war, one that unflinchingly addresses fundamental questions.One such question is whether the Afghan Taliban \u2014 an insurgency that has never had aspirations to operate outside the region \u2014 is an enemy Washington should continue to fight. American forces started battling the Taliban in 2001 because the group had provided safe haven for Al Qaeda, which was based there when it planned the Sept. 11 attacks. While Al Qaeda has largely been defeated, the Taliban has proved to be extraordinarily resilient.Another question is what it would take to bring the conflict to an end \u2014 either by enabling Afghan forces to defeat the Taliban or by bringing them into the political fold \u2014 and whether that is something the United States is realistically capable of achieving.This will not be an easy discussion. A precipitous drawdown from Afghanistan may well have calamitous consequences in the short run, exacerbating the exodus of refugees and expanding the area of ungoverned territory in which extremist groups could once again subject Afghans to despotism and plot attacks on the West.But American taxpayers and Afghans, who have endured decades of war, need a plan better than the current policy, which offers good intentions, wishful thinking and ever-worsening results.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "27 Million Potential Hispanic Votes. But What Will They Really Add Up To?", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeature\u201cI want you to say it and to believe it,\u201d Praeli instructed. \u201cI want you to say it and to commit yourself.\u201d She smiled, but these were marching orders. \u201cIf we don\u2019t believe it, other people won\u2019t believe,\u201d Praeli said in Spanish. \u201cIf we don\u2019t believe it in this room, we won\u2019t be the difference in November.\u201dLooking for answers, I spent six months interviewing scores of Latinos in Virginia, a battleground state where the Latino share of the population has more than tripled since 1990. I met with Latino Catholics, Pentecostals and Mormons, with legal residents, citizens and undocumented immigrants. I frequented a church and a community center, soccer fields and a dance club. I lurked around Republican and Democratic events and a skateboard park. I interviewed custodians and construction workers, lawyers and real estate agents, restaurant owners and community organizers, college students and political staffers. In all, I spoke with more than 100 Virginians of various ethnic backgrounds.For all the energy that activists, especially on the Democratic side, have put into turning out the Latino vote, I met strikingly few Latinos outside the upper-middle class who talked about voting as if it were something they did regularly. The exceptions tended to be people like Luc\u00eda Rodriguez, 61, who cleans houses and has voted regularly for more than a decade \u2014 even in 2008 after she and her husband, a custodian, saw all their savings vanish in the mortgage crisis. For years afterward, they scrambled to keep their family afloat, working every available hour. Yet she kept on voting. Why? \u201cIt\u2019s a civic duty,\u201d she said. Rodriguez explained that in Bolivia, where she had been an accountant, she learned the habit of voting because nonvoters could be penalized with fines. In her Mormon church in the United States, she was surrounded by friends who voted. To pass her citizenship test, she had to study American government and learn English. Her voting behavior entailed years of effort and experience. Through all my conversations, I began to fear that the real roots of political engagement, which lie not in quadrennial outreach programs but around dinner tables and in churches and classrooms, are far more absent from Latino life in America than most people understand.Statistically, the Latinos most likely to cast ballots are almost identical to other reliable American voters. They are over 40. They\u2019ve lived in the United States for at least 20 years. They are Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans with long cultural histories of citizenship. They are college graduates.The Latinos least likely to vote represent a different demographic slice altogether. They are under 30, single and Mexican-American. Their families earn less than $50,000 a year. They may not have completed high school.Data capsules like these suggest that the Latino vote is simply hamstrung by the same factors that impede the Election Day turnout of all Americans: poverty, youth, lack of schooling. Political scientists showed long ago that voting goes hand in glove with affluence and education. Generally speaking, the wealthier you are, the more degrees you earn, the more likely you are to turn out. But if these were the only relevant factors, Latino voting would most likely rise naturally over time as more Latinos enrolled in college and as the age of the average American-born Latino increased. (In 2012 their average age was 18.)Causality unravels, however, when you start picking at the numbers. Take income, for example. While nearly a quarter of Latinos live in poverty, as a group they are slightly better off than African-Americans. Yet in 2012, African-Americans had the highest turnout rates in the nation. They, not Latinos, have arguably been the decisive bloc in our last two presidential contests and in this year\u2019s Democratic primary. So poverty alone can\u2019t explain the weak Hispanic vote.Youth and education also prove to be red herrings. Hispanics are America\u2019s youngest and least-educated major racial or ethnic group. Nearly a third of foreign-born Latinos never reached ninth grade. Some have never had a day of schooling in their lives. But if age and learning were the decisive catalysts, we would expect to find the highest voter turnout among Asian-Americans, who are our second-oldest and best-educated group. More than half of Asian-Americans hold bachelors degrees. Yet Asian-Americans tend to vote at even lower rates than Latinos. In 2012, 53 percent of their eligible voters did not go to the polls.The immigrants from Latin America immediately found themselves lumped together under the label \u201cHispanic,\u201d even if they spoke Portuguese or an indigenous language, even if they had no ancestral link to Spain. It\u2019s tough to galvanize such a heterogeneous group. The panethnic, multilingual category of \u201cHispanic\u201d is a uniquely American invention, created by congressional legislation in the 1970s. In her book \u201cMaking Hispanics,\u201d G. Cristina Mora shows how bureaucrats, media executives and political activists built the notion to combine Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans and others in census counts and federal programs. The term was always deliberately ambiguous, Mora notes, so that it could accommodate varied origin stories. There are Hispanics who swam the Rio Grande hoping for a living wage, Hispanics who flew business class to enroll in Ivy League schools, Hispanics who disembarked as Cold Warriors in Florida. There are even Hispanics whose families owned land in the Southwest before it was ever part of the United States. (These \u201cHispanics\u201d like to joke that they didn\u2019t cross the border; the border crossed them.) Unlike African-Americans, most of whom can trace a connection to slavery, Latinos have no single common history. Trump, Figueroa once told me, \u201cmakes us more Latino\u201d: His threats and insults provoke a unifying sense of indignation.Sifting thorough the numbers and this complicated history makes the 52 percent of nonvoting Latinos look rather different. The problem isn\u2019t their youth, poverty or lack of education. The problem is that when you\u2019re poor, young or undereducated, it takes more effort to overcome your immigrant family\u2019s low levels of political socialization. For first-generation Americans, politics is often just one more cultural expression that they must decipher on their own. It\u2019s rarely a priority. The immigrant parents that I spoke with swam rivers and boarded airplanes to escape violence, to earn money, to educate their children. Learning to play American politics was never on the agenda.In Virginia, I found that serious political talk was so rare among the American-born children of Spanish-speaking immigrants that they would often ask me questions like \u201cWhat is the Tea Party?\u201d and \u201cWho is my mayor?\u201d Alicio Casta\u00f1eda, a student at George Mason University whose parents are from Mexico, told me that after we had lunch in April, he began reading more news articles and researching deeper into the presidential candidates. He voted on Super Tuesday. His love for the soccer team Manchester United had led him to The Guardian newspaper, which reminded him that it was a big day in America. \u201cI\u2019ve always been personally interested in politics,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t had anyone to talk to about it.\u201dUntil the 1960s, high schools often taught courses on democracy, civics and government. At the turn of the 21st century, most teenagers received one such class, or none. This drought in civics hurts all Americans, but for Latinos it\u2019s devastating. Several studies have found that merely hearing parents chat about politics or watching them cast a ballot improves the odds that a child will later vote as an adult. Yet a national survey directed by Mark Hugo Lopez in 2002 found that young Latinos were the least likely to have discussed politics with their parents. They were also the most likely to believe that voting is \u201cdifficult.\u201dOn Super Tuesday, I glimpsed what was missing among so many of the Latino families I spoke with when I met Kat Heller, a non-Hispanic mother, exiting a polling station with two children. Growing up in Minnesota, Heller had always tagged along with her parents when they voted. Once, when she was about 12, her father took her to watch the ballots being counted. \u201cI just remember feeling it was really exciting,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt was seeing history happening. Everyone was waiting breathlessly.\u201d Inside the voting booth on Super Tuesday, Heller put her 3-year-old son on her hip and asked him: \u201cWhich do you think we should vote for?\u201d His 13 touches had already begun.A good rate for voter registration is two new registrations an hour. Chavez and her colleague hit the mark with four new registrations between them (the colleague waited for Chavez every time someone\u2019s dominant language was Spanish). Still, most passers-by ignored them. One 20-something with jet black hair who did stop told Chavez, in Spanish, that he was a citizen but not registered. She tried to reel him in.\u201cO.K.,\u201d she responded with a smile, \u201cwhat is the problem?\u201dHe said that he would come back to register next week, that she should give him her phone number.\u201cWhat happens if you don\u2019t come next week?\u201d she asked him.\u201cI promise you.\u201d\u201cYou know what happens,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it now, four more years will go by, and you won\u2019t vote.\u201dThe Clinton campaign is splitting its strategy between the tactics. After analyzing which programs worked best during the primaries, Praeli began pushing an expansion of Nevada\u2019s bilingual Mujeres in Politics program in battleground and \u201cexpansion\u201d states across the country. Mujeres in Politics marshals Latinas for the ant work of canvassing and phone banking, but it also relies on social ties to deepen the campaign\u2019s reach into Latino communities. Each Latina who participates is tasked with the responsibility of drawing in five more Latina volunteers.Chavez herself was lured into politics by a Latina friend. For years after she settled in Virginia from Peru, she earned money washing dishes, waitressing, cleaning bathrooms, cleaning offices, \u201ccleaning anything,\u201d she says. At one point she held three jobs: a full-time job, a part-time job and a weekend job cleaning the airport at night. In 1996, she earned her real estate license. Then in 2009, after a friend asked her to walk with Terry McAuliffe in a parade, she was so smitten by his concern for Latinos that she decided to volunteer for his campaign for governor. For Chavez, the experience was intoxicating: \u201cI was like, \u2018Whoa, I did not know any of this existed.\u2019\u2009\u201d She has volunteered for Virginia Democrats every year since then. Election season feels like a party to her. \u201cI have the best time,\u201d she told me. When Praeli spoke at the \u201cLatinos con Hillary\u201d event at Todos, Chavez was there, dressed head to toenails in blue.From the beginning, Latino voters have been up for grabs. The national electoral bloc that we now call the Hispanic vote was created by middle- and upper-class Mexican-American Democrats who wanted more clout in government and politics. According to the historian Ignacio M. Garc\u00eda\u2019s book on the subject, they organized \u201cViva Kennedy\u201d clubs in Texas, California, New Mexico, Indiana, Illinois and elsewhere. Working together under an absurd logo of John Kennedy riding a grinning burro, these grass-roots clubs turned out thousands of Spanish speakers in delegate-rich states, helping Kennedy squeak into the White House by a margin of less than 1 percent of the popular vote. But Republicans pushed the strategy further: In \u201cMaking Hispanics,\u201d Mora shows how members of Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 re-election campaign, who nicknamed themselves the \u201cBrown Mafia,\u201d ran Spanish-language ads on radio and television. They crafted three distinct campaigns to bring in not just Mexican-Americans but also Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. With their help, Nixon was re-elected by a landslide, taking about 35 percent of what was then known as the \u201cSpanish speaking\u201d vote. The real loss for Republicans since President George W. Bush left office is that their candidates have frittered away the affections that he and Reagan earned among Latinos.Several of the Catholic Latinos I met said that abortion laws were their top priority. \u201cIf we can close that one clinic,\u201d Iris Chavez told me with a sparkle in her eye, referring to a Planned Parenthood-like women\u2019s clinic that was once located in Manassas, \u201cwe can set fire to the nation.\u201d Chavez, 26, was brought into the United States illegally from El Salvador when she was 11 and was protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Obama created in 2012 for undocumented millennials who came to the United States as children. She works part-time as a secretary at All Saints Catholic Church, where so many Latinos attend the Sunday afternoon, Spanish-language Mass that they spill from the pews to stand three to four deep against the walls. She doesn\u2019t much like Donald Trump, she told me, but if she could vote, she would vote for him based on her belief that abortion is murder.Chavez is the kind of Latino that Nixon\u2019s \u201cBrown Mafia\u201d was after \u2014 the same kind that Reagan tried to embrace with his 1986 amnesty, which legalized 2.7 million Hispanics who had no criminal history, and the kind that Reince Priebus had hoped the Republican National Committee\u2019s 2012 election autopsy would provoke Republicans to seek again. If the party had followed George W. Bush\u2019s lead, Todos Supermarket might have become a site for G.O.P. events. Carlos Castro, its owner, considered himself \u201calmost 100 percent Republican\u201d until 2007, when the Republicans of Prince William County championed an anti-Hispanic \u201cImmigration Resolution,\u201d and he began to reconsider. He\u2019s now an independent. Other conservatives in the county told me that they would keep their votes out of everybody\u2019s reach until a candidate arrives whom they can fully support.Even if a \u201cTrump effect\u201d among Latinos this year does help put Clinton in the White House, will those new voters stay engaged? History suggests they might not. According to the political scientists Matt Barreto and Gary M. Segura, more than a million Latinos in California registered to vote for the first time in the years after the state passed Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative. Prop. 187 prohibited undocumented immigrants from state-funded institutions, like schools, and required police officers to report their arrests to federal immigration authorities. In a statewide election, the initiative passed with 59 percent of the vote. Pete Wilson, the Republican governor who had championed the measure, won re-election that same fall. Prop. 187 was soon tied up in federal court, which ruled many of its elements unconstitutional, but California\u2019s electorate soon went on to pass a ban on affirmative action (Prop. 209) and a reduction in bilingual education (Prop. 227). Both measures were widely regarded as anti-Hispanic.Among those defeated in 2014 was Amanda Renteria, now the national political director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Renteria ran for Congress in a Central Valley district that was 74 percent Hispanic. She grew up in the Central Valley and taught math at her old high school in Woodlake before attending Harvard Business School and becoming the first Latina chief of staff in the history of the Senate. She lost her 2014 bid for Congress by 17 points. If Latinos had turned out for her at the levels that African-Americans turned out for Obama, it\u2019s possible that today she would sit in Congress.California may be a majority-minority state in terms of its population, the report observed, but its electorate is not: 60 percent of its likely voters are white, while only 18 percent are Latino. It would be na\u00efve, however, to expect Democrats to throw themselves wholeheartedly into the project of turning out the state\u2019s Hispanics given that they already control solid majorities in California\u2019s State Assembly and State Senate.\u201cWe have to be honest,\u201d Mar\u00eda Teresa Kumar, the president and co-founder of Voto Latino, a nonpartisan organization, told me last fall. \u201cWhen it comes to voter registration, each party is looking to the Latino community and the African-American community for enough votes. They don\u2019t need us all.\u201d From her office in Washington, she directs efforts to engage young Latinos who are often navigating the political system for their families. \u201cOur job,\u201d Kumar said, \u201cis to do true political empowerment: It\u2019s mass mobilization and mass participation. And for parties, it\u2019s about how little do they need to spend to get over the top.\u201dYet the majority of Virginia\u2019s General Assembly is still Republican, and only two of its state-level representatives, the delegates Alfonso Lopez and Jason Miyares, are Latino. Harry Wiggins, the chairman of Prince William County\u2019s Democratic Committee, described the problem like this: \u201cWe win the presidential. We won for Mark Warner. We won for Tim Kaine.

{"Headline": "Big Deals Like Bayer\u2019s Often Fail to Deliver High Performance", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GamePlenty of people have reason to celebrate the $56 billion bid by Bayer AG, the German pharmaceuticals giant, for Monsanto, the United States agribusiness company.History suggests, however, that one group should be wary of the transaction: Bayer\u2019s stockholders. Their company, which is paying cash for Monsanto but also taking on $10 billion in debt, could very well underperform its peers in the coming years.\u201cDespite the often-heard claim of M&A synergies,\u201d the report said, \u201cacquirers lag industry peers on a variety of fundamental metrics for an extended period following an acquisition. Profit margins, earnings growth and return on capital all decline relative to peers, while interest expense rises, as debt soars, and other \u2018special charges\u2019 increase.\u201dThis view was not among the talking points from the Bayer executives who contended \u2014 as their counterparts in previous deals also did \u2014 that their shareholders would benefit mightily from the transaction. In announcing the Monsanto deal, they said it was expected to increase the combined companies\u2019 earnings in the first year after closing. The executives also said they foresaw double-digit profit growth at the combined company in the third full year, driven in part by purported synergies of $1.5 billion over that period.Time will tell, of course, whether these expectations become a reality. But the S&P Global analysis of deals going back 15 years indicates otherwise.In their study, the analysts included United States companies in the Russell 3000 stock index that had done at least one deal from 2001 to 2013. To eliminate inconsequential acquisitions, the researchers included only those transactions that were at least 5 percent of the acquiring company\u2019s market capitalization or enterprise value.A total of 9,000 transactions made the cut. Returns on the acquirers\u2019 stocks were calculated through April 2016 and were compared with the performance of the Russell 3000 index over the period. The researchers also studied the performance of acquirers before and after they had made a purchase.\u201cIn general M&A deals underperform either their index or their peers over an extended period,\u201d Mr. Tortoriello, a quantitative analyst at S&P Global, said in an interview. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some deals that do very, very well, but over all they underperform.\u201dHow much? From 2001 to last April, the study found, a $1,000 investment in the Russell 3000 index would have grown to $2,956. The same investment in an index of Russell 3000 companies that made acquisitions of the type examined by the researchers would have turned into a paltry $1,671.Although the study reported on a three-year period following an acquisition, Mr. Tortoriello said over five years the outcomes were the same.Timing, he speculated, is one reason for the poor performance. \u201cMergers and acquisitions really heat up at the top of the market when business prospects going forward aren\u2019t as good,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it cools down when the market falls, just when you\u2019d want to be buying stocks and companies.\u201dIndeed, as the broad market indexes have pushed higher in recent years, mergers have increased. Last year was a record for buyouts, with $2.2 trillion worth occurring in the United States. This year is doing nearly as well: As of July 31, over $800 billion in deals had been struck, and that was before the Bayer-Monsanto acquisition.Fueling many of these deals are rock-bottom interest rates and softening corporate earnings. Many acquirers pick up companies to help keep their profits aloft.But precious few executives seeking to juice their earnings via acquisitions will get what they wished for. The average acquisition, the S&P Global study concluded, \u201ctends to be dilutive to earnings growth over an extended period.\u201dOther performance metrics \u2014 returns on both equity and invested capital \u2014 also declined as acquirers compared with their industry peers. This is partly a result of increased interest expense and other charges. And when looking at return on invested capital, many postmerger companies struggled under the weight of their increased debt loads.Fully aware that some acquisitions generate better returns than others, the S&P Global analysts set out to determine the characteristics of truly awful deals.\u201cIt\u2019s easier to handicap bad acquisitions because there are so many of them,\u201d Mr. Tortoriello said. \u201cWe found firms that have the highest levels of growth in assets and share issuance prior to an acquisition tend to underperform afterward. That indicates these companies are growing too fast; the acquisition strategy is part of their overextended growth pathway.\u201dAnother aspect of failing deals: Those using stock as buyout currency underperform those deploying cash, as Bayer is doing with Monsanto. And the larger the stock acquisition, the more likely it is to underperform significantly, the study found. Acquirers using the highest percentage of stock underperform industry peers by 3.3 percent one year after the deal is done and by 8.1 percent after three years.\u201cCompanies tend to make stock acquisitions when their shares are high and when business conditions are doing very well,\u201d Mr. Tortoriello said. \u201cSo that\u2019s probably closer to an inflection point in the market and economy and isn\u2019t good for the prosperity of the acquisition.\u201dFinally, the study found that acquirers with the highest one-year spending on buyouts underperformed their peers by 2 percent in the first year after closing and by 9.3 percent after three years. This reinforced the analysts\u2019 conclusion that companies with heavy deal making in their blood should either be avoided by investors or seen as candidates for short sales or negative bets.Assuming that Bayer\u2019s purchase of Monsanto goes through, it won\u2019t be clear for a while whether its management promises will come to pass. A Bayer spokesman, Christopher Loder, declined to comment further on the merger or on the study\u2019s findings. But Bayer\u2019s use of cash over stock suggests a better chance of success; so does the fact that the company has not been a serial big-ticket deal maker in recent years.Still, when it comes to buyouts, the track record of most companies is poor. Shareholders of acquisitive companies \u2014 including Bayer\u2019s \u2014 should be aware of all the risks executives don\u2019t like to talk about.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Affairs Will Be Overseen by 7 Experts in Finance and Law", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House said it had chosen seven experts in finance and the law to supervise Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal affairs in the coming months under a law enacted this summer intended to help the island restructure its $72 billion debt.Four of the supervisory board members are Republicans and three are Democrats, chosen from lists provided to the White House by the party leaders of both houses of Congress. And four of the members are Puerto Ricans, which is three more than required under the new debt-restructuring law.The Republicans named to the board are:\u25a0 Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\u25a0 Jos\u00e9 B. Carri\u00f3n III, president of Hub International, an insurance brokerage in Puerto Rico.\u25a0 Carlos M. Garc\u00eda, founder and chief executive of BayBoston Managers, a private equity firm.\u25a0 David A. Skeel Jr., a University of Pennsylvania law professor with expertise in bankruptcy.The new debt relief law is stirring colonial resentment, as Puerto Rican officials denounced the \u201cjunta\u201d \u2014 or federal control board \u2014 that will soon direct this island\u2019s failing governance and finances.The Democrats are:\u25a0 Arthur J. Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the New York University School of Law and a former chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\u25a0 Jos\u00e9 Ramon Gonz\u00e1lez, president and chief executive of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.\u25a0 Ana J. Matosantos, president of Matosantos Consulting and a former director of the California Department of Finance.In addition, the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, will hold a position on the board. He is not seeking a second term as governor, so whoever is elected to succeed him in November will take his seat on the board.\u201cThese officials have the breadth and depth of knowledge that is needed to tackle this complex challenge,\u201d President Obama said in a statement on Wednesday.The board was created as part of a new legal framework to shelter Puerto Rico from creditor lawsuits while it seeks to reduce its debt as its financial crisis intensifies. The law was necessary because federal law prohibits Puerto Rico from entering bankruptcy, which is what mainland cities and counties could do in similarly dire straits. It gives the island some restructuring powers normally available only in bankruptcy, but it also requires it to submit to federal oversight. The board is intended to remain in place until Puerto Rico regains the ability to raise money in the capital markets, which could take years.On the island, public opinion about federal oversight has been mixed, and protesters turned out in San Juan on Wednesday to call for repeal of the new law. Many Puerto Ricans resent Washington oversight, and see the board as an unwelcome vestige of colonialism. But at the same time, many Puerto Ricans have lost faith in their own elected officials, and they harbor some hope that the oversight board will help show the way out of the legal and financial maze in which they are lost.Mr. Obama acknowledged their hopes and misgivings on Wednesday, saying that for the board to succeed, it \u201cwill need to establish an open process for working with the people and government of Puerto Rico.\u201d He said the members would also \u201chave to work collaboratively to build consensus for their decisions.\u201dSenior administration officials said the board\u2019s first substantive task would be to review the multiyear fiscal plan that Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla\u2019s administration is preparing, make sure it meets all requirements under the law and propose revisions as needed. Ultimately the board must certify the soundness of the fiscal plan, which is to be the bedrock of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt restructuring and other important measures to revive its economy.\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d Secretary Jacob J. Lew of the Treasury said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe Puerto Rico government should bring together all of its resources to develop and submit a plan to the Oversight Board as soon as possible.\u201dUnsound fiscal policies in the past have contributed greatly to Puerto Rico\u2019s oversize debt. The government failed for many years to balance its budget, and borrowed money to plug the holes. Even as its creditworthiness crumbled, it could still borrow with ease by issuing municipal bonds. As a United States territory, it could offer interest on the bonds that was exempt from federal, state and local taxes, in all 50 states.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boko Haram Rages in Nigeria, but the World\u2019s Eyes Are Elsewhere", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From MaiduguriMAIDUGURI, Nigeria \u2014 The crisis spawned by Boko Haram has drawn hundreds of thousands of people to a relatively little-known city in Nigeria that has finally become safe enough for them to wait out an end to the awful, deadly war.With villagers from the countryside pouring in, it is almost as though the entire city, Maiduguri, has become a sprawling refugee camp.Tented government encampments dot the exurbs where people wait for bags of food to arrive. Once-quaint neighborhoods overflow with cardboard hovels filled with young children who are lucky to eat three meals a day.Squatters live in old university buildings or crammed inside homes with relatives or kind strangers. Old men sit along busy streets asking for money. At the massive Monday Market, women sell handfuls of fruit or jewelry, hoping to earn enough to pay for a meal.And those are the fortunate ones.Other people are far from the city\u2019s center \u2014 and from help \u2014 in remote areas of Borno State that have only recently been wrested from Boko Haram control. The news from these areas is grim: Aid workers say many residents could die of starvation.The Boko Haram crisis still rages, but it has not managed to sustain the level of global outrage that spiked when nearly 300 schoolgirls were kidnapped in 2014 in the village of Chibok, in Borno State\u2019s south.The horrors have been reported by The New York Times and other news outlets. Humanitarian assistance is on the ground, but the United Nations cannot raise even a quarter of the amount of money it says it needs to help combat the problems.Despite the continuing tragedy, the world appears to have moved on to other terrible events. Television cameras capture emergency room doctors treating bloodied Syrian children wounded in bombings, and American mothers who have lost sons in shootings by police officers.For the West, Boko Haram\u2019s victims are easy to overlook. The militants target some of the poorest people on the planet. In rural Borno State, proper emergency rooms do not exist to treat the injured. Here, mothers mourn sons who have either been killed by insurgents or, left with no other choice, have joined them.Most of the victims live in such poverty that, even without the challenges of the insurgency, their lives would play out on the margins, scraping by for survival.Last month, Bono, the Irish musician and the lead singer of U2, came to Maiduguri hoping to retrain the international spotlight on Boko Haram-induced problems, which, by most measures, are on track to get worse.In Maiduguri, Bono met with local government officials and toured encampments for people who had fled their villages as Boko Haram closed in. He visited with a group of young women and children who once lived among Boko Haram commanders.\u201cThese girls were just an unexpectedly human face of the conflict,\u201d Bono said in a telephone interview after his trip. \u201cWhen you think of Boko Haram, I just didn\u2019t think of that, or of the malnourished kids, which we saw at the camps.\u201dThis week, in meetings around the United Nations activities, Bono has been lobbying world leaders to increase aid for the victims of Boko Haram. Borno State serves as the backdrop in a video that will be released on Friday, in which he calls for longer-term economic policies to stem the appeal of terrorism.Getting the world to focus on the Boko Haram crisis will not be easy.In the years since, most of the world\u2019s attention has been on another terrorist group, the Islamic State, and its attacks on Westerners in France, Belgium and elsewhere. Those acts have prompted vigils and rallies in cities around the world, as well as scorn and retaliation from world leaders.Recently, Mr. Buhari released details of failed negotiations for the girls\u2019 release. On Wednesday, he requested that United Nations intermediaries help restart the talks.But access to food and health care is also in jeopardy in areas where Boko Haram is active or has been recently. Mercy Corps said last month that an estimated 800,000 people are living in burned-out villages and unstructured camps in 15 locations across Borno State \u2014 many far outside Maiduguri, with little or no food assistance, no operational markets and no way to make a living.The United Nations office for the coordination for humanitarian affairs has said it needs $739 million to care for the millions of people affected by Boko Haram in Nigeria, one of Africa\u2019s biggest economies, as well as in Cameroon, Chad and Niger. By mid-September, it had received only one-quarter of the total amount.\u201cThere\u2019s so much strategic importance in Nigeria \u2014 that\u2019s why it\u2019s odd that there\u2019s not more focus on what\u2019s happening,\u201d Bono said.\u201cIt\u2019s pathetic,\u201d he added. \u201cIf Nigeria fails, Africa fails. If Africa fails, Europe fails. If Europe fails, America is no longer America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Manipulates Its Currency, but Not in the Way Trump Claims", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 In Monday\u2019s presidential debate, Donald Trump repeated one of his frequent criticisms of China: It keeps its currency artificially cheap.That\u2019s no longer quite the case. Nowadays, China faces the opposite problem: It is shoring up its currency while the rest of the world is trying to push it down.That change speaks to an enormous shift in China\u2019s economic fortunes and to its position in the world. Not long ago, it was still an up-and-coming country looking for ways to nurture an economic boom that was lifting millions of people out of poverty.Today, China is a world power with ambitions to call more of the shots in world economic affairs. Beijing is no longer content to cede that role to the likes of Brussels, London, Tokyo and Washington.With that shift in attitude comes a change in the way China thinks about its money. A decade ago, China saw its currency as merely a tool to help its factories sell goods. That meant keeping it weak.Now, China sees the renminbi as an instrument of its growing power. If more people around the world hold renminbi in their wallets, the thinking goes, then China will have greater say in the decisions they make. Someday, Beijing hopes, the renminbi may even rival the dollar as the world\u2019s de facto currency.With that in mind, China has moved in recent years to make the renminbi more appealing. On Saturday, when the International Monetary Fund is set to formally add the renminbi to its basket of reserve currencies, a move that will lump it in with the dollar, the pound, the euro and the yen, it will take another step in that direction.Tony Gao, a senior at the University of Southern California, helped found a start-up called Easy Transfer three years ago. The company helps Chinese parents with children going to American schools exchange their renminbi for dollars. But business growth is down this year, he said, because many affluent Chinese have already changed their renminbi for dollars.\u201cA lot of them already have acknowledged this depreciation,\u201d Mr. Gao said, adding that he was thinking of switching his renminbi to dollars, too. \u201cNow I\u2019m actually on the edge.\u201dThe situation with the renminbi:Under the traditional rules of economics, the value of a country\u2019s currency will go up if the world moves more money there. That is what should have happened in China. People around the world poured money into the country as they bought its products and as companies built factories and invested in China\u2019s growth.Instead, China largely kept its currency at a steady value compared with the dollar. That contributed to imbalances in the country, but it kept the renminbi weak.For China\u2019s manufacturers, a weak currency is ideal. If the renminbi is at, say, eight to the dollar, then a $100 widget translates into an 800 renminbi sale. At a stronger seven renminbi to the dollar, that same $100 widget generates only 700 renminbi in sales.For starters, China\u2019s growth rate slowed, and the flow of money into the country moderated. Both factors have led economists to say that the renminbi might be fairly valued, or even overvalued. The verdict, for many investors: China\u2019s currency is poised to weaken.There are other forces at work. China has taken steps over the past few years to relax its hold on the renminbi. That makes it easier for banks and merchants abroad to save the renminbi or to use it in transactions. Manufacturing has also declined as a major growth driver in the country\u2019s economy, as the government pushes to build its growing consumer and high-tech sectors.Since August of last year, when Beijing surprised global markets with a one-time devaluation of its currency, investors have been broadly seeking to unload their renminbi in favor of dollars.In Hong Kong, the biggest offshore center for renminbi banking, deposits of the Chinese currency peaked in December 2014 and have since fallen by a third.For five years since 2010, the renminbi had made small but progressive gains as a global payment currency, as measured by transactions processed on the Swift global payment system. But that usage crested in August 2015 at 2.8 percent of transactions, and it has declined steadily since then, to 1.9 percent in August.Even long-term supporters of the renminbi now seem to see the currency\u2019s pause as perhaps inevitable.\u201cIt\u2019s been the strongest currency in the world for the last 10 years or so, and anything that strong should consolidate, should have a correction,\u201d said Jim Rogers, a Singapore-based investor who is well known for being bullish on China. \u201cIs it a normal market correction or being jiggled? Maybe some of both,\u201d he added.Mr. Rogers, who made his name in the 1970s as a co-founder of the Quantum Fund with George Soros, said he retained a positive long-term view of the Chinese currency. But he said the renminbi could continue to come under selling pressure in the next year or so, as investors flock to the perceived safety of the dollar.Some of the renminbi\u2019s declines, Mr. Rogers added, were \u201ca self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s not convertible, people feel trapped and want to get out,\u201d he said.Longer term, despite the I.M.F.\u2019s planned move, few expect the renminbi to rival the dollar as a haven, or even as a significant reserve currency, unless China pushes forward with dramatic legal and financial changes.Inclusion in the monetary fund\u2019s basket is \u201ca symbolically momentous event but is unlikely by itself to be a game changer in global finance,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and a former top I.M.F. official for China. He is also the author of a book called \u201cGaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi.\u201d\u201cNotwithstanding the I.M.F.\u2019s imprimatur, the renminbi will not become a significant reserve currency unless China has better-developed and well-regulated financial markets,\u201d Mr. Prasad added.An article on Saturday about China\u2019s manipulating its currency paraphrased incorrectly from a comment by Tony Gao, who helped found a start-up called Easy Transfer. Mr. Gao said the company\u2019s growth \u2014 not its business \u2014 was down this year.Emily Feng in Beijing and Carolyn Zhang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Hunts for Scientific Glory, and Aliens, With New Telescope", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPINGTANG COUNTY, China \u2014 When hundreds of engineers and builders began clambering up a jagged hill in southwestern China to assemble a giant telescope in a deep, bowl-shaped basin, poor villagers sometimes crept over the sheer slopes to glimpse the country\u2019s latest technological wonder.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like it, never imagined it,\u201d said one villager, Huang Zhangrong, a sun-gnarled 66-year-old carpenter. \u201cIt\u2019s a big circle, a big iron wok.\u201dMaybe even messages from aliens.Chinese science is often seen as serving the country\u2019s economic and military expansion, seeking ruthlessly practical dividends.But the telescope shows that the government in Beijing is also willing to spend heavily to propel China into the big leagues in research that offers few direct payoffs, apart from knowledge and prestige.Osiris-Rex launched Sept. 8, 2016, on a seven-year mission to the asteroid Bennu.China\u2019s history of subjugation to the West in previous centuries reinforced the belief that scientific prowess is essential for any modern power. And studying the heavens was, after all, an area where China excelled in ancient times.Astronomy, however, also depends on international cooperation. Despite Chinese hoopla about the telescope as homegrown technology, it also uses foreign equipment. The receiver, a crucial part, is Australian technology. Foreign scientists will be invited to work on research, and many of the telescope\u2019s big projects will draw on international collaboration.The soluble rock that covers this part of Guizhou has dissolved and eroded over eons into jutting hills with natural cavities. The spectacular terrain has also trapped residents in hard, isolated lives, farming corn and honeysuckle in the narrow strips of land among the hills.But the terrain also offers a nearly ideal environment for a radio telescope. The population is sparse, and the hills are a natural barrier against radio noise and wind that could upset the delicate instruments needed to catch whispers from deep in space.Even so, not all of the thousands of people being moved for the telescope want to go.\u201cI\u2019ve lived here all my life. My ancestors arrived here in the Qing dynasty over 200 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Huang, the carpenter, who lives in Miaoping village. He said local villagers had complained that the housing they had been offered in a town down the road was poorly built. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave, but the government says it\u2019s for the good of the country,\u201d he said.In return for the farmers\u2019 pain, Chinese scientists will have a vast and powerful scientific instrument that they hope will make breakthroughs in some of the biggest mysteries of the universe.The telescope is part of an array of projects to raise China\u2019s standing as a scientific power through big, expensive feats of scientific exploration.Using the new reach of the telescope in Guizhou, astronomers hope to better measure the distribution of neutral hydrogen atoms, like a telltale cosmic dust.If the telescope can be used to survey electromagnetic radiation from neutral hydrogen, he said, Chinese scientists would be well positioned to gain a much more accurate grasp of how fast the universe is expanding. \u201cThat would be very significant,\u201d he said.\u201cThis telescope offers the first time that China will have an unsurpassed opportunity to be at the international forefront of deep space exploration,\u201d said Mr. Zhang, the astrophysicist.Most alluring to the public may be the search for extraterrestrial civilizations, from signals that accidentally reach Earth or from messages sent here.

{"Headline": "Spain Remains Deadlocked as Vote to Form New Government Fails", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the second time this week, Spanish lawmakers on Friday rejected a bid by Mariano Rajoy, the caretaker prime minister, to form a government, increasing the likelihood that Spain will have to hold its third national election in a year to break its political stalemate.Friday\u2019s vote followed another acrimonious debate during which party leaders sought to highlight their differences rather than offer any new concessions.Mr. Rajoy\u2019s attempt to form a government was scuttled by the votes of the main left-wing opposition parties, led by the Socialists.Spanish politics has been transformed by the emergence of two parties, Ciudadanos and Podemos, that have fragmented Parliament. Those parties have taken over seats long held by the two traditional parties, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s conservative Popular Party and the Socialists, but not enough of them to leapfrog above the older parties and present a viable alternative. At the same time, the two traditional parties have remained at odds, refusing to negotiate the formation of a coalition that would guarantee a parliamentary majority, in part because of the antagonism between their leaders.\u201cThe drama is that we\u2019re seeing the end of the two-party system, but it is a terrible agony,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, the chief commentator of El Pa\u00eds, Spain\u2019s leading newspaper.Mr. Rajoy needed a simple majority on Friday, which he could have reached if at least 11 lawmakers had abstained from voting. Instead, each lawmaker cast a vote in line with the party leader, underlining the fierce discipline in a Spanish parliamentary system that has no culture of backbench dissension or open revolts.Friday\u2019s result leaves a third election, in December, as the likeliest possibility, even if Mr. Rajoy or another party leader could still make another attempt to form a government, most likely in October, after regional elections in northwestern Galicia and the Basque region.The regional elections could affect Mr. Rajoy\u2019s chances of staying in office, particularly if there is a swing in the Basque region, which is now governed by a Basque nationalist party that voted this week against Mr. Rajoy.In Friday\u2019s debate, Mr. S\u00e1nchez hinted that he could try again. But his chances look slim, not least because many Socialists worry that any deal with Podemos, an upstart party formed in 2014, could help it eventually replace the Socialist Party as the leading left-wing force in Spain.Spain\u2019s economy has been gradually recovering from the financial crisis in the eurozone. Recently, Mr. Rajoy and others have warned that political deadlock could jeopardize the recovery and Spain\u2019s international credibility as it seeks to meet its European obligations to rein in its budget deficit. On Friday, the government released data showing a slight rise in the number of people registering as unemployed in August, the first increase in five months.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Household Income Grew 5.2 Percent in 2015, Breaking Pattern of Stagnation", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Americans last year reaped the largest economic gains in nearly a generation as poverty fell, health insurance coverage spread and incomes rose sharply for households on every rung of the economic ladder, ending years of stagnation.The median household\u2019s income in 2015 was $56,500, up 5.2 percent from the previous year \u2014 the largest single-year increase since record-keeping began in 1967, the Census Bureau said on Tuesday. The share of Americans living in poverty also posted the sharpest decline in decades.The gains were an important milestone for the economic expansion that began in 2009. For the first time in recent years, the benefits of renewed prosperity are spreading broadly.The data was released into a heated presidential race, where Democrats seized on the statistics to promote Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and undercut Donald J. Trump\u2019s dark assessment of the nation\u2019s well-being.\u201cIt has been a long slog from the depths of the Great Recession, but things are finally starting to improve for many American households,\u201d said Chris G. Christopher Jr., director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight. He said the gains had continued this year.The economic recovery, however, remains incomplete. The median household income was still 1.6 percent lower than in 2007, adjusting for inflation. It also remained 2.4 percent lower than the peak reached during the boom of the late 1990s. The number of people living in poverty also remained elevated, although it shrank last year by about 3.5 million, or roughly 8 percent.Mark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University in St. Louis, said the new data \u201cis obviously good news.\u201d But he noted that poverty and income inequality in the United States remained more extreme than in most developed countries. \u201cIt would take a lot to move that needle,\u201d he said.The Census Bureau also reported that the share of Americans with health insurance continued to increase. It said that only 9.1 percent of the population had no health insurance last year.Several states, including Alaska, Indiana and Pennsylvania, expanded their Medicaid programs in 2015, taking advantage of increased federal funding under the Affordable Care Act. Private sector coverage also increased as companies hired more workers and offered them better benefits.\u201cWe lifted three and a half million people out of poverty, the largest one-year drop in poverty since 1968,\u201d President Obama said on Tuesday at a rally in Philadelphia for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThe uninsured rate is the lowest since they began keeping records. The pay gap between men and women shrank to the lowest level on record,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThanks, Obama.\u201dMr. Trump, the Republican nominee, has repeatedly cited the stagnation of household income as evidence of a broader economic malaise. He did not address the new report directly at a rally in Clive, Iowa, but he said the Obama administration\u2019s economic policies had failed.\u201cPoverty is beyond belief,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to break up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.\u201dThe Census Bureau\u2019s annual report, based on a survey of 95,000 households, is the latest evidence that 2015 was a good year for the economy. Employers added more than three million jobs as the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent. Hourly pay increased by 2 percent, adjusting for inflation. Americans drove more miles in their cars. Even housing showed some signs of a revival.The details of the bureau\u2019s report revealed that the gains last year were both broad and deep. Notably, lower-income households saw the largest income gains in percentage terms. Real household incomes rose 7.9 percent for households in the 10th percentile and 6.3 percent for those in the 20th percentile. By contrast, the increase was only 2.9 percent for those households in the 90th percentile.\u201cYou know the old saying, \u2018When the economy sniffles, the least advantaged catch pneumonia?\u2019\u201d said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research organization, and a former adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cWell, that works the other way, too. The benefits of closing in on full employment disproportionately flow to the least advantaged.\u201dThe increase in median income outpaced average income, which rose 4.5 percent to $79,263. The median income is the amount that divides households evenly between those that make less and those that make more. Average income is generally higher because some households make a lot more.The gains, however, came mostly from job growth rather than wage growth. More people are working, but many of them are still struggling to maintain their standard of living.Jeff Labruzzo, 56, said he was still earning significantly less than before the recession. Mr. Labruzzo, who lives in southwest Louisiana, treats building sites for termites before concrete is poured. The construction business remains soft, and Mr. Labruzzo said he faced increased competition from firms that employ illegal immigrants. He had five workers, but he recently let two of them go.\u201cThings are to the point where I\u2019m thinking about just closing up the business and letting my income drop,\u201d Mr. Labruzzo said. As a veteran, he said he could then qualify for government health benefits.Last year\u2019s income gains do not fundamentally alter the economy\u2019s long-term trajectory. Growth remains slow despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign to stimulate the economy. Predictions of faster growth, followed a few months later by disappointment, have become an annual ritual.Both Fed officials and outside economists argue that stronger growth requires action by fiscal policy makers. But Democrats and Republicans are at loggerheads over the best steps, and there is little suggestion that a breakthrough is in the offing.\u201cIt is encouraging that our economic recovery is lifting Americans out of poverty and boosting wages,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. \u201cBut instead of building on this progress, Washington Republicans want to turn back the clock.\u201dRepublicans responded in kind, presenting the data as evidence Democrats should step aside.\u201cToday\u2019s report is another disappointing confirmation that too many Americans are still struggling to provide for their families and reach their full potential,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThe federal government invests billions of dollars each year in programs to help low-income Americans, but more than 43 million people continue to live in poverty.\u201dThe distribution of income in the United States remains tilted toward the affluent. Last year\u2019s gains by lower-income households were not enough to shift measures of income inequality.The data also was a mixed bag for minority groups. Poverty rates fell most sharply for African-American and Hispanic households, but their income gains were smaller than for white households.\u201cOne good year does not reverse decades of stagnation,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cMiddle- and low-income households need a lot more than one good year. We need to keep this going.\u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary of this article misstated the year covered by the Census Bureau\u2019s report. The increase in household income was compared with 2014, not 2015.Nick Corasaniti contributed from Clive, IowaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Footing the Bill, Footing the Bill, Footing the Bill", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have very different approaches to taxation, but when it comes to spending, they both seem to agree on one thing: improving the nation\u2019s infrastructure.That is in line with a growing number of economists who see upgrading infrastructure as a way to invigorate the economy. For example, spending on new buildings and equipment has been weak partly because that depends on improvements in the nation\u2019s transportation network and pipelines.But, as ever, there is still debate on how much should be spent, and who will pay for it.Spend too little and the nation\u2019s backbone could deteriorate, costing more money in repairs. Spend too much and risk crowding out private investment, pushing up inflation and interest rates.Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, argues that America\u2019s need for better infrastructure is so great that the country could increase its debt load and still come out ahead. Others argue funding should come from increased taxes or budget cuts elsewhere.Once again, it comes down to who is going to pay \u2014 but this time, it involves public pensions.There are two competing ways of valuing a pension fund, and that means two sets of numbers.The debate over the two sets has raised concerns that governments nationwide do not know the true condition of the pension funds they are responsible for, meaning millions of people are exposed to risks they have no way of knowing about.Take, for example, California and its renowned public pension system, Calpers.Calpers keeps two sets of books to show the full cost today of providing \u2014 the officially stated numbers, known as the actuarial approach, and the ones that reflect the market value. The market value is not publicly disclosed and paints a much more troubling picture.But as even the relatively modest actuarial value of the pension fund (a calculation of the cost of providing a pension for life geared toward helping employers plan stable annual budgets) has grown, some local governments have struggled. Doubtful that they can really afford their pension plans, they have told Calpers that they want out.Calpers, in turn, has calculated the market value of the pension promises and, in some cases, the discrepancy between the two values has been a rather nasty surprise.For Citrus Pest Control District No. 2, a fund serving just six people that wanted to convert itself to a 401(k) plan, the district ended up settling the bill.It\u2019s our third case of who pays, but at least this time, we know the answer.The subsidies enabled him to lower his costs and sell apartments at higher prices because of their reduced taxes.No possible subsidy was left untapped.In one case, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Mr. Trump lined up a $150,000 grant for one of his buildings near ground zero. That took advantage of a program to help small businesses in the area recover, even though he had acknowledged on the day of the attacks that his building was undamaged.\u201cHis whole M.O. is to exploit the government for everything he could get,\u201d said Jerilyn Perine, the city housing commissioner during the Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations.\u201cIt is the goal of Chinese outbound industrial policy programs to replace foreign technology leaders in the medium term \u2014 not just in China but also in global export markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Status Quo Jobs Report Shows the Economy Isn\u2019t Overheating", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsNearly everything about the latest data from the Labor Department on Friday aligns with the basic trajectory the economy has been on for years now. We have been seeing steady improvement without signs of overheating. The new numbers fit that story precisely.Indeed, the report is so consistent with the longstanding evidence of how the economy is doing that we probably wouldn\u2019t care much at all about the August numbers if the Federal Reserve weren\u2019t on the precipice of raising interest rates at its September policy meeting.If there\u2019s good news in the report, it\u2019s not that the economy is doing any better than we thought, but rather that the numbers are consistent enough with expectations that bond traders can head to the Hamptons or wherever they plan to spend their Labor Day break. The Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, and her colleagues can safely do the same.The status quo in this case is pretty solid. The 151,000 jobs that United States employers added in August is far below the gaudy 275,000 added in July, but the more recent number is more consistent with what you would expect in an economy already getting close to full employment. The July number is more what you expect during the recovery from a recession, not when most of the people who want a job already have one.In terms of more data that affirms the status quo: Previous months\u2019 data was revised down by a minuscule 1,000 jobs; the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent. The proportion of the population that is in the labor force was unchanged, as was the proportion of the United States adult population with a job. Average hourly earnings rose by a not-very-impressive 0.1 percent.The fine print of the new numbers tilts even more clearly away from the Fed\u2019s pulling the trigger on an interest rate increase when its policy committee meets Sept. 20-21 than the headline numbers do.Fed officials are on watch for evidence that the tighter labor market is feeding through into broad-based price rises, which might over time lead to inflation above the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target. If anything, the August numbers pointed the opposite direction.That 0.1 percent increase in average hourly earnings was not impressive. It was a 3-cent increase in average hourly pay for private sector workers, to $25.73 an hour, which represents a 2.4 percent gain over the last year. Year-over-year pay raises have been larger many times in this expansion, meaning that number doesn\u2019t point to some acceleration in wage growth, but rather is, again, in line with the longstanding pattern.More concerning, the average workweek actually fell in August, to 34.3 hours from 34.4. It could be an aberration and isn\u2019t a big deal on its own. But if the job market were bursting at the seams, you would expect employers to be asking their workers to put in more hours, not fewer.Moreover, when you combine the shorter workweek with the very small hourly wage gain, average weekly earnings actually fell in August, dropping 0.2 percent to $882.54. Again, it\u2019s nothing to panic over \u2014 but also evidence that the economy isn\u2019t overheating in a way that the Fed needs to worry about.Finally, the unchanged unemployment rate points to a remarkably stable pattern. The jobless rate has hovered between 4.7 percent and 5.1 percent for more than a year now. While on the face of it, that might seem disappointing (after all, the rate has gotten down to 4 percent at times in the past), the fact that it isn\u2019t doing so should be a good sign that the economy isn\u2019t bursting at the seams. The number of people not in the labor force \u2014 neither working nor looking for work \u2014 actually rose slightly, up by 78,000 in August.Add it all up, and the new jobs numbers point to an economic recovery that is stable, steady and not entering a danger zone that might prompt the Fed to worry too much about being behind the curve on interest rate increases. Ms. Yellen, and the traders who obsess over her every move, should plan to enjoy the long weekend.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "So You Have $500 Million? Here\u2019s a Shopping List for the Philharmonic\u2019s Hall.", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you\u2019re going to charge $10 or more for a glass of wine, as many concert halls do these days, it should be served in a glass \u2014 not a plastic cup. Plastic is terrific at barefoot beach bars or for free drinks, but it is hard not to feel more than a bit ripped off when you get them after shelling out more than $20 for a pair of reds. Carnegie Hall uses glass at its main bars, and it is one of the many civilizing little touches that make attending concerts there so pleasant. Of course, concert halls could simply lower what they charge these days for snacks and drinks and decide to view them more as amenities that help make concert-going fun and less a means of wringing more cash out of customers. If the price were right, those plastic cups would rankle less.Lots of them. Especially for women. Enough said.Sadly, bag checks and metal detectors have become facts of life at many theaters and halls in recent years, and after the horrific attacks at the Bataclan in Paris last year and the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in June, that is unlikely to change any time soon. If security checkpoints are to be part of the modern concert experience, they should be accommodated by the design of the hall. Architects should plan enough entrances to ensure that security checks do not create bottlenecks as people arrive for the concert \u2014 and to minimize a sense of standing in a Transportation Safety Administration line at the beginning of a transporting evening of music.If you are lucky enough to score floor seats to see a great orchestra, it would be nice to be able to see that orchestra. But too often, it is difficult to see beyond the first row of chairs. Some orchestras use risers \u2014 or tiered platforms \u2014 that elevate the players in the back rows for better visibility. These have pluses and minuses. Some conductors think risers have a negative effect on the sound, since, say, an elevated brass section may be more prone to drowning out the strings. And some players dislike being hemmed in on their risers. But if an adjustable, tiered stage could be designed to work both physically and acoustically, it would add something to the experience of attending a live concert. People could tell which woodwind player was actually creating that eerie effect, or which newfangled contraption the percussionist was busily banging away on.Some music lovers have mixed feelings about the growing trend of cinema karaoke, in which great orchestras play the soundtracks of films live as they are screened. But audiences love them. The New York Philharmonic has made these programs a regular feature. But if such programs are going to continue in the future, the orchestra should think about investing in a bigger screen \u2014 would Imax be possible? \u2014 given how much bigger a concert hall is than a movie theater. And Geffen Hall will certainly need a better sound system to make sure all the dialogue is intelligible.For all the talk about the real acoustical problems that have plagued Geffen Hall since it was first built in the 1960s, an even bigger issue for many concertgoers without highly attuned ears has been the hall\u2019s glamour deficit. So at the risk of sounding shallow, let me just say it: If the new Geffen Hall is going to lure new audiences from New York\u2019s many other offerings, it will need to be date-night-worthy. When Vienna\u2019s Musikverein \u2014 the home of the Vienna Philharmonic \u2014 opened in 1870, some found it too much. Assessing its gilded, opulent, over-the-top main hall, the critic Eduard Hanslick asked if it \u201cwas not too sparkling and magnificent for a concert hall.\u201d But its magnificence \u2014 and beautiful sound \u2014 has been packing them in ever since and has made the hall a regular feature on television each New Year\u2019s. The new Geffen Hall should have such problems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Will Require Its Contractors to Provide Paid Sick Leave", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Obama administration, in its latest effort to update workplace policies it says have lagged far behind the realities of Americans\u2019 lives, will require federal government contractors to provide paid sick leave to their workers.The rule, which was issued on Thursday and which the Labor Department estimates will directly affect more than 1.1 million people once fully in effect, enables workers to accrue up to seven days of paid sick leave a year.\u201cThis is really part of a broader conversation across America about what a 21st-century social compact should look like,\u201d Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, said in an interview. \u201cBack in the day, when Beaver Cleaver got sick and June Cleaver was home, who takes off to stay with the Beav was a nonissue. In today\u2019s world of dual-career couples in the work force, our public policy has not caught up.\u201dThe rule, which does not need additional approval, requires that workers in assignments related to many federal contracts receive one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, for up to 56 hours of leave a year. Workers will be able to use the days to receive medical attention, care for a relative or deal with complications arising from domestic violence or sexual assault. The rule affects only contracts solicited by the government beginning on Jan. 1, 2017.Proponents argue that the benefit can have large social consequences.\u201cIt seems such a minor, sideline type of measure, but it does strike at the core of whether a job is workable within the context of family life,\u201d said Lisa Guide, associate director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, which has financed research and advocacy on this subject. At issue, she said, is \u201cwhether a person will be able to take care of their kids and also hold down a job at the same time and pay their bills.\u201dPaola Angel was working as a security guard in New York City when its paid sick leave law went into effect. Before the law, she typically had to leave one of her two school-age sons at home when they got sick because she could not afford to forgo a day of pay or to put her job at risk.\u201cI had them take some medicine before I left the house and crossed my fingers that they don\u2019t get worse,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel horrible.\u201dOpponents of the new rule say that paid sick leave is often a desirable policy in principle, but that the cost of the mandate will be a hardship for many employers, particularly smaller businesses. Among those who will be affected by the rule are franchisees and concessionaires selling food on federal property.\u201cThere are franchise operations in a wide array of locations,\u201d said Marc D. Freedman, executive director of labor law policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIf someone isn\u2019t providing this benefit, there\u2019s a reason. It isn\u2019t because they\u2019re bad people, evil employers.\u201dCritics have questioned the costs of administering the rule even for larger employers. In a comment letter responding to the proposed rule, the Chamber of Commerce and the International Franchise Association called it a \u201ccompliance nightmare.\u201dThe letter raised the possibility that a federal contractor in San Francisco would have to make its policies conform to three separate sick leave rules \u2014 one for the city, one for the state of California and one for the federal government.The administration is including language in the final rule to make clear how a contractor\u2019s current sick leave policy can comport with the mandate.The administration also increased its estimate of the number of workers who will receive some increase in paid sick leave by nearly 300,000.Some critics say the true intent is to affect substantially more workers than even the higher estimate. Many companies that win federal contracts, they say, are quite likely to enact the new paid sick leave policy across their entire work force rather than maintain separate policies, one for workers involved in federal contracts and a less generous one for everyone else.\u201cIn a cynical way, they\u2019re banking on the idea that employers are going to throw up their hands and put everyone under the new plan,\u201d Mr. Freedman said.Mr. Perez, the labor secretary, essentially responded that he was guilty as charged. \u201cIf that\u2019s one of the benefits, the effects of this rule, I will be thrilled,\u201d he said.Michael Shear contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

The other nations of the eurozone, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have extended Greece three bailouts worth more than 300 billion euros over the past six years. The bailouts were delivered in exchange for tax increases, pension cuts and other measures that have hurt the economy and left one in four Greeks unemployed.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s speech was not broadcast by private Greek television channels because employees were on strike to protest cutbacks and decreasing job security.Pensioners took to the streets last week in Athens, and police officers and firefighters demonstrated in Thessaloniki on Friday. Similar protests are expected when representatives of Greece\u2019s creditors return to Athens next week to check on progress in meeting bailout targets.Mr. Tsipras was elected in January 2015 on a promise to end austerity measures. He reversed course that summer and signed Greece\u2019s third bailout, ushering in a new round of budget cuts and belt-tightening.The government hopes to soon start talks to lighten the country\u2019s debt burden, which stands at around 175 percent of national output. But many European Union countries, led by Germany, are reluctant to offer major concessions, fearing a backlash from their voters.The International Monetary Fund, which joined Greece\u2019s first two bailouts, has insisted on debt relief to make Greece\u2019s debt more sustainable before it signs onto the third program.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Waste Money on Premium Gas if Your Car Is Made for Regular", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWith the typical new passenger vehicle costing more than $33,000, American drivers understandably want to do everything they can to preserve their investments.And what better way to do that than by spending a few extra cents per gallon and occasionally treating your car to a tank of premium fuel?Don\u2019t do it. Unless one likes to unnecessarily enrich the oil companies, there is no reason to buy premium gasoline for a vehicle that needs only regular.There are advantages to using brand-name fuels, whose detergents and additives can help engines run cleaner and last longer. (More on that below.)But using a higher octane fuel than a vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual specifies \u201cprovides no increase in fuel economy, horsepower or a reduction in emissions,\u201d said Greg Brannon, the AAA\u2019s director of automotive engineering.Unless you have a high-performance car \u2014 like a BMW M3 or a Jaguar XF \u2014 whose engine is designed to require the use of higher octane gasoline, so-called premium gasoline, your engine will let you know if regular gas isn\u2019t good enough.Gasoline sold in the United States usually is available in three octane ratings: Regular gas is typically 87 octane, midgrade is 89 and premium might be 91 to 93.The difference is not mere marketing. The higher the octane number, the greater the fuel\u2019s resistance to detonation. Decades ago, that mattered. Using a lower octane fuel could often result in pinging or knocking because the fuel was igniting prematurely. Knocking is not good because it can cause premature engine wear.In the 1960s, vehicle engines were so sensitive to knocking that one fuel company, Sunoco, offered eight octane grades at the pump. And the company produced a chart, second only to the periodic table of elements in complexity, to help drivers figure out which blend their make and model car required. (It being the \u201960s, the only cars listed came from Detroit.)Back then, too, gasoline also contained tetraethyl lead to dampen knocking and increase octane. But leaded gasoline, a neurotoxin and environmental hazard, was eventually outlawed.Modern engines not only don\u2019t need lead but have sophisticated antiknock technologies that sense a fuel\u2019s octane rating and adjust their ignition timing to prevent damage.A vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual specifies the type of fuel required for proper performance, although it might also say that premium fuel is \u2018\u2018recommended.\u2019\u2019When premium fuel is merely recommended, there is no reason to use it instead of regular, according to Jake Fisher, Consumer Reports\u2019 director of auto testing.In its own experiments, Consumer Reports found that vehicles that \u201crecommended\u201d premium did not increase acceleration or fuel economy compared with regular gasoline.At Ford Motor, all vehicles are designed to run on regular fuel, with the exception of high-performance models like the Mustang Shelby GT350 and the Focus RS, which have high-compression engines that burn hotter, said Steve Russ, the senior technical leader for internal combustion engines at Ford Global.And at General Motors, premium gas is required only in vehicles like the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 and the Corvette Z06, with their supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engines. Even the big Cadillac Escalade recommends, but does not require, premium fuel.In fact, more than 90 percent of the company\u2019s products are calibrated for regular gasoline, according to Bill Studzinski, G.M.\u2019s engineering group manager for fuels. \u201cWe have always said, \u2018Don\u2019t put more octane in your tank than the owner\u2019s manual requires,\u2019\u201d he said.Ford and G.M. agreed that there was one exception: If a vehicle was used to pull a heavy load or operate in extremely dry conditions, \u201cyou might gain a little in performance\u201d from premium, Mr. Studzinski said. \u201cGenerally, there\u2019s not a big benefit.\u201dRight now, the best way to ensure that your car is getting its best fuel economy is to use gasoline that helps keep the engine clean. To maintain an engine\u2019s life and performance, it is important to prevent deposits from building. Deposits can reduce fuel economy, cause hesitant starts and increase emissions.But it is the quality of the fuel, not its octane rating, that matters. That is why the brand of gasoline you buy could make more of a difference than the octane grade.While most gasoline is refined by a handful of major players, the quality depends on what ingredients are added to the fuel before it arrives at the service station.To help consumers know whether the gas they buy contains the additives needed to optimize an engine\u2019s performance, eight of the major automotive manufacturers created the Top Tier specification, a set of standards that exceed the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s minimum requirements for gasoline detergents.Top Tier fuel is sold by the major fuel retailers, including Arco, Exxon, Mobil, Shell, Texaco and Valero. To avoid customer confusion, all grades at participating retailers must meet the Top Tier requirements. A Top Tier specification for diesel fuel is expected by 2017.\u201cThere is a major difference in quality between Top Tier and other fuels,\u201d said Mr. Brannon at AAA. \u201cTop Tier greatly reduces engine deposits.\u201dTop Tier is typically not available at independent gasoline retailers. That is why Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor for news at Kelley Blue Book, cautions against buying off-brand fuels, which might contain water and other contaminants.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy fuel from Jack\u2019s Gas and similar smaller stations,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It shakes you up, but it also challenges your ideas about the intersection of race, justice and mass incarceration in the United States, subject matter that could not sound less cinematic. Yet Ms. DuVernay \u2014 best known for \u201cSelma,\u201d and a filmmaker whose art has become increasingly inseparable from her activism \u2014 has made a movie that\u2019s as timely as the latest Black Lives Matter protest and the approaching presidential election.Speed is one reason \u2014 you\u2019re racing through history witness by witness, ghastly statistic by statistic \u2014 but you\u2019re also charged up by how the movie\u2019s voices rise and converge. It\u2019s like being in a room with the smartest people around, all intent on rocking your world. Ms. DuVernay is working within a familiar documentary idiom that weaves original, handsomely shot talking-head interviews with well-researched, occasionally surprising and gravely disturbing archival material. All these sources, in turn, have been shaped into discrete sections that are introduced with music and animation. Every so often, the animation underscores an interviewee\u2019s point, as in one sequence in which the word \u201cfreedom\u201d morphs into flying birds and then the Stars and Stripes and then a slave ship.With few exceptions, the movie\u2019s voices \u2014 including most of its several dozen interviewees \u2014 speak in concert. Some (like a galvanizing Angela Davis) are more effective and persuasive than others; at least one \u2014 Newt Gingrich, speaking startling truth to power \u2014 is a jaw-dropper. Even with its surprise guests, the movie isn\u2019t especially dialectical; it also isn\u2019t mainstream journalism. Ms. DuVernay presents both sides of the story, as it were (racism versus civil rights). Yet she doesn\u2019t call on, say, politicians who have voted against civil rights measures for their thoughts on the history of race in the United States. She begins from the premise that white supremacy has already had its say for centuries.Ms. DuVernay forcefully and sorrowfully challenges that confident assertion, tracing the history of systems of racial control from the years after the abolition of slavery all the way to George Zimmerman\u2019s speaking to a police dispatcher about the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s got his hand in his waistband,\u201d we hear Mr. Zimmerman say shortly before fatally shooting Mr. Martin. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a black male.\u201d When this documentary reaches its culmination, which features graphic videos of one after another black man being shot by police, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s rigorously controlled deconstruction of crime, punishment and race in the United States has become a piercing, keening cry.\u201c13TH\u201d is not rated.

It apparently did so without many voting irregularities, and despite a sluggish economy, sanctions imposed by the West and unrest in some quarters over the government\u2019s crackdown on civil liberties. What gives?What gives is the sorry degree to which Mr. Putin and his Kremlin cronies have consolidated full control over Russian politics. Twenty-five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia appears to have returned full circle to a pseudo-parliament whose only function is to give a semblance of legitimacy to an authoritarian ruler. The post-Soviet Russian Constitution already granted more powers to the president and cabinet than to the legislature, but at least the Duma was a platform for the opposition to question and criticize Kremlin policies. Now even this function is effectively gone.It\u2019s true that after almost 17 years in power as president or prime minister, Mr. Putin enjoys an astounding approval rating hovering around 80 percent \u2014 founded in part on his demagogic claims to be standing up to a United States that he accuses of engineering all Russia\u2019s woes and thus restoring Russia\u2019s imperial greatness.If there was a way the voters expressed discontent, it was by not voting. The 47.8 percent turnout was a record low for post-Soviet Russia, far below the 60 percent in 2011, and it was especially low in major urban areas. In Moscow, less than 30 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, compared with more than 50 percent in 2011.Mr. Putin is free to run for yet another six-year term as president in 2018 should he choose to. Until then, his grip on power seems secure. All the parliamentary election really showed was that those Russians who had once tried to shape a real democracy had been crushed or swept aside, or had given up for now.Advertisement"}

But in March, he visited a boutique that the Swiss watch company Franck Muller had just opened in the upscale Sedona Hotel overlooking Yangon\u2019s Inya Lake \u2014 the company\u2019s 44th location worldwide and Myanmar\u2019s first monobrand luxury watch store.Mr. Thiri Thein Than bought a Master Calendar Lunar watch in pink gold with a tiny moon that rises and falls with the lunar calendar. He said the watch, which sells here for $33,500, has drawn compliments at his office and makes him feel distinguished in crowds.\u201cThis is my jewelry,\u201d he said of the watch on a recent morning, sitting in jeans and a blue dress shirt beside a giant white vase of fresh orchids at the hotel, where the Muller boutique occupies 2,153 square feet.Myanmar\u2019s economy, stunted for decades after a 1962 military coup, has grown swiftly since 2012, when landmark elections ushered in political changes and a wave of foreign investment. Profits from the domestic timber, minerals and oil and gas industries had been fueling urban property markets and a high-end domestic jewelry trade, but international brands were virtually nonexistent before the opening \u2014 even here in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s business capital and most cosmopolitan city.Many residents still patronize ramshackle \u201cwet\u201d markets \u2014 which sell fresh meats and produce \u2014 and sidewalk tea shops, where a full meal costs far less than a Starbucks latte. But by 2015, the country\u2019s economy was growing by 7 percent annually, up from 5.6 percent in 2011, and new high-rises and shopping malls were sprouting alongside the city\u2019s majestic, if dilapidated, colonial-era buildings.Nearly all of Yangon\u2019s new retail space targets low- to midrange buyers. Shoppers who can afford luxury goods typically buy online or on trips to Singapore, Thailand or Europe, several analysts and business people said. But a few overseas luxury brands are beginning to sell watches and other goods here, with an eye toward future sales.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be there at the very beginning,\u201d Nicholas Rudaz, director of Franck Muller, said in a telephone interview from the brand\u2019s headquarters in Switzerland. \u201cAnd, of course, this is a long-term investment.\u201dYangon was expected to have nearly 3.2 million square feet of retail space by late 2016, a roughly threefold increase since 2010, according to the commercial real estate company Colliers. But that would still be just a fraction of the 7.4 million square meters of retail space in Bangkok, the capital of neighboring Thailand and a major Southeast Asian shopping hub.Antony Picon, Myanmar managing director at the commercial real estate company Colliers, said he did not expect major luxury brands to enter Myanmar for another five years to a decade, although a few luxury cosmetics chains might open locations in Yangon\u2019s upscale hotels, a common pattern in emerging markets.But in the longer term, the country\u2019s retail growth could be explosive, said Gregory Miller, managing partner at Myanmar Capital Partners, a Bangkok-based financial services company with staff in Yangon. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to draw comparisons with Laos and Cambodia because they\u2019re not rich with resources,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Myanmar is \u201cgoing to be more like Thailand.\u201dHe said demand for luxury retail would come not only from the existing moneyed elite, but also from an emerging middle class and Myanmar \u00e9migr\u00e9s coming home to pursue business opportunities.The situation \u201cwill change simply because the head of sales will be saying, \u2018We need to be in Myanmar,\u201d\u2019 he added. \u201cAnd some people will take the leap.\u201dThere already are signs of demand: For example, Jaguar Land Rover, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have all opened Yangon showrooms since 2012, the year the government relaxed import regulations for cars.Okkar, a Myanmar national who uses just one name, is a Ford brand manager at a Yangon car dealership selling Ford, Jaguar and Range Rover models. He said that government officials were often among buyers of luxury sport utility vehicles, and that many luxury car buyers here had large fleets.Another sign of growth is Swiss Time Square, a sleek, multi-brand watch boutique that opened in 2013 on the fringes of Yangon\u2019s Golden Valley district. Prices start at a few hundred dollars for Tissot and Rado models, and rise to $1.3 million for a diamond-and-ruby-studded Rolex.\u201cWearing Rolex watches is just like cars: If you are buying a BMW or Mercedes car, it means other people will see that you are a rich person,\u201d Tay Zar Win Htoo, a sales supervisor, said on a recent morning at the two-story boutique, which sits near some mobile phone shops on a traffic-choked boulevard about four miles from downtown Yangon.However, he said, the more common sale was $500 to $1,000. As many as 30 watches of each popular brand are sold in the months before Thadingyut, a Buddhist holiday in October.Luxury elements are being included in several mixed-use real estate projects in Yangon\u2019s downtown. One is the Landmark Development, a two-million-square-foot project scheduled to open in 2019 or 2020 with a luxury Peninsula Hotel, according to the project\u2019s developer, Yoma Strategic Holdings, based in Singapore.Cyrus Pun, the company\u2019s head of real estate, said in an email that the Landmark\u2019s luxury component, though small at first, could expand as Myanmar\u2019s retail market matures.On a nearby block, Sule Square, a project of Shangri-La Group, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, was nearing completion early this summer. Yinn Mar Nyo, Sule Square\u2019s director of sales and marketing, said the project\u2019s 64,583-square-foot retail component would include Myanmar\u2019s first monobrand Rolex store.But Ms. Yinn Mar Nyo added that the mall\u2019s primary target would be midmarket consumers. \u201cThere are buyers for luxury goods, but in terms of volume, it may not be there,\u201d she said during a tour of the high-ceilinged lobby, speaking over the drone of buzz saws and the clank of hammers.Ivan Pun, a Myanmar entrepreneur whose father, Serge Pun, is the executive chairman of Yoma Strategic Holdings, said he came to a similar conclusion about Myanmar\u2019s retail sector after briefly operating a pop-up store with international designer clothing.\u201cThe target audience that I had in my mind \u2014 of girls in their 20s and 30s with a high disposal income \u2014 they came through the door,\u201d Mr. Pun said of the project, which he said featured \u201ccool kid\u201d brands like 3.1 Phillip Lim and Mary Katrantzou, with prices ranging from $300 to more than $7,000. \u201cBut that did not translate into sales.\u201dMr. Pun, who previously worked in New York and Beijing, said he was now talking with international luxury brands and would be open to partnerships with some of them here, but that none were rushing to open a monobrand shop in Yangon because Myanmar's luxury market was so new.For now, his start-up, Pun & Projects, is opening restaurants in Yangon that would not look out of place in Brooklyn or East London. One example is Rau Ram, a Vietnamese fusion restaurant whose menu features Hokkaido scallop crudo, lemongrass buttermilk fried chicken and a designer cocktail named \u201cpho real.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governor\u2019s Views Don\u2019t Help as Maine\u2019s Population Dwindles", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTLAND, Me. \u2014 Leopold Ndayisabye, a Rwandan immigrant who works as a caseworker, has watched refugees, asylum seekers and other immigrants move to this city, fill health care jobs, send their children to school and line up to buy goods in the local stores.\u201cPeople are not feeling safe,\u201d said Mr. Ndayisabye, 46, the president of the local Rwandan association. He says he knows some immigrants who, feeling uneasy, have left for places like Ohio, Michigan and Washington State.\u201cBecause it\u2019s from the governor\u2019s mouth,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s an official thing.\u201dQuite apart from the national debate over immigration, Mr. LePage\u2019s views are causing anxiety among some of Maine\u2019s foreign-born residents. They could also have serious social and economic implications for a state that lost population last year.As other cities and states have discovered, an influx of immigrants can reverse population decline and stave off the loss of political clout in Washington. But in Maine, the governor\u2019s pronouncements are complicating efforts to attract the very people the state needs to grow. And some analysts worry about the long-term consequences.Maine is bedeviled by its population trends: Its median age of 44.5 makes it the oldest state in the country, and it has the nation\u2019s highest concentration of baby boomers. Mr. Colgan said that the retirement of the boomer generation was creating a \u201cslow-motion disaster.\u201dAs older residents retire or die, they are not being replaced. Maine was one of seven states that lost population last year and one of two, West Virginia being the other, where deaths outnumbered births.The trends were set in motion long before Mr. LePage took office in 2011, and they are not unique to Maine. But bringing about change here may be harder than elsewhere, analysts say, in part because Maine starts with an older, less diverse population. It is almost 95 percent white, compared with the nation as a whole, which is 62 percent white.Mr. LePage, who did not respond to a request for comment, has argued that public funds should go to Maine residents before they go to asylum seekers, even though they are not allowed to work while their applications are being processed, which can take several months. He has tried multiple times to withhold or limit the funds. In February, he called asylum-seekers \u201cthe biggest problem in our state\u201d and suggested they were bringing in diseases.Mr. LePage\u2019s views are in contrast to those of officials elsewhere who see immigrants as essential to their economies.Many immigrants have found welcoming communities and do not plan to leave, despite Mr. LePage\u2019s antipathy toward some foreign-born newcomers. Still, the state\u2019s demographic challenges have set off alarm bells.Like many states in the Northeast, Maine has had difficulty retaining young people and attracting those from other states. Its relatively low wages, high cost of energy, remoteness and long, harsh winters may account for some of the resistance.The foundation has set a goal of expanding the labor force by a net of at least 45,000 new workers by 2020 \u2014 a difficult task because the work force is projected to shrink by 20,000 during that period. A major component of those new workers, the foundation hopes, will be foreign-born immigrants, along with young adults from other states and expanded opportunities for seniors, people with disabilities and veterans.\u201cWe can\u2019t suddenly expect to flip a switch and become a preferred destination,\u201d said Yellow L. Breen, president and chief executive of the foundation. \u201cBut we have to send a message that is welcoming and have all the tools for immigrants who do come to succeed.\u201dHe declined to comment on whether the governor\u2019s stance had been counterproductive. He did say that the foundation hoped its efforts would \u201ctranscend any short-term political winds,\u201d adding that, along with the state Chamber of Commerce, it is preparing a report on the value of immigrants to the labor force.Others were more blunt.Michael F. Brennan, the Democratic former mayor of Portland, where immigrants make up 13 percent of the population and 42 percent of public school students are minorities, has clashed often with Mr. LePage, particularly over those seeking asylum.\u201cI\u2019d be hard pressed, at this point, to find another state that is faced with the demographic challenges,\u201d Mr. Brennan said, \u201cwhere you have a significant number of businesspeople and elected officials that are pursuing one policy objective that are being directly contradicted and thwarted and undermined by the governor.\u201dThe governor\u2019s comments have disheartened immigrants and asylum-seekers in particular.Mohamud Barre, a community leader who fled Somalia two decades ago, worries that as the pressure from Mr. LePage intensifies, more families will leave. \u201cMost of the people I see, they are so afraid of what\u2019s coming from him,\u201d Mr. Barre said.\u201cPersonally,\u201d he added, \u201cI don\u2019t like to see my neighbor moving to Minneapolis,\u201d a city that many view as a model for welcoming African immigrants. \u201cI like people to stay here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And despite volumes of policy proposals, even Clinton supporters often strain to identify cohesive themes, independent of Mr. Trump, in her campaign.Aides said last week that she planned to give several speeches aimed at connecting her personal motivations to her political agenda. The second in the series, slated for Tuesday, was postponed after she fell ill.\u201cThey\u2019ve clearly framed the race as a referendum on Donald Trump,\u201d said Steve McMahon, a longtime Democratic strategist. \u201cThat does create a vacuum and a greater level of interest in things like this that, frankly, probably have no special significance.\u201dThe campaign also introduced a new advertisement, a largely positive spot focused on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s history of working with Republicans. She is seated, speaking directly to the camera, evoking a biographical video from the Democratic National Convention in July that highlighted her career accomplishments and compassion.\u201cThey\u2019re going back to that part of the convention that got lost in the month of August,\u201d said Bob Shrum, a veteran Democratic adviser and strategist.Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, said that Mrs. Clinton would continue her speech tour once she returned to full health, with addresses focused on \u201can inclusive economy,\u201d \u201ca call to national service\u201d and \u201ca vision for how we should prioritize the condition of kids and families.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to pick up right where we left off in terms of sparking a conversation about her aspirational vision for the country,\u201d Mr. Fallon said in an interview. \u201cI think that that will be far more enduring in the course of this campaign than this brief focus on this case of pneumonia.\u201dBut the diagnosis has proved particularly ill timed, not least because of recent ominous insinuations from Republicans, including Mr. Trump, that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s health was faltering.People are motivated to vote by a combination of individual priorities, group culture, candidate outreach, and how easy or hard it is to cast a ballot.\u201cThe past impressions of Hillary Clinton help fuel the questions about being transparent about her health,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic operative who helped steer campaigns for Howard Dean and Richard A. Gephardt, among others. \u201cNo one would have asked them of Dick Gephardt.\u201dSeveral hours later, aides announced that she had received a diagnosis of pneumonia \u2014 two days earlier.On Monday, staff members were determined to take the blame for the secrecy and to shield Mrs. Clinton from the criticism.\u201cThat\u2019s on the staff,\u201d Mr. Fallon told MSNBC.\u201cThat\u2019s on us,\u201d Robby Mook, her campaign manager, later told the network.Mr. Mook was referring to the gap between Mrs. Clinton\u2019s departure from the memorial and the campaign\u2019s announcement of what had happened. Some supporters, though, suggested that even more disclosure was necessary.\u201cI would have, on the initial diagnosis, made that public,\u201d said Edward G. Rendell, a former governor of Pennsylvania. \u201cThey\u2019re probably a little bit gun-shy.\u201dMr. Fallon said there was never \u201can intent to conceal the diagnosis\u201d and speculated that Mrs. Clinton might have told the traveling press corps about it on her own this week, had she not become overheated at the memorial on Sunday and changed her travel schedule.Mr. Rendell echoed several other Democrats who predicted that the episode would be largely forgotten if Mrs. Clinton returned to the campaign trail soon, especially if she delivers a commanding performance at the first presidential debate in two weeks.Dan Pfeiffer, a former top adviser to President Obama, preached calm. He said that while \u201cthe last couple of days could have gone better,\u201d the main cost to the Clinton campaign had been \u201cplaying defense instead of offense\u201d while parrying questions about her health.\u201cThat is less of a problem because she is winning,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said, citing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s continued advantage in polls, though some have shown a tightening race. \u201cEvery day the race doesn\u2019t move is a win for her. Trump can\u2019t afford to trade baskets at this point.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The downturn, which Goldman Sachs likens to a depression, has even exceeded the 7.6 percent decline during the so-called lost decade of the 1980s, when Brazil fought hyperinflation.\u201cHis attack on our democracy will sink the country even further,\u201d said Judson Albino Coswosk, 25, a university biology student who has accused Mr. Temer of ousting Ms. Rousseff for his own political gain.\u201cTemer\u2019s government is requesting sacrifice from the population, but has pushed for wage increases for public servants who already enjoy job stability,\u201d said Marcos Lisboa, the president of Insper, one of Brazil\u2019s top business schools.After the move drew criticism from allies seeking to curb public spending, Mr. Temer suspended the wage increases. But some analysts still expect the plan to advance at some point because it enjoys support from many legislators in the president\u2019s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party.\u201cTo put it simply, the left failed in Brazil,\u201d said Jacques Kfouri, 62, a businessman in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cTemer is fantastic compared with the alternatives. What he needs now is for others to support him.\u201dOthers point out that Mr. Temer could get a boost in the coming months. The economy is still bad, with the authorities reporting on Wednesday that it contracted 0.6 percent from April to June. But some economists drew consolation from data that showed a rise in investments for the first time since 2013, perhaps signaling a floor to Brazil\u2019s most severe economic crisis in decades.Either way, the fate of Mr. Temer\u2019s ambitions will hinge on public sentiment and his ability to bargain with Congress. His approval ratings, which are almost as dismal as Ms. Rousseff\u2019s, have been heavily influenced by the scandals swirling around him and his party.Earlier this year, Mr. Temer was convicted of violating limits on campaign financing. In something of a paradox, he is allowed to occupy the presidency as a result of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, but the conviction against him could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years.Separately, various political figures and businessmen have tied Mr. Temer to colossal graft schemes around large public energy companies. A construction executive has testified that Mr. Temer was the beneficiary of a $300,000 bribe related to contracts at Eletronuclear, Brazil\u2019s state-controlled nuclear energy producer. Mr. Temer denies that.\u201cThe biggest problem for this administration is the absolute unpredictability of what the investigations are still going to reveal because we are far from the end of this process,\u201d said Rubens Ricupero, a retired diplomat and former finance minister.While Mr. Ricupero supported the impeachment process and considered Ms. Rousseff incompetent, he noted that new information coming out posed a risk that Mr. Temer is \u201cgoing to run all the time because most of the people who are around him, in one way or another, have been under investigation for some time.\u201dOn Wednesday, in his first televised address after the Senate\u2019s vote to oust Ms. Rousseff, Mr. Temer seemed to acknowledge the difficult road ahead, singling out the unemployment rate as an alarming problem.\u201cWe have a horizon of two years and four months,\u201d he said, referring to the time left in his current presidential term. \u201cAs of today, the demands will be much greater on this government.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Vinod Sreeharsha and Mariana Sim\u00f5es from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stakes in the Election", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySunday DialogueReaders discuss what a President Trump would mean for America\u2019s future.To the Editor:It seems that there\u2019s no end to the list of ugly words and deeds in Donald Trump\u2019s life. What\u2019s more, many are already well known, yet he is rising in the polls for reasons no one seems to fully understand. True, the growing economy has left many behind, and ISIS is still a serious threat, but why would anyone think the solution is electing a self-important fraud who knows nothing of government and boasts of a chummy relationship with a head of state who\u2019s crushed freedom in his own country?The larger concern this raises is about our own political system. If our democracy cannot deny the nation\u2019s highest office to someone so deeply bigoted, uninformed and untrustworthy as Donald Trump, could we be looking at the twilight of democracy itself? Loss of freedom in other countries began the same way, with self-absorbed leaders with similar beliefs and personality traits.It\u2019s ironic to be questioning our democracy after the highly successful two terms of our first black president and the first major-party nomination of a woman, but I have to believe that a great many voters do not appreciate how much is at stake for America\u2019s future in this election.DAVID KERNISTrumbull, Conn.The writer is a retired corporate communications executive.I share Mr. Kernis\u2019s fears about Donald Trump, but I don\u2019t think his candidacy portends the \u201ctwilight of our democracy.\u201d Mr. Trump is an affront to a great many Americans but not, obviously, to all. Be that as it may, it is the very nature of democracy that enables a candidate as grievously unqualified by experience and temperament to grab the baton and run with it. As Winston Churchill observed, democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others. The founders knew this, and established a divided government of checks and balances that for more than 200 years has withstood constitutional crises and survived: the Civil War, F.D.R.\u2019s attempted packing of the Supreme Court, Watergate, to name just a few. We have also suffered and survived a fair number of poor or disastrous presidents. This is not to underestimate the damage Mr. Trump could wreak. The choice has never before been clearer. In the end, no matter how unenthusiastic one may be about Hillary Clinton, she is the better choice. Those disappointed and disaffected by the menu offered are still obligated to come to the table and partake of what is available. The only way to keep America \u201cgreat,\u201d whatever that means, is to ensure that we do not elect Donald Trump.NICHOLAS W. PUNERWest Tisbury, Mass.I believe that many voters of all ages are asking themselves whether we are looking at the \u201ctwilight of democracy,\u201d as Mr. Kernis suggests in his thoughtful letter. Just a few short months ago, sitting with thousands of others at a Bernie Sanders rally in New Brunswick, N.J., amid chants of \u201cthis is what democracy looks like,\u201d I believed we were on the cusp of a better time in our democratic growth and maturation. Perhaps the lesson in both the Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders campaigns is that democracy remains a work in progress, a precarious and delicate work to be sure, and one that could produce a leader on the foundation of profound hatred and prejudice just as quickly as one who proffers compassion and inclusion. The future of American democracy clings less on the outcome of this election and more on the lessons we learn from the present moment.PETER SCHMIDTPhillipsburg, N.J.When historians look back on the decline of democracy in America, I suspect they will identify two contributing factors. One is the shallow and faulty information transmitted in the majority of news media. The second is citizens\u2019 lack of knowledge of American political history. Without solid factual information and lacking an education in government and history, voters cannot make sensible decisions and are easily bamboozled by demagogues \u2014 clearly the situation in America today. Democracy cannot function with an ill-informed, ignorant and politically illiterate electorate.JOSEPHINE DONOVANUrbana, Ill.The Donald Trump debacle is reminiscent of the rise of totalitarian figures, who woo the disaffected by making them think that someone is taking something away from them that is rightfully theirs and that a show of brute strength in a leader is more important than the truth of what he says. Democracy will survive in America because of the checks and balances of a strong two-party system, but the public face and the heart and soul of our nation, as perceived at home and abroad, could suffer a horrific blow if this ignorant man should reach its highest office.BERNARD LANGSNew Providence, N.J.Many reasons explain the popularity of candidates such as Donald Trump, but one that stands out is the increasing distrust we feel toward our institutions and toward one another, as well documented in recent surveys. This in turn leads to a lowered sense of community and a weakening of our democracy. The way forward, no matter who wins the election, is to rebuild trust and community feeling. This can best begin on a local level. All of us, leaders and community members alike, have a necessary role to play in creating cohesive, inclusive, sustainable and participatory local community life \u2014 which is the keystone of democratic self-rule, and of democracy itself.BILL BERKOWITZArlington, Mass.The writer, emeritus professor of psychology at University of Massachusetts Lowell, is a founding contributor to the Community Tool Box, a community building website.Thinking about what is at stake for America\u2019s future is very difficult when a citizen is preoccupied with what is at stake for his or her own future. It is debatable as to whether Donald Trump has done a service to the country by \u201cletting out the dogs,\u201d but he is forcing us to see who we really are as a nation. Actually, this election is democracy in action; now let\u2019s see if it really works.MICHAEL SCHWARTZDix Hills, N.Y.Blaming Donald Trump for the demise of the American democracy and for his own popularity seems incongruous. With our legislature composed mostly of millionaires, elected through a gerrymandered system, funded by a precious few and managed by an established elite, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters \u2014 and Bernie Sanders\u2019s \u2014 may represent a desperate last gasp to reaffirm true democracy. That being said, Mr. Trump scares the hell out of me. But he is a symptom of a failing republic, not the cause.ROBERT READ THRUNCovington, Ky.Democracy requires a well-informed and engaged citizenry to function properly. Unfortunately American voters are updated about politics and current affairs by media outlets increasingly intent on ratings and financial performance. As a result, much of the political discourse on television is little more than partisan entertainment. Ironically, some of our best political pundits are comedians. Donald Trump, the reality TV star, has taken full advantage of this media circus. Whatever you may think about Mr. Trump, you must admit he has manipulated the media masterfully. He consistently engages in outrageous behavior, which would disqualify other candidates, to obtain vast amounts of free publicity. This is not the twilight of democracy. Rather, it is the dawn of reality-show entertainment politics.JERRY WALLINGFORDSan DiegoJENNY GOLUBNew YorkIn recent memory, we survived Watergate and the re-election of George W. Bush. Our institutions are strong, and our faith in them keeps us from tearing up flagstones and throwing bombs rather than waiting for the next election cycle. Much as I abhor the notion, should Donald Trump win, we may rationally hope that in four, or at most eight, years, we will have a new president as different from him as President Obama was from George W. Bush. This dialectic process is messy, but I hope and believe that it will continue.A lot of Mr. Trump\u2019s support is anarchic, based on the notion that the status quo is so awful that any alternative, no matter how risky, is preferable. Unless pigs fly in a Trump presidency and he really grows in the job, which I do not read as a good bet, his supporters will soon learn that he has nothing to offer beyond narcissistic pomposity. They will see yesterday\u2019s bad become today\u2019s awful. There will be a big swing in the other direction toward, possibly, the next Bernie Sanders.HAROLD BROWNNew YorkWhile Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal as an agent for change explains much of his support, if his agenda becomes reality, America would fundamentally change in dangerous ways. We have seen radical change before \u2014 in Russia 100 years ago, in Germany in the 1930s and in China in the 1940s. We have also seen strongmen. They only get worse when in power. \u201cThe twilight of democracy\u201d is staring us in the face.JOE HOWELLWashingtonLike Mr. Puner and other respondents, I have strong faith in our democracy. Democracy is also \u201ca work in progress,\u201d as Mr. Schmidt says, and needs constant attention. But money talks in America, perhaps louder than ever, making it even more difficult to give ordinary Americans a voice. Electing the rich, self-indulgent Donald Trump, who has little regard for rules and regulations that don\u2019t suit him, and no regard for people who don\u2019t adore him, would be a calamity for our democracy that could take decades to repair. Mr. Puner and others say they are confident that our democracy can withstand the challenge, but the prospect of a Trump presidency, along with a compliant Congress and a Supreme Court with Trump appointees, leaves me deeply concerned. Our strong democracy notwithstanding, prudence dictates that we do all we can to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.This may also be the election that mandates a deeper understanding of the American people. Mr. Berkowitz says that the distrust we feel toward one another and toward our institutions weakens our democracy. I agree that many Americans have ceased to see our nation as one community. That is surely more difficult as America becomes more diverse, ethnically, racially and religiously. But we need to try. I believe that our Constitution points the way. We are all equal under the law. I believe that we can recover our sense of one nation indivisible if our institutions, schools, churches and others recognize their responsibility to help bring us together.

{"Headline": "How to Raise Trillions for Green Investments", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs a point of comparison, global gross domestic product in 2015 was $73 trillion. But there is no question that the world needs to ramp up its transition to a low-carbon, environmentally sustainable and resilient economy, and to do so rapidly. The question is, how do we pay for it, given the limited availability of government funding, particularly in developing countries?The answer: private financing. The good news is that there is a global abundance of private capital. To unlock these riches, governments must create conditions that encourage private investment in clean technologies and sustainable development. With smart, well-designed and coordinated policies, financing models and instruments like bonds and incentive programs, countries have the potential to solve some of the planet\u2019s most pressing environmental challenges while still maintaining economic growth.The challenge now is to build on these successes and ensure that green finance mechanisms are widely adopted so that capital markets can allocate financing to low-carbon sectors of the economy that have the potential to generate growth and jobs.For this to happen, countries will need to adopt policies that reduce the price of low-carbon investments to make them more attractive for private investors. These policies include environmental regulations to stimulate clean, sustainable development; incentives and subsidies for clean energy investments; and the pricing of carbon emissions, which can be done in a variety of ways, including emissions trading and taxes. We also need to eliminate subsidies that encourage the use and extraction of carbon-based energy like coal and oil. Such policies will take strong political will, especially as economic growth is slowing.China also has announced plans to create a nationwide carbon market in 2017 that is on track to become the largest in the world. Pilot exchanges already allow Chinese pollution emitters in several cities to trade carbon credits, earned by reducing emissions, to other companies that have been less successful in reducing their carbon discharges. In this way, China is trying to turn an environmental liability into an economic asset. If these exchanges work, they will be powerful examples for the rest of the developing world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dignity and Sadness in the Working Class", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few weeks ago I met a guy in Kentucky who\u2019d lived through every trend of deindustrializing America.He grew up about 65 years ago on a tobacco and cattle farm, but he always liked engines, so even while in high school he worked 40 hours a week in a garage. Then he went to work in a series of factories \u2014 making airplane parts, car seats, sheet metal and casings for those big air-conditioning fans you see on the top of buildings.Every few years as the economy would shift, or jobs would go to Mexico, he\u2019d get hit with a layoff. But the periods of unemployment were never longer than six months and he pieced together a career.He\u2019s in semiretirement now, but he hasn\u2019t been able to take a vacation for four years because he and his wife take care of her elderly mother, who has trouble swallowing. He\u2019s saved her life 10 times so far with the Heimlich maneuver, and they have to be nearby, in case she needs it again.His best job came in the middle of his career, when he was a supervisor at the sheet metal plant. But when the technology changed, he was no longer qualified to supervise the new workers, so they let him go.He thought he\u2019d just come in quietly on his final day, clean out his desk and sneak away.But word got out, and when he emerged from his office, box in hand, there was a double line of guys stretching all the way from his office in back, across the factory floor and out to his car in the lot. He walked down that whole double line with tears flowing, with the guys clapping and cheering as he went.We hear a lot about angry white men, but there is an honorable dignity to this guy.Some of that dignity comes from the fact that he knows how to fix things. One of the undermining conditions of the modern factory is that the workers no longer directly build the products, they just service the machines and software that do.As the sociologist Richard Sennett once put it, \u201cAs a result of working in this way, the bakers now no longer actually know how to bake bread.\u201d But this guy in Kentucky can take care of himself \u2014 redo the plumbing at home or replace the brake pads.He also had a narrative about his own life. It\u2019s not the agency narrative you often find in the professional segments of society: I found my passion and steered my own ship. It\u2019s more of a reactive, coping narrative: A lot of the big forces were outside my control, but I adjusted, made the best of what was possible within my constraints and lived up to my responsibilities.There\u2019s honor to that, too. Still, over the past many months speaking with people in these situations, I can\u2019t help feeling that society is failing them in some major way, and not just economically.There is often a sad, noncumulative pattern to working-class lives. In some professions as you get older, you rise to more responsible positions. And that was true under the old seniority-based work rules in factories.But now there is a stochastic, episodic nature to many careers. As workers get older, potential employers become more suspicious of their skills, not more confident in them. As a result, you often meet people who had been happiest at work in middle age, and then moved down to a series of positions they were overqualified for and felt diminished in.Furthermore, I often run across people who have gone back to menial work in their 60s and 70s because they just want to get out of the house. When you ask them more questions, you find that they are devoted to home and work, but that they often don\u2019t have rich connections outside these spheres.Many of their friends came through work, but those friendships tend to fade away when the job ends. There are older people who feel unneeded. There are younger people who feel lost. Somehow these longing souls never find each other.Suburbia isn\u2019t working. During the baby boom, the suburbs gave families safe places to raise their kids. But now we are in an era of an aging population, telecommuting workers and single-person households.The culture and geography of suburbia are failing to nurture webs of mutual dependence.We are animals who can\u2019t flourish unless we can\u2019t get along without one another. Yet one finds too many people thrust into lives of semi-independence.These are not the victims of postindustrial blight I\u2019m talking about; they are successful people who worked hard and built good lives but who are left nonetheless strangely isolated, in attenuated communities, and who are left radiating the residual sadness of the lonely heart.Advertisement"}

Send only the smartest, the best-connected, the richest to our shores. No losers, no freethinkers, and no ugly people, please.In the hate speech that Donald Trump gave on immigration in Phoenix on Wednesday night, he all but deported the Statue of Liberty, laying out one of the darkest visions of the American experience that any major-party nominee has ever given. Despite the media misread by some who presented the speech as a pivot, it got rave reviews from neo-Nazi and Ku Klux Klan supporters, and prompted some of Trump\u2019s few Latino advisers to resign in protest. \u201cExcellent speech,\u201d said David Duke, the former Klan leader.In Trump\u2019s America, those working in the shadows are not the lawn cutters, Sheetrock hangers, fruit pickers or nannies we see in every community, but the criminal dregs. Under his rules, this country would have closed its doors long ago to those who made the United States the great experiment, unique to the world. He would have shut off the flow of people whose best and perhaps only asset at the time was desire for a better life.So, the Kennedys from County Wexford, the family that eventually gave us the first Irish Catholic president \u2014 not worthy of entry.

Sorry, Sicilian peasants. Not many of them could pass a Trump screen for \u201cmerit, skill and proficiency.\u201d Not many of them could even read, or speak the language, let alone operate an Industrial Age machine. And what about those secret societies that many of them belonged to?The Republican nominee laid out a test for political correctness, in the most authoritarian sense of the term. \u201cI call it extreme vetting,\u201d said Trump. \u201cRight? Extreme vetting. I want extreme.\u201d What\u2019s he talking about? He said \u201can ideological certification\u201d would be required.Sorry, Albert Einstein. So, the German-born Jew knew a thing or two about physics, what with his fancy Theory of Relativity. But he had some uncertifiable political views. He could never get past Trump\u2019s extreme vetting after saying things like this: \u201cI am convinced that there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals.\u201dHe sounds like nothing but trouble. On top of that, his native country accused him of treason. There\u2019s something there, folks, something going on. You have to wonder why Einstein\u2019s property was seized and his books were burned. When Germany sends its people, it\u2019s sending the treasonous, people whose ideas don\u2019t always match ours. Get him out.That goes for Andrew Carnegie as well. What kind of man gives away all his money after making one of the great fortunes in the world? A dangerous one. Trump\u2019s political police would have turned the Scottish-born Carnegies away before they ever got anywhere near Allegheny, Pa.Andrew Carnegie\u2019s father was a loser; couldn\u2019t hold his job as a weaver.

Sure, Colin would became a four-star general and secretary of state, but the parents? Would they have been living in the South Bronx if they could show \u201can ability to be financially self-sufficient?\u201d Not so sure about that.Speaking of Caribbean, how did Alexander Hamilton get in? A lot of red flags with this character. Dubious parentage from an exotic island. An unemployed single mother who was locked up for violating the sexual standards of the day. Extreme vetting would have stopped this abandoned Hamilton kid before he got to New York and starting toying with the mechanics of nation-building.We shouldn\u2019t be fooled, as the hapless Mexican president was, as much of the political press was, by Trump\u2019s stunt this week \u2014 trying to hold his hatred back long enough to get a statesman photo op.

{"Headline": "A Russian-Iranian Axis", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 THE partial cease-fire in Syria\u2019s civil war is welcome news. But it must not be allowed to obscure a dangerous new development \u2014 the emergence from the war of a Russian-Iranian military axis that could upset hopes for stability in the Middle East, and for containing Russia\u2019s global ambitions, into the future.The extent of Russian-Iranian cooperation was signaled last month, when Russia used an Iranian air base to bomb targets in Syria. American officials dismissed the event as unsurprising and tactical, and some Iranian officials said Russia\u2019s access was for a \u201cone-time antiterrorism operation.\u201d But a spokesman for Iran\u2019s foreign ministry attached the words \u201cfor now\u201d to his announcement that the access \u201cis finished,\u201d clearly leaving room for repetition.In fact, a Russian-Iranian bond for military cooperation is rapidly forming, based on a meeting of interests between Russians competing with the West for strategic influence throughout the Middle East, and Iranian hard-liners seeking to dominate local and regional politics.In recent decades, only America and its allies had unbridled license to use a base in one Middle Eastern country to attack targets in another. Russia has now drawn a parallel with that capability, and some Iranian commanders have hinted that joint Iranian-Russian naval exercises and Russian use of Iranian naval bases in the Persian Gulf may follow.The United States and Russia are nowhere near a new Cold War. Still, America has every interest in discouraging Russia\u2019s and Iran\u2019s impulses to ally themselves in rivalry with the West. If such an alliance took the form of a military-backed common front, it would guarantee a more intractable Iran, projecting power in the Middle East even as an assertive Russia tried to restore its sway along its own rim.Russia and Iran share a resentment that America can block their expansive ambitions. So they seek each other\u2019s support. They have collaborated on managing Central Asia and the Caucasus since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. This summer, their presidents together visited Baku, Azerbaijan\u2019s capital, signaling unity in their influence in the Caucasus.During Syria's civil war, they have shared intelligence and coordinated military planning, and Russia has supplied advanced surface-to-air missiles to Iran. Shortly before Russia intervened in Syria a year ago, Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who commands the Islamic Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds force, was in Moscow. Over the past two years, American and Arab officials have told me, the Revolutionary Guards have assembled diverse Shiite fighters, from Lebanese Hezbollah members to volunteers from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, into a force of tens of thousands in Syria. They are gaining battlefield experience under Revolutionary Guards command, and can be expected to survive the civil war as a regional asset available to any new Russian-Iranian axis.To counter them, the United States has been increasing the sales of American weapons to Iran\u2019s regional rivals, led by Saudi Arabia. But this has backfired by giving Iran\u2019s hard-liners another reason to strengthen their military ties with Russia.Escalating the contest for military supremacy, however, is just one approach to strategic policy. Another is to note that far from winning in Syria, Russia and Iran are merely doubling down in a desperate effort to keep Syria\u2019s much-hated president, Bashar al-Assad, in place. As long as that war continues with no victory near for anyone, neither Iran nor Russia gets closer to the economic lift and global inclusion that both of their populations crave.That conundrum offers an opportunity for American policy. In Iran, the Revolutionary Guards and other hard-liners are not the only voices. President Hassan Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, have staked their political fortunes on reaping prosperity from a new relationship with the West, and close Russian-Iranian military cooperation could only complicate that quest. Moreover, Iran\u2019s moderate voices are wary of closely aligning with Russia. They know its imperial aggression stripped Iran of territory in the 19th century, and threatened to do so again in the 20th century. This could be a wedge between hard-liners and moderates.Fortunately, it is still early in the game. First, the United States must move more effectively to end Syria\u2019s war. The cease-fire could be useful for this, but only if American diplomats insist on using the pause to open serious discussions toward a political settlement. They also must press Iran and its Arab neighbors to curb their regional rivalries, since those tensions only push Iran into Russia\u2019s corner. Distant as those goals seem now, they might become more attainable if Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, could be persuaded that a never-ending war and growing tension with the West will keep Russia from what it really needs to do: rebuild a multidimensional economy.Similarly, to refute the logic of embracing Moscow, Iran\u2019s moderate politicians need to show Iranians economic results from the nuclear deal signed last year. So America should offer tangible economic gains in exchange for a firm Iranian commitment not to make its soil or ports available to Russia for military operations.With diplomacy again at play in Syria\u2019s civil war, it behooves America to use the economic promise of the nuclear deal to boost the position of those who see Iran\u2019s future with the West, not the Kremlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yesterday, Outraged by Apple\u2019s Tax Dodge. Today, by Its Tax Bill.", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax avoidance has become a lightning rod as the presidential campaign has taken on a strong populist cast, and leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress have demanded that companies be forced to pay their fair share. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have vowed to crack down on deals that allow companies to relocate their headquarters overseas to lower their tax bills, and the Treasury Department has made limiting international loopholes a priority.And for at least some American politicians, the anger stems from a simple calculation: The tax money that the European Union extracts from Apple should be going to the United States Treasury, not that they have figured out how to make that happen.Most lawmakers and business groups do not see it that way. They defended Apple by arguing that the European Union was overstepping its authority and reinterpreting international tax law to unfairly penalize the company. Some called it a new brand of protectionism.In Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe.The European Commission \u201cis using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view,\u201d Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend\u2019s meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies.He pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion, saying legislation that prevents companies from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the United States \u201cwill see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration.\u201dThe European Commission\u2019s ruling has even managed to forge a rare moment of agreement between the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who is likely to become the next leader of his party in the Senate.\u201cThis decision is awful,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement. \u201cSlamming a company with a giant tax bill \u2014 years after the fact \u2014 sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201dMr. Schumer said in an interview that he and Mr. Ryan had been discussing possibilities for a corporate tax overhaul for next year. He said he was optimistic about the prospect of requiring corporate money to return to the United States at a lower tax rate, with some of the proceeds being used to fund a large investment in infrastructure.The action taken by the European Union, he said, should be an impetus to get moving on such legislation.\u201cThe European Union is going to grab this money, instead of the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big signpost here for us. Let\u2019s get moving.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect our U.S. tax base. That money sitting over there should be here in the U.S., not in Ireland and not in the E.U.\u201dThe bipartisan \u201cconsensus\u201d that the corporate tax rate should be cut in exchange for loopholes closures emerged in President Obama\u2019s first term, yet Congress has not formally drafted a bill, much less voted on one. Tax experts said that without a deep cut in the tax rate, companies like Apple would be better off paying back taxes in Europe than repatriating their overseas cash.\u201cThis is not taking 13 billion euros out of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s pocket and U.S. taxpayers\u2019 pocket and putting it into Europe,\u201d said Jeffery M. Kadet, a tax lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be bringing this money back to the U.S. anyway.\u201d\u201cJust because it happens to be an American company, to say that the European Union should not take action, I think, is the height of hypocrisy,\u201d Mr. Avi-Yonah said.\u201cThe royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U.S. should be taxed in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cBut Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U.S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland.\u201dBlaming Apple and the Internal Revenue Service, he added, \u201cWhen Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them.\u201dIt remains to be seen if corporate tax reform will be a priority for the next administration, but the language used by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on the campaign trail suggests that it is a strong possibility.Mrs. Clinton has released a formal proposal to prevent so-called corporate inversions and to reward companies that keep their operations in the United States. Mr. Trump, who has called for a boycott of Apple products, has threatened to punish companies that relocate to other countries by imposing taxes on products they sell in the United States.The news that a corporate giant might have evaded billions of dollars in taxes could become another populist rallying cry.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders did so well in the campaign this year,\u201d Mr. Gascoigne, of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said. \u201cPeople are fed up with the kinds of back-room deals that are happening at the large multinational companies at the expense of the American people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Final Exam", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEARLY in 2007, Barack Obama met Hillary Clinton at a candidates forum on health care in Las Vegas in one of their first encounters on a debate-like stage, in what would become one of the longest nominating battles in presidential campaign history.When he returned to Chicago, he was glum.\u201cHillary looked like a president up there, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d he told me.As the senior strategist for Senator Obama, I spent the better part of two years thinking about how to deal with Hillary Clinton. Fluent in policy and crisp in delivery, Mrs. Clinton dished out all that Mr. Obama could handle in the 26 debates of that marathon campaign. We won the race, but she came out on top in many of those encounters, including one in New Hampshire that may have cost us a critical early primary victory.Mrs. Clinton is an accomplished debater, and there is no question that she upped my candidate\u2019s game and her own over time. But she will be facing an entirely different kind of opponent on Monday night.There is no whiff of the Oxford Union about Donald Trump. He barreled through a spate of primary debates as an improvisational performer, long on chutzpah and borscht belt put-downs but short on facts. Yet by making it to this stage, the reality show star has ridden the unconventional to the cusp of the presidency.Mr. Trump\u2019s bludgeoning style and boundless bluster have frustrated opponents, moderators and media analysts all season. But what elite commentators have dismissed as boorishness has, to many alienated voters, signified strength, authenticity and, crucially, a willingness to defy \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201dThroughout the campaign, Mr. Trump has rewritten the rules and played a game that\u2019s entirely his own. It is the key reason Monday\u2019s audience is expected to be one of the largest for any show in television history. The sheer element of unpredictability and audacity Mr. Trump brings is the attraction.It may be that he will turn in a muted performance on Monday, convinced that he needs to show presidential temperament and some mastery of substance to woo swing voters who dislike Mrs. Clinton but doubt Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for the job. If Mr. Trump chooses to ride the horse that got him here, however, Mrs. Clinton will confront a showman bent on turning the event into less of a debate and more of a spectacle.As the world knows, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief debate tactic to date is getting under the skin of his opponents by identifying perceived vulnerabilities, appending pejorative descriptors, and then making them stick.When he gleefully attacked primary opponents on the debate stage, they generally reacted in one of two ways. Some sputtered, looking as if they had been hit in the face with a pie. Others, most notably Senator Marco Rubio, responded in kind, and looked bad doing it.Mrs. Clinton, who has high unfavorable ratings of her own, will have to find the right tone if Mr. Trump fires at close range the kind of gibes he has hurled from afar at her honesty, her tenure as secretary of state, her vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq \u2014 even her treatment of her husband\u2019s infidelities and the women involved.She will be armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s own significant vulnerabilities but, in past debates, Mr. Trump generally has benefited from nasty, personal volleys with his opponents, so she will have to decide when to defend, when to attack and when to rise above.Instead of engaging Mr. Trump frontally in an ugly contest of insults, the best course for Mrs. Clinton may be to navigate around him. Even as she strikes contrasts, she should take her case directly to the camera and the American people, referring to Mr. Trump without engaging him.But what if the other Trump appears on Monday? Though it\u2019s tough for a brawler to show restraint for 90 minutes, it might make strategic sense for him to try and strike a reassuringly thoughtful and temperate pose.This version of Mr. Trump would create a different challenge for Mrs. Clinton: She cannot allow her opponent to use the campaign\u2019s largest audience to rehabilitate himself with voters who doubt his fitness for the office. She must hold him accountable for his most provocative comments and his utter lack of substance.In past debates and interviews, Mr. Trump has demonstrated an appalling, almost defiant, lack of knowledge, and these debates, with long segments devoted to specific topics, will demand depth beyond oversimplified answers. Secret plans to defeat the Islamic State, for example, will not pass muster.Mrs. Clinton cannot count on the moderators to corral Mr. Trump or perform the role of fact-checker. She will have to do this herself, choosing when and where to challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s logic and facts without belaboring the tactic or coming off as the obnoxious smartest kid in the class.One of Mr. Trump\u2019s chief assets is his self-cultivated image as a business titan. Managing the economy is one of the few categories in which he has consistently outpolled Mrs. Clinton. (Mitt Romney enjoyed this same presumption over President Obama in pre-election polling.)Mr. Trump surely will brandish his business credentials and present himself as the only \u201cjob creator\u201d on the stage. But in doing so, he will open himself up to a strong counterattack about dubious business tactics, bankruptcies and schemes like Trump University. The Clinton team will know going in that questioning Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth and business success is a hot button, the only one that seems to unsettle him.Yet if some wavering voters will be watching to see if Mr. Trump appears to be a plausible president, others will tune in to discover if Mrs. Clinton, who has struggled with questions of trustworthiness, can speak in an open and authentic way that connects with them. They will be looking for what, beyond personal ambition, motivates her and where, beyond the policies of President Obama, she aims to lead.The well-crafted Democratic convention in July, a high-water mark for Mrs. Clinton, offered a strategic road map to how best to position herself, Mr. Trump and the choice between them.If she holds true to that successful template, she will pitch herself as a champion for economic fairness and Mr. Trump as a populist poseur, whose actual practices and policies belie his claim to advocacy for working people.She will emphasize the sure-handedness and discretion needed in a commander in chief and contrast that with Mr. Trump\u2019s troubling penchant for loose talk and bellicose language.Without pretense about the challenges Americans face, she will offer a more optimistic vision of the future than Mr. Trump\u2019s relentlessly dystopian portrait of a country on the brink \u2014 the audacity of no hope. She will embrace diversity as a strength, in contrast to his past slights on immigrants, Muslims, women and people with disabilities.Finally, she will stress the need to work together to solve the nation\u2019s problems and mock Mr. Trump\u2019s oft-stated declaration that he will single-handedly cure America\u2019s ills \u2014 on Day 1. Both liberals and conservatives bridle at this autocratic vision.In the end, presidential debates are less a trial of fact than a televised final exam for the most exacting job on the planet. They offer Americans a window into how each of these candidates would deal with excruciating pressure. They are measured in revealing moments. Will the candidates react with grace, humor and unflappability, or with anger and uncertainty?Mrs. Clinton\u2019s history has been to rise to these occasions. She calmed unsettled Democrats last fall with her confident and steadfast 11-hour-long appearance before the congressional committee on Benghazi and a series of strong primary debate performances with a dogged challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders.If she can handle the asymmetric challenge of the unorthodox Mr. Trump, she will have taken a big step forward to solidifying her hold on the race, but more important, she will have shown that she can handle pretty much anything.David Axelrod, the former senior strategist for Barack Obama, is the director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago and the author of \u201cBeliever: My Forty Years in Politics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Our cities pledge to continue to stand for inclusivity, and that is why our cities support services and programs that help all residents, including our diverse immigrant communities, feel welcome, so that every resident feels part of our great cities.Investing in the integration of refugees and immigrants is not only the right thing to do, it is also the smart thing to do. Refugees and other foreign-born residents bring needed skills and enhance the vitality and growth of local economies, and their presence has long benefited our three cities.In New York, nearly half of all small-business owners are immigrants who contribute to the tax base and expand job opportunities for other New Yorkers. London recently began a publicity campaign, #LondonIsOpen, which highlights similar success stories, drawing from the three million Londoners who were born abroad and contribute to the city\u2019s creativity, vitality and entrepreneurial spirit.Our cities are also on the front lines of helping those fleeing violence or persecution connect to critical, often lifesaving, services. Paris is one of the first major municipalities to open a refugee center in the heart of the city. Beginning in October, the center will provide services and basic necessities, as well as administrative support, to 400 refugees. New York has placed city representatives in immigration court to connect the thousands of unaccompanied children from Central America seeking asylum to crucial health, education and other social services. Last year London boroughs provided support to more than 1,000 unaccompanied, asylum-seeking children, and the city is now developing new ways of working with communities to offer support to resettled refugees.We know policies that embrace diversity and promote inclusion are successful. We call on world leaders to adopt a similar welcoming and collaborative spirit on behalf of the refugees all over the world during the summit meeting this week. Our cities stand united in the call for inclusivity. It is part of who we are as citizens of diverse and thriving cities.An Op-Ed essay on Tuesday about relief for refugees included the phrase, \u201cIn our experience, militant violence is vanishingly rare.\u201d Because of a miscommunication, the phrase, which was added by an editor, was published without final approval of the authors.Bill de Blasio is the mayor of New York.

{"Headline": "Reliably Red Ohio County Finds Both Trump and Clinton Hard to Stomach", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDELAWARE, Ohio \u2014 Donald J. Trump is not popular in this prospering county north of Columbus. The Republican nominee\u2019s dystopian language does not resonate here. Signs that read \u201cNow Hiring\u201d outnumber \u201cTrump\u201d campaign placards.But many residents of this reliably Republican county, which last voted for a Democratic president in 1916, simply cannot imagine voting for Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. And that goes a long way toward explaining why she has struggled to separate herself from Mr. Trump in this bellwether state.\u201cI just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d said Anne Merrels, 48, who lives with her family in Powell, an old farming town that has sprouted a pair of farm-to-table restaurants at its crossroads.The subdivisions of southern Delaware County are a world apart from the anger and decay of Ohio\u2019s old industrial towns.Here live the beneficiaries of globalization: Ohio State University professors, software engineers and bankers who work at the hulking JPMorgan Chase building, a structure on the southern edge of the county that is as large as the Empire State Building, though considerably shorter.Delaware County\u2019s median household income in 2014 was $91,936, by far the highest in the state and almost twice the statewide median income. The county\u2019s unemployment rate was just 3.4 percent in July, compared with 4.9 percent nationwide.Just as Mr. Trump has made inroads among Ohio\u2019s blue-collar workers by promising to revive their fortunes, Democrats are hoping Mrs. Clinton can find new support among affluent and well-educated voters who are thriving in President Obama\u2019s economy and may be wary of Mr. Trump\u2019s bluster.C. J. Soliday, a 46-year-old mental health therapist, said she was trying to persuade friends to vote for Mrs. Clinton by posing a single question. \u201cPeople should ask if we\u2019re doing better than we were doing eight years ago,\u201d Ms. Soliday said. \u201cAnd the answer is yes.\u201dYet conversations with a few dozen voters here suggest that Mrs. Clinton faces considerable challenges in converting the distaste for Mr. Trump into support for her candidacy. Many of those who do not like Mr. Trump also dislike Mrs. Clinton. They are reluctant to cross party lines. And even here, there is still anxiety and pessimism about the health of the economy.There are some like James Kehoe, a 40-year-old real estate agent and registered Republican, who said he did not recognize Mr. Trump\u2019s descriptions of Ohio\u2019s economic desolation and liked the idea of showing his two daughters that a woman could be president.More common, however, are people like Ms. Merrels. She and her husband, a software engineer, went to see Mr. Trump in person this year at the convention center in Columbus. She was impressed by the long lines, but not by the speech. Mr. Trump, she said, seemed to talk mostly about polling numbers.She said she had voted for the Republican nominee in each election since 1996. She said she would not vote for Mrs. Clinton, and was concerned that voting for a third-party candidate would amount to the same thing. But she is not reconciled to voting for Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019d like someone to represent the United States who we are proud of, who we are not embarrassed by,\u201d Ms. Merrels said.Democrats remain hopeful that they can improve upon the 38 percent of local votes won by Mr. Obama in 2012. The Clinton campaign has opened an office on Delaware\u2019s main street; the Trump campaign has also rented a storefront, but there is just a cardboard cutout of the candidate in the window.Jenny L. Holland, a professor of politics at Ohio Wesleyan University, said she was watching with fascination as Democrats tried to make inroads in a place so Republican that Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, famously protested on national television in 2012 that the election should not be called for Mr. Obama until Delaware County\u2019s votes were counted.\u201cWhat do you do if the Republican candidate is unpalatable to you?\u201d asked Professor Holland, who also lives in the county. \u201cDo you just show up and not vote for president at all? Or \u2014 gasp \u2014 could there be a possibility that a Republican woman would show up and vote for Hillary Clinton? We just don\u2019t know.\u201dDelaware County was mostly farmland until a few decades ago, with a modest cluster of factories in the county seat. Roger Marksch, 67, built and fixed machines in those factories for almost 50 years before hanging up his tools last year. He watched as the factories closed or moved to Japan, China, Mexico and Finland. \u201cI got out just in time,\u201d he said with a laugh.But even as those jobs faded away, developers were replacing Delaware\u2019s soybean fields with subdivisions. Columbus was growing rapidly, fueled by a modern mix of government, education and financial services. Commuters doubled the suburban county\u2019s population from 1980 to 2000, and it is on pace to double again by 2020, easily topping 200,000.Others said they were concerned Mr. Trump was insufficiently conservative. Craig Johnson, who owns a pizzeria in the county seat, said he doubted that Mr. Trump was a Republican, but he laughed when asked if he would consider Mrs. Clinton. \u201cListen, I\u2019m a 45-year-old small-business owner in Delaware, Ohio, and I like guns, fishing and Nascar,\u201d he said.He is mulling a vote for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee.Many local Republicans are making their peace.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Ed Paxton, 51, runs a cigar shop \u2014 and business is good.For a while after the recession, regular customers who bought half a dozen cigars each week had cut back to three or four. Lately, they are buying half a dozen. He recently bought his first new vehicle since 1999, \u201cthe last time things were decent.\u201d He is not particularly moved by Mr. Trump\u2019s promises of an economic revival.But Mr. Paxton said he still planned to vote for Mr. Trump for standard Republican reasons: He wants lower taxes and less regulation. He is upset about an excise tax of 40 cents per cigar imposed in 2009 to fund a children\u2019s health insurance program, and he is upset about a ban on providing tobacco samples to his customers.Matt Lester, 37, a graphic designer, was blunt: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t my first, second, third or fourth option, but he is better than Hillary.\u201dIndeed, as in other parts of Ohio, Mrs. Clinton faces some challenges in maintaining the support of her traditional base.Shalyn Shelton, 26, has completed one and a half years of courses toward a nursing degree, but she already owes $22,000 in student debt and she cannot afford to continue. She also cannot afford to live in Delaware, where she grew up, so she recently moved with her partner to Marion, 20 miles north.And on a recent afternoon she sat outside the International Paper factory where she had worked for the last two years, because she and her co-workers have been on strike since May.The factory, which cranks out diaper boxes, egg crates and other corrugated containers, offers some of the best jobs still available in Delaware for people without college degrees. Ms. Shelton makes about $21 an hour stacking boxes. And business is booming.But International Paper wants the workers to accept more mandatory overtime rather than hire more workers. So Ms. Shelton sat among her fellow workers, holding a cardboard sign that read, \u201c84 Hours a Week = No Family! No Church!\u201d In her arms she cradled her daughter, nearly 3 months old.Mrs. Clinton has framed her presidential campaign as an effort to help people like Ms. Shelton. She has proposed making college free for people under a certain income, creating more affordable housing, strengthening collective bargaining, and improving benefits for working parents. She has won the endorsement of Ms. Shelton\u2019s union, the Teamsters.But Mrs. Clinton has not won the support of Ms. Shelton, who has not registered to vote and does not plan to do so. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about us,\u201d Ms. Shelton said of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton.A few minutes later, she opened the door at least a crack: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 if she shows up here, she would have my vote.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Following Its Country Music, Nashville May Loosen Up on Marijuana", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo perhaps it is not surprising as much as telling that this city, which residents often refer to as the Buckle of the Bible Belt, may be on the cusp of joining the long roster of American cities, including New York, that have decriminalized the stuff.On Tuesday, the Metropolitan Council, the legislative body for the consolidated city-county government here, will vote on a proposed ordinance that would give the police an alternative to criminally charging people caught with a half-ounce of marijuana or less.Under the ordinance, officers will have the discretion to forgo a misdemeanor charge for marijuana possession, and instead issue a civil citation with a $50 fine. A judge could then suspend the civil penalty if the person cited agrees to perform up to 10 hours of community service. The goal here, as elsewhere, is to keep minor drug offenders from clogging the court system, and relieving them of the stigma of a record.It is hardly a sweeping measure, and hardly the most significant American drug policy reform under consideration this year: In November, voters in five states, including California, will consider legalizing recreational marijuana, while at least three states, including Florida and Arkansas, will decide whether to legalize its medical use.But the fact that the decriminalization proposal has a good chance of passing here in Nashville \u2014 the great promulgator of heartland values in song, and home to the conservative Southern Baptist Convention \u2014 says something about the steady erosion of the fear of marijuana, which, for many here, has come to seem about as threatening as a Lady Antebellum ballad.The fear in Nashville was palpable once. In October 1980, the city\u2019s police chief, Joe Casey, declared in a front-page article in The Tennessean that marijuana caused people to rob and kill. Anyone caught growing or selling marijuana three times, Mr. Casey said, or selling it to minors once, should be executed.Asked at the time if it should be legalized, Mr. Casey replied, \u201cGod forbid.\u201dA sponsor of the proposal, Councilman Russ Pulley, is a former police officer and state trooper and retired F.B.I. agent, who chuckled when asked if he smoked marijuana himself. (He does not.) He is among many lawmakers around the country who believe that criminal justice resources should be reserved for more serious matters, and worry that criminal drug charges on the records of young people may prevent them from finding good jobs.\u201cThese kids that have made stupid mistakes \u2014 I hate to see them carry these stupid mistakes with them the rest of their lives,\u201d Mr. Pulley said.Others, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, have urged council members to approve the bill, arguing that black residents have been disproportionately arrested on charges of possession of small amounts of marijuana.For Todd Snider, a singer-songwriter here with roots in country\u2019s less commercial folk, outlaw and Americana strains \u2014 where songs about drug use have long been common \u2014 the occasional mention of marijuana smoking in mainstream country says something about where the middle of the country stands.\u201cThat\u2019s the barometer,\u201d he said of the mainstream country charts. \u201cThose guys don\u2019t say stuff that mom don\u2019t tolerate. And mom\u2019s like, \u2018Ah, pot\u2019s not so bad anymore.\u2019\u201dDoak Patton, a Nashville native and president of the Tennessee chapter of Norml, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThere used to be a terrible stigma associated with it. I think that\u2019s gone.\u201dBut Mr. Patton, a former criminal prosecutor, said that almost no one from the country music community had lent their support to his group.

If it passes, he said, police officers could play favorites, giving a civil citation to people whom they like, but slapping those they don\u2019t with a misdemeanor.\u201cMy real worry is that they pass this ordinance, and all these people in Nashville, and people who are visiting Nashville, think that it\u2019s legal,\u201d he said.But for Mr. Snider, who lives outside the city limits but still plays, records and socializes in the city, the proposal seems like a move in the right direction, especially for a city with a world-famous creative-class economy.On Thursday night, Mr. Snider, whose music straddles the line between country, folk and rock, sat in his living room with a fat green bag of marijuana on a table, occasionally packing it into a pipe and puffing as he spoke of the life of a songwriter.He described a good song as something to be caught, as if it were butterfly. Marijuana, he said, afforded people like him a wider net.

{"Headline": "Raghuram Rajan, India\u2019s Departing Central Banker, Has a New Warning", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCountries around the world, including the United States and Europe, have kept interest rates low as a way to encourage growth. But countries could become \u201ctrapped\u201d by fear that when they eventually raised rates, they \u201cwould see growth slow down,\u201d he said.Low interest rates should not be a substitute for \u201cother instruments of policy\u201d and \u201cvarious kinds of reforms\u201d that are needed to encourage growth, Mr. Rajan said in a recent interview with The New York Times. \u201cOften when monetary policy is really easy, it becomes the residual policy of choice,\u201d he said, when deeper reforms are needed.Mr. Rajan is a celebrity in a country where taxi drivers and vegetable sellers are as likely as business owners and bankers to be immersed in debate on the local economy. A blunt speaker who has laid out the case for tighter monetary policies in more than 30 public speeches over the last three years, he was called \u201cthe Ranbir Kapoor of banking,\u201d a reference to a Bollywood superstar, by one of the country\u2019s longest-running columnists.Mr. Rajan, whose term expired on Sunday, is credited with helping stabilize the Indian economy. It was fighting double-digit inflation, a weakening of its currency and a plunging stock market when he took the job in 2013.But he also leaves bruised after a barrage of public attacks from the political base of conservatives and small-business interests of India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party. They complained that he choked business by keeping interest rates high and requiring banks to clean up bad debts, which made credit expensive and hard to come by.The attacks turned vicious and personal in the weeks before Mr. Rajan announced in June that he would not continue for a second term, with a B.J.P. lawmaker declaring that Mr. Rajan was \u201cmentally not fully Indian,\u201d in part because he holds a United States green card, allowing him to work and live there. Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, later denounced the attacks, but only after Mr. Rajan said he was leaving the job.With Mr. Modi preparing for contentious local elections, some observers have said the government did not want Mr. Rajan to stay because it needed a looser monetary policy to bolster growth. India has the fastest-growing large economy in the world, at an annual rate of 7.1 percent for the most recent quarter, but that is still far slower than the rate of a decade ago and not fast enough to create jobs for the more than one million people who enter the work force each month. Mr. Modi won election in 2014 promising economic growth and jobs.Mr. Rajan, leaning back in his chair and laughing at times during the interview, disputed that claim.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s because of tight policy that the government wanted to move on,\u201d he said.He cited the government\u2019s move after he announced his departure to set a low inflation target of 4 percent for the next five years. He said his successor, Urjit Patel, a central bank deputy governor who takes over this week, played an important role in setting the country\u2019s tough inflation targets.Mr. Modi has said little in public about Mr. Rajan\u2019s departure except to defend him as \u201csomeone who loves his country\u201d and \u201cwill continue to serve it.\u201d Mr. Modi\u2019s spokesman declined in a telephone interview on Sunday to explain why Mr. Rajan was leaving, other than to say: \u201cThere is a tenure and the tenure has ended. Why should the prime minister of India even be brought into this discussion?\u201dMr. Rajan said his tight monetary policy had helped bring India\u2019s rate of inflation \u2014 currently about 6 percent \u2014 down to the upper end of the government\u2019s target range. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done exactly what was needed,\u201d he said. Mr. Rajan said the central bank should continue to prioritize low inflation.In discussing the Indian economy in the interview, Mr. Rajan offered a less-than-ringing endorsement of the government\u2019s emphasis on manufacturing in India \u2014 what the prime minister has called his Make in India campaign.Mr. Rajan said he did not support the view of critics that it was too late in world economic history for India to become a manufacturing hub. But he also said that he would not focus exclusively on manufacturing as the solution to joblessness.If India improves infrastructure and reduces government regulations, manufacturing might take off in a big way, but it \u201ccould also be services. It could be value-added agriculture also.\u201dAlthough China\u2019s economy has overshadowed India\u2019s in recent decades, Mr. Rajan said he was still a believer in democracy as the better system to create long-term growth.\u201cIndia\u2019s strengths to some extent comes also from its democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThings can get bad in India, but not beyond a certain point, because the democratic process asserts itself. And we have a change in government.\u201dMr. Rajan, who served as chief economist of the International Monetary Fund from 2003 to 2006, will return to his longtime job as a professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s business school.He grew momentarily wistful when comparing the job of central bank governor with his past positions, which were more advisory.\u201cSo better to be a doer than an adviser. Of course being an adviser sometimes has effects, important effects, but you don\u2019t see it as much immediately. Here you can see what you\u2019re doing and in the years to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton\u2019s Victory Without Breakthrough", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was one of her best moments, an understated swipe at Trump\u2019s evident lack of preparation for the responsibilities of the Oval Office, and it got to the heart of their often disjointed exchanges: Clinton was measured and assured, if a little too much of a policy wonk at times, while Trump was as erratic and peevish as he has been since the beginning of his campaign.This has worked for him up to now; it may work still in what has become a close race. A lot of Americans want change; Trump is the political upstart and Clinton the political establishment. Nothing that transpired in the debate will have altered the fact that millions of Americans want rupture not continuity, and they see in Trump the potential for a radical break from politics as usual.But if Trump\u2019s aim was to come across as presidential, in the sense of possessing judgment and some actual knowledge of issues, he failed. He ranted more than he reasoned. He repeated untruths, and he repeated himself over and over. His core supporters won\u2019t care, of course, but the undecided voters who will decide the election might.She was at her worst when she talked about how \u201cindependent experts\u201d favor her economic plans over Trump\u2019s and when, more than once, she urged viewers to go to her website for real-time fact checking of her opponent\u2019s words. People were not watching Clinton to be directed to the efforts of Clinton\u2019s staff. They know the Clinton campaign is competent.\u201cWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,\u201d Clinton said during this sharp discussion of trade, which constituted Trump\u2019s most effective moment. Clinton\u2019s reversal on the free trade that has, on balance, been good for the American economy for decades has left her vulnerable, defending positions of which she herself is unconvinced. Bernie Sanders pushed her left of her comfort zone on trade, and now she is cornered.His case to be president came down to saying it was time that the United States is run by somebody who understands money. But, even if Trump does know his way around money, an uncertain proposition, that is insufficient preparation for leading the free world.Toward the end, Trump questioned Clinton\u2019s stamina. The response was instant: \u201cWell, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u201dIt was a brilliant dismissal of Trump\u2019s nasty innuendo. In a normal campaign, it might drive home why Clinton is far better prepared to be president. But this is not a normal campaign. Clinton won Monday night, by any conventional reckoning. But whether that makes victory for her on Nov. 8 any more likely is unclear.Advertisement"}

The bottom decile actually saw an average real income gain of almost 8 percent. The median earner saw more than 5 percent. So that\u2019s good! A few more years like that and we\u2019ll be in business. Just imagine what we could be accomplishing if D.C. were churning out pro-growth reforms instead of sclerosis.But as I was saying. Financial crises tend to suppress growth for a long time, even a decade or more, but then the drought finally ends. So my prediction is that the next president will get credit for an improving economy without deserving it, and historians will continue to derive an unwarranted inference about his or her doing a good job with the economy.Over to politics. What was the biggest story?Then his campaign realized the whole thing looked so insane, they had to make it go away. But Trump still couldn\u2019t bear to admit he\u2019d been in the wrong. He created another huge lie about Hillary Clinton starting the whole thing.Sometimes I think it stems from a desire to come up with a more interesting story than everybody else. Although if the secret conspiracy involves huge election fraud, it\u2019s just a weeny, pathetic Republican political ploy.In general, they tend to be believed by people who feel powerless and resent it. They assume that powerful people have bad motives and are deliberately keeping citizens in the dark. People often say Trump used birtherism to brand Obama as an outsider. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the whole explanation. I think it was also a shrewd way to rally a movement of aggrieved citizens who felt powerless in a more general way, and assumed elites lie all the time about pretty much everything.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Crumbling Case for a Mexican Border Wall", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIs there actually a case for the Wall?Donald Trump\u2019s boast to build a \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d wall along the southern border clearly provided a lift to his candidacy, arguably delivering him the Republican presidential nomination. Along with his promise to deport millions of immigrants who are living in the United States without legal authorization, it remains the leitmotif of his campaign, despite occasional bursts of softer rhetoric.But even looking at a best-case situation, the answer is still straightforward: No. Even if you care only about the workers most hurt by new immigrant labor, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals simply aren\u2019t worth the cost.Those arriving in the 1980s and 1990s were born in the 1960s and 1970s, when Mexico\u2019s fertility rate was as high as seven children per woman. Mexico was hit by repeated macroeconomic crises. To Mexicans growing up at the time, the prospect of a job in the prosperous American economy of that era was worth braving the Arizona desert and the Border Patrol.Mexico is a different country today. It is older. Since 1970, fertility rates have declined to just above the replacement rate of 2.1. Its labor supply is growing at about the same pace as that in the United States. And though Mexico is still much poorer, it is no longer prone to crises and unemployment spikes every couple of years.\u201cThe completion of the demographic transition in most of the Western Hemisphere leaves one to wonder whether the benefits of continued U.S. enforcement spending will justify its costs,\u201d Professors Hanson and McIntosh concluded.Of course, this won\u2019t settle the argument to the satisfaction of Mr. Trump\u2019s angry base of white working-class men. And perhaps the demographic analysis has blind spots. What about unauthorized immigrants from Africa and the Middle East, where fertility rates remain high, conflicts frequent and job prospects poor?They might not be stopped with a literal wall \u2014 they are more likely to arrive legally and overstay their visa. But don\u2019t they justify spending more on immigration enforcement?I can\u2019t think of anybody among the ranks of top immigration experts who would make for a better adviser to the Trump campaign than George J. Borjas. Over a long and prolific career, Mr. Borjas, a prominent Harvard economist, has written innumerable papers and books making a case for fewer immigrants and more restrictive immigration policies.He has advocated a points system to favor more highly skilled migrants, arguing that the quality of immigrants deteriorated since national quotas were abolished in 1965. That opened the door to Mexicans and others of less schooling and skill, more likely to rely on public benefits. Perhaps most uncomfortably for those on the left, he forcefully makes the case that immigration hurts less-skilled Americans, those in most direct competition against low-wage immigrants from south of the border.But even Mr. Borjas\u2019s dire conclusions about the damage inflicted by immigration on American-born workers makes a weak case for tougher border controls.Mr. Borjas acknowledges that the immigration surge to the United States from 1990 to 2010 produced a net benefit to the economy \u2014 $50 billion a year, according to a report to be published one of these days by the National Academies of Science. Still, he notes, none of this went to workers. Workers who dropped out of high school, he states, lost big.But my argument is blunter: 3.1 percent, so what?This is not to be callous. Of course $900 makes a difference to a worker making less than $30,000 a year. Nonetheless, a pay cut of 3.1 percent for 10 percent of the American work force seems modest compared with the price tag of ramping up immigration enforcement. What\u2019s more, there are probably cheaper and more effective policies available than walls and police officers on the border.More significantly, perhaps, is the immense cost to the immigrants themselves \u2014 measured in lost opportunities to achieve a better life. This may be of no concern to Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. But it is worth pondering the cost to Mexican stability \u2014 and its knock-on effect on the United States \u2014 had Mexico suffered through the many crises of the 1980s and 1990s without the escape valve of migration.And for all Mr. Trump\u2019s charges about immigrants becoming public charges, living at taxpayers\u2019 expense, noncitizens are barred by law from most means-tested federal programs. While their children benefit from public education, most of those children are United States citizens, and their education is an investment that will pay off down the road, when they grow up to pay their share of taxes.American immigration policy over the last couple of decades may look like a mess. Still, \u201cif we could turn back the clock,\u201d Mr. Hanson said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we would have done things differently.\u201dAnd if economics teaches us anything, it is that much of the money could have been better spent on something else.Instead of a new wall, how about an expanded earned-income tax credit? Or how about more training for low-skilled workers? \u201cWhere should immigration policy be among the options to help workers with stagnant wages?\u201d Mr. Hanson asked. \u201cI think it should be pretty far down the list.\u201dFor all his skepticism about the benefits from immigration, this is something even Mr. Borjas might agree with.\u201cMaybe we have to think about immigration in broader terms,\u201d he told me. \u201cMaybe the discussion should not be just about who gets a green card but about how the benefits of immigration could be more evenly distributed. That would clarify what is at stake.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The European Union\u2019s decision takes direct aim at some of the country\u2019s generous tax policies, calling them illegal incentives in Apple\u2019s case.But it is a big payday to forgo, prompting criticism from left-wing lawmakers, government workers and even some local fans of Apple. European officials calculate that Apple\u2019s tax bill may rise to $21.3 billion when interest is included.The money would go a long way toward funding hospitals, schools and other social programs. At the height of austerity, Ireland cut government salaries by double-digit percentages, halted investment in public works and introduced a series of new taxes.In Cork, unemployment still hovers around 8 percent, or roughly the national average, after reaching highs of about 15 percent. Many young people still must emigrate in search of jobs.\u201cThat money could create at least 100,000 jobs,\u201d said Mick Barry, a Cork lawmaker from the Anti-Austerity Alliance, a small political party. \u201cIt would have a transformative effect.\u201dThis tug of war over Apple\u2019s money is part of a broader identity crisis in Ireland since the downturn.Much of the country\u2019s long-term economic growth has been tied to attracting international companies through low taxes and flexible working conditions. Almost 200,000 Irish workers, or roughly 10 percent of the total work force, are now employed by overseas companies, according to government statistics.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have a problem with government\u2019s appeal, but where were they during the financial crisis when Irish workers could have done with the same help?\u201d said Declan Connolly, 39, an information technology worker for Cork\u2019s local government.Almost a third of his colleagues have either been let go or not been replaced when they retired. Extra taxes on his income and pension have left him with roughly 10 percent less cash in his pocket.\u201cThe Irish government never did do as much for us as they are now doing for Apple,\u201d Mr. Connolly added.Cork, with a population of about 125,000, is a contradictory blend of Silicon Valley chic and Irish-style austerity.A Starbucks in a refurbished 19th-century building on the banks of the River Lee, which meanders though the city center, attracts a techie crowd of 20-something millennials, speaking languages as varied as Chinese and Czech. High-end stores like Tommy Hilfiger line the main thoroughfare, and luxury sedans carry tech and pharmaceutical executives to meetings.Yet only a few blocks away, where street stall vendors once sold fruit and vegetables, pawnshops and mostly empty casinos dot the streets. Posters at a government agency offer tips on how to deal with spiraling personal debt.A longtime port town, Cork in recent decades has made itself an attractive hub for multinationals. Companies can tap into a steady stream of graduates from the local university, along with lucrative tax breaks on any research and development carried out in the city. Rents are roughly half those in Dublin.Apple was at the leading edge of this movement, putting down roots in the early 1980s, when the company was a mere minnow in the tech world. Three decades on, Cork\u2019s suburbs are littered with newly built office parks, where glass-fronted buildings are emblazoned with logos from some of the world\u2019s largest companies, like Dell Technologies, Intel and Eli Lilly and Company.Apple, with its fortresslike compound, is one of the area\u2019s largest employers. Its army of over 5,000 workers has been a boon for the local economy, pumping in millions of dollars through income tax, rents and spending at fashionable restaurants and luxury stores.When Apple arrived, its workers mostly assembled computers and other devices. But as labor costs sent production to Asia, the company\u2019s Cork offices have now switched gears, mostly providing global customer and sales support.\u201cCork and Apple have stuck together through thick and thin,\u201d said Des Cahill, the city\u2019s mayor, who will meet company executives in San Francisco this week as part of an annual trade visit to drum up new investment. \u201cWe\u2019re like an old married couple.\u201dJust a few minutes\u2019 walk from Apple\u2019s main campus, Cork shows a different side. Austere concrete government housing stands crumbling in the late-summer sun. And social workers say many local residents stand little chance of landing well-paying jobs at Apple, mostly because of a lack of high-tech skills.For Charlie Harrington, a paramedic, the Apple tax standoff comes down to fairness.Like most people in Cork, Mr. Harrington, 53, said international companies \u2014 and the jobs they created \u2014 were more than welcome in the city. But he doesn\u2019t think tax rules are equally applied.When he recently refused to pay a new property tax, authorities took the money directly from his paycheck. If the government was so quick to penalize his small-scale tax avoidance, Mr. Harrington asked, then how could it protect Apple?\u201cIf the big guys don\u2019t pay and the government helps them, then everyone else will ask why we are paying too,\u201d he said over a cup of tea in a living room decorated with family photos. \u201cThey owe the money, so they should just pay it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It warned that expansion could slow more and said that it would maintain a program to pump more cash into the financial system to bolster the eurozone economy.\u201cWe see that our monetary policy is effective,\u201d Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, said. \u201cInterest rates have to be low today to be high tomorrow.\u201dEconomists say the bank is moving slowly because with interest rates already at record lows, traditional monetary policy is at its limits.Mr. Draghi and his colleagues have already unleashed an arsenal of unconventional tools, including:\u25a0 Negative deposit rates, which effectively require banks to pay to store cash in the central bank\u2019s vaults, giving them an added incentive to lend it out instead.\u25a0 Quantitative easing, where the central bank buys 80 billion euros, or about $90 billion, of government and corporate bonds each month in an effort to reduce market interest rates to stimulate the economy.\u25a0 Flooding banks with cheap money to encourage them to lend to individuals and businesses.Though the central bank has fallen short of its target of pushing inflation to just under 2 percent \u2014 it has been hovering at 0.2 percent for the last two months \u2014 the bank argues that its policies have averted deflation and encouraged economic growth. Its policies have also helped weaken the euro, which indirectly benefits the economy \u2014 a weaker currency typically encourages inflation and makes eurozone exports look cheaper compared with those from rival countries.\u201cThe jury is still out on whether this is effective,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING-DiBa in Frankfurt. \u201cThe E.C.B. likes to say that if they hadn\u2019t done it, the world would look much worse. I believe that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s something we can\u2019t really prove.\u201dIf more measures are needed, the central bank could move further into unconventional territory by buying stocks as well as bonds. And it could also provide \u201chelicopter money\u201d \u2014 giving cash directly to households to increase spending. But Mr. Draghi will probably need time to prepare public opinion for any such moves, and he said that neither measure was discussed at Thursday\u2019s meeting.\u201cThe economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still-subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties following the U.K. referendum outcome.\u201dMuch remains unclear about the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. Among the possible repercussions:\u25a0 Trade with Britain could be affected, depending on the terms of the final deal between London and Brussels. The fall in the value of the pound could also make British exports more competitive, while making Continental European products more expensive in Britain.\u25a0 Companies, including ones in London\u2019s prized financial services industry, could desert Britain for the Continent to ensure continued access to the eurozone market.For the moment, the central bank has not taken any direct measures to address concerns stemming from \u201cBrexit.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.\u201cIn order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level.\u201dThe unemployment rate across the eurozone stands above 10 percent. Household spending is restricted. Demand across the region is weak. And the advice from several officials, including Mr. Draghi, has been clear: Governments must spend more.The central bank\u2019s policies can create the conditions for more growth and investment, Mr. Brzeski said, \u201cbut they simply can\u2019t force people or companies to invest. That\u2019s why the discussion is gradually moving toward\u201d what role \u201cgovernments should play.\u201dThat may seem to be an unexceptional view, but it is a major departure from the consensus in a bloc dominated by Germany, which has long pushed for balanced budgets. In a sign that times may be changing, even Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, recently suggested the possibility of tax cuts after elections in autumn 2017.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s \u201cfree speech\u201d rampages (with attacks just like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education\u2019s on \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d), the Senate\u2019s lockjaw against open hearings, and market-driven entertainment that encourages real violence. Shaming undergraduates who are upset by all this and assailing deans who must cope with them have a chilling effect on \u201cno strings attached\u201d alumni generosity like Mr. Johnston\u2019s, which shielded free inquiry from donors with more mercenary and ideological agendas.A college is a civil society on training wheels. Students, away from home and in an \u201cadult\u201d society for the first time, may try out defensive ethno-racial flag waving, religious and political dogmas, athletic and fraternal self-segregation, and premature career-ladder climbing. They may scare one another a little, but they also learn to stand up for themselves.If collegiate civil societies are lurching into ditches as often now as the \u201cfree speech\u201d campaign claims, that\u2019s partly because the larger society is, too. Yes, some students are as intemperate as the Republican presidential nominee, and some deans accommodate them. Their behavior may not be your daddy\u2019s liberalism, but what their outraged critics are selling isn\u2019t his conservatism, either.An opinion essay last Sunday incorrectly described the headline and details of a video of a protester at Yale. The video was posted online by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, but the headline and details about the student were posted by The Daily Caller.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Donald Trump Set Off a Civil War Within the Right-Wing Media", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "FeatureSince the candidate clinched the nomination, the green room has become a chilly place.Supported byAlong the way, Erickson became one of the new kingmakers of the Tea Party-era G.O.P. A little-known Florida legislator and Senate hopeful named Marco Rubio reached out to him in 2009 when he was at 3 percent in the polls. A former Texas solicitor general, Ted Cruz, did the same in 2011. Rick Perry announced his 2012 presidential candidacy at Erickson\u2019s gathering. By 2015, a number of the coming cycle\u2019s aspirants \u2014 Rubio, Cruz, Perry and Bobby Jindal \u2014 had given him their personal cellphone numbers, and he had traded emails with Jeb Bush. And two months before that August\u2019s convention in Atlanta, a New York-based Republican consultant named Sam Nunberg reached out to Erickson to ask if he could accommodate one more speaker: Donald Trump.The hourlong conversation struck Erickson as pleasant but unmemorable. What did stick with him was their exchange as he was leaving Trump Tower. \u201cTrump asked me if I played golf,\u201d Erickson told me recently. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m terrible.\u2019\u2009\u201d Then, he said, Trump asked if he would be interested in coming to Trump\u2019s golf-club in West Palm Beach, Fla., to play. \u201cI\u2019m very flattered \u2014 I\u2019ve never been to West Palm Beach before,\u201d Erickson recalled. \u201cSeveral times, his office reached out. So finally I asked my wife, \u2018What do you think this is about?\u2019 She said, \u2018He wants to own your soul.\u2019 So I never went.\u201dErickson did not see much of a political future for Trump, but he imagined that he might be good for ticket sales, if nothing else, at the RedState Gathering. He informed Nunberg that Trump could have a slot on the convention\u2019s second day.Erickson dug in, writing that Trump was \u201cout of his depth\u201d and lacking in \u201ccommon decency.\u201d But he was drowned out by Trump sympathizers with even bigger audiences than his own, like The Drudge Report and the online outlet Breitbart. It was one of the first salvos in what would open up in the year that followed into a civil war within the conservative media, dividing some of the loudest voices on the right. Days earlier, Erickson had unimpeachable credentials in the conservative movement. But by crossing Trump, he was now, in the eyes of his former allies, \u201ca tool of the establishment.\u201dBut alongside the institution-builders like Buckley and Ailes, the conservative-media landscape has also produced a class of rowdy entrepreneurs who wield their influence in more personal, protean ways. The godfathers mostly came to power in the 1990s: Clinton-administration antagonists like Rush Limbaugh, who began broadcasting nationally in 1988 and became talk radio\u2019s hegemonic power in the Clinton years, and Matt Drudge, who started his pioneering Drudge Report online in 1996.If these figures defied the stuffy ceremony of the East Coast think tanks, opinion journals and bow-tied columnists who traditionally defined the conservative intelligentsia, they rarely challenged the ideological principles of conservatism as they had existed since the Reagan era: small government, low taxes, hawkish foreign policy and traditional social values. What they mostly did was provide the Republican Party with a set of exceptionally loud megaphones, which liberals have often envied and tried unsuccessfully to emulate. Conservative talk radio and Fox News now collectively reach an audience of as many as 50 million \u2014 most of them elderly white Republicans with a high likelihood of turning out in election years. And this isn\u2019t even counting the like-minded online outlets that have flourished during the Obama years, thanks to a growing internet-media economy and a presidency, particularly in the case of the Affordable Care Act, that gave conservatives common cause.Since Trump clinched the nomination, the dividing lines have become starker, the individual dilemmas more agonizing. Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, complains that among conservative commentators, Trump\u2019s message is endlessly repeated by what he derisively refers to as \u201cthe Rockettes.\u201d But Levin, too, recently announced to his listeners that he intends to vote for Trump, if only to prevent another Clinton presidency. As he put it to me, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be throwing confetti in the air if Trump wins,\u201d adding that he viewed the candidate as \u201ca liberal with some conservative viewpoints that he\u2019s not terribly reliable at sticking to.\u201dOthers \u2014 Sean Hannity, Ingraham, the former Reagan official and \u201cThe Book of Virtues\u201d author William Bennett \u2014 have thrown in for Trump with a brio that strikes some in the business as unseemly. \u201cLook, we\u2019re in the opinion business, but there\u2019s a distinction between that and being a Sean Hannity fanboy,\u201d the Milwaukee-based talk-radio host Charlie Sykes told me. \u201cIt\u2019s been genuinely stunning to watch how they\u2019ve become tools of his campaign and rationalizing everything he\u2019s done.\u201d\u201cFor 20 years I\u2019ve been saying how it\u2019s not true that talk radio is all about ratings and we don\u2019t believe what we say,\u201d he went on. \u201cThen you watch how the media types rolled over for him. Obviously Donald Trump is very good for ratings, and at some point it\u2019s hard not to conclude they decided the Trump train was the gravy train. I\u2019ve been thoroughly disillusioned, and I\u2019m not alone in that. It\u2019s like watching \u2018Invasion of the Body Snatchers\u2019: Oh, my God, they got another one!\u201dThe line struck Sykes as awfully familiar when he heard it. A month before, he had run a segment with Ann Coulter, who had just published her 11th book, an anti-immigration screed titled \u201c\u00a1Adios, America!\u201d Sykes was well aware of Coulter\u2019s views, but he was taken aback when she began a riff on Mexican rapists surging into the United States (a subject that takes up an entire chapter of \u201c\u00a1Adios, America!\u201d). \u201cI remember looking at my producer and going, \u2018Wow, this is rather extraordinary,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen Trump used that line, I instantly recognized it as Ann Coulter\u2019s.\u201dIn fact, Corey Lewandowski had reached out to Coulter for advice in the run-up to Trump\u2019s announcement speech. The address Trump delivered on June 16 bore no resemblance to his prepared text, which contained a mere two sentences about immigration. Instead, he ad-libbed what Coulter today calls \u201cthe Mexican rapist speech that won my heart.\u201d When Trump\u2019s remarks provoked fury, Lewandowski called Coulter for backup. Three days later, she went on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher\u201d and, amid shrieks of laughter from the audience, predicted that Trump was the Republican candidate most likely to win the presidency.One evening this past March, Trump received Coulter at Mar-a-Lago, his estate-turned-club in Palm Beach. Though in recent years the two had developed a rapport on Twitter, she had met him face to face only once before he declared his candidacy, a lunch date at Trump Tower in 2011. Over lunch, Trump gave Coulter the impression that he had read her books. He also gave her a few items from his wife\u2019s line of costume jewelry and told Coulter, who keeps a house in Palm Beach, that she was welcome to use the pool at Mar-a-Lago anytime.The golf resort was the chief staging ground for Trump\u2019s charm offensives against the conservative media. Many of its members have visited at Trump\u2019s invitation in recent years, joining the resident Gatsby for steak and lobster on the patio, where Trump squints and appears to listen intently while his guests dispense political wisdom \u2014 though it is never clear whether he is actually interested in it, simply flattering his guests or sizing them up. When I dined with him on the patio this spring, Trump asked me eagerly about how I liked his odds in the election. Later, on the campaign trail, I watched him solicit the same counsel from random stragglers on the rope line.Coulter, at any rate, appeared immune to the whole routine. A week earlier, Trump bragged during a Republican presidential debate in Detroit that \u201cthere\u2019s no problem\u201d with the size of his penis. On the patio, Coulter told the candidate that no one wanted to hear about his endowment. She told Lewandowski that he should buy a dozen teleprompters and put them in every room of Trump\u2019s house until he learned how to use them. Reminding Trump that she had been his earliest and most dedicated advocate, she told him: \u201cI\u2019m the only one losing money trying to put you in the White House. You\u2019re going to listen to me.\u201dThis appeal to the bottom line seemed to tweak Trump\u2019s conscience. He gave Coulter an open invitation to Mar-a-Lago, waiving the $100,000 membership fee. The following evening at the next Republican debate, he exhibited considerably more restraint, for which Coulter, with characteristic modesty, claims credit. \u201cCoulter delivers!\u201d she told me.Some of Trump\u2019s supporters within the conservative media are attracted to his actual positions on issues. One is his trade policy, on which many media personalities on the right are considerably more populist and protectionist than Republican Party leaders and Chamber of Commerce boosters. Throughout Obama\u2019s presidency, Laura Ingraham has warned of China\u2019s predations: \u201cThe trade war is on, and we\u2019re losing it,\u201d she has often said. For others, Trump\u2019s assurance that he will appoint Antonin Scalia-like conservatives to the Supreme Court is reason enough for their support.But Trump also simply fulfills the ineffable urge many have to, as Michael Needham, the chief executive of the conservative policy group Heritage Action for America, puts it, \u201cpunch Washington in the face.\u201d This is true for Coulter, who, in her newly published paean to the candidate, \u201cIn Trump We Trust,\u201d writes that Trump is fit for the presidency not in spite of his crudeness but because of it: \u201cOnly someone who brags about his airline\u2019s seatbelt buckles being made of solid gold would have the balls to do what Trump is doing.\u201dCoulter has not always gotten her way with the candidate. At Mar-a-Lago that evening in March, she lobbied unsuccessfully for him to pick as his running mate Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, who is credited with selling Mitt Romney on \u201cself-deportation.\u201d And her book tour for \u201cIn Trump We Trust\u201d hit a momentary snag when Trump told Sean Hannity that he would be open to \u201csoftening\u201d his immigration stance, though Coulter chose to believe that, as she told me, \u201cit was Hannity badgering him.\u201dSighing, she said, \u201cTrump has made my life better in so many ways.\u201dAmong the guests that evening in May was Laura Ingraham. Ingraham is of proudly working-class heritage \u2014 her mother was a waitress for almost 30 years and her father owned and operated a Coin-a-Matic carwash \u2014 and does not share Will\u2019s reverence for decorum. She was an early defender of Trump\u2019s willingness to say things \u201cno one else is saying.\u201d While interviewing Cruz on her radio show six weeks before the Wills\u2019 party, she interrupted him to mock his Harvard Law degree. Still, Cruz knew that his political future relied on conservative opinion-makers like Ingraham, and it was at his request that the Wills included her in the party.Over cocktails, the Cruzes spoke fondly of their experiences on the campaign trail, and the other guests listened politely, mindful of Cruz\u2019s recent humiliating defeat. Then midway through dinner, at a table set with glasses once used by Abraham Lincoln, Ingraham insisted that Cruz needed to throw his weight behind the man who had branded him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t endorse him, where does that leave you?\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the public and you don\u2019t have the establishment. How can you be a leader of the conservative movement?\u201dCruz amiably replied that such a decision did not have to be made right away. Others at the table joined in to defend him, but Ingraham would hear nothing of it. \u201cYou can\u2019t want Hillary Clinton elected,\u201d she goaded him.Will sat fuming silently. \u201cShe was quite animated,\u201d he would later recall. Cruz refused to offer his support to Trump that night or in the weeks to follow. Speaking at the Republican convention on July 20 moments before Cruz was to do the same, Ingraham taunted him: \u201cWe should all, even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos \u2014 and we love you, we love you \u2014 but you must honor the pledge to support Donald Trump now, tonight!\u201d The following morning on her radio show, Ingraham declared that Cruz\u2019s refusal to endorse had \u201ceffectively ended his political career.\u201dWill was no more persuaded by Ingraham than Cruz was. The first and only time Will met Trump was in March 1995, when, at Trump\u2019s invitation, he gave a speech at Mar-a-Lago. Years later on Twitter, Trump would ascribe Will\u2019s harsh view of him to Will\u2019s having \u201ctotally bombed\u201d with his performance that night. Will told me: \u201cHe started telling this story: \u2018The reason Will doesn\u2019t like me is I invited him to give a speech at Mar-a-Lago, and I knew it was going to be boring, so I waited out on the patio.\u2019 Which raises two questions. First, if he knew it was going to be that boring, why did he invite me? And second, who would be the guy with the orange hair sitting in the front row?\u201dWill said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d in 2012 that Trump was \u201ca bloviating ignoramus\u201d and he has spent much of the past year predicting the candidate\u2019s imminent political demise. \u201cI thought even an entertaining bore could be a bore after a while,\u201d he told me. By late December of last year, however, his contempt had given way to alarm. \u201cConservatives\u2019 highest priority,\u201d he wrote in a Post column, \u201cmust be to prevent Trump from winning the Republican nomination\u201d \u2014 even if it meant Hillary Clinton\u2019s election.Then on June 2, three weeks after his dinner party for Cruz, Will learned that his friend and fellow Republican Paul Ryan, the House speaker, had endorsed the nominee. Will considered the matter over martinis at home that evening. The next morning, he walked into his office and told his assistant: \u201cGo change my registration. This is not my party anymore.\u201dRecently I visited Will at his office, a three-story Georgetown brick rowhouse erected in 1811. Its walls are covered with framed photographs, several of them depicting the writer in his youth alongside Reagan and other titans of his former party. The dean of conservative pundits, now 75, wore a crisp pinstripe shirt and gray slacks, his customary owlish Mona Lisa expression a bit tighter than usual, owing to the subject matter. Will told me that he cast his first vote in 1964, for Barry Goldwater. He voted for the Republican candidate in every succeeding presidential election, until now.He seemed genuinely despondent. \u201cGiven that, could you see yourself urging your readers to vote for Hillary Clinton?\u201d I asked.Will\u2019s lips pursed slightly. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s clear from everything I\u2019ve written that I think she\u2019d be a better president. That said, I\u2019m not going to vote for her. First of all, I\u2019m a Maryland voter. She couldn\u2019t lose Maryland if she tried.\u201d\u201cThen. ...\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t decided,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can imagine \u2014 I get tons of emails: \u2018I, too, have left the Republican Party. What should I do?\u2019 Well, there are a number of legitimate options. Not voting is a legitimate expression of opinion.\u201d\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t build that wall, I\u2019m pissed,\u201d Sean Hannity told me, reflecting on the prospects of a Trump presidency in the office of his radio show in Midtown Manhattan. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t repeal Obamacare, I\u2019m gonna be pissed. If he appoints a liberal jurist to the Supreme Court, I\u2019m gonna lose my mind. And by the way: I\u2019ll be screaming. Not talking \u2014 screaming about it. But in fairness, if Trump doesn\u2019t keep his promises, you can also blame me, because I believed him.\u201dAlthough Coulter was Trump\u2019s earliest cheerleader among prominent conservative-media personalities, Hannity\u2019s stake in the election perhaps runs deepest of all, if only because of the size of his audience. He hosts the second-highest-rated show (after Limbaugh) on talk radio and the third-highest-rated program (after Bill O\u2019Reilly and Megyn Kelly) on cable news. More than 2.4 million weekly viewers and 13 million listeners have witnessed Hannity sticking his neck out on behalf of a first-time politician and sometime Republican who has voiced support for Planned Parenthood while vowing to limit America\u2019s military footprint and shred trade deals that the G.O.P. has backed for decades.Hannity\u2019s critics on the right have accused him of essentially running hourlong daily Trump infomercials. When I asked him about this, Hannity responded with a well-rehearsed litany of sins perpetrated by the Republican establishment in concert with Obama: perilously low labor participation and homeownership rates, soaring national debt, Obamacare and so on. A Clinton presidency, he warned, would be \u201cObama on steroids.\u201d These were his motivations. \u201cMy conscience is clear. And I feel like Donald Trump would be a great president.\u201dHannity told me that he had in fact never stayed at a Trump hotel property, played on a Trump golf course or visited Mar-a-Lago. \u201cI have my own place \u2014 on the other Florida coast, in Naples,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need his place. I always got the sense people were asking him for something. I don\u2019t believe in asking for free stuff.\u201dNonetheless, the two men have a mutual affinity that has spanned at least two decades. The MSNBC \u201cMorning Joe\u201d host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough theorized to me that their relationship has a psychological underpinning: \u201cDonald Trump, Sean Hannity, Bill O\u2019Reilly all share the same resentment that they will never be accepted into Manhattan\u2019s polite society no matter what they do.\u201d (Trump is from Queens; Hannity and O\u2019Reilly are from Long Island.) Trump, in a recent phone conversation, offered me a somewhat simpler explanation: \u201cSean likes having me on his show, and that has to do with ratings more than anything else.\u201dNo presidential candidate in history, Hannity told me, understands television better than Trump \u2014 \u201cnot even close.\u201d On this score, I couldn\u2019t disagree. One evening this past spring, on his plane after a campaign event in Buffalo, Trump told me that at rallies, he always made a point of finding the TV cameras at the back of the media pen and noticing whether a red light was flickering. \u201cThat means they\u2019re airing it live,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo I make sure to say something new\u201d \u2014 by which he meant newsworthy, the better to own the next news cycle.Trump was a TV star for more than a decade before he became a politician; he watches TV news incessantly and understands the medium intimately. He knows the optimal time slots on the morning shows. He stage-manages the on-set lighting. He is not only on speaking terms with every network chief executive but also knows their booking agents. He monitors the opinions of hosts and regular guests more avidly than most media critics do and works them obsessively, often directly.Scarborough told me that Trump\u2019s family \u2014 particularly Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner \u2014 sometimes asked him for advice, and more than once \u201ccalled me and asked me to get him off the ledge. I\u2019ve said, \u2018I can do that, but six hours later he\u2019s going to revert to form.\u2019 I told Jared at one point: \u2018Jared, your father-in-law listens to me more when I\u2019m attacking him on television than when I\u2019m trying to convince him to be rational for the sake of the party.\u2019 I think he\u2019s a creature of TV.\u201dTV networks, in the mainstream as well as conservative media, have profited handsomely from Trump\u2019s election-season theatrics, but some of their on-air personalities like Hannity are drawn to him for reasons apart from ratings. The prospect of getting in on the ground floor of a Trump administration that is short on policy ideas and disdainful of old Washington hands amounts to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By employing the Breitbart publisher Steve Bannon, and by including both Ingraham and Roger Ailes in his debate preparations, Trump has implicitly encouraged the conservative media to consider itself part of the campaign team.I asked Hannity if it was true that, as a Trump confidant had told me, he wished to be considered as a potential Trump White House chief of staff. \u201cThat\u2019s news to me,\u201d he insisted, adding a politician\u2019s practiced nondenial denial: \u201cI have radio and TV contracts that I will honor through December 2020.\u201d Nonetheless, Hannity\u2019s service to the Trump campaign well exceeds that of ritually bashing Clinton and giving Trump free airtime. He has offered private strategic advice to the campaign. The same Trump confidant told me of at least one instance in which Hannity drafted an unsolicited memo outlining the message Trump should offer after the Orlando nightclub shooting in June. In public, Hannity has made it his mission to warn fellow conservatives \u2014 naming names, like the columnist Jonah Goldberg and the National Review editor in chief Rich Lowry \u2014 that if they do not soon climb aboard the Trump train they will, as the hashtag threatens, #OwnIt: Clinton\u2019s picks for the Supreme Court, her response to the Islamic State, her trade deals, all of it.Hannity maintains that his scolding of Trump\u2019s conservative dissenters derives from his fear of a Clinton presidency. \u201cIt\u2019d be pretty much over,\u201d he said. Taken alone, George Will or even National Review might have little impact on Trump\u2019s standing in the race, Hannity argued, but \u201ccumulatively they do. I can look at the poll numbers. If you go back to a month ago, he was garnering 73 percent of the Republican vote. The most recent, I think he had 88 percent. He needs to get to 93.\u201d And the key to the last 5 percent might very well lie with the noisy holdouts, like Erick Erickson.The subject of the debate, inevitably, was Trump: specifically, whether evangelical Christians should support him. Being a lifelong evangelical himself, Erickson had some thoughts on the matter. Over the years, he had been condemned for his own offensive words, like the time he called the Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis \u201cAbortion Barbie.\u201d But he had recently apologized for many (though not all) of these statements and had called upon Trump to affect a similar posture of Christian humility. \u201c1 Corinthians is very explicit,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf someone holds one\u2019s self out to be a Christian and doesn\u2019t behave that way, Christians are supposed to judge him. This is a guy who\u2019s bragged about his affairs.\u201dThis was Erickson\u2019s principal argument during the debate. Trump was not merely a sinner, he said, but a gleefully unrepentant one. Erickson\u2019s debate opponent, the Christian talk-show host and fervent Trump supporter Janet Parshall, responded by reciting a litany of sinners in chief \u2014 from Thomas Jefferson with the out-of-wedlock child he fathered with a slave, to Warren G. Harding with his multiple liaisons, to Richard Nixon with his foul language memorialized on the White House tapes. \u201cWe are not electing a messiah,\u201d Parshall said. \u201cLast time I checked, he was appointed to office and he is not term-limited.\u201dErickson\u2019s debating partner, the conservative activist Bill Wichterman, argued that Trump appealed to the worst in America: His bullying, his lying and his bigotry were \u201ccorrosive to our national character.\u201d Erickson could testify to this. At one point, he was receiving as many as 300 emails a day from Trump supporters. Some of them referred to him as a \u201ccuck\u201d or \u201ccuck-servative.\u201d The word \u2014 a masculinity-insulting derivative of \u201ccuckold\u201d \u2014 was new to Erickson, as were its originators in the white-nationalist alt-right.More than one of the emails predicted that Erickson would be shot to death. At the local grocery store, a man walked up to Erickson\u2019s two young children \u201cand told them they needed to know their father was destroying this country by supporting Hillary Clinton,\u201d Erickson told me. And one evening, two people showed up on the Ericksons\u2019 doorstep to deliver a threat \u2014 Erickson would not tell me what it was \u2014 explicit enough that he later hired security guards. \u201cI\u2019ve never had Obama or Romney or McCain or Clinton supporters come to my home or send me nasty letters,\u201d he said.Did Trump beget all of this? If so, what begot Trump? Erickson argued that the fault lay with Beltway Republicans. \u201cThey\u2019ve broken so many promises,\u201d he said. \u201cThey promised to defund the president\u2019s immigration plan. They promised to defund Obamacare. They promised to fight the president on raising the debt limit. At some point, the base of the party just wants to burn the house down and start over.\u201dBut even Erickson did not seem convinced that this alone explained what he saw as a nihilistic turn among Republican voters. \u201cI do think there are a lot of people that have just concluded that this is it \u2014 that if we don\u2019t get the election right, the country\u2019s over,\u201d he said. As to where they might have gotten that idea, Erickson knew the answer. It was the apocalyptic hymn sung by talk-radio hosts like his friend and mentor Rush Limbaugh, whose show Erickson once guest-hosted, though in the time of Trump, it seemed unlikely he would receive another invitation.This February, Limbaugh, who has applauded Trump without endorsing him outright, posed to Erickson the question of whether a commentator should try to act as \u201cthe guardian of what it means to be a conservative.\u201d In effect, the legend of talk radio was laying down an unwritten commandment of the trade, which applies as well to cable TV: Do not attempt to lead your following.This was simple enough for an avowed Trump supporter like Ingraham. \u201cLaura\u2019s never missed an opportunity to build her career on the backs of others,\u201d Erickson told me. He counted Hannity as another mentor and admired his entrepreneurial cunning, saying: \u201cSean reflects his audience. He\u2019s not going to leave his audience.\u201d On his own radio show, Erickson found that the more he denounced Trump, the more female listeners he picked up. But most of the 300,000 people who tuned in weekly during rush hour were men. While Erickson refused to abandon his principles, he did not wish to go broke, either.On Sept. 20, Erickson wrote a long post for The Resurgent titled \u201cReconsidering My Opposition to Donald Trump.\u201d He made no effort to disguise his moroseness. \u201cI see the election of Hillary Clinton as the antithesis of all my values and ideas on what fosters sound civil society in this country,\u201d he wrote, and described his manifold objections to her at great length. But, he went on, \u201cI have to admit that while I may view Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign as anti-American, I view Donald Trump\u2019s campaign as un-American. ... While I see Clinton as having no virtue, I see Donald Trump corrupting the virtuous and fostering hatred, racism and dangerous strains of nationalism.\u201d The election left him adrift. \u201cI am without a candidate. I just cannot vote for either one.\u201dAnd so Erickson\u2019s conscience led him back to where he was 13 months ago. Nowadays, he told me, he was doing all he could to avoid discussing Trump and the election altogether \u2014 a tall order for a talk-radio host. Responding to my look of bewilderment, he said, \u201cWhy dwell on the train wreck?\u201dErickson believed he was not alone. \u201cPeople know where we\u2019re headed, don\u2019t like where we\u2019re headed and would rather talk about something else,\u201d he said. Erickson had won many fights. This one was the biggest yet, and he had lost. There was nothing left to do but step back from his megaphone, dwell on happier matters and wait for the next righteous cause.An article on Oct. 2 about the conservative media\u2019s reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy misstated the rank of Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show among the highest-rated cable news shows. It is the third-highest, not the second. The article also misidentified the location in Florida of Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s estate-turned-club. It is Palm Beach, not West Palm Beach. (The Trump International Golf Club is in West Palm Beach.) And the article referred incorrectly to Ann Coulter\u2019s book \u201c\u00a1Adios, America!\u201d It is her 11th book, not her 10th.Advertisement"}

Or would you prefer first dibs on tickets for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s world tour, or a private dinner cooked by a \u201cTop Chef\u201d winner?\u201cMany people have under-optimized wallets,\u201d said Matthew Goldman, the chief product officer for the credit card sites at Bankrate, which offers a variety of consumer finance comparison tools. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a really good time to be a customer, especially one with good credit. The issuers are really going after each other with lucrative deals.\u201dCash isn\u2019t as exciting as a fantasy vacation, but for most people, it is the most lucrative choice.\u201cWe haven\u2019t worked through all the details yet,\u201d said Michael Saccucci, the director of statistics for Consumer Reports, who tinkered for several years with an internal tool before releasing it to the public in June. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it more consistent, and one of my goals for future versions is to add a two-card optimization.\u201dSo, 10 months in, has he stuck with his cash card resolution?\u201cThat bonus was too big to ignore,\u201d Mr. McQuay said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it fits my long-term spending, but I think I\u2019ll spend enough to justify the card for the first year.\u201dThere is a reason so many cards focus their rewards structure on travel. It\u2019s aspirational \u2014 who doesn\u2019t like to daydream about jetting off to the tropics? \u2014 and it\u2019s cost-effective. Airline miles and similar benefits can be bought in bulk by card issuers for a fraction of their cash value.But delving into the fine print of actually redeeming all those miles and points is a quick buzz-kill, which means that many accumulate and languish, unused.The way to stretch the dollar value of your points and miles the farthest, though, is by jumping through the hoops and redeeming them for airline travel and hotel stays. For customers with a preferred airline or hotel chain, that brand\u2019s credit card is still typically the best deal, but travelers who bounce around are fueling a growing market for flexible cards with transferable perks.Dedicated points ninjas tend to juggle multiple cards to squeeze out the maximum bonus on each. Mr. Saccucci of Consumer Reports said his analysis found that average card holders could increase the yield of their rewards programs by about 30 percent by strategically using two different cards.The app is still a beta version, with some flaws, but Jonathan Hayes, the company\u2019s founder, sees a big future in helping customers treat rewards points like the currency they have become.\u201cWhen you buy stocks, you have a broker,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. \u201cPeople have a lot of points stored up in various programs, but they don\u2019t know how to get real value out of them. There\u2019s no system set up for this sector of personal finance. That\u2019s the role we hope to fill.\u201dBut if you decide to stop using an older card, it often pays off to keep it open. The age of your accounts factors into your credit score and closing older accounts takes a toll, especially if it reduces the total amount of untapped credit you have available.\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve figured out yet how to help people understand all of those options and benefits,\u201d said Mr. Goldman of Bankrate. \u201cIt\u2019s a more nuanced thing to market, but we\u2019re going to keep seeing more of them, because there\u2019s an upper limit on rewards and cash.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an outdated reference to a rewards card offered through Fidelity Investments. The current offering is the Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature card; the company no longer offers the Fidelity Investment Rewards American Express card.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justin Trudeau, Nearing a Year in Office, Tries to Recast Himself", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 The crowd was enthusiastic, and Justin Trudeau was working it. He seemed to leave no hand unshaken in the crush of the convention hall as light perspiration gathered on his forehead. Even on what could have been hostile turf, the ebullience was palpable.That\u2019s how it goes when you are a prime minister-slash-social media star on a political honeymoon \u2014 one that, far from waning, has actually seemed to intensify since Mr. Trudeau and his Liberal Party swept to power in Canada\u2019s general election last fall.After 10 months in office, though, Mr. Trudeau is signaling a shift in focus toward grasping the nettles of power as well as the laurels.Delegates in the convention hall seemed to think so, too, even though they belonged to Unifor, the country\u2019s largest private-sector trade union. Its predecessor unions helped to found the New Democratic Party, the Liberals\u2019 main rival on the center-left.\u201cI love him. He\u2019s thinking forward, always forward,\u201d said Annette Morgan, a member of a Toronto local of Unifor.\u201cAnd he\u2019s supportive of labor; he\u2019s willing to talk to us,\u201d her friend Nicole Beard added.His emphasis on consulting the public before making major decisions \u2014 in stark contrast to the Conservatives he unseated \u2014 has bought Mr. Trudeau time on some potentially thorny issues. So have the disarray and the leadership void of both main opposition parties. But that will not last forever.\u201cHe really is the one carrying everything right now,\u201d said Alex Marland, an associate professor of political science at Memorial University of Newfoundland.\u201cMy sense is that he is trying to move away from being known as the selfie prime minister,\u201d Professor Marland said. \u201cThe risk is that you become seen as nothing more than a celebrity. If people are to think of him as someone who is intelligent and thoughtful, he\u2019s going to have to keep coming up with new things.\u201dMr. Trudeau held retreats for his cabinet and his parliamentary caucus in late summer with that pivot in mind. After the cabinet retreat, where his ministers bunked down in somewhat spartan college dorms rather than at a luxury resort, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s public remarks were tinged with caution.\u201cThere are going to be difficult decisions and challenges ahead of us on everything from natural resources to investments to trade deals,\u201d he said at a news conference in Sudbury, Ontario.At the cabinet gathering, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s ministers heard from Michael Barber, who was chief adviser of Tony Blair\u2019s Delivery Unit when Mr. Blair was prime minister of Britain.\u201cIn Year 2 you really need a focus on relentless implementation, on taking some difficult decisions where you can\u2019t please all of the people all the time,\u201d Mr. Barber said.Mr. Trudeau did move swiftly on some of his promises after taking office, including taking in 25,000 Syrian refugees.But so far, \u201cit would be fair to say that the biggest change has been in tone and style of leadership\u201d rather than policy, said Nik Nanos, the chairman of Nanos Research.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s approach to government has been less secretive, less centralized and, in Mr. Nanos\u2019s view, more in line with long-held Canadian values than the approach of Stephen Harper, his Conservative predecessor. \u201cThe charm offensive continues,\u201d Mr. Nanos said.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s rising popular support may be without precedent in Canadian history, said Norman Hillmer, a professor of history and international relations at Carleton University in Ottawa. But even so, Professor Hillmer said, the prime minister may soon find himself haunted by his habit of making explicit promises \u2014 something his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, usually avoided doing when he was prime minister in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s.\u201cExpectations have been ramped up so high that disappointment is sure to come,\u201d Professor Hillmer said. \u201cMaybe now is that time; they\u2019ve picked the low-hanging fruit.\u201dAs his tenure continues, Mr. Trudeau will have to sort out some conflicting promises and deal with issues where there is no clear national consensus.He has said that climate change will be a top priority, but he has also promised to help the country\u2019s economically vital oil and gas industry \u2014 a major and growing source of carbon emissions \u2014 out of its current slump.Passions on the climate issue run high: The country\u2019s National Energy Board was forced in August to suspend hearings on a pipeline to carry oil from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to the Atlantic Ocean after a melee in Montreal in which police wrestled protesters to the ground.Relations with aboriginal Canadians, which reached a new low under the previous Conservative government, immediately improved under Mr. Trudeau. But it is probably beyond any government\u2019s power to resolve all of that community\u2019s problems and grievances in a handful of years, when some of them conflict sharply with the views of other Canadians.And while there appears to be broad public support for Mr. Trudeau\u2019s plan to revive the economy through government spending, it will be difficult to find a lasting way to revitalize key sectors, particularly manufacturing.Still, no one thinks the country will soon turn against the popular new prime minister.The government scandals that have surfaced on his watch so far have been relatively paltry, like the flap over a $400 expense claim by the health minister to pay for access to Air Canada\u2019s airport lounges.And the opposition remains in disarray and without clear leadership. Mr. Harper of the Conservatives has quit politics, and the New Democrats have rejected the leadership of Tom Mulcair. No strong candidates have emerged to succeed either of them.Before last year\u2019s election, some on the left suggested that the Liberal and New Democratic Parties should merge and fight the Tories together. Professor Marland of Memorial University said voters may have gone ahead and done the job for them: Polling data indicated that most of the Liberals\u2019 gains came at the New Democrats\u2019 expense, he said, while the core of Conservative support remained stable.\u201cIt\u2019s the N.D.P. that\u2019s really kind of fallen through the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt almost seems in some ways that Justin Trudeau has united the left.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Tom Mulcair, who led the New Democrats in the most recent general election. The party has voted to reject his leadership; he did not step down.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putin, Admired by Donald Trump, Emphasizes Strength as Virtue", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Tiger shooter, bare-chested horseman and architect of Russia\u2019s revival as a muscular global power, President Vladimir V. Putin, dressed in a somber suit and tie, sat for over an hour this past week sipping tea from a delicate porcelain cup and offering earnest advice on how to improve housing, medical care and other services in a provincial town south of here.State television broadcast the entire encounter, in between reports of Russian airstrikes in Syria ordered by Mr. Putin and gleeful accounts of how, thanks to a stunt by a pro-Putin athlete, the Russian flag appeared during the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro despite a ban on the Russian squad because of a doping scandal.It was, in the span of just a few hours, a dizzying display of the political mastery that Mr. Putin has over his country and his own image \u2014 a tough, can-do warrior; caring father of his people; and guarantor that no slight to Russia\u2019s pride will go unanswered.Mr. Putin, 63, has shown an extraordinary ability to project an image of towering strength no matter what the circumstances. When he first took power, an old schoolteacher of his in St. Petersburg, Vera Malishkina, remembered her former pupil, who is below average height, as a superb basketball player because he was \u201cvery tall.\u201dAccording to Mr. Trump, the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee, \u201cHe has been a leader far more than our leader.\u201dThe beauty of that is largely in the eye of the beholder, and is certainly lost on Mr. Putin\u2019s Russian opponents.\u201cVladimir Putin is a strong leader in the same way that arsenic is a strong drink,\u201d Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion and a fierce critic of the Russian president, said in a Facebook post. \u201cPraising a brutal K.G.B. dictator, especially as preferable to a democratically elected U.S. president, whether you like Obama or hate him, is despicable and dangerous.\u201dBut what, aside from his undeniable skill at rallying the support of the Russian public, has made Mr. Putin such a potent figure, giving him a growing band of admirers like Mr. Trump and any number of right-wing populist leaders scattered across Europe?Judged by many of the yardsticks of success he set before his first presidential race in March 2000, however, Mr. Putin has often faltered.He has cut down to size or driven into exile some of the so-called oligarchs who made billions in murky deals under President Boris N. Yeltsin in the 1990s. But far from eliminating \u201coligarchs as a class\u201d as he promised, he has created a new class of business moguls who still enjoy sweet insider deals and whose only real difference with those who thrived under Mr. Yeltsin is that they do not dare challenge the Kremlin.Mr. Putin\u2019s economic record has also been mixed to poor. The economy grew rapidly during his first two terms as president, from 2000 to 2008 \u2014 about 8 percent annually, on average, thanks largely to soaring prices for energy, of which Russia is a major exporter. But it developed none of the diversity beyond oil and gas or freedom from corruption that Mr. Putin repeatedly promised.And with oil prices now below $50 a barrel, half what they were in 2014 and far off their peak of $145 in 2008, the economy is in the doldrums. It perked up slightly in June but has declined over all by nearly 1 percent since the start of the year. That is better than the decline of 3.7 percent last year but still a threat to what had been Mr. Putin\u2019s contract with his people: rising prosperity in return for obedience.With the economy on the ropes, the Kremlin has turned increasingly to foreign affairs to keep Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity at levels that would delight any Western leader. His ratings soared after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which unleashed a wave of patriotic fervor across Russia \u2014 and caused more economic pain as the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions.The military interventions in Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad have been accompanied by a drumbeat of reports on state television celebrating Russia\u2019s role as a key power without which no military or political knot can be untied. This has reinforced his status at home, but also a deep wariness of his intentions among mainstream political leaders abroad.He has inserted Russia not only into Syria but also into the even more intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Russian diplomats working frantically to organize a meeting in Moscow between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas.Mr. Putin, he said, was \u201cincensed\u201d in 2014 when President Obama dismissed Russia as a \u201cregional power.\u201d Eager to show that Mr. Obama underestimated Russia\u2019s reach, Mr. Putin has since embarked on a whirlwind of diplomatic activity across the Middle East and in Asia, asserting Moscow\u2019s role far beyond the narrow confines of the former Soviet Union.\u201cYou can criticize Russia for anything, but if you belittle Russia, that is a crime,\u201d Mr. Trenin said.That Russia is now a power to be reckoned with is a message drummed home relentlessly on television. Under President Yeltsin, television had a wide array of state and private channels offering a cacophony of views, but now it is largely state-controlled and entirely on message with the Kremlin.\u201cWe interpret freedom of expression in different ways,\u201d Mr. Putin told three Russian journalists who were writing a book to burnish his image before the 2000 presidential election, when he was a little-known former K.G.B. officer.One of those journalists, Nataliya Gevorkyan, has since been beaten up twice by unidentified assailants in Moscow, and her old and once freewheeling newspaper, Kommersant, was taken over by a pro-Kremlin businessman. Effectively barred from publishing in Russia, she lives mostly in France.While never a fan of Mr. Putin \u2014 \u201cI was sure a guy who served in the K.G.B. should never be president\u201d \u2014 Ms. Gevorkyan granted the Russian president one indisputable asset, one that appalls Moscow intellectuals but enthralls admirers like Mr. Trump: \u201cPeople elected him.\u201d\u201cHe is popular. Maybe not 86 percent, but definitely more than 50 percent,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat is democracy. I really don\u2019t know about democracy anymore.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s ratings are certainly far higher than those of Mr. Obama, and Mr. Putin should easily win the next presidential election in 2018 if he runs. But the authorities are taking no chances. In the latest strike in a sustained campaign to shut down or at least tame alternative sources of information, Russia\u2019s Justice Ministry recently announced that it would place the Levada Center, an independent and highly respected national pollster, on its official register of organizations \u201coperating as foreign agents,\u201d a listing that the center said would cripple its work.The decision to brand the country\u2019s most reliable polling organization as an alien force followed the release of an opinion survey that showed declining support for Mr. Putin\u2019s United Russia Party ahead of elections for Parliament on Sept. 18.Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity, said Peter Kreko of the Political Capital Institute, a research group in Budapest, has made him a seductive figure for Western politicians and electors, who often pine for decisive action and a more secure world, free from the uncertainties created by immigration, insecurity and economic globalization.\u201cAll Western politicians that define themselves as out of the mainstream tend to have positive views of Russia and Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey regard the Putin regime as hyper-efficient, contrary to the hesitant democratic and sometimes incompetent and paralyzed systems in their own countries.\u201dThis efficiency, Mr. Kreko added, is mostly a myth but is widely believed. \u201cWe used to think that because of pluralist media, checks and balances, and globalization that people could not be brainwashed,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what we see in Russia and also Hungary is that people can be brainwashed.\u201dSophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.videovideoAdvertisement"}

The outcomes could shape the 2017 political map.It is worth remembering the state\u2019s crucial role in 2000. Despite all the attention to Florida, if Al Gore had taken New Hampshire \u2014 he lost by 7,000 votes \u2014 he would have won the electoral as well as the popular vote.Yet in the last six presidential races, the once reliably Republican state has voted Democratic five times; Barack Obama twice won decisively. The Democratic campaign in the state is much better organized.Five hours later, enthusiastic supporters packed a gymnasium in Laconia to hear Mr. Trump. In his fourth visit to the state since the primaries in February, he accused Mrs. Clinton of corruption and blamed her for every major failure in the Middle East, including a \u201ccentral role in unleashing ISIS.\u201d Along with forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall, he vowed to make the Middle East Gulf states pay for a refugee haven, claiming that these states would not exist \u201cfor very long\u201d without United States support. For good measure, he asserted that New Hampshire lost one in three manufacturing jobs in President Obama\u2019s economy.

But the Granite State may provide important indicators early on election night. If Mr. Trump loses the state, any path to victory will be elusive.

His wages put him solidly in the Dutch middle class: He has earned enough to buy an apartment and enjoy vacations to Spain.Lately, though, Mr. Duijzers has come to see global trade as a malevolent force. His employer \u2014 a unit of the Maersk Group, the Danish shipping conglomerate \u2014 is locked in a fiercely competitive battle around the world.He sees trucking companies replacing Dutch drivers with immigrants from Eastern Europe. He bids farewell to older co-workers reluctantly taking early retirement as robots capture their jobs. Over the last three decades, the ranks of his union have dwindled to about 7,000 members, from 25,000.\u201cMore global trade is a good thing if we get a piece of the cake,\u201d Mr. Duijzers said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the problem. We\u2019re not getting our piece of the cake.\u201dFar beyond the docks of the North Sea, such laments now resonate as the soundtrack for an increasingly vigorous rejection of free trade.For generations, libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of goods, lifting wages and amplifying growth. The powers that emerged victorious from World War II championed globalization as the antidote to future conflicts. In Asia, Europe and North America, governments of every ideological persuasion have focused on trade as their guiding economic force.But trade comes with no assurances that the spoils will be shared equitably. Across much of the industrialized world, an outsize share of the winnings have been harvested by people with advanced degrees, stock options and the need for accountants. Ordinary laborers have borne the costs and suffered from joblessness and deepening economic anxiety.These costs have proved overwhelming in communities that depend on industry for sustenance, vastly exceeding what economists anticipated. Policy makers under the thrall of neoliberal economic philosophy put stock in the notion that markets could be trusted to bolster social welfare.In doing so, they failed to plan for the trauma that has accompanied the benefits of trade. When millions of workers lost paychecks to foreign competition, they lacked government supports to cushion the blow. As a result, seething anger is upending politics in Europe and North America.\u201cThe trade policy of the European Union is paralyzed,\u201d said the Italian minister of economic development, Carlo Calenda, during a recent interview in Rome. \u201cThis is a tragic situation.\u201dThis tide of animosity may prove nearly impossible to reverse, given that technological disruption and economic upheaval are now at work in an era of scarcity. Today, many major nations are grappling with weak growth, tight credit and a gnawing sense that a lean future may persist indefinitely.The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression has left banks in Europe and the United States reluctant to lend. Real estate bonanzas from Spain to Southern California gave way to a disastrous wave of foreclosures, eliminating construction jobs. China\u2019s slowdown has diminished its appetite for raw materials, sowing unemployment from the iron ore mines of Brazil to the coal pits of Indonesia.Trade did not cause the breakdown in economic growth. Indeed, trade has helped generate what growth remains. But the pervasive stagnation has left little cover for those set back by globalization.\u201cThe debates that we are having about globalization and the adjustment cost, these are the conversations that we should have been having when we did Nafta, and when China entered the W.T.O.,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThere were people talking about these things, but they weren\u2019t taken very seriously at the time. There\u2019s a lot of policy regret.\u201d\u201cWe do need to have these trade agreements,\u201d Mr. Bown said, \u201cbut we do need to be cognizant that there are going to be losers, and we need to have policies to address them.\u201dThe extent of the damage suffered by these \u201closers\u201d has accelerated an erosion of faith in the wealth-creating powers of free trade. A profound skepticism has taken root in some of the largest trading powers, notably the United States, France, Italy and Japan.Volumes of economic data tell a different story.Lower-income households have benefited from better prices on basic goods. As imports surged, the cost of baby and toddler clothes in the United States dropped by 10 percent from 1999 to 2013, according to an analysis by Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. The price of shoes went up much more slowly than the overall cost of living.But the fear and anger over trade are well founded.Vast numbers of laborers have lost jobs as imported goods from low-wage countries arrived. Mills have closed, while strip malls fill with dollar stores and payday lenders.In the fallout, the United States maintained limits on unemployment benefits, leaving American workers vulnerable to plummeting fortunes. Social welfare systems have limited the toll in Europe, but economic growth has been weak, so jobs are scarce.American factories produced more goods last year than ever, by many indications. Yet they did so while employing about 12.3 million workers \u2014 roughly the same number as in 2009, when production was roughly three-fourths what it is today.Yet if robots are a more significant threat to paychecks, they are also harder to blame than hordes of low-wage workers in overseas factories.\u201cWe have a public policy toward trade,\u201d said Douglas A. Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a public policy on automation.\u201dWhen Michael Morrison took a job at the steel mill in the center of Granite City, Ill., in 1999, he assumed his future was ironclad.He was 38, a father with three young children.\u201cI felt like I had finally gotten into a place that was so reliable I could retire there,\u201d he said.The mill had been there \u2014 just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis \u2014 since the end of the 19th century. It had changed hands, ultimately landing in the portfolio of United States Steel. But the basics held. For those willing to sweat, the mill was a reliable means of supporting a family.Mr. Morrison began by shoveling slag out of the furnaces, working his way up to crane driver. From inside a cockpit tucked in the rafters of a cavernous building, he manned the controls, guiding a 350-ton ladle that spilled molten iron.It was a difficult job requiring finesse and perpetual focus. He was compensated accordingly, earning $24.62 an hour.He worked overtime shifts, amassing savings to send his children to college. Last year, he took home $86,000.His eldest daughter recently finished her master\u2019s in epidemiology. His son completed his sophomore year at McKendree University in nearby Lebanon.But events playing out on the other side of the world would soon upend his life.China\u2019s relentless development was turning farmland into factories, accelerated by a landmark in the history of trade: the country\u2019s inclusion in the World Trade Organization.The W.T.O. was born out of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a compact forged in 1947 that lowered barriers to international commerce in an effort to prevent a repeat of global hostilities.Most of this trade took place between wealthy countries with similar wages and labor standards. But the rollout of Nafta in the 1990s put American workers in direct competition with counterparts in Mexico, where wages were much lower and labor rights and environmental standards were minimal.A washing machine maker with factories in the United States now had a ready way to cut costs: set up a plant in Mexico.Still, Mexico \u2014 home to about 123 million people \u2014 was not big enough to refashion the terms of trade. When China joined the W.T.O. in 2001, that added a country of 1.3 billion people to the global trading system.China targeted crucial industries for domination, lavishing favored companies with sweetheart credit terms while investing aggressively in ports, highways and electrical generation. Anyone with ideas about organizing Chinese labor risked landing behind bars.In the first 13 years after China entered the W.T.O., its exports of goods swelled to nearly $2.3 trillion in 2014 from $266 billion, according to the World Bank.The beneficiaries of this surge include anyone who has bought practically anything touched by human hands \u2014 an iPhone, a car, a Christmas ornament. Corporations that used China to cut costs raised their value, enriching executives and ordinary investors.The casualties of China\u2019s exports are far fewer, but they are concentrated. The rugged country of western North Carolina suffered mass unemployment as Chinese-made wooden furniture put local plants out of business. So did glassmakers in Toledo, Ohio, and auto parts manufacturers across the Midwest.Mr. Trump vows to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. But that would very likely just shift production to other low-wage countries like Vietnam and Mexico. It would not turn the lights on at shuttered textile plants in the Carolinas. (Even if it did, robots would probably take most of the jobs.)Granite City sat smack in the middle of this gathering storm.Last fall, United States Steel began slowing production in Granite City, laying off 40 or so apprentices. As layoffs accelerated, they reached the ranks of more senior workers.Two days before Christmas, Mr. Morrison finished his shift and went into the break room. \u201cEverybody was standing there like zombies, looking at the bulletin board,\u201d he said. A list of names was tacked there, along with instructions for those workers to clean out their lockers.This is how Mr. Morrison found himself confronting a bewildering new state of affairs \u2014 joblessness.\u201cI\u2019ve worked since I was 12,\u201d he said, recalling a paper route, then a job as a cook at his brother\u2019s taco place.A blue Steelworkers union T-shirt hugs his burly frame. His calloused hands attest to years of physical labor. Suddenly, his $2,000 biweekly paycheck shrank to a $425-a-week unemployment check, plus some severance. In July, the unemployment checks stopped. He had reached the six-month limit.He interviewed for a job as a supervisor at an Amazon warehouse, but it required computer skills that he lacked. So he took a position as a \u201cfulfillment associate,\u201d working the night shift, pulling products off warehouse shelves and putting them in boxes. It paid $13 an hour \u2014 a little more than half his United States Steel wages.His first night on the job, his knees gave out. He took painkillers. The next morning he could barely stand up. He called in and said he would not be coming back. He has an interview coming up for a forklift driving position at a warehouse. It pays $12 an hour, another step down.\u201cI had to tell my son that he can\u2019t go back to McKendree for his junior year,\u201d Mr. Morrison says, straining to choke back tears. \u201cHe has to go to community college.\u201dHe swallows hard. Tears emerge from the corners of his eyes.\u201cIt just crushes you,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to go to college. I wanted my kids to succeed. When you see the disappointment in your kids\u2019 eyes. \u2026\u201dWhen Dan Simmons started working at the mill 38 years ago, talk centered on how to make steel. These days, he spends his days at a job for which he feels little prepared \u2014 de facto social worker.Mr. Simmons is the president of the Steelworkers Local 1899, which represents 1,250 workers at the Granite City plant. On a recent morning, only about 375 of his people are employed. He sits at his desk inside the brick union hall, greeting laid-off workers who arrive seeking help.One man wants guidance scanning online job listings. Another has hit a snag with his unemployment benefits.A night earlier, Mr. Simmons took a call on his cellphone from the niece of a high school classmate, a laid-off millworker. He had shot himself to death, leaving behind two children.Trade Adjustment Assistance, a government program started in 1962 and expanded significantly a dozen years later, is supposed to support workers whose jobs are casualties of overseas competition. The program pays for job training.But Mr. Simmons rolls his eyes at mention of the program. Training has almost become a joke. Skills often do not translate from old jobs to new. Many workers just draw a check while they attend training and then remain jobless.European workers have fared better. In wealthy countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, unemployment benefits, housing subsidies and government-provided health care are far more generous than in the United States.Yet in Europe, too, the impacts of trade have been uneven, in part because of the quirks of the European Union. Trade deals are cut by Brussels, setting the terms for the 28 member nations. Social programs are left to national governments.\u201cYou\u2019re pursuing trade and liberalization agreements at the E.U. level, and then leaving to the individual member countries how to deal with the damage,\u201d said Andrew Lang, a law professor at the London School of Economics.In Granite City, the damage now dominates Mr. Simmons\u2019s day.Inside the union hall, a supply cabinet has been outfitted as a food pantry. He hands out plastic bags full of canned foods \u2014 yellow corn, peas, green beans. He hands one to Mr. Morrison, who initially refuses to take it.\u201cThese are some proud steelworkers, and it\u2019s very difficult for them to do this,\u201d Mr. Simmons says. \u201cThese guys are used to making a living, and not asking for handouts.\u201dKenneth Hahn had been working at the plant for more than 40 years when he was laid off in February. He spends most of his time in his garden, tending to vegetables.His father lived on a Missouri farm without plumbing or electricity during the Great Depression.\u201cThey grew everything they needed,\u201d he said.If the mill does not start up again soon, Mr. Hahn is thinking about doing likewise.\u201cMove down to the holler,\u201d he said. \u201cI can always eat squirrel and rabbit.\u201dIn America, idled steelworkers are contemplating how to live off the land.Rotterdam has a history of looking across the water and finding things that can be turned into money.In the 16th century, it was herring. A burgeoning fleet set sail in pursuit. Merchants began salting and drying the catch in barrels for an emerging export trade. By the 17th century, local shipyards were clattering away, constructing vessels for the Dutch East India Company as it plied the spice routes to Southeast Asia.As waterways linking the port to the industrial communities of the Rhine were deepened and channelized, German automobiles and machinery began flowing through Rotterdam on the way to the rest of the planet. Offices filled with law firms, insurance agents and logistics companies.\u201cThe fortunes of this country have been built on trade,\u201d said Wouter Jacobs, a transportation economist at Erasmus University Rotterdam. \u201cIt\u2019s our lifeline.\u201dYet even here, unease has entered the conversation.Jacob van der Vis is paid to promote trade. An adviser on international business for the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce, he advertises innovations playing out at the port. He speaks of trade with China as a golden opportunity.Esso, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, the American petroleum company, has operations in the Netherlands. Suppose the government went ahead with plans to limit drilling to protect the environment?\u201cThey could sue the Dutch state,\u201d he fumed. \u201cWe are not so sure in the Netherlands whether we want to give the multinationals so much power. We are a trading country, but it\u2019s not always that trade should prevail against quality of life.\u201dOut at the docks, the longshoremen fret about robots.On a recent afternoon, the Mette Maersk, a Danish-flagged behemoth, sat tethered at APM Terminals. Some 18,000 shipping containers are stacked like children\u2019s blocks on a deck longer than three football fields, bearing auto parts, scrap metal, electronics \u2014 any conceivable thing made on one continent and sold on another.Robotic arms grip containers, lift them and deposit them on deck with thunderous rumbles. Trucks drive themselves.Yet to absorb this scene and conclude that robots are about to render humanity jobless is to miss something vital. At offices a few miles away, coders are designing the software powering the automated port system, earning wages they distribute through the economy.For the longshoremen still employed, automation has tamed their work.John Arkenbout remembers working through ceaseless wind and drizzle when he started at the port 25 years ago. He lifted huge bricks from a pile and dropped them into rope sacks that a crane operator lifted skyward. He saw three people die \u2014 one crushed by a truck, two flattened by wayward containers.Now many longshoremen sit in glass-fronted offices set back from the docks, controlling robotic arms via computer terminals.\u201cBefore, it was physically taxing,\u201d Mr. Arkenbout, 51, said. \u201cNow it\u2019s more mental.\u201dMost longshoremen earn about 50,000 euros a year, or $56,000. Mr. Arkenbout works a maximum of 40 hours a week.But he sees the robots becoming more sophisticated. He hears from union leadership that as many as 800 jobs could be eliminated by 2020.Mr. Arkenbout scoffs at the notion that automation and trade are separate. The shipping companies are deploying robots to cut costs.Trade deals, immigrant labor, automation: As Mr. Arkenbout sees it, these are all just instruments wielded in pursuit of the same goal \u2014 paying him less so corporations can keep more.\u201cWhen they don\u2019t need me anymore,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m nothing.\u201dAn earlier version of a chart with this article mislabeled a point on the horizontal axis. The final point in a series marking five-year spans should have been labeled \u201915, not \u201905.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Bad Off Is Oil-Rich Venezuela? It\u2019s Buying U.S. Oil", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo add insult to injury, the Venezuelan government has been forced to turn to its nemesis, the United States, for help.\u201cYou call them the empire,\u201d said Luis Centeno, a union leader for the oil workers, referring to what government officials call the United States, \u201cand yet you\u2019re buying their oil.\u201dBut those profits have evaporated with mismanagement and the drop in global oil prices over the past two years. Now, even Venezuela\u2019s subsidized oil shipments to its vital ally Cuba are slowly being phased out, oil executives with operations in Venezuela contend, forcing Havana to look to Russia for cheap oil.The United States has always been a huge market for Venezuela\u2019s oil. But with Venezuela\u2019s state oil company hobbling along, it was actually forced to start importing oil from the United States.Early this year, the United States began shipping more than 50,000 barrels a day of the light crude that Venezuela needs to prepare its own oil for export, joining a handful of suppliers that have become vital to keeping the country\u2019s oil industry afloat.Even that lifeline is tenuous. Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, PDVSA, is struggling to pay for the foreign oil. Some tankers wait in port for as long as two weeks to be paid, and sometimes they leave because of a lack of payment, said an oil executive who requested anonymity to avoid reprisals from the government.The problems are just some of the reasons Venezuela\u2019s oil production has plummeted to 2.4 million barrels a day, down 350,000 barrels from a year ago. That is nearly a million barrels below what it was in 1998 when Mr. Ch\u00e1vez took power.Venezuela is racked by shortages of foods like corn and rice, which it once easily imported using the company\u2019s vast foreign currency revenues. Essential medicines like antibiotics have disappeared. The economy is set to contract by 10 percent by the end of the year and has already seen triple-digit inflation.The price of bread alone has doubled from month to month, now about 50 cents a loaf in many places, at a time when the oil workers here say they are making less than a dollar a day because of the inflation.\u201cWe are practically working for free,\u201d said Pedro Vel\u00e1squez, a supervisor at an oil field in the town of Punta de Mata.Whatever money the government can muster to improvise patchwork repairs in its oil fields and processing plants is now drying up.With the state oil company hobbled by debts, two-thirds of its exports go to paying off Chinese and other lenders. The company is running out of resources to pay international technicians, or even its own people.\u201cThe decline is speeding up, and that will continue to happen,\u201d said Lisa Viscidi, a Latin America energy expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington research institute. \u201cConditions are getting worse and worse; there\u2019s less and less money to invest.\u201dThe condition of Venezuela\u2019s state oil company has international oil traders concerned that its collapse could jolt an otherwise oversupplied global market. They note that when labor strife brought nearly all production in Venezuela to a halt for several weeks at the end of 2002 and in early 2003, global prices jumped more than 30 percent, marking the first in a series of international crises that ushered in a decade of climbing oil prices.Venezuela accounts for less of the international oil market today, but its exports still make up roughly 2 percent of the world\u2019s output. That means that a serious decline in Venezuelan exports, especially if accompanied by a crisis in Nigeria or Iraq, could tighten the market enough to send oil prices climbing again.\u201cA collapse in Venezuela would be an accelerator for oil prices; it would be a total shock,\u201d said Helima Croft, the chief commodity strategist for Royal Bank of Canada. \u201cThis country is literally imploding.\u201dRight now, she added, \u201cThere is no oil producer that is falling apart as fast as or as dramatically as Venezuela.\u201dNeither PDVSA nor its American subsidiary Citgo agreed to requests for interviews.The challenges ahead are ever-present here in the vast oil fields of El Furrial, in northeastern Venezuela. Beneath the flat, grassy expanses lies the very grade of oil that Venezuela must now import to blend with its large reserves of heavy oil to ship them abroad.At its peak, El Furrial alone produced 453,000 barrels a day, equivalent to about 80 percent of the national production of Ecuador. But in 2009, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez nationalized Wilpro, an American consortium that handled the complex natural gas injection at the site designed to coax more oil out of the ground. Production has declined by more than half.Workers at El Furrial today tell a story of decline and mismanagement. There is not even enough drilling mud \u2014 the most basic fluid required to keep drill bits cool and well bores clear \u2014 to keep all of the rigs running.At one PDVSA well pad here, China National Petroleum Corporation now fills the gap left by Wilpro. But the site had not been operating for several weeks because PDVSA had not delivered a vital piece of equipment that suspends tubing over the well.Once completed, the well might produce 3,500 barrels of oil per day, but it was not clear when that would be.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever gone three weeks waiting this way,\u201d said Nelson Ruiz, a manager. \u201cNormally we would get the project going after one signature, and the drill would be in the ground.\u201dBut it is the issue of food that is demoralizing the workers the most.Workers at one production site described how they eat so little food now, they watch out for their co-workers in case they faint. Claudio Lezama, who has spent the past eight years at the site, said he weighed about 200 pounds several years ago. Between his manual labor and being able to afford only one meal a day, he is now 145 pounds.Sitting in a trailer where workers take their breaks, he said that he worked as a stone mason to afford to feed himself during his time off. A colleague said she had taken to reselling food like yucca, cheese and eggs.\u201cYou\u2019re a black-market seller,\u201d Mr. Lezama said, chiding her for raising prices when food was in short supply in Venezuela.In a complaint filed in July by a group of workers at the state oil company, the workers detailed a history of extensive petroleum leaks since 2012 in El Furrial stemming from lack of maintenance and costly infrastructure that was left abandoned.The complaint said the problems also posed a health risk for surrounding communities.\u201cAll this has been hidden from view, generating multimillion-dollar losses,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cWe workers are extremely angry because no one has done anything to put a stop to this disaster.\u201dThese days, some oil workers fear that simply going to work puts them at risk. Carlos Robles, a union leader, spent a recent afternoon talking to supervisors of a well about a number of attacks by armed gangs who robbed that facility and others of laptops, air-conditioning units and metal equipment.It was getting to be 6 p.m., the time that workers warned that the gangs begin to prowl; the streets of El Furrial were empty, looking as if a curfew were in place.\u201cThe only thing between us and being robbed is God and the Virgin,\u201d said Juan D\u00edaz, a supervisor at the site, as his shift continued into the night.International service companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger are scaling back their operations as Venezuela\u2019s state oil company struggles to pay its debts to them \u2014 as much as $25 billion \u2014 with a flurry of bonds and promissory notes.And as the production from El Furrial and other fields plummets, the state oil company has to lean ever more heavily on Citgo, which is being forced to leverage to the hilt.Last year, Citgo borrowed $2.5 billion to keep PDVSA afloat. And now it plans to borrow an additional $800 million to update a refinery on the island of Aruba to produce synthetic light oil, according to executives who have been briefed on the plans.Mr. Centeno, the union leader, said Venezuela\u2019s state oil company had become so strapped that it had stopped providing its workers with new boots, helmets and gloves.\u201cPDVSA is on the floor now,\u201d he said.Nicholas Casey reported from El Furrial, and Clifford Krauss from Houston. Jesymar A\u00f1ez contributed reporting from El Furrial, and Patricia Torres from Caracas, Venezuela.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With U.S. Election in Sight, Ban Ki-moon Seeks Quick Action on Climate Accord", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Ban\u2019s push to nail down the legal commitments of at least 55 countries to the global agreement comes as Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who has called climate change a hoax, rises in the polls. Should Mr. Trump become president before the Paris pact enters into force, he could make good on his vow to withdraw the United States from the agreement \u2014 even if President Obama has signed on to it. The absence of the world\u2019s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas polluter would cripple the first accord binding nearly every country to actions that would reduce planet-warming pollution.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount at stake in whether the United States is in the agreement or not,\u201d said Robert C. Orr, dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and a special adviser to Mr. Ban. A withdrawal by the United States would \u201ccreate a global diplomatic crisis,\u201d he said.Experts in international law said they could not think of an example of a major United Nations agreement entering into legal force less than a year after it was finalized. The Paris deal was reached in December. At the time, the diplomats who forged the deal said that their goal was for it to enter into force by 2020.But Mr. Ban has planned a ceremony at the United Nations on Sept. 21, when he hopes to announce that enough countries have ratified the deal, or pledged to ratify it, to ensure it will enter into force before the inauguration of the next American president. To do that, he would need at least 55 countries representing 55 percent of climate-change emissions.\u201cThis would be entry into force in a lightning-quick way, if it happens,\u201d said David Waskow, an expert in climate change diplomacy at the World Resources Institute, a Washington research organization.Once the requisite signatures are secured, each country will be legally bound to the deal for at least four years \u2014 even if the country\u2019s government does not participate in the accord. That would be enough to keep the United States legally bound to the Paris deal through the first term of a Trump presidency.But it is far from certain that Mr. Ban can get enough countries to add up to the 55 percent threshold. No other countries have close to as many carbon emissions as China or the United States. The world\u2019s third-largest carbon polluter, India, which emits about 7 percent of the world\u2019s emissions, has been unclear about its plans to sign on. Although India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, emerged as a key broker of the Paris agreement, many members of his government remain wary of taking the final steps to clinch the deal.Rajendra M. Abhyankar, a former Indian minister of foreign affairs who is now a professor at Indiana University, said, \u201cWhile many in our government want to go forward with the terms of the agreement, there is still a feeling that ratifying the agreement would be tying our hands in terms of what we can do economically.\u201d\u201cAnd from an international point of view, the sense is, why should we sign on if the United States might one day drop out?\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States has signed on for now, but what will happen once Trump comes?\u201dAnother question mark is the European Union, whose 28 member countries together account for about 10 percent of global emissions. Under the Paris agreement, the union has pledged to collectively reduce its emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. But the union cannot legally ratify that pledge until all 28 countries have separately ratified it in their own parliaments, a process that could take years. The British vote to leave the European Union could further complicate that process.Within the union, advocates of the Paris deal who fear a Trump presidency have pushed for new legislation that would allow the body to quickly ratify the Paris deal with executive authority \u2014 or would allow individual countries to ratify it separately from the union. But those proposals are already creating political rifts within the European body.In the face of such difficulties, Mr. Ban has redoubled his diplomatic efforts. In recent weeks, he has met with or telephoned dozens of world leaders, including Mr. Modi, to urge them to complete their ratification of the Paris deal by Sept. 21. At the Chinese summit meeting of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies this month, he pressed the issue with every world leader present, according to aides.He is seeing some success. On Monday, Brazil, which emits about 2 percent of global emissions, announced that it had completed its domestic ratification of the Paris deal. That came as a surprise to many, since Brazil\u2019s climate pledge had been a signature policy of Dilma Rousseff, the country\u2019s recently impeached president.The governments of Canada, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa, which together represent about 5 percent of global emissions, have said they expect to complete or pledge to complete their ratifications this month.The government of Japan, which emits about 3 percent of global emissions, is expected to take up its Paris ratification in a special parliamentary session this fall.Still, global climate policy advocates are preparing to move forward without the United States if necessary. \u201cFrom the outside, from Europe, when you hear what Donald Trump says, it is somewhat difficult to take seriously,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, the French climate change envoy. \u201cBut even without the United States, the agreement will eventually enter into force.\u201dThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Is Europe\u2019s Moral Authority?", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Democracies may be destined to dislike one another. When people have a decisive voice in government, they are guided by self-interest, and put their short-term concerns before those of neighbors or partners. In an effort to channel this endless ebb and flow of passions, institutions provide a framework of \u201crights\u201d and \u201cwrongs,\u201d and governments function by persuading the greatest number of voters that they are doing the \u201cright\u201d thing.What happens, however, when leaders are unable or unwilling to turn the tide of nationalism, xenophobia and self-interest?In many liberal democracies, the network of systems that maintained stability and promoted prosperity (nationally and internationally) appears to be disintegrating. When people cannot be assured of continued prosperity, when they face mass immigration and the threat of terrorism, the pull of populism \u2014 with its simple messages of who is to blame and what is to be done \u2014 is strong. When leaders cannot (or will not) persuade citizens that their long-term interest lies in dialogue and consensus with other groups and nations, politicians find it even more difficult to do the right thing; they may be carried away by the forces that divide society into ever smaller self-interested groups.Today the sources of that support are themselves under threat, none more so than the European Union. Economic difficulties and immigration are dividing nations, and pitting them against one another. Greece needs a reduction of its enormous public debt in order to function, but governments in creditor countries do not dare propose this to their voters. France and Italy are in favor of looser fiscal rules, which Germany refuses. Ad hoc alliances of \u201cNorthern\u201d and \u201cSouthern\u201d countries line up against one another. In several countries, hard-line nationalists openly challenge European Union principles of liberal democracy and solidarity \u2014 questioning even membership in the union.When battle lines over different issues are drawn across the Continent, alliances will shift continually, and consensus will become even more difficult. If no single, unifying policy can be adopted on a given issue, divisions will deepen. Then only outside intervention can break the deadlock. This is what the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan achieved after the carnage of World War II, allowing Europe\u2019s nations to move toward democracy, open economies and, eventually, the European Union.Today the United States is neither interested in nor capable of promoting anything equivalent to this. And Europe already has the benefits of liberal democracy and of a unification process that provided decades of peace and prosperity. Yet its nations still cannot agree on common policies that will control debt and promote growth; they are still wary of ceding enough sovereignty to solidify what is, in effect, still one of the world\u2019s largest economies. The European Union was created to prevent a slide back into the Europe of the 1930s, when the democracies that had won World War I undermined one another in a climate of economic instability while autocratic rivals prepared for what became the greatest slaughter humanity has known.She needs that trust to be a voice of moral authority in Europe. It is crucial that she balance humanism on the refugee issue with a reassessment of her country\u2019s priorities on economic issues, allowing closer economic union and promoting growth. Other leaders must be just as brave, working to persuade voters that the security and prosperity of each nation can be achieved only through collective action, not division.Europe\u2019s nations have a duty to confirm democracy\u2019s resilience under pressure. The future of the union \u2014 the future of Europe \u2014 depends on this.Nikos Konstandaras is the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump? How Could We?", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy reaction to the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton debate can be summarized with one word: \u201cHow?\u201dHow in the world do we put a man in the Oval Office who thinks NATO is a shopping mall where the tenants aren\u2019t paying enough rent to the U.S. landlord?NATO is not a shopping mall; it is a strategic alliance that won the Cold War, keeps Europe a stable trading partner for U.S. companies and prevents every European country \u2014 particularly Germany \u2014 from getting their own nukes to counterbalance Russia, by sheltering them all under America\u2019s nuclear umbrella.How do we put in the Oval Office a man who does not know enough \u201cbeef\u201d about key policies to finish a two-minute answer on any issue without the hamburger helper of bluster, insults and repetition?How do we put in the Oval Office a man who boasts that he tries to pay zero federal taxes but then complains that our airports and roads are falling apart and there is not enough money for our veterans?How do we put in the Oval Office a man who claims he was against the Iraq war, because he said he privately told that to his pal Sean Hannity of Fox News \u2014 even though he publicly supported the war when it began. Trump is so obsessed with proving his infallibility that he missed scoring an easy debate point for himself by saying, \u201cYes, I supported the Iraq war as a citizen, but Hillary voted for it as a senator when she had access to the intelligence and her job was to make the right judgment.\u201dHow do we put in the Oval Office someone who says we should not have gone into Iraq, but since we did, \u201cwe should have taken the oil \u2014 ISIS would not have been able to form \u2026 because the oil was their primary source of income.\u201dISIS formed before it managed to pump any oil, and it sustained itself with millions of dollars that it stole from Iraq\u2019s central bank in Mosul. Meanwhile, Iraq has the world\u2019s fifth-largest oil reserves \u2014 140 billion barrels. Can you imagine how many years we\u2019d have to stay there to pump it all and how much doing so would tarnish our moral standing around the world and energize every jihadist?How do we put in the Oval Office someone whose campaign manager has to go on every morning show after the debate and lie to try to make up for the nonsense her boss spouted? Kellyanne Conway told CNN on Tuesday morning that when it comes to climate change, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what Hillary Clinton believes, because nobody ever asks her.\u201dSay what? As secretary of state, Clinton backed every global climate negotiation and clean energy initiative. That\u2019s like saying no one knows Hillary\u2019s position on women\u2019s rights.Conway then went on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d and argued that Clinton, who was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, had never created a job and was partly responsible for the lack of adequate \u201croads and bridges\u201d in our country. When challenged on that by MGM Resorts\u2019s C.E.O., James Murren \u2014 who argued that his business was up, that the economy was improving and that Clinton\u2019s job as secretary of state was to create stability \u2014 Conway responded that Clinton had nothing to do with any improvements in the economy because \u201cshe\u2019s never been president so she\u2019s created no financial stability.\u201dI see: Everything wrong is Clinton\u2019s fault and anything good is to the president\u2019s credit alone. Silly.The \u201cSquawk Box\u201d segment was devoted to the fact that while Trump claims that he will get the economy growing, very few C.E.O.s of major U.S. companies are supporting him. Also, interesting how positively the stock market reacted to Trump\u2019s debate defeat. Maybe because C.E.O.s and investors know that Trump and Conway are con artists and that recent statistics show income gaps are actually narrowing, wages are rising and poverty is easing.The Trump-Conway shtick is to trash the country so they can make us great again. Fact: We have problems and not everyone is enjoying the fruits of our economy, but if you want to be an optimist about America, stand on your head \u2014 the country looks so much better from the bottom up. What you see are towns and regions not waiting for Washington, D.C., but coming together themselves to fix infrastructure, education and governance. I see it everywhere I go.I am not enamored of Clinton\u2019s stale, liberal, centralized view of politics, but she is sane and responsible; she\u2019ll do her homework, can grow in the job, and might even work well with Republicans, as she did as a senator.Trump promises change, but change that comes from someone who thinks people who pay taxes are suckers and who thinks he can show up before an audience of 100 million without preparation or real plans and talk about serious issues with no more sophistication than your crazy uncle \u2014 and expect to get away with it \u2014 is change the country can\u2019t afford.Electing such a man would be insanity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Refugees in Lebanon, Cash Instead of Camps", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesDoes 10,000 seem a lot?Consider Lebanon, a country of 4.5 million people that has taken in probably close to 1.5 million Syrians fleeing their civil war. At equivalent levels, the United States would have 107 million Syrian refugees by now.I am not arguing that the United States should take in millions of Syrians. But Americans should appreciate that Lebanon is doing them and Europe a huge favor.And at great cost. Lebanon is not a prosperous country. The economy is weak and its democracy is battered by destructive religious divisions, complicated by outside intervention \u2014 Syrian troops occupied the country from 1976 to 2005. There has been no president for two years.Lebanon, of course, is also home to half a million Palestinians, some of them residents of refugee camps for 60 years. Largely for that reason, Lebanon has not permitted the building of camps for the Syrians.Instead, they live in limbo.Until January 2015, Lebanon\u2019s border with Syria was open. Now it is closed and the country has set rules that make life much harder for the refugees who are there. Perhaps 70 percent of Syrian refugees do not have legal residency, which can also mean they can\u2019t get work, shelter, education or health care, according to Human Rights Watch.That leaves them open to all kinds of exploitation. Syrians do off-the-books jobs for a pittance. Their children sell candy on the street. They squat in abandoned buildings with no water or electricity, lodge with families who are struggling themselves, sleep in makeshift tent cities.The world has well-worn systems for dealing with refugees in camps. But how do you help urban refugees?Lebanon\u2019s government and international aid groups are doing something new. Cash is keeping the refugees alive \u2014 and it should be noted, off the path to Europe.Cash isn\u2019t the solution everywhere. Goods must be available. Markets must be functional, and large enough so that an infusion of new cash isn\u2019t inflationary. Since it\u2019s easier, safer and carries less risk of corruption to provide cash electronically instead of handing people envelopes of bills, mechanisms should exist for debit cards or cellphone banking.But that covers much of the world, even in emergency situations. It\u2019s no problem in Lebanon, a middle-income country known for commerce. \u201cWe\u2019re using in the humanitarian sector what you and I experience in our normal retail life,\u201d said Dominik Heinrich, the food program\u2019s country director for Lebanon.Here\u2019s how it works: Each needy Syrian refugee family gets a banking card. Family members use it to shop for food at the 450 participating stores and markets; a family of five gets about $135 per month.Especially vulnerable families also get cash. They can withdraw $174 per month in cash, to spend anywhere, on whatever they need most.Next month, all the different agencies that give cash will be combining forces to use the same bank card. The food comes from the World Food Program. The cash comes from either the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or the Lebanon Cash Consortium, which is a collaboration of several private relief groups, led by Save the Children. Unicef also gives cash to families who need it to keep warm in the winter.Many humanitarian groups in Lebanon help with sanitation systems and other in-kind assistance. Many run schools, or provide skills or business training. The cash is intended to address (a little; it\u2019s not really enough to live on) refugees\u2019 most urgent problems: What\u2019s for dinner? Where am I sleeping?\u201cThere is nothing that could replace cash,\u201d said Alan Moseley, the Lebanon country director for the International Rescue Committee, a member of the Lebanon Cash Consortium. \u201cIf we provided shelter materials, clothing, food or direct rent subsidies, it would be more costly to deliver and people would be getting things they don\u2019t necessarily need.\u201dCash has particular advantages for refugees, who are sometimes on the move. A cash card travels better than grain, buckets and blankets.Another major way cash can help refugees: it builds good will with hosts far better than sacks of grain can. Lebanon\u2019s enormous generosity has many critics: politicians demonize refugees, and citizens resent the strain they put on schools, social services and local wages. Locals also see foreigners get help that the citizens themselves could use.When refugees get foodstuffs it can make tensions worse \u2014 they often sell their grain for prices lower than in local stores.In Lebanon, however, Syrians go to nearby stores to buy food that has been grown by local farmers and transported in local trucks. Kevin Murphy, senior manager for cash assistance at the International Rescue Committee, said that every dollar in cash assistance generates more than $2 for the Lebanese economy. When the food program cut its payments last year, \u201cwe saw a lot of backlash from local vendors,\u201d Moseley said.The International Rescue Committee, for example, runs cash-for-work programs in two regions. About 2,500 people, both Syrians and Lebanese, can earn $200 each month for 10 days of collecting trash, cleaning up public areas and making repairs in parks.On a much wider scale, the food program\u2019s cards also go to the poorest Lebanese. Their card is a different color, but Lebanese families can shop in the same stores. Heinrich said that Lebanon first tried to set up such a program for its citizens in 2008, but the logistics had been troublesome (the program used paper vouchers). The country succeeded only after the refugees\u2019 digital cash system was in place \u2014 an example of locals benefiting in some ways from hosting refugees.One problem that cash can\u2019t solve is the big one: There\u2019s not enough aid. Last year a conference of rich-country donors to Syria raised only half its goal. As a result, in July 2015 the food program cut its assistance in half, and Syrian refugees in Lebanon began receiving only $13 per person per month to buy food.It\u2019s strongly in the interest of Europe and the United States to compensate Lebanon richly for its service to the refugees, and to help Syrians there live lives as close as possible to normal. \u201cHere, home is 50 kilometers away,\u201d said Heinrich. \u201cYou are in an environment with the same culture, food, climate, religion. If you have hope, you don\u2019t reach the desperate measures of using your last savings to move thousands of kilometers to a strange country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Syrian War, Russia Has Yet to Fulfill Superpower Ambitions", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterIf you held up two maps of Syria \u2014 one from last September, when Russian forces first intervened in the chaotic civil war there, and one today \u2014 you would see that the battle lines look quite similar.Russia\u2019s intervention has succeeded in freezing its interests, along with Syria\u2019s battle lines, largely in place. But hundreds of airstrikes, dozens of casualties and months of diplomacy have done little to demonstrably advance those interests: The war remains stalemated, with key areas under rebel control and pro-government forces unable to retake them.Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, has succeeded at winning Moscow a seat at any table where Syria\u2019s future might be decided. But he has failed to leverage Syria into rapprochement with Western governments that still shun him and impose economic sanctions. Nor has his Middle Eastern adventure rallied the Russian public.Though Americans sometimes perceive Mr. Putin as being on an endless victory march across the Middle East, dictating terms to allies and adversaries alike, analysts say the reality is more modest.Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Institute of International Relations, based in Prague, said of the yearlong campaign, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see much in terms of true strategic impact.\u201dIt is easier to see where Russia has fallen short. Mr. Putin appeared hopeful he could use Syria to prove Russia was again to be respected as a great power: a message aimed both at Western powers and at Russia\u2019s allies in formerly Soviet Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which were shaken by Moscow\u2019s invasion and annexation of territory in Ukraine.\u201cIf Russia is to look like a great power, then it has to stand by its clients, especially when it has so few,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said.But Russia\u2019s military might has not made victory any more viable for its Syrian ally, which is increasingly reliant on Iranian officers and pro-government militias.A year later, no one has joined Mr. Putin\u2019s coalition and no grand bargain appears likely.Mr. Putin seems to have settled on two smaller accomplishments \u2014 each significant for Syria, but not much more \u2014 highlighting the gap between his superpower ambitions and his ability to achieve them.Russian bombing forced opposition groups to hunker down, halting Mr. Assad\u2019s retreat and even allowing him to seize some areas that, while small, make his current holdings more defensible. Russia has also aided Mr. Assad in besieging Aleppo, a rebel stronghold that was bombarded anew on Thursday and Friday.This has forced opposition groups there to turn to extremists for help, making it harder for the United States to arm them or include them in any final peace deal.Still, Genevieve Casagrande, an analyst with the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, said that pro-government ground forces remain too few and too weak to come anywhere near winning the war \u2014 a problem no amount of Russian bombing can overcome. The net result: Syria\u2019s stalemate is slightly less unfavorable to Mr. Assad, but it is still a stalemate.Second, the intervention has forced the United States to include Russia in any negotiations. Mr. Putin cannot dictate terms any more than the Americans can, but he is now one of several leaders with effective veto power over any cease-fire or peace deal. This gives him leverage to preserve Russia\u2019s access to its military bases in Syria, and to ensure that any postwar government remains a Russian ally.Both on the battlefield and in diplomacy, Mr. Putin\u2019s best hope is to break even. Even that will require constant Russian involvement to prevent Mr. Assad\u2019s gains from collapsing, which, in a paradox for Moscow, will also delay the settlement that it seeks and deepen the costs.\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to see is actually more of a protracted conflict,\u201d Ms. Casagrande said, warning that Russia\u2019s involvement had also helped unify opposition groups.Russia\u2019s airstrikes are also backfiring in another way: Initially intended to draw Moscow closer to the West, they have instead alienated a world outraged by attacks on civilians.Because the ground war is led by a patchwork of Syrian and Iranian officers and pro-government militias, Russia has few advisers on the front lines who can call in strikes. It is therefore unable to provide close-fire support during battles, Ms. Casagrande said, and has defaulted to a strategy of bombarding areas it believes are under rebel control.Russia has avoided miring itself in a ground war in Syria, like the one in Afghanistan in the 1980s, but still appears unwilling to withdraw, as Mr. Putin said he would in March. Leaving now, with no demonstrable concessions, would only damage Mr. Putin\u2019s sought-for superpower image.Mr. Galeotti said that Mr. Putin\u2019s decision to stay in Syria made more sense through Russian eyes. While Americans often see Russia as a resurgent power galloping fearlessly across the globe, he said that Russian security and foreign policy officials \u2014 \u201cthe people who according to some narratives are busy trying to create a new Soviet Union\u201d \u2014 see their country as surrounded and besieged by an aggressive, all-powerful United States.\u201cIf I had to think of one word to characterize them, I think it is that they\u2019re scared,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said.But they are also driven by a lingering Cold War paranoia, in which every event \u2014 say, the outbreak of civil war in Syria \u2014 is presumed to be an American plot aimed at Russia\u2019s destruction.\u201cThey have this sense that the West is actually much more strategic and effective than it really is,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said, adding that Americans have a similar habit for overstating Russian power and ambition. \u201cIn a way, what we actually see is both sides thinking that the other side is 10 feet tall.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama on Climate Change: The Trends Are \u2018Terrifying\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIDWAY ATOLL \u2014 Seventy-four years ago, a naval battle off this remote spit of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean changed the course of World War II. Last week, President Obama flew here to swim with Hawaiian monk seals and draw attention to a quieter war \u2014 one he has waged against rising seas, freakish storms, deadly droughts and other symptoms of a planet choking on its own fumes.Bombs may not be falling. The sound of gunfire does not concentrate the mind. What Mr. Obama has seen instead are the charts and graphs of a warming planet. \u201cAnd they\u2019re terrifying,\u201d he said in a recent interview in Honolulu.\u201cWhat makes climate change difficult is that it is not an instantaneous catastrophic event,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a slow-moving issue that, on a day-to-day basis, people don\u2019t experience and don\u2019t see.\u201dBut while climate change has played to Mr. Obama\u2019s highest ideals \u2014 critics would call them messianic impulses \u2014 it has also exposed his weaknesses, namely an inability to forge consensus, even within his own party, on a problem that demands a bipartisan response.He acknowledged that his rallying cry to save the planet had not galvanized Americans. He has been harshly criticized for policies that objectors see as abuses of executive power and far too burdensome for the economy.That has made Mr. Obama\u2019s record on climate curiously contradictory, marked by historic achievements abroad and frustrating setbacks at home. The threat of global warming inspired Mr. Obama to conduct some of the most masterful diplomacy of his presidency, which has bound the United States into a web of agreements and obligations overseas. Yet his determination to act alone inflamed his opponents, helped polarize the debate on climate change and will carry a significant economic cost.Mr. Obama chalks up the contradictions both to politics and to the amorphous, unseen nature of the threat.\u201cIt feels like, \u2018Meh, we can put this off a little bit,\u2019\u201d he said.The president spoke in a cottage on a Marine base that overlooks Kaneohe Bay in his home state, Hawaii. Angry waves crashed on the rocks below the house, the sea churned by one of two hurricanes spinning close to the island. Hawaii, as one of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate advisers pointed out, normally does not get back-to-back hurricanes.\u201cWhen you see severe environmental strains of one sort or another on cultures, on civilizations, on nations, the byproducts of that are unpredictable and can be very dangerous,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf the current projections, the current trend lines on a warming planet continue, it is certainly going to be enormously disruptive worldwide.\u201dEight years ago, when Mr. Obama ran for president against Senator John McCain of Arizona, both men had essentially the same position on global warming: It is caused by humans, and Congress should enact legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions and force polluters to buy and trade permits that would slowly lower overall emissions of climate-warming gases.\u201cOne would have hoped for transformational leadership, in the way J.F.K. would have done it,\u201d said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.That domestic defeat was compounded by failure on the world stage after efforts to enact a highly anticipated United Nations climate change treaty in Copenhagen fell apart in 2009.By the fall of 2010, Tea Party \u201csuper PACs\u201d supported by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch had seized on cap-and-trade as a political weapon, with attacks that helped Republicans take control of the House.Polls showed that few Americans thought of climate change as a high public policy priority, and the percentage of voters who accepted the reality that it was caused by humans had tumbled.\u201cThere is the notion that there\u2019s something I might have done that would prevent Republicans to deny climate change,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI guess hypothetically, maybe there was some trick up my sleeve that would have cast a spell on the Republican caucus and changed their minds.\u201dIn fact, some Republicans, including Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, were willing to go forward with a more limited climate bill that would have restricted emissions only from power plants. But the president\u2019s own party would not unify even around that, with Democrats from industrial and coal states digging in against him. Ironically, Mr. Obama would end up with regulations that narrowly target power plant emissions.\u201cThe White House wanted 60 votes on climate, and they weren\u2019t interested in Republican votes,\u201d Mr. Alexander said in an interview. \u201cNow it\u2019s back to power plant only. The lesson here is that if people who want a result would be a little bit more flexible, they might actually get one.\u201dIn defeat, the president appeared cowed. Campaigning against Mitt Romney in 2012, he barely mentioned climate change.But soon after Election Day, Mr. Obama interrupted a broad discussion with historians about the country\u2019s challenges with a surprising assertion. Douglas Brinkley, a historian who attended the session, recalled, \u201cOut of nowhere, he said, \u2018If we don\u2019t do anything on the climate issue, all bets are off.\u2019\u201d\u201cWhat we owe the remaining people who are making a living mining coal is to be honest with them,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cand to say that, look, the economy is shifting. How we use energy is shifting. That\u2019s going to be true here, but it\u2019s also going to be true internationally.\u201dFew people would have described Mr. Obama as a climate evangelist when he ran for the White House in 2008. While he invoked the rising seas and heating planet to thrill his young supporters, he did not have the long record of climate activism of Al Gore or John Kerry, who is now his secretary of state. Like many things with Mr. Obama, his evolution on climate was essentially an intellectual journey.Mr. Obama immersed himself in the scientific literature, which left little doubt that the planet was warming at an accelerating rate. \u201cMy top science adviser, John Holdren, periodically will issue some chart or report or graph in the morning meetings,\u201d he said, \u201cand they\u2019re terrifying.\u201dThe morning Mr. Obama unveiled the final version of the Clean Power Plan last year, he summoned his senior climate adviser, Brian Deese, to the Oval Office. Mr. Deese expected that the president would hand him some last-minute changes to his speech. Instead, he brought up an article in the journal Science on melting permafrost.\u201cMore and more, there are events that are happening that are astoundingly unusual, that knock your socks off, like the flooding in Louisiana,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. \u201cThose are the kinds of events where it\u2019s becoming possible to draw attribution.\u201d\u201cIf you have even a portion of those billion people displaced,\u201d he said, \u201cyou now have the sorts of refugee crises and potential conflicts that we haven\u2019t seen in our lifetimes.\u201d\u201cThat,\u201d he added, \u201cpromises to make life a lot more difficult for our children and grandchildren.\u201dThe Europeans, who had been cut out of the talks, derided the deal as toothless, but Mr. Obama learned from the experience. A global climate accord could not simply be a compact among developed economies, he said. It had to include the major developing economies, even if they resented being held to standards that had never applied to the club of wealthy nations. And any agreement had to be led by the two largest emitters, the United States and China.\u201cIt was a place Obama and Xi found some common ground,\u201d said John D. Podesta, a chief of staff to President Bill Clinton whom Mr. Obama recruited to lead his climate efforts in his second term. (Mr. Podesta is now the chairman of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.)Mr. Podesta and Todd Stern, the State Department\u2019s climate envoy, began arduous negotiations with China. They were backed by Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama, who sent Mr. Xi a letter with a proposal in which the United States would pledge to increase its target for reducing carbon emissions by 2025 if the Chinese pledged to cap and then gradually reduce their emissions.\u201cOne of the reasons I think that China was prepared to go further than it had been prepared to go previously,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cis that their overriding concern tends to be political stability. Interestingly, one of their greatest political vulnerabilities is the environment. People who go to Beijing know that it can be hard to breathe.\u201d\u201cBy locking in China,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cit now allowed me to go to India and South Africa and Brazil and others and say to them: \u2018Look, we don\u2019t expect countries with big poverty rates and relatively low per-capita carbon emissions to do exactly the same thing that the United States or Germany or other advanced countries are doing. But you\u2019ve got to do something.\u2019\u201d\u201cThere are certain things that the United States can do by itself,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re going to actually solve a problem, then our most important role is as a leader, vision setter and convener.\u201dTo his successor, Mr. Obama leaves an ambitious and divisive legacy: a raft of new emissions rules that promise to transform the United States economy but are likely to draw continuing fire from Republicans, and an aggressive \u2014 some say unrealistic \u2014 pledge made in Paris to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050.All of this, he acknowledges, could be undone at the ballot box. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that if Donald Trump is elected, for example, you have a pretty big shift now with how the E.P.A. operates,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton has embraced Mr. Obama\u2019s go-it-alone approach, promising to meet and in some cases exceed his goals without trying to pass cap-and-trade legislation. She is proposing marquee projects like installing 500 million solar panels by 2020 and giving states and cities $60 billion to invest in energy-efficient public transportation and buildings.\u201cIt will be first-order business,\u201d Mr. Podesta said.\u201cMy hope,\u201d he said, \u201cis that maybe as ex-president I can have a little more influence on some of my Republican friends, who I think up until now have been resistant to the science.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Midway Atoll, and Mark Landler and Coral Davenport from Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Can Mexico Do About Trump?", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWhen Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, the Mexican secretary of the economy, came to talk to me last week about trade and the American elections, I didn\u2019t expect him to drag up the old spat between Mexico and the United States over trucks.Back when it signed on to the North American Free Trade Agreement more than 20 years ago, the United States pledged that in the year 2000 it would lift restrictions that kept Mexican trucks from hauling cargo inside the United States, forcing them instead to dump their loads at the border. But when the time came, under pressure from the Teamsters and the union\u2019s allies in Congress, Washington backed out.Mexico kept its cool for a while, though an arbitration panel in 2001 found the United States was in breach of the agreement. In 2007, Mexico accepted the George W. Bush administration\u2019s request to cooperate in a pilot program that allowed a few Mexican trucks over the border, to prove that the rigs and their drivers posed no undue safety threat to the United States.Sure enough, common sense prevailed: On July 6, 2011, the two countries signed an agreement to allow Mexican trucks to operate in the United States. On Oct. 21, 2011, the first Mexican truck rumbled across, and the last retaliatory tariff was removed.Few, if any, countries would be as vulnerable to a Trump presidency as Mexico. About $4 of every $5 worth of goods that Mexico exports come to the United States. Some 35 percent of Mexican jobs depend directly on foreign trade.Mexico\u2019s future relies on North American integration. \u201cThat\u2019s Mexico\u2019s vulnerability,\u201d said Luis Rubio, who heads the Center of Research for Development in Mexico City. \u201cThere is nothing more important in Mexico than Nafta.\u201dThe outline of a strategy seems clear: Mexico must communicate to the United States just how valuable their relationship is, and how self-destructive it could be to undermine it. The question is how to make this case. How persuasive can Mexico be?A slide from a presentation that Mr. Guajardo Villarreal and his aides carry with them as they speak to American business and political leaders shows what the 2017 Ford Fusion, made in Hermosillo, in northern Mexico, would cost if a 35 percent tariff were imposed on imports from Mexico: $30,253, which is almost $8,000 more than it costs now. Another slide shows that eight of 10 avocados consumed in the United States are grown in Mexico, as are nine of 10 limes and half of all tomatoes.Six million American jobs also depend on exports to Mexico, one slide says. Mexico buys nearly $250 billion worth of stuff from the United States. And 37 cents out of each dollar\u2019s worth of Mexican exports to the United States came from the United States in the form of parts and other components. \u201cIf you throw obstacles at the relationship with Mexico, you would be shooting yourself in the foot,\u201d Mr. Guajardo Villarreal told me.Allies in the United States would indeed help Mexico make its case, including states and municipalities that would be hurt by Nafta\u2019s unraveling, and businesses that would be forced to relocate production and rethink their global supply chains.But perhaps a more muscular approach is needed. Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, a former Mexican foreign minister who is a harsh critic of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, suggests that Mexico\u2019s best argument is that the country\u2019s stability and prosperity are indispensable for the national security of the United States. Americans worried about illegal immigration across the southern border might stop to consider what it could look like if the Mexican economy went into a tailspin.If this argument fails to persuade, Mr. Casta\u00f1eda argues, there are other tools in the toolbox. Say Mexico demanded that the United States prove that a migrant was Mexican before it would accept her back into the country. It could deploy American courts and regulations against Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, pushing for things like environmental impact assessments. \u201cWe should throw as many monkey wrenches into the works as possible,\u201d Mr. Casta\u00f1eda said.And together with Canada, Mexico should sue in every court \u2014 under the provisions of Nafta, the World Trade Organization and the United States \u2014 to resist Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionist agenda.A big question remains, however: If a Trump administration were to follow through on its threats \u2014 breaking the rules of Nafta and the W.T.O. \u2014 how strongly should Mexico retaliate?It has shown it knows how. In the truck spat, Mexico picked political targets skillfully. It avoided shooting itself in the foot when it retaliated against Christmas trees rather than car engines. \u201cMexico has been very good at trying to follow the rules of trade agreements when it has run into trade frictions with the United States,\u201d said Chad Bown, an expert on trade at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Yet, as Mr. Bown observed, in the early days of a Trump administration \u2014 when he wouldn\u2019t be worried about re-election \u2014 \u201cwhat products would you pick?\u201dThe problem for Mexico is that the damage to its own economy would be much larger. \u201cIf we are to go to war, of course we have rifles,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. But the economic weapons his country has at its disposal, he added, are like \u201cnuclear bombs that you can\u2019t use.\u201dLamenting their luck, Mexicans often say, \u201cPoor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States.\u201d Facing the prospect of a Trump presidency, many Mexicans would hope their northern neighbor were farther away. But Mexico\u2019s prosperity depends on a closer relationship with the United States, not a weaker one. The best approach to a Trump administration may be to hunker down and wait for his successor.A picture caption on Wednesday with the Economic Scene column, about how Mexico might handle a Trump presidency, misspelled the surname of Mexico\u2019s secretary of the economy in some editions. As the column correctly noted, he is Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, not Ildefonso Guajardo Villareal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thai Court Finds British Labor Activist Guilty of Defamation", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A Thai court on Tuesday found a British labor activist guilty of defamation and computer crimes, a verdict that some experts and rights advocates predicted would harm efforts to protect migrant workers in Southeast Asia.The activist, Andy Hall, was sentenced to three years in prison and fined about $4,300 in connection with his work on a 2013 report by a Finnish advocacy group that accused Natural Fruit, based in Thailand, of violating its workers\u2019 rights.But the court suspended the sentence for two years. That means Mr. Hall is effectively on probation and will go free if he commits no crimes during that time, said Sonja Vartiala, executive director of the advocacy group, Finnwatch.\u201cAny company around the world that is concerned about human or labor rights abuses in their supply chain will have to take a real hard look at whether they want to source anything from Thailand going forward,\u201d Brad Adams, the Asia director for the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, in New York, said in a statement released after the verdict was handed down.Laurent Meillan, the acting regional representative for the United Nations Human Rights Office for Southeast Asia, called the ruling \u201cvery disturbing.\u201d\u201cInstead of prosecuting Mr. Hall, it would have been more appropriate to conduct an independent and thorough investigation into the serious allegations raised in the Finnwatch report,\u201d Mr. Meillan said in a statement.Among other reported abuses, the report said that the family of a worker who died from electric shock had received at most 10 percent of the financial compensation required by law. It also said the company had confiscated workers\u2019 passports and forced them to pay deposits to get them back for trips home.The defamation charge against Mr. Hall was based on an interview he had given to Al Jazeera in connection with the report\u2019s findings. The computer crimes charge stemmed from claims that he had uploaded confidential communications to Finnwatch\u2019s website, which the organization has denied.Mr. Hall, 36, who has mostly lived in Thailand since 2005, said he planned to appeal the verdict. He said he had expected to be acquitted of all charges because his advocacy work benefited Thai society and migrant workers.\u201cI respect the decision of the court, but I\u2019m very disappointed in it,\u201d he said by telephone after leaving the courthouse in Bangkok.The British Foreign Office said in an emailed statement that Britain \u201csupports the right of human rights defenders to raise concerns about human rights violations without fear of reprisals or legal action to prevent public participation.\u201d It said it would raise Mr. Hall\u2019s case with Thailand and offer him support if needed.Kachin Komneeyawanich, the vice president for Natural Fruit, said Tuesday that he was happy with the verdict, saying that the report had caused \u201ccolossal\u201d damage to the company\u2019s profits and reputation. \u201cWe are fighting for our honor,\u201d Mr. Kachin said by telephone. \u201cWe thank the court and the justice system for having mercy on us.\u201dNatural Fruit has filed two civil claims against Mr. Hall seeking damages of about $11.5 million, according to Finnwatch.Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of international political economy at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said in an email that the ruling \u201csends signals to companies in labor-intensive industries that the law is on their side when it comes to labor repression.\u201dRyn Jirenuwat contributed reporting from Bangkok.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Save Gabon From Election Fraud", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOn Saturday, Aug. 27, presidential elections were held in my country, Gabon, in West Africa, and I was the candidate who won by a substantial vote margin. Nearly a week later, I would have expected to be addressing the world as Gabon\u2019s president-elect, ready and willing to work with the United States and all our international partners to fight terrorism, build our economies and improve the lives of our citizens through increased development and cooperation.Instead, I am hoping that the American people, and all others who care about democracy, will help my country through a crisis for our democracy. I\u2019m in Gabon where the current president, Ali Bongo Ondimba, is using our national security forces \u2014 armed with valuable military weaponry provided by the United States to fight terrorism \u2014 against our own people. In the reports I\u2019ve heard, at least a dozen are dead \u2014 probably more \u2014 and hundreds wounded; thousands have been arrested, including 23 of my campaign workers.Why is Mr. Bongo doing all this? Well, when the people of Gabon voted for their leader, they chose me. They chose a change from the dynastic regime that has ruled our country since 1967. Mr. Bongo\u2019s father, Omar Bongo Ondimba, ruled from 1967 to 2009, when the son took over. Now Mr. Bongo is throwing a deadly and dangerous tantrum because the people of Gabon told him that it\u2019s time for him to go.Specifically, after Saturday\u2019s vote \u2014 which was peaceful, orderly and open to international observers \u2014 election officials, provincial governors and international witnesses could see that I had a double-digit lead across the country, and Ali Bongo got nervous.These results were not surprising because the two other major challengers withdrew from the race before the election and backed me as the unified opposition candidate against Mr. Bongo. The votes \u2014 373,310 in all \u2014 were collected, and preliminary counts from eight of nine provinces showed me with a solid lead as late as Tuesday.But on Wednesday, when Mr. Bongo\u2019s interior minister announced the \u201cofficial results,\u201d including the ninth province \u2014 Mr. Bongo\u2019s own base \u2014 he shocked us all by announcing that the voter turnout in that province had been 99.9 percent (in contrast to a national turnout elsewhere of 59 percent) and that 95 percent of the province had voted for the incumbent. Curiously, the total number of voters there included several thousand more than actually live in the province.On that basis, Mr. Bongo claimed victory by 1.57 percent of the national vote and declared himself president until 2025.We have seen \u201cresults\u201d like these before, but only from sham elections, most often in dictatorships. The citizens of Gabon had peacefully and respectfully exercised their right to freely and fairly choose our country\u2019s next president. Mr. Bongo did not approve of their choice, so he substituted his will for theirs. While we are disappointed, we were not surprised. Mr. Bongo did the same thing in 2009; he was up to his same tricks again.We, the people of Gabon, demand that Mr. Bongo end the violence and stop ordering our brothers, sisters and children in the security forces to attack our own. We demand that he stop seeking retribution against his political adversaries and their supporters. We demand that he release the election results by bureau and polling place so that independent observers can verify a recount of all the votes and confirm the will of our people.As I said in a public appeal to the world last Wednesday, we also want the United States to accept nothing less than true democracy in Gabon, as officials in Canada, France and throughout the European Union have already committed to do. And we hope America\u2019s citizens, its leaders and its policy makers will send a clear message to Mr. Bongo that he cannot steal an election.I have already called on my fellow Gabonese citizens to protest peacefully until our demands have been met. I will continue this fight until our voice and our will are respected and accepted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reinhard Selten, Whose Strides in Game Theory Led to a Nobel, Dies at 85", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReinhard Selten, who was expelled from school in Germany when he was 14 because he was half Jewish, but returned after World War II to study mathematics and become the country\u2019s first and only Nobel winner for economics, died on Aug. 23 in Poznan, Poland. He was 85.His death was announced by the University of Bonn, where he had taught since 1984 and was professor emeritus. No cause was given.The prize celebrated their pioneering advances in game theory, or strategic decision-making by individuals, businesses, nations and even nature on matters like playing poker, nuclear deterrence and biological evolution.By awarding them the prize, the Nobel committee also recognized a fundamental shift in economic theory: from the model of predicting that free markets evolve from perfect competition to more robust versions based on give-and-take behaviors that acknowledge other factors, like hostile takeovers, trade wars and big government.Alvin E. Roth, another Nobel laureate in economics, who teaches at Stanford University, wrote in 1999 that game theory and experimental economics were two of the most important developments in the field in the second half of the 20th century.\u201cReinhard Selten is one of the pioneers in both of these endeavors, and he has been a leader in each of them throughout his career,\u201d Professor Roth wrote. \u201cThis makes him unique: No one else in the world has made such important or such sustained contributions to both fields.\u201dReinhard Justus Reginald Selten was born on Oct. 5, 1930, in what was then Breslau, Germany, and is now Wroclaw, Poland. His father, Adolf Selten, a blind bookseller with a third-grade education, was Jewish. His mother, the former Kathe Luther, was Protestant.The couple decided that they would let Reinhard decide on a religion for himself, but as the Nazis began imposing laws against Jews, they had him baptized. His father died in 1942.In his official Nobel biography, Professor Selten recalled that despite the baptism he was not only dismissed from high school as a son of a Jew but was also denied the opportunity to learn a trade. He was relegated to menial labor.\u201cMy situation as a member of an officially despised minority forced me to pay close attention to political matters very early in my life,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMoreover, I found myself in opposition to the political views shared by the vast majority of the population.\u201cI had to learn to trust my own judgment rather than official propaganda or public opinion. This was a strong influence on my intellectual development. My continuing interest in politics and public affairs was one of the reasons why I began to be interested in economics in my last high school years.\u201d\u201cI had to walk to school, which took about three and a half hours there and back,\u201d Professor Selten recalled. \u201cDuring these walks I occupied my mind with problems of elementary geometry and algebra.\u201dHe graduated from Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, where he went on to receive his master\u2019s degree and, in 1961, his doctorate. He was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and also taught at the Free University of Berlin and the University of Bielefeld before joining the University of Bonn in 1984.He married Elisabeth Langreiner, whom he had met through the movement to spread Esperanto, a language developed in the 19th century to encourage global communication. Like Professor Selten, she had diabetes; both her legs were amputated below the knee. There was no immediate word on his survivors.The Nobel economics committee\u2019s recommendation to award the prize was almost overruled by the full Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and prompted an unprecedented floor debate because of concerns about Dr. Nash\u2019s mental state. But his advocates, and the committee\u2019s desire to acknowledge the growing importance of game theory, carried the day.Beginning in the mid-1960s, Professor Selten expanded on Dr. Nash\u2019s groundbreaking game theory research, devising complex formulas. One is colloquially called \u201cthe chain store paradox,\u201d whereby the threat of a price war in one market affects other markets; another is \u201cthe trembling hand equilibrium,\u201d whereby each player believes there is a small probability that a mistake will occur.Professor Selten\u2019s research topics \u201cseem often strongly risk-seeking and sometimes almost contrarian,\u201d Abdolkarim Sadrieh, a former student of his and now a teacher himself, wrote in 2010. But he said that the professor could be cautious in his personal life. For one thing, Dr. Sadrieh noted, he always carried an umbrella.Advertisement"}

As the head of cardiology, he has seen similar cases routinely referred from his satellite hospital to the \u201cheart center\u201d in Odense. Just a few years ago, before the advent of digital reporting, the longer time needed to collaborate on a treatment decision could have affected the patient\u2019s chances.Now, however, Dr. Kragh-Thomsen was able to instantly share and discuss the patient\u2019s echocardiograms with his colleagues at Odense University Hospital. A decision was promptly made, and the patient was transferred immediately for a valve replacement.Denmark\u2019s interconnected health care system serving a population of 5.5 million is a good example of how data access and collaboration could simplify clinician workflow \u2014 saving time and money while improving outcomes \u2014 especially in a world with an increasingly aging population.Today, as people live longer, they are more likely to develop chronic conditions, placing tremendous and unsustainable strains on health care systems around the world. The challenge of providing effective health care at an affordable price will require not only new technology, but also a new way of thinking about care by providers, governments and patients, according to an international perception study sponsored by Philips.Hover over highlighted area below for more informationUnited Arab Emirates72.160.063.9Netherlands72.458.845.5China64.857.352.1Australia71.555.147.2Singapore70.154.848.2United States68.454.749.0Sweden64.060.946.9South Africa63.255.351.6United Kingdom70.253.745.3France66.954.442.6Germany69.252.841.5Brazil45.457.049.4Japan57.950.738.4The proportion of the world\u2019s population over 60 is expected to nearly double, to 22 percent, by 2050, according to the World Health Organization. Much of this growth will be concentrated in developing countries, where many already lack access to health services and infrastructure. At the same time, longer life means an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, dementia, cancer and diabetes \u2014 all of which require long-term commitment by patients and health care systems \u2014 and, subsequently, significant resources.\u201cHealth care is just not sustainable the way it is run today,\u201d says Helen Routh, senior vice president of Strategy & Innovation at Philips. \u201cWe have to get to better outcomes at lower costs.\u201dThe solution is making connections via a new, integrated approach to health care. Leveraging technology and connectivity to address communication gaps could also help ensure constant feedback throughout a patient\u2019s journey along the health continuum \u2014 from healthy living and disease prevention to diagnosis, treatment and the return home.This \u201cconnected care\u201d approach facilitates integration of all parts of the health system, from patients and their families, friends and employers to doctors and hospitals to insurers and governments. It relies on real-time communication, made possible through emerging technologies like secure networks, devices that monitor key health indicators and software algorithms that analyze and interpret the data. If implemented successfully, integrated solutions can enhance efficiency and outcomes in the long term. The perceived level of access that patients have to a range of health care solutions and services across all health needs  The perceived state of functional integration and interoperability between health care systems  The perceived proliferation, take-up and use of, and familiarity with, connected-care technology  People aged 18 or older who have visited a health care professional within the past three months  Those who work in health care as a doctor, surgeon, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse or nurse across a variety of specializations  Technology that enables sharing of information throughout all parts of the health system. This can range from computer software that allows secure communication between doctors and hospitals to a watch that tracks a person\u2019s heartbeat The readiness to address future health challenges with connected-care technology and integration varies from country to country, according to the Philips Future Health Index. Developed countries are slowed down by bureaucracy and regulation, while emerging economies struggle with providing access to health care and good infrastructure.For example, the United Arab Emirates leads the ranking, partly thanks to patient and health care professional readiness to adopt connected-care technology; 43 percent of UAE patients surveyed say the health system in their country is very or completely integrated. Japan, on the other hand, ranks lowest on the index, with a perceived lack of access to health services and knowledge regarding connected care \u2014 about a quarter of Japanese patients surveyed agree they have access to the information and resources they need to live healthily.Developed countries score better in terms of access to health care resources, while emerging countries such as South Africa and the UAE are blazing a trail for technology adoption, with more health care professionals expecting connected technology to be used to manage health in the future.While three-quarters of health care professionals in developed countries agree that their patients have access to the treatments needed for current and future medical conditions, these economies tend to approach integration and connected care with heightened vigilance around data privacy and security. This presents a significant potential obstacle to connected care in some countries. In Germany, for example, half of the health care professionals surveyed see privacy and security concerns as a top barrier to the adoption of connected-care technology, versus only 16 percent in South Africa and 18 percent in the UAE.On the other hand, there is the possibility of emerging countries \u201cleapfrogging\u201d more developed countries through targeted partnerships and the quick adoption of new mobile technologies. The explosion of mobile devices in some parts of the world, such as Africa and Southeast Asia, is a prime example.A case in point is Indonesia, where the number of smartphone users is expected to reach 69 million in 2016. Tapping into the trend, the Padang city government teamed up with PT Philips Indonesia for the implementation of a new telehealth platform that helps address the high maternal mortality rate via Mobile Obstetrical Monitoring. The solution uses a mobile phone application where midwives can create health profiles of pregnant women by collecting data from physical examinations and tests done at local nursing clinics or at the patients\u2019 homes. This integrated approach aims to drastically reduce Indonesia\u2019s maternal and fetal mortality rates, which is also one of the government\u2019s Millennial Development Goals.Health leaders recognize the need for a more integrated approach to care that maximizes efficiency, improves patient experience and ultimately fosters a healthier population.Developed CountriesEmerging CountriesThree-quarters of health care professionals in developed countries agree their patients have access to treatments, versus just over half of those in the emerging countries polled.Click the icons below to toggle chart dataHealth Care ProfessionalsPatientsOver half of health care professionals and 43% of patients name bureaucracy as a major barrier to the coordination of health care.Connected care requires patients and health care professionals to be comfortable with technology. The Future Health Index study found a clear generation gap, not only in the area of technology, but also in accountability. Beyond the disparities between developed and emerging countries, the research points to other divides in views on health system integration, medical technology, and the promotion and maintenance of health overall \u2014 between young and old, and health care professionals and their patients \u2014 that will need to be addressed for connected care to take root.Similarly, health care professionals are also less confident about patients\u2019 maintaining their own health; only 40 percent of health care professionals surveyed agree that patients have enough knowledge to manage their own health effectively.To reverse this trend, Philips and Allianz Worldwide Partners co-developed an occupational health solution to help employees in Germany lead a healthier life. There are as many as 40 million people with hypertension in the country, and the cost of medication amounts to \u20ac3.2 billion annually. Part of the health motivator initiative, the solution is aimed at people with certain risk factors and includes a monitoring app with virtual coaching to engage and educate users on how to sustainably change their lifestyle and improve their overall health.Some experts, however, are concerned that potential misuse of connected technology could raise legal and reputational issues for health care professionals.Dr. Kiyoshi Kurokawa, adjunct professor at Japan\u2019s National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, says that \u201cadvancing digital technology is a great tool to improve medical care and share best practices, and also for patients to understand health issues and share information on which doctors are best.\u201d But he also warns: \u201cThis democratization of knowledge has two sides, because increased patient knowledge also can increase litigation, which can stifle advances.\u201dIn the meantime, rigorous data and privacy protection regulations in developed countries can stop or slow integration. In the United States, for example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act prevents health care professionals from sharing any medical information without the patient\u2019s written consent.\u201cThere are some patients who are suspicious this data is somehow going to be used against them, i.e., that they won\u2019t have access to health insurance or it will become prohibitively expensive,\u201d says Lynne Dunbrack of the International Data Corporation (IDC). \u201cConsequently, they don\u2019t necessarily want to share their user-generated health information.\u201dThis ultimately leads back to the implementation of adequate government regulations in the health care sector and the trust of both patients and health professionals in the system. \u201cIn the U.S., many physicians are very concerned about the legal liability that might result from having all this data,\u201d Dunbrack says. \u201cFor example, if a reading signals that the patient is experiencing a clinically significant event which requires an intervention, is the physician liable for malpractice if he doesn\u2019t act on that information?\u201d Therefore, many patients and agencies would be reluctant to share health-related information if they had doubts about how it would be handled or used.In the U.S., many physicians are very concerned about the legal liability that might result from having all this data. on how to put information into practice  that they can achieve health goals  of health indicators and symptoms  from a health nutrition or fitness expert, family and friends  to health care facilities  consultations and treatment Click the labels to toggle the chart dataWhile the cost of connected technology is seen as one of the top barriers to its adoption (with 42 percent of patients and 46 percent of health care professionals surveyed noting this), about a third of health care professionals (36 percent) and patients (29 percent) also see training to use or interpret data from connected technologies as a top barrier to its adoption.Dunbrack of IDC says, however, that larger-scale health monitoring initiatives, while not necessarily reducing costs at the \u201cmoment of impact,\u201d have been shown to deliver results by encouraging early interventions that may prevent serious and economically damaging health conditions down the road. \u201cCare now could, for example, help someone avoid a stroke later that is very debilitating and has implications in terms of their not contributing to society,\u201d she says. \u201cBut how do we go about calculating that as an ROI (return on investment)?

{"Headline": "Hinkley Point Nuclear Plant Will Go Ahead, Britain Says", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 After delaying a project to build a nuclear power plant with Chinese investment, Britain\u2019s government on Thursday gave the go-ahead for the plant, but insisted on new conditions designed to protect the security of critical infrastructure.The decision ended weeks of uncertainty that had strained relations with China, which is financing more than a third of the $23.7 billion power station, and with France, whose largely state-owned energy giant EDF is paying for the bulk of the project.By pressing ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant on the Somerset coast of England, Prime Minister Theresa May appears to be open to greater involvement by China in Britain\u2019s energy industry. China also wants to build and operate a nuclear plant of its own design at another British site, at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex.Mrs. May said in July that her government would not yet sign off on the Hinkley Point deal, reportedly on security and economic grounds, deciding instead to review the plans for the new power plant. It was one of her first big political moves after succeeding David Cameron as prime minister, and was seen as a sign that she was uncomfortable with some aspects of Mr. Cameron\u2019s aggressive pursuit of an economic partnership with Beijing.In recent weeks, Mrs. May has upended a variety of Mr. Cameron\u2019s domestic policies. She has abandoned his financial targets and, most recently, overturned his education policy by advocating for allowing selective admissions in schools.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Thursday\u2019s decision suggested that the price of any significant policy shift on the Hinkley project would simply have been too high.If the project did not proceed, the French energy firm, EDF, would have made claims to be compensated for development and construction; trade with China would have almost certainly suffered; and Britain would have lost out on the Hinkley plant\u2019s production, expected to be able to cover 7 percent of the country\u2019s electricity needs. And with around 26,000 jobs at stake, British trade unions were campaigning for the power station to go ahead.Britain\u2019s energy secretary, Greg Clark, promised on Thursday that the government \u201cwill introduce a series of measures to enhance security and will ensure Hinkley cannot change hands without the government\u2019s agreement.\u201d\u201cAfter Hinkley, the British government will take a special share in all future nuclear new build projects,\u201d he added.That announcement seemed designed to increase British control over critical aspects of national infrastructure, similar to those exercised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.After the delay to the Hinkley project\u2019s approval was announced in July, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said in a commentary that it added \u201cuncertainties to the \u2018Golden Era\u2019 of China-U.K. ties.\u201d\u201cChina can wait for a rational British government to make responsible decisions,\u201d the editorial said, \u201cbut cannot tolerate any unwanted accusation against its sincere and benign willingness for win-win cooperation.\u201dWith its huge economic muscle, China is a formidable trade partner for Britain, particularly after Britain\u2019s vote to quit the European Union. Mrs. May\u2019s government is hoping to boost trade with non-European partners. She and President Xi Jinping of China met at the gathering of Group of 20 leaders this month in Hangzhou, China.On Thursday, China\u2019s CGN, which is one of the partners in the Hinkley deal, said it was \u201cdelighted that the British government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation.\u201dMichel Sapin, the French finance and economy minister, said in a statement Thursday that the decision was \u201ca major step in French-British industrial and energy cooperation.\u201dHowever the opposition Labour Party in Britain dismissed the new security safeguards announced by the government as \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d saying that most of the protection they afforded could already be achieved under existing legislation.Critics of the Hinkley project said the British government had ignored the biggest failing of the project: It is a bad deal for the money.In exchange for building the plant, EDF has been guaranteed 92.50 pounds (about $120) for every megawatt hour of electricity produced, rising with inflation, for 35 years \u2014 equivalent to more than twice the current wholesale price of electricity.Javier C.

Stepping in after ten minutes waiting on the steamy Astor Place platform, and with my 3-month-old strapped to my chest, I didn\u2019t dare make a dash for the next car.

{"Headline": "A Dodd-Frank Rollback Bill Clears a House Committee", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A House committee on Tuesday approved a bill to roll back significant portions of the financial-crisis-era overhaul known as the Dodd-Frank Act in a vote that was largely down party lines.The legislation, the Financial Choice Act, is not expected to be adopted this year. But it could influence the broader debate over financial reform and provide a starting point for its sponsor, Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, whose leadership role on the panel is set to end in two years.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to frame the debate going forward and lay some groundwork for next year,\u201d said Mark A. Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute, and a former Republican staff member in the Senate. \u201cThis is your last window before the election.\u201dThe Financial Choice Act split the banking panel with a vote of 30 to 26, with just one Republican, Representative Bruce Poliquin of Maine, siding with the committee\u2019s Democrats against it.Mr. Hensarling has been a prominent critic of Dodd-Frank and other changes after the 2008 financial crisis, including the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate the consumer finance industry.\u201cIt has been six years since the passage of Dodd-Frank. We were told it would lift our economy, but instead we are stuck in the slowest, weakest, most tepid recovery in the history of the Republic,\u201d said Mr. Hensarling at Tuesday\u2019s session. \u201cThe economy does not work for working people.\u201dThe bill would also repeal the Volcker Rule, which aimed to stop banks from making risky bets with their own money, and replace regulators\u2019 authority to wind down troubled banks with a new chapter of the bankruptcy code. In addition, it would remove the Durbin Amendment, which set a limit on certain fees retailers are charged for debit card transactions.Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who is the committee\u2019s ranking member, said at the vote that the plan was a nonstarter for any conversations about amending Dodd-Frank.\u201cThis bill is so bad that it simply cannot be fixed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is a rushed, partisan messaging tool.\u201d\u201cThe chairman\u2019s bill strips, takes away, from the C.F.P.B. its authority to punish abusive conduct, which means Wells Fargo would have gotten off even easier for this scandalous conduct,\u201d said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York.Still, a handful of lawmakers signaled interest in finding opportunities to tweak Dodd-Frank, though they cautioned that the Republican bill being considered went too far.\u201cAre there mistakes in Dodd-Frank? Of course there are. We are human beings,\u201d said Representative Emanuel Cleaver, Democrat of Missouri. \u201cRather than correct the mistakes, we decided to just throw the baby out with the bath water.\u201dThe piecemeal approach may prove to be the model for other revisions to Dodd-Frank.\u201cFor any financial regulatory relief legislation to pass, it looks like it will have to be targeted toward a group in good standing with the Hill and incredibly narrow in its overall impact,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for Compass Point Research & Trading.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Plot to Put Conceptual Art on \u2018Melrose Place.\u2019 Yes, Really.", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwenty years ago, the conceptual artist Mel Chin cold-called the offices of \u201cMelrose Place,\u201d Aaron Spelling\u2019s wildly popular prime-time soap opera, with a proposition. What if a task force of artists supplied free artworks and props for the show\u2019s apartment-complex set, with coded cultural messages on pressing topics like reproductive rights, American foreign policy, alcoholism and sexual politics?Deborah Siegel, the show\u2019s set decorator, listened to this absurd offer and had an instant reaction. \u201cI thought it sounded really interesting,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cSo I met with him.\u201dThe exhibition, through Nov. 20, will be, appropriately enough, a rerun. Viewers of \u201cMelrose Place\u201d saw a version of it in April 1997, in a television episode featuring an actual exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, \u201cUncommon Sense,\u201d which included many of the works produced for the set.In it, Heather Locklear, as the hard-charging advertising executive Amanda Woodward, has just taken on the museum as a client and brings her love interest, Kyle McBride (Rob Estes), to the opening for a stimulating evening of art talk.Much of it takes place in front of a Ross Bleckner-like painting that alludes to the American bombing of Baghdad. That work was ordered by Carol Mendelsohn, the show\u2019s head writer. This fictional opening, filmed two weeks before the museum\u2019s opening, was one of the great meta moments in television history.The \u201cMelrose Place\u201d idea began when Mr. Chin was shuttling back and forth between the University of Georgia, where he held a temporary professorship, and the California Institute of the Arts, where he was conducting a workshop. \u201cWe discussed pop culture and Hollywood,\u201d said Valerie Tevere, one of his Cal Arts students, an artist and now a professor of media culture at the College of Staten Island. \u201cHow might artists work with TV. What sort of things could happen?\u201dMr. Chin had never heard of \u201cMelrose Place.\u201d \u201cI was not watching much television at the time,\u201d he said in a recent interview at Red Bull Studios.But if he was not watching, he was thinking, prompted by Julie Lazar, the director of experimental programs at the Museum of Contemporary Art, and Tom Finkelpearl, a guest curator and now New York\u2019s commissioner of cultural affairs, who approached him to take part in \u201cUncommon Sense.\u201dMr. Chin recalled that while on a flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, he looked out the window and thought \u201cLos Angeles is in the air.\u201d The city existed in the trillions of electronic impulses its residents sent through the atmosphere and around the world, transmitting social content and cultural symbols. \u201cOur world is transformed by covert information, political messages,\u201d Mr. Chin said. \u201cHow would that work if it was art?\u201dBack home, Mr. Chin watched as his wife, Helen Nagge, flipped the remote and stopped on an arresting image. \u201cI saw this large blond face filling the screen, with blue eyes,\u201d he said. It was Ms. Locklear. \u201cWhen she moved, there was a painting behind her, and I said, \u2018That\u2019s the gallery.\u2019\u201dMr. Chin began assembling his troops. The name GALA fused the abbreviations for Georgia and Los Angeles, but eventually the committee absorbed dozens of artists around the country.The team included students; professional artists; a media scholar (Constance Penley of the University of California, Santa Barbara); and an actual fan of the show, Mark Flood, an old friend of Mr. Chin\u2019s from his native Houston.Mr. Flood wondered aloud whether the project amounted to a sellout. Mr. Chin told him, \u201cWe\u2019re not selling anything, we\u2019re getting in.\u201dFrank South, an executive producer for the show, and Ms. Mendelsohn decided not to mention the project to Mr. Spelling or the network brass. Eventually, word leaked out. In 1997, The New Yorker ran a Talk of the Town article, \u201cAgitprop,\u201d timed to the opening of \u201cUncommon Sense.\u201d Mr. South said, \u201cI was busted.\u201dMr. Spelling, tickled at the idea of seeing \u201cMelrose Place\u201d in the museum world, took the news well. \u201cJust don\u2019t do anything to hurt the show,\u201d he told his charges.In early 1996, with the series in its fourth season, the artwork began to arrive, first in a trickle, then in a flood. As a safe-sex message, committee members designed \u201cSafety Sheets\u201d for the manipulative, womanizing Dr. Peter Burns: bedsheets in an all-over pattern of cylindrical shapes that, on close inspection, turned out to be unrolled condoms.When Alison Parker (Courtney Thorne-Smith) became pregnant, the GALA Committee made her a quilt appliqu\u00e9d with the chemical symbol for the abortion pill RU-486. \u201cOne of the things we wanted to do was to respond to the fact that in network TV, no matter how strong you are, you cannot have an abortion,\u201d Ms. Penley said. \u201cYou either have the baby, or you fall down the stairs. We wanted to put reproductive choice back on network TV.\u201dOne of the sneakier placements \u2014 the committee referred to them as \u201cproduct insertion manifestations\u201d \u2014 came from the Cal Arts workshop. When Michael Mancini, a character played by Thomas Calabro, visits a hot-sheet motel, he sees the clerk reading \u201cLibidinal Economy,\u201d a work by the French poststructuralist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard.As the television project gathered steam, the producers turned to the committee to help invent the character of Samantha Reilly, an artist who, after graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design, heads out to Los Angeles and moves into the Melrose Place complex. Ms. Mendelsohn was flown out to Kansas City to brainstorm with 10 women on the committee who became known as the Sisters of Sam.\u201cWe thought, she could be a Cindy Sherman, or a Kiki Smith, or a Barbara Kruger,\u201d said Ms. Penley, who envisioned a feminist conceptualist. But the producers demanded paintings in the David Hockney mode, with bright pastels.\u201cThey said, \u201c\u2018Because the camera loves those colors,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chin recalled.Hijacking the concept, the Gala Committee turned out a series of cheery-toned paintings on the theme of violence and death in Los Angeles.The Gala Committee called it a day after the museum episode, but the series continued until May 1999. In a half-serious statement for a sale of many of the artworks at Sotheby\u2019s, Mr. Chin summed up the great intervention as the catalyst for \u201ca profoundly radical transformation of worldwide art, entertainment, communication and government.\u201dThe reality was somewhat less dramatic. \u201cWe were exhausted, basically,\u201d Mr. Chin said. \u201cIt was very stressful, producing on deadline. The potentiality and the pictorial reality had been enlarged, so we decided to stop there. It was time to release it to the world. And think of the reruns.\u201dAn article on Thursday about a group of artists led by Mel Chin who provided artworks for the television show \u201cMelrose Place\u201d in the 1990s misidentified the position currently held at the College of Staten Island by Valerie Tevere, who at the time was a student of Mr. Chin at the California Institute of the Arts. She is a professor of media culture, not an associate professor of art. The article also referred incorrectly to the medication known as RU-486, the chemical symbol for which was put on a quilt made for a character in the show who became pregnant. It is an abortion pill, not a morning-after pill.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Physicist in Albany Corruption Case Was a Geek With Big Goals", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for Alain E. Kaloyeros, a physicist who rose from a basement laboratory at the State University at Albany to oversee hundreds of millions of dollars in state economic development funds over a quarter-century, a more complex purpose seemed to be at work. Beyond money, the rewards he sought appeared to be power, prestige and, perhaps most of all, the fulfillment of a long-held dream: reinventing upstate New York as a Rust Belt Silicon Valley.With an early zeal for nanotechnology, a taste for head-turning cars, a sardonic tongue and a talent for luring major corporations with government financing, Dr. Kaloyeros, 60, is widely credited with transforming Albany from a drowsy government town into an unlikely center for high-tech research.\u201cIt was pretty much a miracle,\u201d said Lloyd Constantine, a top aide to Eliot Spitzer, the former governor. \u201cFrom my standpoint, from the administration\u2019s standpoint, he was doing a spectacular job. Revitalization of the upstate economy was Job No. 1. And he was doing it, and doing it really well.\u201dOften working with a lobbyist, Todd R. Howe, a former aide to Mr. Cuomo, Dr. Kaloyeros is accused of personally drafting and revising several requests for proposals to favor certain developers, including one for a SUNY Polytechnic dorm, another for a campus research building and two connected to huge economic development contracts in Syracuse and Buffalo.Untethered from the usual government safeguards, the university all but supplanted the state\u2019s economic development agency as the Cuomo administration\u2019s chief economic engine in upstate New York.The grants, rents and business he brought in to SUNY Polytechnic \u201call benefited him personally through his compensation package, and also added to his status as a kingmaker and an important person in state government,\u201d said the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who charged Dr. Kaloyeros with three felony counts of bid-rigging at a news conference. Additional federal charges were brought by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan.Michael C. Miller, a lawyer for Dr. Kaloyeros, said his client was innocent and \u201clooks forward to being exonerated.\u201dDr. Kaloyeros had bragged about his ability to \u201cwrite an RFP in such a way that only one company could win it,\u201d according to the state criminal complaint. Dr. Kaloyeros, referred to as \u201cDr. K\u201d in the federal complaint, did so, according to prosecutors, to preserve his status as one of the state\u2019s highest-paid employees, draw more research financing to SUNY Polytechnic and inflate his reputation as Albany\u2019s most successful rainmaker.\u201cThe job requires being a scientist, being a psychiatrist, being a priest, being a cop, being a negotiator, being a business developer or manager, being a teacher, being an adviser and being an ego-kisser,\u201d Mr. Kaloyeros told the Albany Business Review in 2011. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I do all of them very well.\u201dWheedling and wooing over sushi and Starbucks coffee, he made every college president, legislative leader and governor who supported him feel like a visionary, even as he outlasted, and out-earned, all of them. He consistently ranked among the state\u2019s highest paid employees, earning a total of $1.17 million in salary and other performance-based payments last year.\u201cHe worked the power, in a sense, and knew what buttons to push,\u201d said Ronald Canestrari, the former majority leader of the State Assembly. \u201cThe more he produced, the more he received. He was king of the hill.\u201dMr. Percoco, who had served as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315,000 in bribes. In addition, corruption charges were announced against another former aide, a senior state official and six other people.In 2012, after Mr. Cuomo announced that the state would spend $50 million to open a medical research hub in Buffalo, modeled on what Dr. Kaloyeros had done at SUNY Polytechnic, Dr. Kaloyeros christened the Albany-Buffalo pipeline \u201cthe Andrew Cuomo 21st century high-tech innovation canal.\u201dMr. Cuomo happily reciprocated: The state owed the scientist \u201ca tremendous amount of gratitude,\u201d the governor said last year.In the sometimes drab world of state government, awash in power suits and committee hearings, Mr. Kaloyeros \u2014 with his elegant but hard-to-identify accent, his taste for John Varvatos and his wardrobe full of jeans frayed just so \u2014 openly flaunted his unconventionality.Dr. Kaloyeros\u2019s Facebook page pulsed with off-color jokes about women (\u201cI bought a Ferrari for my girlfriend,\u201d read one image he posted. \u201cBest trade ever.\u201d) and lighthearted Darth Vader memes.Raised in East Beirut, Lebanon, Dr. Kaloyeros was a 19-year-old American University student when, he later told Albany acquaintances, he was attacked by members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the early stages of Lebanon\u2019s civil war. Later, he joined a small Christian militia before immigrating to the United States, where he earned a doctorate in physics from the University of Illinois.By the early 2000s, as a State University at Albany professor, Dr. Kaloyeros was persuading state leaders to commit millions of dollars of state funds to high-tech equipment and laboratories, which he used to entice corporations and jobs to the area.\u201cWe\u2019re out to put Stanford out of business,\u201d he told the Albany Times-Union in 2002.Two of his most important political relationships were with Sheldon Silver, the former State Assembly speaker, and Joseph Bruno, the former State Senate majority leader. To keep the state money flowing, he often played the governor and the two legislative leaders off one another.By the time Dr. Kaloyeros had amassed the clout to spin off the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at SUNY Albany into the independent campus known as SUNY Polytechnic, in 2013, the state\u2019s top politicians were all but squabbling over who should receive credit for his work.Whenever questions arose about the power and the money the state had concentrated in Dr. Kaloyeros, his bosses always concluded that he had earned it.\u201cHis salary was a bargain,\u201d Mr. Constantine said.Mr. Cuomo apparently made the same calculation.The professor\u2019s face spread into a corrugated smile.\u201cStay tuned,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goodbye, Ivory Tower. Hello, Silicon Valley Candy Store.", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor eight years, Peter Coles had an economist\u2019s dream job at Harvard Business School.His research focused on the design of efficient markets, an important and growing field that has influenced such things as Treasury bill auctions and decisions on who receives organ transplants. He even got to work with Alvin E. Roth, who won a Nobel in economic science in 2012.But prestige was not enough to keep Mr. Coles at Harvard. In 2013, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. He now works at Airbnb, the online lodging marketplace, one of a number of tech companies luring economists with the promise of big sets of data and big salaries.Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute candy store for economists,\u201d Mr. Coles said.The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for a Ph.D. economist will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more.Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends \u2014 topics like recessions and currency exchange rates \u2014 and help their employers deal with them.But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they are studying the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging.Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft and up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of improved efficiency means more profit.At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic research scientist, is finely measuring the effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in economic behavior: What consumer actions occur coincidentally after people see ads, and what actions are most likely caused by the ads?At Airbnb, Mr. Coles is researching the company\u2019s marketplace of hosts and guests for insights, both to help build the business and to understand behavior. One study focuses on procrastination \u2014 a subject of great interest to behavioral economists \u2014 by looking at bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or months in advance? Do booking habits change by age, gender or country of origin?\u201cThey are microeconomic experts, heavy on data and computing tools like machine learning and writing algorithms,\u201d said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics.Understanding how digital markets work is getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian, Google\u2019s chief economist. But, he said, \u201cI thought it was fascinating years ago.\u201dMr. Varian, 69, is the godfather of the tech industry\u2019s in-house economists. Once a well-known professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Varian showed up at Google in 2002, part time at first, but soon became an employee. He helped refine Google\u2019s AdWords marketplace, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown on search pages, based on the words users type into Google\u2019s search engine.Google\u2019s insight was to avoid giving the best ad placement to the highest bidder. Mr. Varian worked to develop a different model for ad placement, calculating the probability that a user will click on an ad and find the ad relevant. It was a classic example of smart market design.Seeing this emerging job market, the National Association for Business Economics held its first meeting for technology company economists in April in San Francisco. Another is set for October in Silicon Valley.Academia is also starting to take notice \u2014 and adapt. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast, it\u2019s hard to keep up,\u201d said Susan Athey, an expert in the economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who is also a consultant to Microsoft.Many economics students also take computer science courses, and some major in both. But a new course this fall at Yale, called Designing the Digital Economy, seeks to blend economics and computer science in the way digital economists do at tech companies. The instructor is Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, and the course will have guest lecturers from Amazon, Pandora and Uber.The course is a pilot for curriculum change and perhaps a joint degree program focused on digital markets and their design. Dirk Bergemann, chairman of the Yale economics department, explained that economics was concerned with efficiency, prices and incentives, while computer science focused on algorithms and complexity.\u201cIn digital marketplaces, you are trying to address both sets of problems,\u201d he said.Mr. Weyl predicts that the rise of digital marketplaces in the economy is just getting underway. Uber in ride-hailing and Airbnb in room-renting, he said, may well be just the start of a redefinition of private property, made possible by digital technology.Things, according to Mr. Weyl, will increasingly be rented as services instead of owned. That is the long-term vision of driverless cars: When a vehicle just shows up on command, far fewer cars will sit in driveways. Transportation efficiency, resource consumption and industries will all be transformed, he said.The same could be true for household goods, Mr. Weyl said. One possible situation: After you use your espresso machine for breakfast, a drone comes to pick it up, and you rent it out for the day.A current market-design challenge for Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud computing services. These digital services, for example, face a peak-load problem, much as electric utilities do.How do you sell service at times when there is a risk some customers may be bumped off? Run an auction for what customers are willing to pay for interruptible service? Or offer set discounts for different levels of risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working on that now.To answer such questions, economists work in teams with computer scientists and people in business. In tech companies, market design involves not only economics but also engineering and marketing. How hard is a certain approach technically? How easy is it to explain to customers?\u201cEconomics influences rather than determines decisions,\u201d said Preston McAfee, Microsoft\u2019s chief economist, who previously worked at Google and Yahoo.Advertisement"}

The administration has fallen back on the 46-year-old Clean Air Act to justify emissions controls Congress would not pass.\u201cThe policy is laudable,\u201d said Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a George W.

Even if the panel splits, 5 to 5, the regulation would stand, pending an almost certain appeal to the Supreme Court.Supporters, opponents and judges all painted a picture of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate policy as sweeping and historic.\u201cThis is a huge case,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh said. \u201cIt has huge economic and political consequences. This has huge international consequences.\u201dBut opponents, led by West Virginia\u2019s solicitor general, Elbert Lin, described a regulation with a scope that far exceeds the intent of the law in an effort to transform the nation\u2019s electricity system.\u201cThe E.P.A. has invoked a little-used provision in the Clean Air Act and used it to justify creation of a new energy economy,\u201d Mr. Lin told the judges.The Environmental Protection Agency relied on an obscure provision of the Clean Air Act, Section 111 (d), last year to put forth an aggressive rule aimed at cutting planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants 32 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels.Traditionally, when the E.P.A. puts forth such a pollution reduction rule, it includes a requirement for polluting entities to purchase existing technology, such as smokestack \u201cscrubbers,\u201d to cut pollution. But no such commercially available technology exists for reducing carbon dioxide.Instead, the E.P.A. has assigned each state a target to cut emissions, and asked states to come up with comprehensive plans to do so. To meet those targets, most states would have to shut down polluting coal-fired electric plants and replace them with clean sources like wind and solar. The rule is also intended to push states to institute interstate \u201ccap-and-trade\u201d systems, allowing polluters to buy and sell allowances to pollute. If states do not produce rules, the E.P.A. will impose its own state plan, which is expected to follow the cap-and-trade model.Mr. Obama tried but failed to push a cap-and-trade bill through Congress in 2010. Opponents of the Clean Power Plan argued that Mr. Obama was using his executive authority to push through a policy he could not persuade Congress to enact.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t this debate going on on the floor of the Senate instead of with a group of unelected officials?\u201d asked Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee.Among the most prominent opponents of the plan is Laurence H. Tribe, a constitutional authority who was Mr. Obama\u2019s mentor at Harvard Law School.\u201cThis action by the E.P.A. is impermissible,\u201d Mr. Tribe told the court.\u201cImagine if Congress had been unable to pass the Americans With Disabilities Act, as it was unable to pass cap-and-trade, and if instead that same agency told states they had to each pass a mini-A.D.A., and said if they don\u2019t, we will use executive authority to put it into place?\u201d he said.The rule comes in the context of \u201cthe most urgent environmental threat our nation has ever faced,\u201d Mr. Hostetler said.Judge Sri Srinivasan, who has been mentioned as a possible nominee to the Supreme Court should Hillary Clinton be elected president, noted that the Clean Air Act and subsequent Supreme Court statute gave the E.P.A. broad authority to regulation carbon dioxide.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dispute that Congress delegates authority to regulate carbon dioxide from power plants,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a way to regulate carbon dioxide.\u201dOpponents also brought up a question about the rule raised by clerical error in a 1990 update of the Clean Air Act. That update accidentally included conflicting versions of the amendment. There is a House version, which by some readings could forbid the E.P.A. from regulating carbon dioxide from power plants if it also regulates other pollutants under a different section of the law. A Senate version would more clearly appear to permit double regulation. But the frustrated judges seemed to find the matter unclear.Judge Kavanaugh told Mr. Lin that his justification, in the legal briefings, for reading only the House provision \u201cis a hall of mirrors.\u201dHe added, \u201cI needed a drink after going through all your footnotes.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the president who appointed Judge David Tatel to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He was appointed by President Bill Clinton, not by President Obama.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Become a C.E.O.? The Quickest Path Is a Winding One", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrail of the ChiefHow does a person get to be the boss? What does it take for an ambitious young person starting a career to reach upper rungs of the corporate world \u2014 the C.E.O.\u2019s office, or other jobs that come with words like \u201cchief\u201d or \u201cvice president\u201d on the office door?The answer has always included hard work, brains, leadership ability and luck. But in the 21st century, another, less understood attribute seems to be particularly important.To get a job as a top executive, new evidence shows, it helps greatly to have experience in as many of a business\u2019s functional areas as possible. A person who burrows down for years in, say, the finance department stands less of a chance of reaching a top executive job than a corporate finance specialist who has also spent time in, say, marketing. Or engineering. Or both of those, plus others.However, there is still such a thing as too much variety: Switching industries has a negative correlation with corporate success, which may speak to the importance of building relationships and experience within an industry. Switching between companies within an industry neither helps nor hurts in making it to a top job.This interactive graphic shows how different traits affected a former consultant\u2019s likelihood of ending up as a top executive of a midsize or large company.While some of this might sound intuitive, and top executives have always needed to have grounding in a range of specialties, huge collections of data about individuals have only recently made it possible to analyze in such detail what traits and experiences seem to predict success in the job market.In effect, the increased ability to collect and analyze such troves of data raises the possibility that in the future we\u2019ll be able to better understand what types of education the workers of the future most need, how companies can best recruit future star performers and how individuals can position themselves to benefit from shifts in what skills the modern economy most rewards.There is a lot of work to be done to get to that point. But this early evidence suggests that success in the business world isn\u2019t just about brainpower or climbing a linear path to the top, but about accumulating diverse skills and showing an ability to learn about fields outside one\u2019s comfort zone.\u201cWork used to be much more hierarchical, and in many instances rote,\u201d said Gary Pinkus, McKinsey & Company\u2019s managing partner for North America. \u201cYou could build a nice career within any particular function by taking on more responsibility within that specialty. But if you look at most companies now, work has become incredibly cross-functional.\u201dOnce upon a time, Mr. Pinkus said, an operations manager might be laser-focused on making a factory work efficiently. Now to be great at that job \u2014 and earn a promotion to vice president or beyond \u2014 that manager had better also understand how the factory\u2019s inventory procedures tie in with the company\u2019s sales and marketing strategy, and any tax laws affecting inventory management, while assuring the reliability of the supply chain.The manager had better also be adept at using the technology that links all that information together.Marc Andreessen, the prominent venture capitalist, has gone so far as to call this the \u201csecret formula to becoming a C.E.O.\u201d The most successful corporate leaders, he wrote, \u201care almost never the best product visionaries, or the best salespeople, or the best marketing people, or the best finance people, or even the best managers, but they are top 25 percent in some set of those skills, and then all of a sudden they\u2019re qualified to actually run something important.\u201dGeorge Kurian was a young engineer at Oracle in the early 1990s, helping build database software. Then a manager pushed him to break out of his software engineering silo and see what it was like to deal with potential customers.That\u2019s when things got interesting.\u201cI had built a set of technologies I thought were groundbreaking,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cI went into this meeting expecting I was going to bring my engineering skills and wow this customer with our amazing technology. She asked, \u2018Who built this piece of software?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes, that was me.\u2019 \u201dHer next comment, though, wasn\u2019t what Mr. Kurian expected at all.\u201cShe said, \u2018You have no idea what my day looks like,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Kurian recalled.The software didn\u2019t solve the problems the customer actually had. The valuable lesson for the young engineer? Work that seems impressive on an engineering level isn\u2019t always what will most satisfy paying clients.As a product manager, Mr. Kurian added sales and marketing and team management to his engineering background. He later did a stint as a strategy consultant, which he recalls as a crash course in quickly synthesizing information about unfamiliar situations. He considers the combination of all of these areas a key to his path to becoming chief executive of NetApp, a data storage company with a $10 billion market value.He represents one common way to collect experience across functions: Within a larger company, pursue opportunities that are adjacent to, yet different from, existing expertise.\u201cPeople tend to think of their career as a linear progression,\u201d he said. \u201cI think having a nonlinear career progression helped me.\u201dThe LinkedIn data doesn\u2019t address causality. Did Mr. Kurian advance to a C.E.O. job because he gained experience across different functions, or did the traits that led him to take on a variety of assignments in his career also lead to his being an attractive candidate for top jobs? And the former consultants who created detailed LinkedIn profiles may be different in some systematic way from those who did not, which would distort the results.Beyond the results on job functions, the data from LinkedIn shows some trends for which the explanations aren\u2019t completely obvious. For example, former consultants who lived in New York or Los Angeles had higher odds of ending up with a top job than people in other large cities like Washington or Houston. A former management consultant with 15 years of work experience in six different functions and an M.B.A. from a top school had a 66 percent chance of becoming a top executive if he lived in New York compared with a 38 percent chance in Washington.But regardless of how exactly the cause and effect works and how the consultants analyzed might be different from others who weren\u2019t included in the sample, there is evidence that more top jobs in business require an ability to meld knowledge from different fields.Burning Glass found a 53 percent rise in the number of openings for hybrid jobs requiring both technological and business acumen from 2011 to 2015, for jobs like product management and marketing analytics.\u201cThe common theme that we see in the jobs that are the fastest-growing and have the highest value for employers and job seekers is this set of jobs that require a mix of skills that don\u2019t tend to ride together in nature,\u201d said Matthew Sigelman, the chief executive of Burning Glass.There are ways a young person can gain experience across functions that aren\u2019t a matter of taking on different assignments within a big company. Marla Malcolm Beck embodies this other, more entrepreneurial path.Ms. Beck worked in consulting right out of college in the mid-1990s, then studied at Harvard Business School and worked briefly in private equity. But she found the work unfulfilling, and in 1999 started Blue Mercury as an online seller of beauty products. Soon after, as the dot-com boom turned bust, the company pivoted toward physical stores.Ms. Beck built Blue Mercury into a 109-store chain. Macy\u2019s acquired the company for $210 million last year, and she remains its chief executive.In her days as a consultant she had worked on projects like figuring out the pricing of mutual funds and re-engineering the claims process for an insurance company. As a retail C.E.O., she essentially trained herself across the various functions it takes to make a retail business work: inventory and supply chain management, information technology systems and everything else.She acted as the company\u2019s chief financial officer even as it grew, entrusting routine accounting to a controller but doing the strategic work of forecasting and financial modeling herself. Some fields have come easier to her than others. \u201cI think I\u2019m almost too logical for some of the emotion around marketing,\u201d she said.Her approach has been to break down each of these new areas in which she had to immerse herself as a start-up founder the way she once did in unfamiliar fields as a consultant.\u201cWhat I really learned from those experiences was how to break down even the most complicated processes into their most minuscule components,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an approach that you can use to tackle any process in any organization.\u201dIn hiring at Blue Mercury\u2019s corporate headquarters in Washington, she has focused less on traditional retail industry experience and more on people who have a comfort with engineering processes, skills they can apply to whatever urgent task arises.In other words, she didn\u2019t become chief executive by getting loads of experience across functions. Rather, she took some core analytical skills and used them to learn to develop experience in those functions as she went.There are some parallels with programs that the biggest companies have long operated to deliberately rotate promising young executives across different divisions, to ensure that as they hit midcareer they have broad experience. The challenge can be to replicate that kind of experience even in a world where few people sign on with a single large employer for decades.To be a C.E.O. or other top executive, said Guy Berger, an economist at LinkedIn, \u201cyou need to understand how the different parts of a company work and how they interact with each other and understand how other people do their job, even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t know well enough to do yourself.\u201dKai Monahan embodies a third pathway through different specialties into top executive jobs. He didn\u2019t start his own company, like Ms. Beck, or gradually add different layers of experience that were adjacent to his previous job, like Mr. Kurian.Rather, at some key junctures he jumped headlong into an entirely new function. In 1999, he left the (now defunct) accounting and consulting firm Arthur Andersen, where he had worked on projects to transform businesses, for Ernst & Young, where he focused on risk management, a less sexy field that became more in demand after the accounting scandals at Enron and others starting in 2001. In 2008, he joined Nationwide Insurance as its chief audit executive, before quickly moving out of the back office and into selling financial products to consumers in an operational role. He became president of Nationwide\u2019s mortgage business in 2014.It helped that he had an early mentor who encouraged him to take risks in his career by taking on jobs he was unfamiliar with \u2014 and bosses willing to take a chance on assigning him jobs he wasn\u2019t qualified for on paper.After all, if you assign, say, an accounting specialist to run a logistics operation, there\u2019s a chance that person will fail. What\u2019s best for the employee who wants to get broad experience to help climb the ranks may not be what is best for the employer who wants deeply experienced people in every job.\u201cThere\u2019s comfort in familiarity,\u201d Mr. Monahan said. \u201cLeaders can be reluctant to hire someone who doesn\u2019t have directly applicable experience. That\u2019s still a mind-set that is fairly prevalent.\u201dBut how does one navigate into sharply different functional specialties while also dealing with new colleagues and a new organizational culture? \u201cIf you\u2019re in your comfort zone, it\u2019s very easy to stay in your comfort zone,\u201d said Paul McDonald, a senior executive director at the recruitment firm Robert Half International.\u201cWhat was critical for me in going into new functional areas was breaking that habit of feeling like you have to know it all,\u201d Mr. Monahan said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re honest with yourself and with others in terms of your need for their support and involvement, generally people are willing to share with you what they know and help you be successful.\u201dIn other words, the path to the executive suite may be long and winding, and include stops in many different types of specialties. But the key to navigating it is being able to learn from others all along the way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cher\u2019s Latest Road Show? The Campaign Trail", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCher\u2019s first brush with politics was an act of teenage civil disobedience. It was right before the election of 1960. And she came home one day horrified to discover that her mother and stepfather had festooned their house in Hollywood with Richard Nixon paraphernalia.Cher purged it all.First she ripped the Nixon yard signs out of their front lawn. And after her mother fished them out of the garbage and put them back up, Cher found a more permanent solution.\u201cI took them to my girlfriend\u2019s house, and we threw them in her trash,\u201d she told me by phone from California the other day, the mischievousness and pride still in her voice after all those years.But the signs weren\u2019t all she got her hands on. \u201cAlso threw out those hideous straw hats with Nixon on them,\u201d she said.In many ways, Cher is the perfect political counterpart to Mr. Trump. Like him, she has always been defiantly indifferent toward her critics. Also like Mr. Trump, no one holds her to the rigid standards of campaign conduct, giving her license to say what she wants without all the consequences. Imagine for a minute that another septuagenarian supporter of Hillary Clinton like Madeleine Albright tweeted side-by-side pictures of John Gotti and Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s recently departed campaign chairman, and offered this critique: \u201cFYI.. Manafort\u2026John Gotti called..he wants his look back!!\u201dIf there was ever a presidential election perfect for a Cher moment, this is it. Personality, outrage and a quick-off-the-keyboard insult are the political currency of 2016.She has earned a reputation as one of the more effective and entertaining Trump neutralizers on Twitter, largely because she can go toe-to-toe with him both in the sheer volume of tweets she fires off (19,000 and counting) and in her lacerating, no-filter style. She often won\u2019t refer to Mr. Trump by name, for example, but with the toilet emoji. (And that is one of her few jokes that is printable here.)Now she is getting marquee billing on the campaign trail. The Clinton campaign realized the weapon it had at its disposal and reasoned that Cher would be a hit at fund-raisers \u2014 especially those with a larger than average guest list of gay men. She headlined three of them last month, in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, Fire Island and Provincetown, Mass. \u201cI\u2019m such an obvious person,\u201d she told me, \u201cto bring that message to, as I call them, my people.\u201d\u201cI think the one thing that I am,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m honest. And I say what I think.\u201dShe is self-aware enough to know her impetuousness may cause trouble for her and Mrs. Clinton. That is why she sheepishly acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019m trying not to use any bad words.\u201dI told her this when we had our first phone call because she wouldn\u2019t let me start the interview until I submitted to a minor grilling.\u201cI have to ask you a question,\u201d she said before I could get a word out. \u201cBecause most people think that if you\u2019re famous that you don\u2019t deserve an opinion. And so why are you calling me?\u201dI\u2019ve followed her career, the farewells, the reinventions, the public degradation and adulation, for quite a while. When I was in seventh grade, my performance in the talent show was to lip-sync Sonny and Cher\u2019s \u201cI Got You Babe.\u201d I was Cher, dressed in a hip-length black wig and a pair of my mom\u2019s old bell bottoms.I always thought Cher had a unique voice, and in more than just song.She told me she was so strongly moved to oppose Mr. Trump not solely because of his politics but because she felt he was dangerously misguided and intemperate. Ronald Reagan, she said, was a Republican she disagreed with politically but did not fear personally.\u201cHe did nothing for AIDS, and he just stood back when people were dying,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there were things that you could say, \u2018He makes a good president\u2019 \u2014 for some people. But I wasn\u2019t frightened really that he could bring the country to his knees because he knew nothing about how to govern.\u201dShe says she is no fan of the government and has little confidence it can solve the employment problems that come with a rapidly changing economy, which she blames on cold, impersonal decisions made by dollar-driven chief executives.\u201cIt\u2019s criminal what\u2019s happened to these people who had great jobs in Detroit, who worked in steel in Pittsburgh,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost respect for everything that doesn\u2019t make money.\u201d Or for jobs that don\u2019t require four-year college degrees, she added: \u201cThe janitor at my school, we called him \u2018Mr.\u2019\u201dPolitics have been at the periphery of Cher\u2019s life since the 1960s. Her first husband would become one of the country\u2019s most famous Republicans: Mr. Bono, who was the mayor of Palm Springs and a congressman for two terms until he died in a skiing accident in 1998.\u201cWhen Sonny and I were married, he was a Democrat,\u201d she said, recalling how thrilled he sounded after returning from the 1968 Democratic National Convention. \u201cHe said, \u2018Oh my God, Cher, I met this amazing guy McGovern,\u2019\u201d meaning George McGovern, the former senator from South Dakota, who ran for the Democratic nomination that year and lost.Cher did not expect much more than a tour that night. But she said that as she was downstairs in the White House basement looking at Mary Todd Lincoln\u2019s china collection, Amy Carter, the president\u2019s daughter, summoned her: \u201cAmy came down and said, \u2018Mama wants you to have dinner.\u2019\u201dI wondered, did she ever want to get in the game and run for office? \u201cNot even for a hot second,\u201d she assured me. She could never live with herself, she said, if she had to hold her tongue. \u201cIt would ruin me as a person.\u201dIn 1988, Cher publicly backed Michael Dukakis, who was not the only Dukakis she got to know. That year, she won an Oscar for her lead role in \u201cMoonstruck.\u201d Starring as Cher\u2019s mother in the film was Olympia Dukakis, Mr. Dukakis\u2019s cousin.Cher\u2019s support for Mrs. Clinton started with her Senate campaign and, later, in 2008 with her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination against Barack Obama.The similarities between the two women struck me as something that must have affected Cher. They are just a few years apart in age. Cher is 70. Mrs. Clinton is 68. They both triumphed in male-dominated professions and faced their own career humiliations and rebirths.But when I asked her about it, she wouldn\u2019t hear it. \u201cI have to stop you right there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s a woman does not \u2014 I don\u2019t care.\u201dWhen she was a child, she said, the idea of a female president was so foreign to the way she saw politics that she thought electing a woman might even be against the law. \u201cI\u2019m so blessed to be alive to see a woman president,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m so angry at the fact that I feel blessed \u2014 that it\u2019s not something that\u2019s natural.\u201d\u201cAnd even if they don\u2019t like Hillary, and many women don\u2019t,\u201d she added, they have to think to themselves \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to risk my children\u2019s future to this guy.\u201dDespite running in overlapping social circles for years \u2014 she and Mr. Trump were regulars in Aspen, Colo. \u2014 Cher said she has never met this man she has such disdain for. She said she would occasionally see him at Mezzaluna, a hot spot in Aspen that they both frequented. That cemented her opinion early on. \u201cI just thought, \u2018What an. \u2026\u201dShe stopped herself. She is trying not to use bad words anymore.An article last Sunday about Cher\u2019s political activism misstated the location of one of the Hillary Clinton\u2019s fund-raising events attended by the singer. It was held in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, not Miami Beach.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a President Trump Could Start a Trade War With Surprising Ease", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceAmericans often dismiss populist promises that emerge on the presidential campaign trail because they are unlikely to be passed by Congress. Should Donald J. Trump get elected, Congress most likely would moderate his proposals to cut taxes, increase spending and even to build a border wall.But international trade policy is one area where a President Trump could unilaterally deliver on the changes that he has promised.The result is that the usual checks and balances don\u2019t apply. (For anyone wondering, yes, the same rules would apply to Hillary Clinton if she were elected.)Typically, congressional gridlock prevents presidential elections from causing wild swings in policy. For a protectionist president, it has the opposite effect, strengthening his hand. The only way that Congress could block Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda is by passing new legislation to repeal or alter the powers it has previously delegated to the president. But this would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate to override a likely presidential veto.Even that might not be enough, if the courts hold that the president\u2019s constitutional power over foreign affairs can be used to terminate trade agreements.Mr. Hufbauer\u2019s analysis is already causing waves among policy wonks in Washington and economists on Wall Street.Beyond these emergency powers, two separate Cold War-era statutes also give the president power to regulate international trade. Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, the president can raise tariffs as necessary to strengthen national security. Mr. Trump\u2019s rationale for raising tariffs against Mexico or China probably meet this standard.Alternatively, the president can impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days to deal with balance of payments deficits, under the Trade Act of 1974. Another section of that act gives the president the power to levy a tariff to retaliate against unfair trade practices, and this could easily be invoked against China, citing allegations of exchange rate manipulation.With so many different legal rationales, it seems almost certain that if Mr. Trump became president, he would have the power to create a more isolated American economy.Of course, his actions would anger our global trading partners. Their remedies are limited, though. After all, even the World Trade Organization recognizes the need for national security exceptions to its rules. Even if Mr. Trump were found to breach their rules, the only recourse for other countries would be to retaliate by raising their own tariffs. It\u2019s a prospect that scares many economists, but appears not to worry Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}

She caught up with Mr. McAdam and Marni Walden, a rising star at Verizon who is expected to oversee the Yahoo business after the deal is complete, by phone, according to people briefed on the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Yahoo recently discovered that at least 500 million of its user accounts had been breached by hackers two years ago, well before the two companies began talks. Yahoo and law enforcement officials were scrambling to unwind the intrusion.After calling Mr. McAdam and Ms. Walden, Ms. Mayer phoned Tim Armstrong, who leads the AOL business at Verizon and will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo, according to the people briefed on the conversation. Again, the news was not good.The calls set off a flurry of questions at Verizon \u2014 How could this possibly have happened? Who was behind it? Why is it only becoming known now? Could this jeopardize the deal? \u2014 but also the sounding of an alarm and the deployment of a triage team to assist Yahoo.The telecom giant directed its online security experts, including Chandra McMahon, Verizon\u2019s chief information security officer, to do their own investigation of the hack. And they enlisted the help of Verizon\u2019s security division, part of its enterprise solutions business, which helps companies defend against and manage hacks.Now, just a few days after Verizon learned of the breach, it is contending with the ramifications of what is believed to be the largest hack of a single company. Even as Verizon tries to assess the damage at Yahoo and prevent further security intrusions, the scope of the hack and the potential fallout \u2014 including the possibility of a costly class-action lawsuit \u2014 are inevitably prompting renewed scrutiny of a deal that was intended to transform the telecom behemoth into a digital media powerhouse.Simple tips to follow if you think your personal information online has been exposed to hackers.For now, Verizon has given no indication of whether the breach will affect its plans to acquire Yahoo. On Friday, the company declined to provide a comment beyond a statement it issued on Thursday, in which it said it would evaluate the situation \u201cas the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities.\u201dOn Friday, Yahoo said, \u201cOur investigation into this matter is ongoing and the issues are complex.\u201dThe effort is complicated because the sales proceedings between Verizon and Yahoo are at an early stage. Though teams from the two companies were already working together on integration plans, Verizon does not yet own Yahoo. As a result, Verizon does not have direct access to the Silicon Valley company\u2019s servers to conduct its own investigation.In late July, after the Verizon deal was announced, Yahoo became aware of a claim that about 280 million of its user credentials had been hacked, according to a person briefed on the specifics, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Yahoo started an investigation but could not substantiate the claim, this person said. It was not clear on Friday whether Yahoo had made Verizon aware that it was looking into this claim in July.During the course of that investigation, Yahoo learned of the more severe breach, which it has said it believes was state-sponsored. Yahoo has not yet said exactly when it realized how large the intrusion was, leaving open the question of whether Ms. Mayer and her team waited to notify Verizon of the hack. Yahoo is now working with outside security consultants and said its investigation was continuing.Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College Law School, said Verizon had two main options if it decided to use the hack as leverage in setting the terms of the deal.\u201cThey could say, \u2018This thing is huge. We want to walk away from the transaction,\u2019\u201d he said. Were Verizon to try to claim that the breach was so severe it was grounds to terminate the deal, it would have to prove that the hack amounted to a material adverse effect on the value of Yahoo.Such claims can be difficult to prove in court. According to Mr. Quinn\u2019s reading of the merger document for the deal, Verizon would most likely have to prove that certain high-level Yahoo employees were aware of the severity of the hack before the deal was agreed upon, and intentionally withheld that information.More likely, Mr. Quinn said, Verizon could pressure Yahoo to renegotiate the terms of the deal.\u201cThey go to court, or threaten to go to court, and renegotiate the price,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can be a very winning strategy.\u201dFind out which parts of your identity may have been stolen in major hacking attacks over the last four years.Like any big company contemplating an acquisition, Verizon performed due diligence on Yahoo before it agreed to the deal. It was not immediately clear, however, how seriously it took security issues during that process.But Verizon would have known that Yahoo has a history of breaches. In 2012, Yahoo said that more than 450,000 user accounts had been hacked.\u201cWith this concerted action and a series of high-profile strikes on businesses including eBay, Target and Yahoo, the risks of cyberattack are evident,\u201d they wrote.\u201cYet as the global economy recovers and deal activity rises,\u201d the report continues, \u201cincreasing awareness of cyber-risk has not resulted in meaningful changes\u201d to the mergers and acquisition process.Those motivations are unlikely to have changed in the course of two months. But it remains unclear whether this new information has made Yahoo a less desirable acquisition target.Some of Verizon\u2019s executives have indicated they may be up to the challenge of a big hack. In a recent talk at Penn State University, Ms. McMahon, the telecom company\u2019s chief information security officer, suggested that she relished the cat-and-mouse game between hackers and companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. Job Shift From Mexico Tests a Trump Premise", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisIn the realm of international trade, it is a truism seemingly as consistent as gravity: Jobs and investment flow from north to south, while manufactured goods travel the other way around. Factories in the United States and Canada shutter as work shifts to Mexico and Central America, where human hands do it more cheaply.One might reflexively assume that this turn effectively validates a central promise made repeatedly by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential aspirant. Loudly and frequently, Mr. Trump has vowed to yank jobs back to America from Mexico, using shame, executive fiat and his uniquely Trumpian form of threats to make it happen. Here was apparent proof that such a goal was doable.Except life turns out to be more complicated than that.The General Motors deal does indeed signal that work can today wind up transferred seemingly anywhere \u2014 never mind the well-pounded pathway of north to south. In an era of increasingly sophisticated manufacturing that relies more on computers and robotics than low-wage hands, centers of innovation like Canada and the United States will exert a greater pull than before.This plays well to Mr. Trump\u2019s premise that a robust era of American job growth awaits, if only the nation selects a president with the audacity to set aside the niceties of trade agreements and begin acting like a self-interested superpower, dictating the terms of commerce. And it speaks to one group of voters that has embraced him \u2014 dispossessed factory workers prone to blaming globalization for lost jobs, declining wages and financial anxiety.But consider this deal more of a caveat added to the dominant narrative than some revolutionary twist to the story of globalization.\u201cYou can bring some jobs back, but they will likely be more of a drip than a big flow,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economic adviser in the Obama administration, and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. \u201cTrump has a very nostalgic view of globalization, circa 1950.\u201d\u201cBroadly speaking, the trends that have hurt communities here in terms of trade and trade deficits are very much ongoing, and if that gets turned around, it\u2019s not going to be about bringing all the old jobs back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about forging new sectors like advanced manufacturing.\u201dWhich is to say, sectors where a handful of highly skilled people with degrees and technical prowess earn a good deal of money. And lesser-educated workers \u2014 the ones who lost jobs to China and Mexico and are now embracing Mr. Trump \u2014 continue to be left behind.Far from representing a reversal of course, the G.M. deal then underscores how multinationals are fine-tuning their approach to making things. They are increasingly differentiating between more labor-intensive manufacturing \u2014 tasks like stitching bluejeans and snapping together cellphone cases \u2014 and more advanced, machine-intensive pursuits that rely on automation and software.Given that state-of-the-art products fetch a higher price, it is presumably worth paying a premium to the limited numbers of humans involved in their creation \u2014 and especially since this buys proximity to the minds that dream up lucrative new visions. The Canadian plant getting the jobs sits near Waterloo, the birthplace of the BlackBerry, which is something like Canada\u2019s Silicon Valley.The union in Canada won something headline-grabbing \u2014 jobs retrieved from Mexico. But it also relented on a major objective sought by G.M.: Workers gave up the fight to retain old-fashioned pensions that pay out fixed amounts. They accepted newfangled plans that see benefits fluctuate with the markets.Far from proof that Canadian workers have somehow recaptured the upper hand in jockeying for the spoils of globalization, this deal is just the latest evidence that companies have effectively used international factories to permanently tilt the power dynamics in their favor.For decades, global automakers have been on the march for lower costs. In the United States, they shifted factories from union strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin to Southern states like South Carolina and Alabama, where union ranks were weak and local rules limited labor organizing.Then, they kept moving south, to Mexico, exploiting a series of trade deals \u2014 not least the North American Free Trade Agreement. A quarter century ago, the then-American presidential candidate, Ross Perot, spoke of a \u201cgiant sucking sound\u201d in warning that factory work was being vacuumed up by Mexico, with American communities abandoned.For workers in Canada and Mexico, the impacts were evident. They had to satisfy the demands of auto manufacturers locked in an increasingly global competition. They had to make concessions. Otherwise, the car companies could employ their demonstrated power to leave them behind, moving the work to places where labor was cheaper and more pliable.The G.M. deal affirms this reality. Labor paid a price for gaining jobs in Canada \u2014 downgraded retirement.Above all, the deal underscores the potency of markets in shaping what happens in commercial life, a force far more powerful than demagogues making dubious promises about tearing up trade deals.Canada\u2019s unions are relatively strong, and the nation\u2019s currency is relatively weak, making Canadian-made goods cheaper in the global marketplace. G.M. was willing to pay for access to highly skilled working hands, provided it got a break on its pension contributions.These factors coalesced into a negotiated result. The jobs did not come back to Canada because of the sort of edict Mr. Trump has promised to unleash, somehow compelling global companies to stop making things in Mexico and resume making them in the United States.\u201cThe central Trump fallacy here is that the president can tell multinational companies what to do,\u201d said Mr. Bernstein, the former Obama administration economic adviser.\u201cThat\u2019s completely wrong, I\u2019ve seen that firsthand. President Obama was constantly exhorting companies to create more jobs, and they\u2019ll only do so if they want to,\u201d he added. \u201cSimply calling multinational C.E.O.s from the Oval Office and yelling at them isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201dIf Mr. Trump really did seek to dictate to General Motors (or any company) where it can make its wares, that would risk undermining the company\u2019s competitiveness.If, under threat of political action, a company had to buy steel from an American producer instead of China, that could make its cars more expensive than competing models from Honda or Hyundai.If they had to use American workers for final assembly instead of Mexicans, that could damage their business and undercut sales for many suppliers, from glassmakers in Ohio to auto parts manufacturers in Indiana.\u201cThen,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, \u201cthose jobs that came back from Mexico aren\u2019t going to be any jobs at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Big Blast in North Korea, and Big Questions on U.S. Policy", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisGENEVA \u2014 North Korea\u2019s latest test of an atomic weapon leaves the United States with an uncomfortable choice: Stick with a policy of incremental sanctions that has clearly failed to stop the country\u2019s nuclear advances, or pick among alternatives that range from the highly risky to the repugnant.A hard embargo, in which Washington and its allies block all shipping into and out of North Korea and seek to paralyze its finances, risks confrontations that allies in Asia fear could quickly escalate into war. But restarting talks on the North\u2019s terms would reward the defiance of its young leader, Kim Jong-un, with no guarantee that he will dismantle the nuclear program irrevocably.Speaking in Geneva early Saturday morning after announcing a deal with Russia over the Syrian conflict, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States was willing to negotiate with North Korea, but only if it agreed that the goal of those talks was for it to give up its weapons. \u201cWe have made overture after overture to the dictator of North Korea,\u201d he said, including on normalizing the country\u2019s relationship with the West and a formal peace agreement to replace the 1953 armistice that halted the Korean War but not the state of hostilities.\u201cAll Kim Jong-un needs to do is say, \u2018I\u2019m prepared to talk about denuclearization,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kerry said.Mr. Kim has rejected that, making it clear that whatever his grandfather and father intended, his nuclear program is for deterrence and strength, but not a bargaining chip.For more than seven years, President Obama has adopted a policy of gradually escalating sanctions that the White House once called \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d But the test on Friday \u2014 the North\u2019s fifth and most powerful blast yet, perhaps with nearly twice the strength of its last one \u2014 eliminates any doubt that that approach has failed and that the North has mastered the basics of detonating a nuclear weapon.Despite escalating sanctions and the country\u2019s technological backwardness, North Korea appears to have gotten past a rocky beginning with its nuclear tests, and enjoyed a burst of progress in its missile program over the last two years. American experts warn that it is speeding toward a day when it will be able to threaten the West Coast of the United States and perhaps the entire country.\u201cThis is not a cry for negotiations,\u201d said Victor Cha, who served in the administration of President George W. Bush and now is a North Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThis is very clearly a serious effort at amassing real nuclear capabilities that they can use to deter the U.S. and others.\u201dMr. Cha said the usual response from Washington, Seoul and Tokyo \u2014 for another round of sanctions \u2014 was not likely to be any more successful at changing the North\u2019s behavior than previous rounds. That means Mr. Obama\u2019s successor will confront a nuclear and missile program far more advanced than the one Mr. Obama began grappling with in 2009.In a statement Friday, Mr. Obama condemned the North\u2019s test and said it \u201cfollows an unprecedented campaign of ballistic missile launches, which North Korea claims are intended to serve as delivery vehicles intended to target the United States and our allies.\u201d\u201cTo be clear, the United States does not, and never will, accept North Korea as a nuclear state,\u201d he said.Many experts who have dealt with North Korea say the United States may have no choice but to do so.\u201cIt\u2019s too late on the nuclear weapons program \u2014 that is not going to be reversed,\u201d William Perry, the defense secretary under President Bill Clinton during the 1994 nuclear crisis with North Korea, said in August at a presentation in Kent, Conn. The only choice now, he argued, is to focus on limiting the missile program.Yet the latest effort to do that, an agreement between the United States and South Korea to deploy an advanced missile defense system in the South, has inflamed China, which argues the system is also aimed at its weapons. While American officials deny that, the issue has divided Washington and Beijing so sharply that it will be even more difficult now for them to come up with a joint strategy for dealing with the North.China has been so vocal with its displeasure over the deployment of the American system that Mr. Kim may have concluded he could afford to upset Beijing by conducting Friday\u2019s test.Fueling that perception were reports that a North Korean envoy visited Beijing earlier this week.\u201cNorth Korea almost certainly sees this as an opportunity to take steps to enhance its nuclear and missile capabilities with little risk that China will do anything in response,\u201d Evans J.R. Revere, a former State Department official and North Korea specialist, said in a speech in Seoul on Friday.But Mr. Obama noted that sanctions had failed at having much effect. That is largely because the Chinese have left open large loopholes that have kept the North Korean economy alive and, by some measures, enjoying more trade than at any time in years.The United Nations Security Council, meeting in emergency consultations, agreed early Friday evening to work \u201cimmediately\u201d on drafting a resolution imposing new sanctions on North Korea, the council\u2019s president for September, Ambassador Gerard van Bohemen of New Zealand, told reporters.In a recent paper, two researchers concluded that sanctions so far \u201chave had the net effect of actually improving\u201d North Korea\u2019s procurement capabilities for its weapons program. To evade sanctions, the North\u2019s state-run trading companies opened offices in China, hired more capable Chinese middlemen and paid higher fees to employ more sophisticated brokers, according to the scholars Jim Walsh of M.I.T. and John Park of Harvard.The sanctions, Mr. Cha noted, \u201care supposed to inflict enough pain so the regime comes back to the negotiation table, and that\u2019s clearly not working; or it\u2019s supposed to collapse the regime until it starves, and that\u2019s not working either.\u201d\u201cUnless China is willing to cut off everything, which they don\u2019t appear willing to do, the sanctions may be politically the right thing to do and a requisite response, but they are not the answer to the problem,\u201d he said.That means the choices facing Mr. Obama\u2019s successor will be stark. One option is to choke off all trade, in part by telling banks that conduct transactions with North Korea that they will be shut out of dealing in dollars around the world \u2014 an effective tactic against Iran before last year\u2019s nuclear deal. But that would enrage the Chinese, and probably cut into cooperation on other issues.At the same time, an attempt to intercept all shipping could quickly escalate into a full-blown conflict, something neither Mr. Obama nor the South Koreans and Japanese have been willing to risk.On the other hand, reopening negotiations, which Donald J. Trump has indicated he is willing to consider, could mean paying North Korea again to freeze nuclear activities that the Bush administration and the Clinton administration had already rewarded it for stopping years ago.On Friday, the test became fodder for the American presidential campaign. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign issued a statement that read, in part, \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s fifth nuclear test, the fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, is yet one more example of Hillary Clinton\u2019s catastrophic failures as secretary of state.\u201dA statement from Mrs. Clinton said that she supported Mr. Obama\u2019s approach on sanctions, and that \u201cthis is another reminder that America must elect a president who can confront the threats we face with steadiness and strength.\u201dThe nuclear program dates back to Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the country\u2019s founder, who emerged from the Korean War more than 60 years ago mindful that the United States had considered using nuclear weapons in that conflict and determined to get his own arsenal.The missile program also has a long history, mostly to deliver conventional arms. But now the two are converging, as the North races to develop a weapon small, light and durable enough to be launched into space and survive re-entry into the atmosphere.The explosive energy unleashed during the test on Friday, estimated at 10 to 12 kilotons of TNT, was nearly twice that of the North\u2019s last test, conducted in January, said Yoo Yong-gyu, a senior seismologist at South Korea\u2019s National Meteorological Administration.And the fact that North Korea\u2019s fifth test came only eight months after its fourth is another indication that it is making fast progress toward fitting its ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads, said Choi Kang, a senior analyst at the Asan Institute. The North had waited about three years between each of its previous tests.North Korea\u2019s advances have unnerved its neighbors in South Korea and Japan, and Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that the two nations should pay more for the United States to defend them has not helped.Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in Seongnam, south of Seoul, argued that a South Korean nuclear program might distract the North from its efforts to build a long-range missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the mainland United States.\u201cIf South Korea arms itself with nuclear weapons, North Korea will regard the South Korean nuclear weapons, not the distant American nukes, as the most direct threat to its security,\u201d Mr. Cheong said.David E. Sanger reported from Geneva, Choe Sang-hun from Seoul, South Korea, and Jane Perlez from Beijing. Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Trickle-Up Economics", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe expected good news; but last year, it turns out, the economy partied like it was 1999. And this tells us something very important \u2014 namely, that a government that wants to can make American society more equitable, improving the quality of life for ordinary families.The reports showed strong progress on three fronts: rapid growth in the incomes of ordinary families \u2014 median income rose a remarkable 5.2 percent; a substantial decline in the poverty rate; and a significant further rise in health insurance coverage after 2014\u2019s gains. It was a trifecta that we haven\u2019t hit since, yes, 1999.It\u2019s true that the surge in median income comes after years of disappointment, and even now the typical family\u2019s income, adjusted for inflation, is slightly lower than it was before the financial crisis. But the percentage of Americans without health insurance is now at a record low. And the overall performance of the Obama economy has given the lie to much of the criticism leveled at President Obama\u2019s policies.But there was also something of a policy debate. Republicans accused Mr. Obama of being a \u201credistributionist,\u201d taking money away from \u201cjob creators\u201d to give free stuff to the 47 percent. And they claimed that these socialistic policies were destroying incentives and blocking economic recovery.Conservatives predicted disaster from these initiatives. Tax hikes on the rich, they insisted, would stall the economy. Obamacare\u2019s combination of regulation and subsidies, they declared, would kill millions of jobs without increasing the number of Americans with insurance.You might ask whether these numbers reflect reality. It\u2019s often claimed that Americans aren\u2019t feeling any economic recovery \u2014 and if anyone were to ask Mr. Trump, he would no doubt claim that the Census numbers, like every number he doesn\u2019t like, are cooked.So the good news is real. And it should (but won\u2019t) finally break the grip of trickle-down ideology on much of our political class.You know how the argument goes: Any attempt to help working families directly, we\u2019re told, will backfire by hurting the economy as a whole. So we must cut taxes on those \u201cjob creators\u201d instead, counting on a rising tide to raise all boats.It would be an exaggeration to say that the Obama administration has done the reverse, but there definitely was an element of trickle-up economics in its response to the Great Recession: Much of the stimulus involved expanding the social safety net, not just to protect the vulnerable, but to increase purchasing power and sustain demand. And in general Obama-era policies have tried to help families directly, rather than by showering benefits on the rich and hoping that the benefits trickle down.Now the results of this policy experiment are in, and they\u2019re not bad. They could have been better: The stimulus should have been bigger and more sustained, and Republican opposition hamstrung the administration\u2019s economic policy after the first two years. Still, progressive policies have worked, and the critics of those policies have been proved wrong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bank of Japan Tries the Long View", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe latest instrument to emerge from Governor Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s toolbox is \u201cyield curve control.\u201d The Bank of Japan will aim to keep the interest rate on 10-year bonds at zero. For now, the central bank will continue to buy bonds at \u201cmore or less\u201d the current rate of 80 trillion yen ($785 billion) a year. But it has edged away from its explicit annual money-printing target.The shift squares a few circles for the Bank of Japan. It can\u2019t keep up the current pace of bond-buying much longer: After three and a half years of huge purchases, Deutsche Bank says the central bank already holds nearly 40 percent of Japan\u2019s outstanding government debt. But abruptly pulling back would roil markets. Pledging to hold 10-year yields at zero might in practice require less firepower, allowing the Bank of Japan to keep up its policy for longer.Super-low interest rates have squeezed the financial sector. Reducing its emphasis on buying seven- to 12-year bonds could mean the Bank of Japan spends more on shorter-dated paper, increasing the difference between shorter- and longer-dated yields. Such a steepening of the yield curve should bolster bank earnings and improve returns for insurers and pension funds.The central bank also stepped up a commitment to stoking annual inflation of 2 percent, vowing to keep the printing presses whirring until it actually overshoots that goal. That seems less convincing. Mr. Kuroda wants to jolt inflation expectations higher by forcing companies and consumers to think more about future price increases, not the flattish prices actually seen in recent years. But while influencing bond yields is relatively straightforward for a central bank with a printing press, changing the psychology of inflation in Japan is proving more elusive.This might not be the Bank of Japan\u2019s last move this year. Though its recent foray into negative interest rates was deeply unpopular, it could push deeper, especially if confronted with a shock from the Federal Reserve or another quarter. Despite growing worries that central banks are running out of ideas for reviving the economy, the Bank of Japan is still fighting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s \u2018Fertility Day\u2019 Call to Make Babies Arouses Anger, Not Ardor", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 One ad pictured a woman holding an hourglass next to the words: \u201cBeauty has no age limit. Fertility does.\u201d Another portrayed a pair of baby shoes wrapped in a ribbon of the Italian flag. Yet another showed a man holding a half-burned cigarette: \u201cDon\u2019t let your sperm go up in smoke,\u201d it read.They were part of a government effort to promote \u201cFertility Day\u201d on Sept. 22, a campaign intended to encourage Italians to have more babies. Instead, the ads set off a furor, were denounced as being offensive, and within days were withdrawn.What they did succeed in doing, however, was to ignite a deeper and lasting debate about why it is that Italy has one of the lowest birthrates in the world, and what can be done about it.The problem is not a lack of desire to have children, critics of the campaign say, but rather the lack of meaningful support provided by the government and many employers in a country where the family remains the primary source of child care.\u201cI should be a model for their campaign, and I still feel very offended,\u201d said Vittoria Iacovella, 37, a journalist and mother of two girls, ages 10 and 8. \u201cThe government encourages us to have babies, and then the main welfare system in Italy is still the grandparents.\u201dMany working women, without an extended family to care for a child, face a dilemma, as private child care is expensive. Some also worry that their job security may be undermined by missing workdays because of child care issues. Many companies do not offer flexible hours for working mothers.Not surprisingly, Italy\u2019s long slowdown in childbirth has coincided with its recent economic slump. But Italian families have been shrinking for decades.By contrast, in France, the economy has been flat, too, but a family-oriented system provides a far more generous social safety net that includes day care and subsidies for families to have children. There, women have two children each on average.\u201cOn paper, Italian women have equal rights,\u201d said Tiziana Bartolini, the editor of Noi Donne, one of Italy\u2019s most prominent feminist magazines. \u201cBut reality tells us a different story. Women are expected to care for children. If they live in regions where services are good, or in small towns, they keep their job. If they live in big, chaotic cities and have no family nearby, they are very prudent about becoming pregnant.\u201cOr they stop working,\u201d she added.The Ministry of Health began the fertility campaign on Aug. 31 with a group of online advertisements and a hashtag on Twitter. The goal was to publicize a series of public meetings on Fertility Day and encourage Italians to have more children.Yeah, sure, thought Maria Scioli, 41, a teacher who depends on her family to care for her 15-month-old boy, when she spotted the debate on her Facebook page.\u201cI\u2019d love to have a second child,\u201d Ms. Scioli said, \u201cbut my job situation worries me. And I even feel lucky. I think about all those women my age or younger that couldn\u2019t have babies and had to watch that offensive ad.\u201dEven Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose own health minister started the campaign, distanced himself from the ads in a radio interview, noting ironically that none of his friends \u201chad their kids after seeing an advert.\u201dMr. Renzi said that to increase the birthrate, structural issues like day care and services needed to be addressed.Under Mr. Renzi, Italy\u2019s government has tried to help families with a so-called baby bonus of 80 to 160 euros, or about $90 to $180, for low- and middle-income households, and it has approved labor laws giving more flexibility on parental leave. But Italy allocates only 1 percent of its gross domestic product to social protection benefits \u2014 half the European average.

{"Headline": "So Much Land, Too Few Russians", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLooking to become a homesteader these days? As of May 2, a new Russian law provides for a free land grant of 2.5 acres to any citizen willing to move to a vast territory along Russia\u2019s Pacific Coast and China\u2019s border. This is Russia\u2019s Wild Far East, at 2.4 million square miles almost three times the size of Alaska, Washington State and Oregon combined, but populated by merely 6.3 million people.Still, many Russians are suspicious of the government\u2019s offer. For good reason. During Russia\u2019s privatization phase in the 1990s, each citizen was issued a voucher for shares in government-owned enterprises. Very quickly, most of these shares ended up in the hands of a few people who became billionaires. Some suspect that this may be another such scheme to enrich a few well-connected Russians, who would buy up the land and bring in Chinese laborers.Indeed, a large and increasing number of Chinese workers are already in Russia, and this is a delicate issue in itself \u2014 a case in point of a fundamental challenge to Russia\u2019s future from a convergence of stresses: a weak and corruption-riddled economy, declining population, vast distances and a great diversity of ethnic minorities craving more autonomy.Take the Far East as an example:Russia urgently needs Chinese investments. In return, in the Far East\u2019s southeast corner, China has made Russian land along the Amur River border a virtual colony, having secured the right for Chinese people to work there. In the last decade, huge tracts have been leased to China at rock- bottom prices. Nearly two million acres with gigantic pig farms and fields of soybean and corn are being worked by Chinese agribusinesses. Most recently, Moscow leased out about 300,000 acres in the Trans-Baikal region for 49 years. The price: $2 an acre and $368 million in promised investments.In all, about 4.3 million people on Russia\u2019s side of the border face at least 26 million Chinese on the other side. And Russia\u2019s population over all has been declining, leaving the whole country desperately short of labor to cultivate and develop the vast expanses of Siberia. So densely populated China seems a natural, if uncomfortable, resource to turn to.Neither country\u2019s government wants to advertise the scale of Chinese migration into Siberia to fish, mine and grow produce. Most conservative estimates put the number of illegal Chinese migrants at two million, while the Center for Migration Research in Moscow says the number of Chinese residents in Russia is projected, conservatively, to reach 10 million by 2050, making them the predominant group in the Far East.In an attempt to counterbalance that prospect, the Russian Ministry for the Development of the Far East is considering resettling in the region some two million migrants from neighboring Central Asian countries by 2030. But some Central Asian countries themselves share Russia\u2019s worries about Chinese migration. On May 21, protests erupted in Kazakhstan over a proposal to let its government privatize land by selling it at auction. Kazakhs feared it was a plan to sell land to China. After arresting the protesters, the government decided to wait six months and reconsider holding the auction.Meanwhile, many residents in Far-Eastern Russia are ambivalent about growing Chinese influence. They see the benefits of Chinese trade and investments but harbor longstanding xenophobic fears of the growing Chinese presence. Nevertheless, some Russian women have favored Chinese men for marriage, based on a cultural stereotype that they are more hardworking and sober than Russian men. But the challenge of governing enormous spaces, especially those sparsely populated by diverse peoples, remains. The Russian Federation is home to more than 185 peoples with distinct ethnic and national identities. In ways similar to what is unfolding in the Far East today, Moscow has long been unable to fully assimilate them and unwilling to address their historical grievances.Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia is no different. For example, it has redeployed a Soviet myth \u2014 the \u201cfriendship of peoples\u201d \u2014 to sweep existing ethnic and religious tensions under the rug with euphemistic slogans, even as Russian sociologists regularly monitor the level of actual ethnic tensions. The common rating they give, vague enough to be read as optimistic, is \u201cstable tension.\u201dBut tension is hard to keep stable. The more economic and political complaints grow, the stronger movements for autonomy become. On May 1, thousands of protesters in Novosibirsk, the capital of Western Siberia, marched with the slogan, \u201cThis is no Moscow.\u201d In the Muslim republics of the North Caucasus, Moscow\u2019s tenuous control is largely limited to directing security forces to prevent further acts of terrorism. In the center of European Russia, the Kremlin has tried for years to tighten its rule over the largely autonomous Muslim republics of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, but local elites have been pushing back.Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s population is projected by the Pew Research Center to decline from 143.5 million in 2015 to 120.5 million by 2050, accompanied by a decreasing ratio of ethnic Russians to non-Russians. That portends even more clamor for regional autonomy, amid a worsening disparity between available human resources and Russia\u2019s vastness.And those trends, in turn, will most likely reinforce Russian ethnic nationalism. Historically, Russia\u2019s rulers, whether czars or commissars, reached for autocracy at the center to control the extraordinary diversity of peoples, cultures and religions. In the end, though, the strong center failed. In the 16 years since Mr. Putin became Russia\u2019s leader, he has done everything possible to take power away from the regions and concentrate it in his hands. But with an economy in steep decline, a corrupt political system that masks a form of dictatorship, and the growing regional and ethnic tensions, Russia is again approaching the brink.The Russian state is unsustainable on its present course. Most experts within and outside Russia admit that it desperately needs reforms: economic, social and political. But the current occupiers of the Kremlin see any meaningful reform as a threat, and we should not be taken by surprise if one day Russia itself implodes, as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics did a quarter of a century ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Local 1-Percenters May Not Be as Rich as You Think", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside WealthAt the Democratic National Convention this summer, Hillary Clinton said 1-percenters were due for a tax increase.\u201cThis is not because we resent success,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that\u2019s where the money is.\u201dBut defining America\u2019s 1 percent \u2014 and finding out \u201cwhere the money is\u201d \u2014 has become an increasingly subjective endeavor. As wealth becomes more concentrated in certain states and even counties, the gap between the national 1 percent and the local 1 percent is growing, creating wealth clusters that are pulling away from the rest of the country.One-percenters in the New York metro area (which includes parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania) earn at least $673,000. Those in the Bridgeport-Stamford, Conn., area make at least $1.4 million. Both are eclipsed by the 1-percenters of Jackson, Wyo., who earn at least $1.7 million. Why Jackson? Billionaires have been flocking to Wyoming, attracted by its outdoor lifestyle and low taxes.Teton County, Wyo., is the richest in America when it comes to 1 percent incomes, with 1-percenters earning more than $2.2 million. New York County, or Manhattan, ranks second, with a $1.44 million threshold, followed by Fairfield County, Conn., with just under $1.4 million. The tech boom has helped the 1 percent in San Mateo County and Marin County, Calif., where they earn at least $1.1 million.By contrast, you need only $97,000 to be a 1-percenter in Holmes County, Miss., or Lamar County, Ala., or $108,000 in Grayson County, Va.It\u2019s no surprise that the most expensive states have the highest incomes at the top. And wealth, by nature, has always been relative. Yet economists and wealth experts say the economic distance between 1-percenters in rich states and the 1-percenters in middling or even affluent states has widened drastically, creating a new national landscape of the 1 percent.Regionally, the Northeast has been pulling away the fastest. The income threshold of the top 1 percent surged 101 percent in the Northeast from 1979 to 2013, according to Mr. Price. In the South and Midwest, the threshold has grown by about half that.In Massachusetts, 1-percenters\u2019 incomes jumped 130 percent from 1979 to 2013; they\u2019ve increased by 112 percent in New York and 113 percent in New Jersey. In New Mexico, they\u2019ve grown only 22 percent over the same period, and in Nevada, only 15 percent.Yet the rich are also moving beyond the traditional hubs of the Northeast and California, creating some unlikely 1-percenter enclaves, such as Wyoming. North Dakota also moved up the 1-percenter ranks \u2014 from 45th to ninth from 1979 to 2013 \u2014 as the oil boom lifted the fortunes of its fortunate.The new peaks and valleys of America\u2019s elite have made national definitions less and less useful. The 1 percent is no longer the very top layer of the national economy, but a much deeper slice of residents in high-income, high-cost states like New York, Connecticut and California.The shift has important policy and cultural implications. Calls to tax the 1 percent nationally are really calls to tax the top 5 or 10 percent in the richest states \u2014 while missing the top 1 percent in many Western and Southern states.\u201cA tax on the 1 percent is increasingly a regional tax,\u201d Mr. Price said. \u201cOn average, more folks will be touched by higher rates in New York than, say, West Virginia.\u201dMany economists say that\u2019s as it should be \u2014 people making more than $389,000 should pay higher tax rates, regardless of where they live.\u201cThey should pay more,\u201d Mr. Wolff of N.Y.U. said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter where they live. They\u2019re earning large amounts of money.\u201dYet they may not feel like top earners. People making $389,000 in New York or Connecticut, for instance, are only in the top 10 percent for their states. They may not feel like 1-percenters, since so many people around them are far richer.\u201cI have friends who may be in the 1 percent nationally but say they don\u2019t feel rich because they have friends who are richer,\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cPsychologically they don\u2019t feel like a 1-percenter. They don\u2019t feel rich.

Mrs. Clinton defended herself by saying, \u201cNone of the emails sent or received by me had such a header\u201d marking them as classified.In saying this, Mrs. Clinton offered a variation on the explanation she has repeatedly given about whether classified information passed through her private email server. Rather than saying she never \u201csent or received\u201d classified information, Mrs. Clinton was making a distinction about how they were marked classified, with a small notation of a \u201cC\u201d on them, or with a larger, more visible header marking them as such.The F.B.I. director, James B.

Mr. Videgaray, a longtime ally of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, had been a strong proponent of extending an invitation to Mr. Trump, according to Mexican news reports. Although the president did not give a reason for Mr. Videgaray\u2019s departure, analysts speculated that he wanted to deflect the barrage of scorn that has been directed at him since Mr. Trump left Mexico.But the Trump visit might not be the only reason for Mr. Videgaray\u2019s exit from the cabinet. The Mexican economy has slowed and the peso has weakened on his watch. He also came under scrutiny after it was reported that he had bought a home at a golf resort from a government contractor.JOHN HARNEY_____Defending his past praise of Russia\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump at one point asserted that President Vladimir V. Putin had the support of 82 percent of Russians.Mr. Trump appears to be basing that on a July poll by the Levada Center in Russia.

{"Headline": "How Much Do We Really Know About Global Trade\u2019s Impacts?", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyDonald Trump\u2019s campaign has at times resembled a whistle-stop tour of broken-down manufacturing towns. Places like Monessen, Pa., and Hickory, N.C., have come to be seen as central to his rise \u2014 and that of Bernie Sanders, before he bowed out \u2014 as well as symbols of a national preoccupation during this election season: the downsides of globalization. Earlier this year, research that led to an academic paper from several economists titled \u201cThe China Shock\u201d found that between 1999 and 2011, the growth in imports from China killed about 2.4 million American jobs, one million or so of them in manufacturing. That\u2019s a much greater impact than most economists had been assuming, and the 2.4 million figure has come up again and again in debates over global trade.There\u2019s much less specificity when it comes to the other side of the ledger, however. For all the talk about winners and losers in the global trading game, an actual accounting of what\u2019s happening on the winning side overseas is surprisingly elusive. Even as economists point to cheaper consumer goods and new jobs that trade brings to the United States, they\u2019re unable to say how many jobs are created in, say, Asia. Among friends and in the news coverage I see, the dismissive assumption tends to be that the big winners in the game are the same elites, here and all over, who seem to profit from everything. But the fact is, there\u2019s no deep understanding of what the gains are in other countries. How many and what sorts of jobs are created? To what extent are lives and nations changed?There are many reasons that the disadvantages have received more attention than the gains. In American political discussions, after all, the focus is understandably on domestic losses rather than foreign benefits. Trade also presents a classic case of concentrated costs and diffuse benefits \u2014 the lower prices and higher employment that trade can produce are generally distributed thinly over many beneficiaries, while the loss of jobs falls hard on a smaller number of people. But there is a less-obvious reason as well: Economists haven\u2019t done a particularly good job of pinning down the virtues of trade. In \u201cThe China Shock,\u201d the authors David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson chastise their discipline for its relative silence on this front: \u201cIt is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate the gains from trade.\u201dI have come across one paper, though, that provides a good starting point for thinking about what trade can mean for people overseas. A young Canadian economist at Wilfrid Laurier University, Brian McCaig, studied what happened in Vietnam immediately after the United States slashed tariffs on goods from that country in 2001 \u2014 a bilateral trade agreement similar to many others before and since that have opened up the United States to manufactured goods from Asia. He found that over the next three years, as the value of apparel and clothing accessories going to the United States from Vietnam rose by 277 percent, the poverty level in Vietnam fell to 19.5 percent from 28.9 percent, twice as fast as it had fallen in the preceding four years and enough to lift about seven million people out of poverty. This wasn\u2019t American food-stamp poverty those Vietnamese were escaping; it was malnourished, dollar-a-day poverty.McCaig does not claim that these changes were produced solely by the surge in exports to the United States. By his estimate, only about 250,000 jobs were created in export-based manufacturing in Vietnam during those two years. But those jobs, which were better-paying than almost anything else available before, had an enormous ripple effect: Every new factory position led to several other new jobs nearby. In general, the more specialized a region was in producing exports, the faster poverty declined. In districts with the most exposure to manufacturing, like Tien Giang, near Ho Chi Minh City, the poverty rate fell about twice as fast from 2002 to 2004 as it did in more rural areas like Ha Tinh, in the north. Even in the rural areas, living standards rose as workers in the cities sent money back home. According to McCaig, this came to account for 15 percent of the total income in those regions. Productivity on the farms also improved as landowners adapted to fewer workers.I asked him if there was a way for some back-of-the-envelope math to convey at least a sense of how China benefited from the global trade that led to the loss of 2.4 million jobs in the United States. It is not a straightforward calculation, because the increasing American openness to trade has by no means been the only catalyst behind China\u2019s economic growth; among other factors, its government has also been changing economic policies and making enormous domestic investments. With that caveat, however, McCaig noted that if Chinese exports really did lead to the elimination of one million American jobs in manufacturing, as estimated in David Autor\u2019s work, China would have had to replace them in proportion to how productive Chinese workers were compared with their American counterparts. Given that it took roughly 10 Chinese workers to match the output of one American worker over the last two decades, McCaig said he assumes that China would have needed about 10 million new jobs to replace one million manufacturing jobs in the United States. (It made sense for companies in China to expand on this scale because Chinese workers made less than one-tenth what Americans did.) That accounts for just under half of the new manufacturing jobs that China gained between 2003 and 2011, following China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, which gave the country\u2019s exporters preferred access to American consumers.Last year, economists at the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, said that by their very rough estimates total foreign demand for Chinese goods may have led to the creation of as many as 70 million jobs in China in the five years after China joined the W.T.O. This \u201cexport shock\u201d has been described by economists as the most important factor in China\u2019s economic development in the 2000s; foreign consumers were able to support higher wages than Chinese consumers could. The overall growth in the period described by \u201cThe China Shock\u201d helped raise 350 million Chinese above the country\u2019s poverty line of $1.90 a day.Other costs have emerged, however. Urban Chinese are choking on pollution and confronting growing income inequality. In the United States, jobs have disappeared, and there is social unrest. Our exposure to foreign markets is partly to blame, but economists attribute many of the job losses to changes in technology and productivity. (American manufacturing output has grown even as the number of manufacturing workers has shrunk.)On the other hand, as an article in the current Quarterly Journal of Economics points out, the cheaper products coming into the United States have particularly benefited the poorest Americans, who spend more of their income on imported goods and thus save more when trade makes goods cheaper. But when I spoke with David Autor, he told me that whatever the virtues or costs in the United States, they pale in comparison with the basic humanitarian benefits that people in places like China and Vietnam have experienced as a result of trade with the United States. \u201cThe gains to the people who benefited are so enormous \u2014 they were destitute, and now they were brought into the global middle class,\u201d Autor says. \u201cThe fact that there are adverse consequences in the United States should be taken seriously, but it doesn\u2019t tilt the balance.\u201dAutor told me that he does not hold out hope that American politicians will bring this sort of calculus to the election debate. But if the rest of us want to consider trade in moral and humanitarian terms, not just as a political and economic matter, it seems important to contemplate how to assign and compare the values of a new job to someone who would otherwise be stuck in dire poverty and a lost job for someone with at least some version of a safety net, which Americans have compared with many of the poor people in the developing world. Undoubtedly there are ways to soothe the hardship on both sides, and we should try to figure them out. But trade inevitably involves some trade-offs. If we want to determine if they are worth it, we can\u2019t just look at one side of the transaction.Nathaniel Popper is a reporter for The Times and the author of \u201cDigital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump visited the Detroit Economic Club last month to tell a story about a once-great city destroyed by free trade.I grew up in Michigan, and even then, we were told the manufacturing jobs that Mr. Trump is now promising the state weren\u2019t coming back. I was a sophomore at Lansing J. W. Sexton High School in 1982. In December of that year, Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate was almost 17 percent. It was the pits of a recession that helped transform the industrial Midwest from the Arsenal of Democracy into the Rust Belt.That fall, my physics teacher gestured toward the Fisher Body plant across the street from our school and said: \u201cIt used to be that you didn\u2019t have to study here. You could just walk across the street and get a job in that plant. Those days are over. You guys are going to have to study and go to college.\u201dMr. Trump has his reasons for focusing on manufacturing, though. They don\u2019t all have to do with economics. He ignores the fact that many of Michigan\u2019s auto industry jobs were lost to automation, or to foreign manufacturers operating in the right-to-work South, because depicting the Chinese, Japanese and Mexicans as job-stealing alien villains better fits his America First narrative.Mr. Trump\u2019s economic nationalism is inseparable from the ethno-nationalism that\u2019s turning off so many African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and Muslims who might agree with him on trade, but understand deep down that jobs aren\u2019t all he wants to bring back from his good old days.Marcus Riddle is an example. I met him outside a Coney Island diner in Flint\u2019s North End. He\u2019s exactly the kind of dispossessed autoworker Mr. Trump was talking about when he called Nafta \u201ca total disaster for the United States.\u201d Mr. Riddle once held a well-paying job with an auto parts manufacturer, but was laid off when the company moved some of its operations to Costa Rica. Now he works at an adult foster-care home, earning \u201c$9 an hour after nine years.\u201d Mr. Riddle likes Mr. Trump\u2019s stands on terrorism and illegal immigration, but he\u2019s planning to vote for Hillary Clinton.\u201cHe\u2019s too racist for me,\u201d Mr. Riddle said, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Mexicans. \u201cI\u2019m mixed: Indian and black. If he gets into office, what am I going to look like?\u201dMr. Riddle is skeptical of Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States: \u201cIf other presidents couldn\u2019t do it, how can he?\u201dMichigan was a key state for the Reagan Democrats: hawkish, socially conservative autoworkers who ignored the U.A.W.\u2019s entreaties to vote for Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale. Mr. Trump is winning their heartland, Macomb County, in the blue-collar suburbs of Detroit. He\u2019s also ahead among voters ages 50 to 70, who came of age when a factory job was still a birthright, and share his nostalgia for those years.The Fisher Body plant across the street from my school is long gone. Most of the jobs are gone, too. As Lansing\u2019s mayor, Virg Bernero, has noted, G.M. can build the same number of cars with 5,000 workers as it did with 25,000 in the 1950s and \u201960s.The Trump conundrum is that his campaign is about loss. His appeal is strongest among people who feel their social, economic and political influence slipping away, but he appeals to them specifically because their numbers are dwindling, thus making them less effective as an electoral coalition.A candidate of the past can\u2019t win the present. As my physics teacher predicted, Michigan now has more college graduates and fewer autoworkers than it did in the 1980s. Mr. Trump is promising to restore a way of life that, even then, we knew was disappearing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clubbers Lament Demise of Fabric, a \u2018Totem\u2019 of London\u2019s Dance Scene", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 For fans of one of London\u2019s most fabled nightclubs, the party is over.The decision by the Borough of Islington to revoke the license of the 2,500-capacity nightclub came after the police had asked the borough council to close the venue after the deaths of two 18-year-olds in recent months. According to the council, both had taken MDMA, a drug better known as Ecstasy. In 2014, the police had also asked the council to review Fabric\u2019s license after the deaths of four others in the previous three years were attributed to drugs.A sad day for London nightlife.It was also seen as a death knell for nightclubs in London, where venues are already being pushed out by creeping gentrification, the lack of business from some millennials short on cash, and austerity-conscious local governments that are more favorable to luxury apartment buildings and shopping malls than to loud, raucous music clubs.In August 2015, the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, a group that represents owners of pubs, bars and restaurants, published figures showing that half of Britain\u2019s nightclubs had shut down since 2005, including dozens in London.The closing of the club reverberated among revelers around the world; a stop at Fabric was a must-do on any clubber\u2019s trip to London. Several regulars, who said they viewed Fabric as a second home, gathered on the steps of the club this week, some overcome by tears.\u201cFabric is a place where people from all socio-economic backgrounds, colors, and sexual orientations, tourists and people from finance come together next to edgy club kids in sneakers and mohawks,\u201d she said. \u201cElectronic music is the music of our generation, and I am devastated. Just as clubs in New York have been pushed out of the center and replaced by shopping venues and luxury apartments during the last decade, now this is happening here.\u201dFabric\u2019s closing also feeds into the debate about the criminalization of recreational drug use. There were questions about whether the authorities were making an unfair example of Fabric, with the club\u2019s supporters contending that those determined to obtain drugs would find a way of using them at the club, with or without tough security checks.In its decision to close Fabric, the Islington council said the two teenagers had been able to sneak into the club without the drugs being detected, and had also bought drugs inside the club. It criticized Fabric for having what it called \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d security.The council said that undercover police operations at the club had revealed patrons displaying symptoms such as \u201csweating, glazed red eyes and staring into space, and people asking for help.\u201dFabric said in a statement that it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the decision. \u201cClosing Fabric is not the answer to the drug-related problems clubs like ours are working to prevent, and sets a troubling precedent for the future of London\u2019s nighttime economy,\u201d it said.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has been pushing to make London more of a 24-hour city by opening the subway for all-night service on weekends, said he was \u201cdisappointed.\u201dBefore the club was closed down, Mr. Khan had told the council that Fabric was important to a nighttime economy in London that contributed 26.3 billion pounds, or about $35 billion, to the city\u2019s coffers every year.\u201cClubbing needs to be safe, but I\u2019m disappointed that Fabric, Islington Council and the Metropolitan Police were unable to reach agreement on how to address concerns about public safety,\u201d he said in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge totem on the London night-life scene, the premiere destination for the world\u2019s biggest D.J.s, and I think the closure is going to have a totally massive impact on the music scene, on dance music culture and on the night-life economy,\u201d he said.\u201cI think it\u2019s got more to do with gentrification, noise complaints and path-of-least-resistance policing than it does with public safety. It\u2019s all a bit post-Brexit apocalyptic,\u201d he added, referring to Britain\u2019s vote this summer to leave the European Union. Some critics say leaving the bloc will make the country, and its culture, more inward-looking.For many, Fabric was more than just a music venue. Jacob Husley, 35, a promoter and D.J., said in May that his favorite experience there came when a Polish couple in their 70s turned up, downed a shot of tequila each, high-fived the D.J. and danced until 5 a.m.\u201cI took them upstairs to the balcony and brought them some tea \u2014 because they wanted to have tea,\u201d he told The Evening Standard. \u201cThey were really sweet, they were on the balcony with their hands together ballroom dancing.\u201dChristopher D.

{"Headline": "Merkel Feels Political Pressure in Germany as Europe Is in Flux", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Merkel, chancellor since fall 2005 and Europe\u2019s longest serving leader, has found herself on the defensive in a round of interviews on both the anniversary of the refugee influx and the effective start of campaigning for next year\u2019s national elections.\u201cGermany will remain Germany, with all that is dear to us,\u201d she insisted in an interview this week with the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, a leading newspaper.With everything in flux in Europe after the stunning British vote to exit the European Union, and elections also in France and the Netherlands next year, Ms. Merkel has come under increasing fire at home.\u201cThe failed policy of the chancellor is a stroke of luck for our party,\u201d said Alexander Gauland, a leader of Alternative for Germany. \u201cIt drives voters towards us.\u201dBy opening Germany\u2019s borders to all last year without consulting even one member of Parliament, he added, Ms. Merkel behaved like a dictator. \u201cIt is regarded by just about every European leader as an act of madness,\u201d he said.In tacit acknowledgment of critics who say she consulted nobody on the refugee move, Ms. Merkel has embarked on a listening tour of Europe to try to repair relations. In Tallinn, the Estonian prime minister effusively thanked her for her leadership.But it was plain in Warsaw, where she met the four Central European leaders who have flatly refused to take in refugees, that she was not among friends.A host of other demands \u2014 from Italy and France for looser purse strings, from Scandinavian and Dutch leaders to beware of fading support for Europe in their countries \u2014 are tugging at Ms. Merkel as she and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France consult the Continent\u2019s leaders.They will succeed, at least on paper, in sketching some grand goals for Europe to be announced at a meeting of 27 nations \u2014 all of the bloc\u2019s members save Britain \u2014 in mid-September.But no one has so far explained how Europe is likely this time, for example, to reduce youth unemployment, a goal voiced for years and reiterated since Britain voted on June 23 to leave the union.Missing goals again is not likely to enhance Europeans\u2019 faith in the bloc. \u201cThe chief concern should be for the attractiveness of the union,\u201d said Guntram B. Wolff, director of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.With Britain, one of Europe\u2019s two nuclear powers, looking for the exit, it is no longer in a position to hamper moves toward what France, Germany and Poland defined this week as \u201ca European civil and military planning and command capacity.\u201dThat will also require \u201cdevelopment of a strong and competitive defense economy in Europe,\u201d the foreign ministers of the three countries declared.Even Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary and Ms. Merkel\u2019s most implacable opponent on refugees, seems to agree.In Warsaw, he bluntly said that Europe had failed to master economic challenges and that \u201cwe have no answers to the migrant crisis.\u201d But, he added, \u201csecurity takes first place.\u201d\u201cWe want to build up a shared European army, common European forces,\u201d he continued.How far any such plans progress is as uncertain as Ms. Merkel\u2019s political future.Analysts and politicians across the board see no serious challenger to Ms. Merkel, who has coyly said only that she will announce \u201cat the given time\u201d whether she will seek a fourth term next year.Jacqueline Boysen wrote a 2001 biography of Ms. Merkel, whom she got to know in the 1990s in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the chancellor has her parliamentary constituency. She doubted that Ms. Merkel would leave her giant refugee task half-finished, or her party in the lurch, by declining to run.\u201cIt would be unlike her to leave the party in a mess,\u201d said Ms. Boysen, now a journalist in Berlin. \u201cShe is very much aware of duty.\u201dShe also emphasized that Ms. Merkel, a trained physicist who entered politics only as Germany unified in 1990, had constantly been underestimated. \u201cShe was not taken seriously,\u201d Ms. Boysen recalled in an interview. \u201cThe subtext was always, \u2018She can\u2019t do it.\u2019 \u201dStill, in an interview with ARD this week, Ms. Merkel could not resist a little smile as she noted that NATO began a mission to save refugees in the Aegean in just five days in the spring, and that the pact with Turkey was negotiated within months.\u201cMany people said, \u2018We can\u2019t do this,\u2019 and then it got done,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Identity Politics Run Amok", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnce, I seem to recall, we had philosophical and ideological differences. Once, politics was a debate between liberals and conservatives, between different views of government, different views on values and America\u2019s role in the world.But this year, it seems, everything has been stripped down to the bone. Politics is dividing along crude identity lines \u2014 along race and class. Are you a native-born white or are you an outsider? Are you one of the people or one of the elites?Politics is no longer about argument or discussion; it\u2019s about trying to put your opponents into the box of the untouchables.Donald Trump didn\u2019t invent this game, but he embodies it. His advisers tried to dress him up on Wednesday afternoon as some sort of mature summiteer. But he just can\u2019t be phony.By his evening immigration speech he\u2019d returned to the class and race tropes that have defined his campaign: that the American government is in the grips of a rich oligarchy that distorts everything for its benefit; that the American people are besieged by foreigners, who take their jobs and threaten their lives.It\u2019s not that these two ideas are completely wrong. The rich do have more influence. There are indeed some foreigners who seek to harm us. It is just that Trump (like other race and class warriors) takes these kernels of truth and grows them into a lie.According to one study, only 2 or 3 percent of Mexican-, Guatemalan- or Salvadoran-born men without a high school degree end up incarcerated, compared with 11 percent of their American-born counterparts.Trump argues that the flood of immigrants is taking jobs away from unskilled native workers. But this is mainly false, too. There\u2019s an intricate debate among economists about this, but if you survey the whole literature on the subject you find that most research shows immigration has very little effect on native wage or unemployment levels.Trump claims the rich benefit from immigration while everyone else suffers. Doctors get cheap nannies, everyone else gets the shaft.A report from the Partnership for a New American Economy found that immigrants accounted for 28 percent of all new small businesses in 2011. Between 2006 and 2012, over 40 percent of tech start-ups in Silicon Valley had at least one foreign-born founder.Identity politics distorts politics in two ways. First, it is Manichaean. It cleanly divides the world into opposing forces of light and darkness. You are a worker or an elite. You are American or foreigner.Seeing this way is understandable if you are scared, but it is also a sign of intellectual laziness. The reality is that people can\u2019t be reduced to a single story. An issue as complex as immigration can\u2019t be reduced to a cartoon. It is simultaneously true that immigration fuels American dynamism and that the mixture of mass unskilled immigration and the high-tech economy threatens to create a permanent underclass.Second and most important, identity politics is inherently the politics of division. But on most issues \u2014 whether it is immigration or the economy or national security \u2014 we rise and fall together. Immigration, even a reasonable amount of illegal immigration, helps a vast majority of Americans. An economy that grows at 3 percent would help all Americans.Identity politics, as practiced by Trump, but also by others on the left and the right, distracts from the reality that we are one nation. It corrodes the sense of solidarity. It breeds suspicion, cynicism and distrust.Human beings are too complicated to be defined by skin color, income or citizenship status. Those who try to reduce politics to these identities do real violence to national life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germans and Austrians Protest E.U. Trade Talks With U.S. and Canada", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of people rallied across Germany and Austria on Saturday to urge their governments not to sign new agreements being negotiated for European Union trade deals with the United States and Canada.The proposed deals have been bitterly contested since the European Union and Washington agreed in 2013 to try to form a new free-trade area with a market of more than 800 million people.Beyond eliminating the remaining trade barriers and tariffs, one declared aim is ensuring that American and European consumer regulations \u2014 rather than the perceived lower standards in rising markets like China and India \u2014 become the standards worldwide.Although Germany\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on exports, opposition to the proposed pacts with the United States and Canada has swelled from the start, uniting a coalition of churches, trade unions, intellectuals and left-wing parties. That coalition called for Saturday\u2019s protests in seven German cities.The opposition effort poses problems in particular for Sigmar Gabriel, Germany\u2019s vice chancellor and the leader of the German Social Democrats. He is battling to keep his party well above the 20 percent mark in opinion polls ahead of national elections in the fall of 2017.In what appeared to be a tactical move, Mr. Gabriel hurriedly visited Canada this past week and agreed with the Canadians that their pact could still be amended once passed by European Union trade ministers next Friday and then ratified by national parliaments.By contrast, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said through her spokesman that the negotiations must continue.Aware of the ticking clock, activists in Germany and Austria called Saturday\u2019s demonstrations to push their case that both trade pacts are unfair and would force Europeans to accept what they see as lower American consumer standards.The attacks on American practices have been so vigorous that proponents of a trade deal have often accused protesters of anti-Americanism, which they strongly deny.Europeans have focused on genetically manipulated food produced in the United States and a desire to preserve the guaranteed quality of goods like Italian Parmesan, French Champagne and Black Forest ham by insisting that only products from those European regions can carry such labels.Perhaps an even bigger point of contention is that the United States wants firm protections for investments by American companies in Europe, in case a member state fails to uphold the terms of the pact. Opponents of the pacts argue that such clauses could undermine the laws of European states by, in effect, providing legal protection for private companies even if they violate existing agreements on labor practices, for instance.Organizers estimated that 320,000 people turned out in the German cities on Saturday, with at least 50,000 others expected in five cities across Austria. The Austrian lobby opposing a trade deal wants to hold a referendum on the issue and plans to collect the required 100,000 signatures in one week in January to force a popular vote barring the government from signing either deal or an earlier one regulating trans-Atlantic services.German businesses have mounted a vigorous campaign favoring the trade pacts, particularly T.T.I.P. A typical recent brochure from the Atlantik-Br\u00fccke, one of the oldest trans-Atlantic groups here, described \u201cextraordinary opportunities,\u201d and said T.T.I.P could increase trans-Atlantic trade by 100 billion euros, or more than $110 billion, within 10 years for the European Union alone.On Berlin\u2019s Alexanderplatz, the center of the protests in the capital on Saturday, protesters sounded unconvinced.Asked why she was there holding an anti-T.T.I.P. banner, Marina Dudek, a 52-year-old teacher, was clear: \u201cI don\u2019t like the way this is being negotiated. This is not being done in a transparent way \u2014 and if that is the case, it makes me suspicious.\u201dUlrike Dettmann, 42, an urban planner, brought her 9-year-old son, Luka, to the protest. He was the one waving their banner, and he was the first to answer when asked why they were there.\u201cI don\u2019t want to eat genetically manipulated food,\u201d the boy said, citing an image that has become a favorite for the protesters \u2014 American chickens washed in chlorine. \u201cPlants should grow as they always have, from ancient times.\u201dHis mother said they had decided together to attend. \u201cWe both said that if everybody thought, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just two people, we can\u2019t make difference,\u2019 then no one would go,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so we came.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Caesars Bankruptcy Fight, Private Equity Owners Fold", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsCaesars may be defeated, but borrowers reign supreme.Efforts by Caesars Entertainment\u2019s private equity owners, Apollo Global Management and TPG Capital, to salvage something from their $30 billion casino buyout largely failed after creditors fought back. Under terms of a new deal, junior creditors would recover 66 cents on the dollar if a bankruptcy court approves. Most debt investors around the world are bowing to lame terms, however, meaning Caesars probably will be an exception.The acquisition of the company, formerly called Harrah\u2019s Entertainment, in 2008 got into early trouble as a flagging economy left the indebted company struggling. Refinancing, selling equity in public markets and cost-cutting helped up to a point, but the operating company was forced to seek bankruptcy last year. Along the way, Apollo and TPG moved assets around in a way that irritated creditors.A court-appointed investigator said this year that Caesars and its owners could be liable for up to $5 billion of damages for the shuffling. A separate ruling ordered Apollo and TPG executives to hand over details of their finances. That prompted them to give in. The firms agreed to forfeit their equity in the Caesars parent company. In exchange, lenders agreed on Tuesday to not proceed with lawsuits against the company or its backers.Senior creditors are essentially made whole on their investment, while second-lien note holders now get nearly 70 percent more than under an earlier proposal. Part of the success is the result of a recovering economy and the sale of an online gambling unit. Even so, the settlement proves that overreaching equity holders can be beaten back by lenders who assert their rights.That typically requires some vigilance from the outset, however. Investors today are desperate, though, given the low yields on benchmark Treasury bonds. They are charging into more treacherous slices of debt, enabling even highly leveraged, risky companies to sell bonds and loans with little protection. That can raise the chances of default and lower potential recoveries.The credit rating agency Moody\u2019s said this month, for example, that almost eight out of 10 new leveraged loans have relatively weak protection. The figure for 2013 was about half. With lenders so acquiescent, borrowers rule the capital kingdom.Advertisement"}

She talked about her youth minister who took her from the safe harbor of suburbia to the inner city of Chicago, and she shared the memory of seeing her gruff father bent on his knees in prayer each night.And, without ever mentioning Donald J. Trump by name, Mrs. Clinton portrayed her rival as a nihilist who doesn\u2019t understand African-Americans or their faith.The next president, she told the audience at the National Baptist Convention here on Thursday night, should be \u201ca praying person.\u201d\u201cOur greatest leaders are often the most humble because they recognize both the awesome responsibilities of power and the frailty of human action,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told an audience that was almost entirely black. The nation, she added, needed \u201ca president who will pray with you and for you.\u201dIn an address that seemed something of an exhale in a week in which Mrs. Clinton has spent much of her time eviscerating her opponent as unqualified to handle national security, the Democratic nominee spoke instead of her activist, social justice background, often fusing policy and personal anecdotes about how her Methodist faith had steered her toward public policy.Mrs. Clinton, who is often criticized for her lack of self-reflection, said she was \u201cgrateful for the great gift of personal salvation and for the great obligation of the social gospel.\u201dAnd, as she faces continued criticism over her handling of emails at the State Department, Mrs. Clinton conceded she had \u201cplenty\u201d of faults and had made mistakes. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who hasn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\u201cEveryone here today has stumbled on their own stony roads,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s grace that lifts us up, grace that leads us home.\u201dDespite the central role Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Methodism plays in her life, she seldom talks about it on the campaign trail. Such public displays of faith don\u2019t come naturally \u201cto a Midwestern Methodist,\u201d she said.But amid the political mudslinging with Mr. Trump \u2014 and a stubbornly high number of voters who dislike and distrust her \u2014 Mrs. Clinton must show voters more of herself and explain her own motivations, aides said.\u201cWe believe we have to work extra hard to make sure the positive notion she wants to do breaks through given the amount of interest there is in what he says,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign.The speech on Thursday was the first of several in which Mrs. Clinton will try to connect her personal motivations with policies. In the coming weeks, she will give at least three addresses, about the economy, proposals to help children and families and a call to national service.She sought to reinforce her deep roots in African-American churches on Thursday, paying tribute to several of the Baptist congregations she had visited during the campaign, and present herself as the antithesis of Mr. Trump, who drew criticism last week after revelations that his campaign had prewritten questions and responses when he spoke at a black church.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick and tired of politicians who think they can just show up at election time, say a few nice words and earn your support,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, whose relationship with the group stretches back decades.Mr. Trump has accused Mrs. Clinton of \u201cbigotry\u201d toward African-Americans and said she and other Democrats had pandered to black voters without helping them find jobs and reduce crime.Mr. Trump has asked black voters \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d in voting for him, after painting an image of poverty and crime sweeping their communities.Mrs. Clinton responded, \u201cYou also know better than anyone that people who look at the African-American community and see only poverty, crime and despair are missing so much.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worst of the Trumps", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a presidential campaign often inhabits the gutter it\u2019s not easy to establish its low point.We\u2019ve seen Donald Trump vilify Muslims, Mexicans and women. We\u2019ve seen him indulge airy suggestions that rifle-bearing Americans might like to shoot Hillary Clinton. We\u2019ve seen him belabor the lie that President Obama was not born in the United States \u2014 until he recanted. For Trump, the low road to the White House is paved with boorishness. But perhaps his son Donald Trump Jr. set the nadir this week when he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles.A caption accompanying a photograph of the candy said: \u201cIf I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That\u2019s our Syrian refugee problem.\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted, \u201cThis image says it all.\u201dWhere to begin? With the fact that human beings are not Skittles? With the fact that after more than five years of war 4.8 million Syrians are refugees and 6.1 million are internally displaced and Trump Jr., even with his coddled New York existence, can surely make the calculation that this amounts to almost 2.5 million more human beings than live in the five boroughs?With the fact that you do not flee your home because you have a choice (like choosing between Skittles and M&Ms after a Manhattan dinner party) but because you no longer have one? With the fact that, according to a Cato Institute study of refugees admitted to the United States between 1975 and 2015, the chance of an American being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion? With the fact that Syrians want to work, make a living, put their kids in decent schools, and recover their dignity, just like the rest of us?Or perhaps with the fact that comparing Syrians to Skittles carries echoes of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher comparing Jews to mushrooms in a popular children\u2019s book that posited the ticklish dilemma of how to distinguish poisonous toadstools from edible fungus; and has a mother saying to her son Franz:\u201cYes, my child! Just as a single poisonous mushroom can kill a whole family, so a solitary Jew can destroy a whole village, a whole city, even an entire Volk.\u201dWe all know, even the Trumps know, that the door into the United States was closed to desperate European Jews trying to escape the Holocaust.If I may be pardoned for extending an awful analogy, I\u2019d suggest to the Trumps that a better caption would read: \u201cIf I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three of them would turn out to be Sergey Brin, Elon Musk and Pierre Omidyar, would you take a handful?\u201dThe co-founder of Google, co-founder of Tesla, and founder of eBay were all immigrants. Steve Jobs\u2019 biological father was a Syrian immigrant. In fact, earlier this year, the National Foundation for American Policy found that 51 percent of the country\u2019s start-up companies valued at over $1 billion had at least one immigrant founder. A study by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a coalition of governors and business leaders, found that in 2013 more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies, including seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable brands, were started by immigrants or their children.The strength of the United States is its creative churn. In contrast to European states, it is hard-wired to reinvention through immigration. When Trump traffics in fear about immigrants, whether Muslim or Mexican, he guts America of its greatness and turns his back on its singular idea.The American response to the Syrian crisis has been paltry \u2014 almost 12,000 refugees admitted since the war began, or 0.25 percent of the total. Part of the slowness has come from the rigor of the vetting process. But what do the Trumps care? They are concerned with just one message: Muslim equals danger.Let\u2019s see now. Trump\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was a German immigrant. He arrived in the United States in October 1885. For decades, the family lied: They said he hailed from Sweden. In his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump says his grandfather \u201ccame here from Sweden as a child.\u201d The family historian, John Walter, explained that Trump\u2019s father, Fred, \u201chad a lot of Jewish tenants and it wasn\u2019t a good thing to be German in those days.\u201dMake up stories: It\u2019s the Trump way. So here was a German-American posing as a Swedish-American opting not to rent to African-Americans.Friedrich Trump, the immigrant, was young. He was penniless. He came not from Sweden but from Bismarck\u2019s recently formed nation state in the middle of a turbulent Europe. A U.S. immigration officer allowed him into the United States in 1885 \u2014 not a decision without risk.But an American decision taken in the spirit the Trumps now trample with cavalier untruth and vile innuendo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Immigration Reform: Disparate Ideas, Disparate Futures", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIf Donald Trump were to win the presidency and carry out his strident promise to build an impregnable wall along the border with Mexico, both advocates and foes agree, it would turn the United States into a nation quite different from the one they live in.They don\u2019t know the half of it: Under Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant proposals, the American population would probably shrink to 323 million by 2024, about one million fewer people than today and 22 million fewer people than the Census Bureau\u2019s projections for eight years from now.There is another side to the story, too: With Hillary Clinton as the next president, the population of the United States is more likely to increase to 360 million in 2024, from 324 million today.Of course, these disparate futures, estimated by Joseph Chamie, a demographer who once headed the United Nations Population Division, rely on a few assumptions. Mr. Trump would expel 11 million immigrants who are illegally in the country; Mrs. Clinton would legalize them. Future migration in a Trumpian America would fall to zero but would rise if Mrs. Clinton were president, as many newly legalized residents brought their families along.The gap \u2014 37 million people, more than a tenth of the population \u2014 underscores how powerfully immigration policy will shape the future of the United States. And it highlights the shortcoming of a decades-old political debate over overhauling the nation\u2019s immigration system that has failed to take into account the disconnect between policy makers and the American public.\u201cOne of the main demographic effects would likely be on overall population size,\u201d said Michael S. Teitelbaum, who in the 1990s was vice chairman and acting chairman of the United States Commission on International Migration. \u201cAnother major effect would be on demographic composition in terms of national origin, language, education, religion, race/ethnicity, etc.\u201dNobody disputes that America\u2019s immigration system is broken. The law governing immigration is pretty much irrelevant to the reality of immigration on the ground. But we can\u2019t just patch the system.Attempts at reform have focused on cobbling together constituencies that would stand to gain from specific changes: businesses eager to acquire cheap workers; labor unions interested in organizing newly legalized foreigners; advocacy groups out to protect the rights of immigrants who are toiling with little recourse to law.One problem with this approach is that it has bypassed American voters.This doesn\u2019t mean the United States should pull up the drawbridge, as Mr. Trump proposes. But it does suggest that any effort to change immigration laws and practices faces a big democratic challenge.\u201cWhat the U.S. government is doing in terms of border enforcement, mass deportations and other restrictive policies just isn\u2019t relevant to the decision to stay home,\u201d noted the Mexican Migration Field Research and Training Program of the University of California, San Diego, which has interviewed thousands of immigrants and potential immigrants in communities across Mexico.Wayne A. Cornelius, who heads the effort, concluded that \u201cborder enforcement, in whatever form and at whatever level, has never been a cost-effective deterrent.\u201dIf Mr. Trump were able to cut immigration to zero, it would have other consequences. The United States would have not just a smaller population in the future but also an older one. The work force, which powers economic growth, would be smaller. Each worker would have to maintain more retirees.But Mr. Trump is not the only politician misleading the public about immigration.For decades, the political debate over immigration has been mired in implausible possibilities. Notably, even reformers on the pro-immigration side still peddle the notion that illegal immigration could be stopped after the latest batch of unauthorized immigrants obtained legal residence.This proposition doesn\u2019t mesh with an ineffectual enforcement policy and a border that, to most voters, looks like Swiss cheese. What it does is squander voters\u2019 trust. \u201cWhat trips this up is that politicians are continuously making claims which turn out not to be true,\u201d Mr. Chamie, the demographer, told me.The runaway popularity of Mr. Trump\u2019s extreme anti-immigrant stance among a large bloc of the electorate tells you just how mistrustful voters have become over the prevarications of the political class.Two decades later, President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which offered amnesty to several million unauthorized immigrants but promised to slam the door on future illegal immigrants by holding their employers accountable.Lots of things happened over the last few decades. What\u2019s certain is that immigration did not follow the pattern envisaged by President Reagan. Nor did its impact on the makeup of the United States fit the modesty of President Johnson\u2019s prognostication.Immigration brings many positive things, including diversity of experience and talent, new ideas, customs and skills. The National Academy of Sciences this week will release a report that the immigration surge to the United States from 1990 to 2010 produced net benefits for the native-born, beyond those accruing to the immigrants themselves, of $50 billion a year, a small but nontrivial amount. It is bigger than the economic gains expected from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade agreement among 12 Pacific Rim nations now stalled in Congress.But admitting new immigrants carries costs, too, like pressure on land, housing and natural resources, and lower wages for workers with scant education who compete directly with immigrants in the labor market. It might be a bad idea to craft policy around Americans\u2019 misgivings about ethnic and cultural change. Still, they should be brought into the conversation.Any effort at durable immigration reform must acknowledge that expelling 11 million people and having them wait in some nonexistent line to return legally would not just be inhumane but also impossible. The effort must come to terms with the fact that the United States economy benefits from workers of many different backgrounds. It must accept that stopping illegal immigration from the poorer regions of the world will require offering a legal avenue for entry.Reform cannot simply deal with things like border controls and requiring employers to verify legal status. Education \u2014 both of immigrants and the American-born \u2014 will be critical to nurture bonds of identity.Reformers must engage with Americans\u2019 fears, while offering those who suffer economic losses the means to overcome their loss. Reform efforts will not succeed if they fail to bring Americans along.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is Russia Up To, and Is It Time to Draw the Line?", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe behavior of Russia in the last few weeks has echoes of some of the uglier moments of the Cold War, an era of proxy battles that ended in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. President Obama, fresh from a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin this month, wondered aloud whether the Russian leader was content living with a \u201cconstant, low-grade conflict.\u201d His reference was to Ukraine, but he could have been addressing any of the arenas where Mr. Putin has reveled in his new role as the great disrupter of American plans around the globe.\u201cIt seems to me we have Mr. Putin\u2019s answer,\u201d said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of a coming book, \u201cA World in Disarray.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s answered in the affirmative. Low-grade conflict is his thing. And the question is how directly or indirectly we introduce costs.\u201dNone of these conflicts have, in fact, cost Mr. Putin very much. Cyberpower in particular is tailor-made for a country in Russia\u2019s circumstances \u2014 a declining economy with the gross domestic product of Italy. It is dirt cheap, hard to trace to a specific aggressor and perfect for sowing confusion, which may be the limits of Mr. Putin\u2019s goals.The bigger question confronting American intelligence officials, though, is whether the Russian president has a grander scheme at work. So far, their conclusion is probably not. Mr. Putin\u2019s moves, they argue in background conversations, are largely tactical, intended to bolster his international image at a moment he has plenty of troubles back home.For a year now, the White House has argued that these escalating clashes, while worrisome, do not constitute a new Cold War. There is no great ideological struggle underway. No one is brandishing nuclear weapons, though after two decades of reducing their forces, each is now racing to modernize them. Syria is a humanitarian disaster of barely imaginable scope, but it is not a fundamental strategic threat to American interests.Yet the few veterans of that era still in senior posts see similarities. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t come as a big shock to people,\u201d James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said about the \u201cinformation warfare\u201d that has been put to sophisticated use from Kiev, Ukraine, to Washington. \u201cI think it\u2019s more dramatic maybe because now they have the cybertools.\u201dThe deal in Ukraine is hanging on, but just barely: Russia conveniently ignores many of the commitments it signed and has denied involvement in the downing two years ago of a Malaysia Airlines jet flying over Ukraine that killed 298 people.\u201cIt\u2019s probably not real, real clear whether there\u2019s influence in terms of an outcome,\u201d Mr. Clapper said. \u201cWhat I worry about more \u2014 frankly \u2014 is just sowing the seeds of doubt, where doubt is cast on the whole process.\u201dSo far, the American response has been decidedly mixed. The West\u2019s sanctions against Russia for the annexation of Crimea have clearly stung; Russian officials make no effort to hide their desire to get them lifted. But the White House has not publicly blamed Russia for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the theft of the Arizona and Illinois voter registration rolls, or breaking into the cellphones of Democratic operatives.Mr. Obama pulled Mr. Putin aside in China for a conversation that officials decline to recount, and Mr. Kerry has done the same with his counterpart during the long effort to find common ground in bringing peace to Syria.The president\u2019s reluctance to publicly blame the Russians \u2014 born of concern that taking on Mr. Putin head-on would only invite him to escalate \u2014 has led to something of an uprising in parts of the White House and the State Department. A range of cyberstrategists and younger diplomats have complained over the past nine months that the failure to draw lines has encouraged Mr. Putin to see what else he can accomplish, especially at a time of political transition in the United States.Few in the American intelligence community predicted much of this. Intelligence assets have been so focused for the past 15 years on counterterrorism that traditional targets have taken something of a back seat \u2014 they have not been ignored, one senior intelligence official said recently, but only lately have they begun to receive new resources.Mr. Kerry threatened earlier this week to cut off all negotiations with the Russians. The Russian Foreign Ministry responded that the United States was in an \u201cemotional breakdown\u201d and rejected the effort to restore a seven-day pause in hostilities, the first step in an agreement Mr. Kerry reached with his counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Sept. 9.That was mild compared with what the spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said. He called the opposition leaders the United States has been not-so-covertly arming in Syria \u201ca U.S.-controlled terrorist international,\u201d using a phrase that was a throwback to Soviet times.And he warned that \u201cshould any attempt be made to carry out any threats against Russia or Russian servicemen in Syria, it is far from guaranteed\u201d that the American-backed militias would have enough body bags.So far, though, Mr. Putin has shown some caution. While he has tried to intimidate NATO nations with overflights of bombers, nuclear submarine runs along coasts and military exercises near the borders of Estonia and Latvia, he has been careful to stay on his side of the boundaries.\u201cThese are all occurring in gray-zone locations with gray-zone tactics,\u201d said Robert Kagan, a historian at the Brookings Institution who has written on the return of geopolitical conflict. The question the United States will have to face, he added, is \u201cAre we willing to operate in the gray area, too?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greek Lawmakers Pass Additional Austerity Measures", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greek lawmakers approved a new set of austerity measures Tuesday evening, including further trims in pensions and the transfer of major state assets to a new privatization fund to be overseen by the country\u2019s creditors.Earlier in the day, hundreds of workers protested outside Parliament, railing against further pension cuts and describing the planned privatizations as \u201cthe biggest sell-off of national wealth in the country\u2019s history.\u201dThe legislation was approved by a 152-141 vote, an outcome that was expected as Greece\u2019s ruling coalition retains a slim majority in the 300-seat Parliament. But the debate preceding the vote was particularly vehement, and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had to intervene to secure the support of two coalition lawmakers.The transfer of the assets, including major organizations such as the country\u2019s power corporation and the water boards of Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second-largest city, is one of a raft of measures demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors in exchange for bailout funding worth 2.8 billion euros.The government is aiming to secure the money at the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers, on Oct. 10. Mr. Tsipras has said he hopes the conclusion of the next review of Greece\u2019s finances by creditors will pave the way for talks on relieving Greece\u2019s huge debt.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s increasingly unpopular government is hoping that the beginning of debt negotiations will raise its political fortunes. The International Monetary Fund is insisting on debt relief before the fund will join the country\u2019s third international bailout, worth 86 billion euros, which eurozone leaders agreed to last year.A succession of Greek governments have enforced a barrage of austerity measures, chiefly pension cuts and tax increases, over the last six years in exchange for three bailouts worth more than 300 billion euros. The era of belt-tightening has reduced the country\u2019s huge deficits but also slashed its economy by 25 percent and left one in four Greeks unemployed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Corbyn Is Re-elected as Leader of Britain\u2019s Labour Party", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn strengthened his grip on Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party on Saturday, beating back a challenge to his leadership by members of Parliament with increased support from the party\u2019s rank and file.The results of the summer-long leadership struggle were announced in Liverpool, in northwestern England, on the eve of the annual Labour Party conference.Mr. Corbyn, a 67-year-old hard-left politician, won 61.8 percent of the more than 500,000 votes cast, up from the 59.5 percent he won a year ago, when his victory shocked and divided the party.A revolt by Labour members of Parliament, who said they feared that Mr. Corbyn would lead the party to electoral disaster, came to nothing as their favored candidate, Owen Smith, won only 38.2 percent of the vote.The result tightened Mr. Corbyn\u2019s grip on the party and isolated many of its members of Parliament from a growing membership that is younger and more left-leaning, drawn by Mr. Corbyn\u2019s policies to reduce inequality, make Britain non-nuclear and renationalize key areas of the economy, like the railways and energy.The party has almost tripled its membership to more than 500,000, making it the largest political party in Western Europe, Mr. Corbyn said. But opinion polls regularly indicate that if an election were held tomorrow, Labour under Mr. Corbyn would suffer a historic defeat in the country as a whole.In a victory speech, Mr. Corbyn called for unity, said that more held \u201cthe Labour family\u201d together than divided it and vowed that the party would win the next election under his leadership.Mr. Corbyn also promised forgiveness to the rebels, noting that many heated things are said in a campaign that are later regretted. \u201cLet\u2019s wipe that slate clean from today and get on with the work we have to do as a party together,\u201d he said.There are concerns among the rebels in Parliament that Mr. Corbyn and his team will move against them. Electoral districts are to undergo boundary changes as the House of Commons shrinks from 650 members to 600, and Mr. Corbyn\u2019s opponents fear the leadership team will use those changes to replace them with other candidates. Some of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s allies have been pressing for \u201cmandatory reselection\u201d of all candidates in every district before another British election.Anticipating his victory before it was announced, Mr. Corbyn had issued a plea for unity. \u201cWhatever the result, whatever the margin, we all have a duty to unite, cherish and build our movement,\u201d he said.Mr. Corbyn and his allies see Labour as a socialist movement whose purpose is to change society. But most Labour members of Parliament, who regard Mr. Corbyn as a man of the old-fashioned, hard-left fringe, believe the best way to effect change is to win power in elections, which in Britain has meant moving toward the center, not farther to the left.They have also criticized Mr. Corbyn for poor organization and weak leadership, and have said Labour is not doing its job as an effective opposition to the governing Conservative Party.But after this resounding victory, Mr. Corbyn is highly unlikely to face another challenge before the next general election, which is due in May 2020. Labour members of Parliament who refused to serve in his shadow cabinet, or who resigned from it as part of the revolt, will be under pressure to join it, even if they sharply disagree with his policies.Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics, said the Labour Party was \u201clike a miserable, unhappy family trying to coexist.\u201dLabour\u2019s home affairs spokesman, Andy Burnham, told BBC radio that while the party\u2019s \u201cwar of attrition\u201d must stop, Mr. Corbyn must also build more support among the general public, not just among Labour activists.\u201cNo one gets the right to take Labour down to a devastating defeat,\u201d said Mr. Burnham, who is trying to avoid the party\u2019s parliamentary problems by running for mayor of Manchester.Some Conservatives have urged the new British prime minister, Theresa May, who took over from David Cameron, to change the law to call an election sooner, in order to get her own mandate and take advantage of the divisions in Labour. But she has said there will be no early election.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Save Mosul, Arm the Sunnis", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, has said that by the end of the year Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, will be liberated from the Islamic State\u2019s control. As of this month, Mr. Abadi, a Shiite, has had two years to rebuild the Iraqi Army with the support of an international coalition. Unfortunately, the institution remains incapable of liberating Mosul on its own, forcing Mr. Abadi to rely on Shiite militias \u2014 many of which serve as Iran\u2019s proxies in Iraq \u2014 to conduct the war.Meanwhile, Sunni Arabs \u2014 the one group in Iraq that should be given a major role in liberating its own areas \u2014 have been marginalized and sidelined by the government in Baghdad.This is a mistake, and one that Washington should work urgently to correct. Preventing Sunnis from liberating Mosul will destabilize Iraq into the foreseeable future.The Sunnis have the capacity and the willingness to fight. But they lack the support. Some 20 miles northeast of Mosul, a group of some 2,000 Sunni Arab tribal fighters, working with local political leaders, are training. They are from Mosul and nearby towns, willing and able to fight the Islamic State to reclaim their homes, protect their neighbors and relatives, and defend the city\u2019s infrastructure, which will be needed to rebuild the economy. Unfortunately, these brave Iraqi citizens are not given air support or the necessary military equipment by Baghdad.Mosul is the largest city that the Islamic State has captured. It is also overwhelmingly Sunni. The only way to liberate the city and minimize bloodshed is to involve the local population. To invite Shiite militias into Mosul would prompt a huge backlash from local residents. Some would even join the Islamic State, viewing the extremist group as the lesser evil, compared with Shiite militias.For hundreds of years, Sunni Arab tribes have dominated the area to the west of Baghdad all the way to the Jordanian and Syrian borders. My tribe, Zobaa, is only one of scores of tribes in that area. Unlike the Iraqi Army, which is dominated by Shiite Arabs that hail from the more southern provinces of Iraq, these Sunni Arab tribes are fully committed to defending their territories themselves.These honorable men have risked their lives in the war against extremists before. From 2006 to 2008, Sunni Arabs fought and defeated Al Qaeda in Iraq in a movement, spearheaded by local tribal leaders and working in coordination with American forces, known as the Anbar Awakening. The Awakening became so central to stabilizing Iraq that George W. Bush visited Anbar Province to express his gratitude.The Awakening was the most important factor in contributing to the decline of violence in 2007 and Al Qaeda in Iraq\u2019s loss of territory. Patriotic Iraqi tribes \u2014 not a corrupt government \u2014 saved Iraq from dissolution. But that stability and sacrifice was squandered by the sectarian policies of Mr. Maliki\u2019s government.The United States should withhold support if these militias take part in the Mosul operation. Instead, Washington should arm Sunni tribesmen from Anbar and Nineveh Provinces. These forces \u2014 including the 2,000 based near Mosul city \u2014 can fight alongside selected Iraqi Army units, such as the Nineveh Operations Command, the Iraqi counterterrorism units and the Ninth Armored Division.Unfortunately, American officials have turned us away, insisting that we can take part in the liberation of our own areas only if the central government in Baghdad approves. This is disappointing and counterproductive. It is the tribal forces that have the crucial local knowledge \u2014 not only of the terrain but also of its people, many of whom are their relatives. The Sunni civilians will trust the tribes to protect them.But Mr. Abadi, like Mr. Maliki before him, fears that the Sunni tribes will threaten the Shiite-led order in Baghdad. This fear, promoted by Iran and its hard-line Shiite allies in Iraq, is misplaced. The Sunni Awakening forces never extended into territory populated by Shiites or areas where Al Qaeda in Iraq was not present. Moreover, depriving Sunni tribes of arms does not make the government safer. Had the tribes been armed and supported by the government in 2014, the Islamic State would not have captured as much Iraqi territory.The liberation of Mosul will be complex and costly. But it can be much less so if the city\u2019s residents support, rather than fear, their liberators.Jamal Al-Dhari is president of the Iraq National Project.Advertisement"}

But this is a question of banking law. And, on a banking law exam, his critique of the Fed would not pass muster. Let me explain.It\u2019s even more difficult to maintain the separation of banking from commerce \u2014 which is still the foundational tenet of United States bank regulation \u2014 in the face of banks\u2019 extensive private equity operations. Once a banking entity acquires full control of a commercial company, it becomes impossible to determine whether that bank is a passive financier or an actual commercial actor in, for example, oil drilling, uranium mining or arms trading.And how is the Fed supposed to monitor and control the overall levels of risk present in big, systemically important banks\u2019 operations if those operations include all kinds of nonfinancial activities?Even though the Fed\u2019s report emphasized its traditional concerns with the banks\u2019 safety and soundness, the full range of risks that such extensive merchant banking operations pose includes heightened conflicts of interest, unfair competition, misallocation of credit, more complex forms of market manipulation and fraud and excessive concentration of economic and political power. These are all real risks that are rarely invoked in a basic corporate law exam but lie at the heart of banking law and policy.The Fed\u2019s extraordinary step of recommending legislative repeal of merchant banking authority for bank conglomerates must be evaluated in this broader legal and historical context.\u201cMerchant banking\u2019s storied past\u201d is irrelevant here. The original European merchant banks were small private partnerships that took a lot of risk with a lot of their own capital. They did not take federally insured demand deposits from the general public who had no means of policing their affairs. They did not run a nation\u2019s payments system. And their failure could hardly have pushed the global economy into a severe crisis followed by protracted recession.For the same reasons, free-standing investment banks, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley before their conversion into bank holding companies in 2008, were never subject to limitations on their equity investments and risk-taking. Just like the Italian Renaissance merchant houses, pure investment banks were fundamentally different from the publicly insured deposit-taking banks and, as a result, were treated differently for regulatory purposes.What the Fed is proposing is to restore that market to its pre-1999 state of fair, free-market play: Publicly guaranteed banks would not be able to compete with private equity firms, and private equity firms would not be able to piggyback on big banks\u2019 public guarantee to shift their risks over to taxpayers. These are fundamentally different business models, and the law should simply revert to acknowledging that basic fact.True, the Fed\u2019s report does not cite specific amounts of actual losses or gains to individual banks, or to the nation\u2019s economy, from specific merchant banking investments. It\u2019s also true that no bank\u2019s portfolio has yet been shattered by an environmental catastrophe. But those are not proper reasons to dismiss the Fed\u2019s conclusions as the Deal Professor column does.The Fed is not a hyper-populist agency with a penchant for inexplicable \u201cbank-shaming.\u201d The absence of granular portfolio-level data on individual banks\u2019 merchant banking investments may be partially explained by the sheer difficulty of collecting it. If the Fed requested such portfolio-level data, banks would predictably attack it for unnecessarily increasing their compliance burden.Perhaps banks should produce such specific data voluntarily, so that we actually see that their private equity investments do, in fact, generate significant public benefits with no appreciable risks. Let them show to all of us how many specific new nonfinancial technology start-ups they have financed since 1999, and how much their merchant banking activities have actually contributed to the growth of the real American economy and the welfare of ordinary Americans.I trust Professor Davidoff Solomon would also welcome such data. It would provide a more solid basis for debate than banks\u2019 self-serving assertions that they should be allowed to benefit from extraordinary public guarantees, while also reaping the extraordinary private rewards of high-risk finance.Saule T. Omarova is a professor of law at Cornell University who has published extensively on the subject of bank derivatives and commodity activities, and regulation of bank conglomerates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wild About Watches", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 \u201cWelcome. Please sit in the Spitfire chair.\u201dDr. Bernard Cheong, a physician and probably one of the world\u2019s quirkiest watch collectors, gestured at a red leather seat from the cockpit of a former Royal Air Force plane. It sat on a covered porch at his home, along with a mounted water buffalo head, antique ice-making machines, some hoverboards and a handful of watches \u2014 just a small part of the collection he estimates to be worth $15 million to $20 million, most of which he keeps at a secure site.Just home from work at his medical clinic, Dr. Cheong poured the first of several Chivas on ice and settled at a stainless-steel seat-and-table structure, the vibration-free platform he usually uses to inspect his watches. He had the 3-ton piece designed by a Canadian-Chinese sculptor and, once it was fabricated, air-lifted onto his porch \u2014 \u201cWe had to remove the roof,\u201d he explained.Dr. Cheong, 58, is one of the few self-taught watch enthusiasts accepted by Switzerland\u2019s elite industry organizations. In 2002, he helped create a more transparent jury system for the Grand Prix d\u2019Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve, the annual watchmaking competition. In 2011, he became the first lay expert \u2014 and the first Asian \u2014 to be appointed as an ambassador for the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva.He is an oddity in the rarified world of top watch collecting: He is not European, he is not an industry professional and he does not have inherited wealth. As the co-owner of a chain of medical clinics, he would most likely describe himself as comfortably affluent, but certainly not in the ranks of the global elite. When he started attending watch fairs in the late \u201990s, he paid for his own economy-class tickets to Switzerland.He is as passionate about watches online as he is in person and began posting on the Singapore-based watch website TimeZone in the mid-\u201990s. His own blog and Facebook page have dazzling photos of his acquisitions, as well as insider tips that the industry may or may not appreciate. (One watch-enthusiasts\u2019 online forum has essentially barred him for what it described as being too self-promotional.)He and his wife Dolly Ong are regulars on the Singapore society scene, often photographed with something very pricey strapped to their wrists.\u201cWhy am I famous?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cNot because I\u2019m some rich famous dude but because I\u2019m a loudmouth. When I say something bad \u2014 like \u2018This watch isn\u2019t worth a fraction of its sales price\u2019 \u2014 I\u2019m lambasted.\u201dDr. Cheong says that like all good collectors, he looks for quality, rarity, beauty and price \u2014 and also is motivated by the thrill of the hunt.Among his most prized acquisitions are two No. 00/11 watches; the zero is used to label the watchmaker\u2019s own piece in an 11-item limited edition.One is a Greubel Forsey Invention Piece 1, a platinum watch with a double tourbillon, that Dr. Cheong said cost him $2.2 million in 2014. (He said he saved for nearly a decade and sold some less-valuable pieces from his collection to afford it.) \u201cThis actual piece was on Robert Greubel\u2019s wrist,\u201d he said of the Swiss watchmaker. \u201cI will not sell it for profit. It should end up in a museum.\u201dHis other \u201c00/11\u201d belonged to Vianney Halter, the French-born watchmaker who has a strong cult following. \u201cThere should be more people like Bernard Cheong in the world,\u201d Mr. Halter wrote in an email interview, praising the doctor for supporting independent watchmaking.Dr. Cheong\u2019s collection also includes classics from Rolex, Cartier and Omega, as well as historic pieces like a 19th-century Hamilton, a pocket watch made in the United States, and another pocket watch made of cheap metal in Germany during World War II.Many of the doctor\u2019s watches are unusual contemporary designs, especially those with a steampunk look. One is a Devon Tread One, an American-made watch whose face is a blocky black square with stark white numbers. Another is a red-gold Cabestan, which is run with old-fashioned winch-and-chain mechanisms, made in Switzerland. And he has a timepiece by the independent Swiss watchmaker Romain Jerome that includes metal from the Titanic.Dr. Cheong\u2019s first watch, a Flyback Seiko Chronograph, was a gift from his parents, a sculptor and a nurse, when he was 15. At 23, he got his first paycheck as a doctor and used part of it to make his first watch purchase, an Omega Seamaster Titanium. He still has both watches, their bands now faded and too tight, their cases strangely small against the giant models of today.He began collecting in the 1980s and has many stories of those early days. \u201cThe time I started collecting, it was just luck,\u201d he said, describing, for example, how he bought a lot of Panerai watches in the \u201980s and early \u201890s from a Singapore shop that was having trouble moving stock.\u201cI had a gut feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cI just let them sit in my warehouse until 1998. One day I thought, \u2018Goodness! I forgot about those watches!\u2019 So I released them via auction a bit at a time.\u201d He says he bought the Panerais for about $3,000 each, and the best ones ended up selling for almost $90,000 each.In an age of smartphones and Apple Watches, the mechanical timepieces Dr. Cheong collects are, practically speaking, no longer necessary. He does not feel, however, that the march of technology will diminish the connoisseur\u2019s love of luxury watches.\u201cWhen photography was invented, some people said, \u2018What\u2019s the point of painting? A photograph will always be easier and more accurate,\u201d\u2019 he said. \u201cBut photography didn\u2019t kill art. There are still great painters, and their works have only gone up in price.\u201dOn his own wrist the day of the interview was a Seiko, the same brand he coveted as a 15-year-old. Only this time, his Seiko had parts carved from a single piece of synthetic diamond. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he said, sotto voce. \u201cThis model is not out yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The potential combined company would be Europe\u2019s largest operator of stock markets by far.\u201cTherefore, we have opened an in-depth investigation to assess the proposed merger.\u201dThe inquiry would look at a variety of areas within the European financial markets, including the clearing of trades; the markets for derivatives and short-term repurchasing agreements known as repos; and other areas of financial market infrastructure.The European Commission noted that the planned merger would combine two of the three markets for German stocks.To address competition concerns, the London Stock Exchange Group said on Wednesday that it intended to explore a potential sale of LCH S.A., the French operating arm of the LCH.Clearnet Group, its majority-owned clearing business.The European Commission expects to conclude its investigation and issue a decision by Feb. 13.Ahead of the shareholder votes this summer, both exchanges spent much of their time trying to reassure investors about the deal in light of the outcome of the British referendum, which could greatly change Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of Europe.They have said that an exit by Britain would not change the deal but that it could \u201cwell affect the volume or nature\u201d of business carried out by the combined company.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump, in Pittsburgh, Pledges to Boost Both Coal and Gas", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump on Thursday traveled to Pittsburgh, a city once synonymous with the rich coal seam that runs beneath it and now the capital of natural gas fracking, to promise the impossible: a boom for both coal and gas.Mr. Trump\u2019s energy promises to those attending a corporate conference contained a fundamentally incompatible concept, as expanding the exploration of natural gas is the surest way to hurt coal production, and vice versa. Since the two fuels compete directly for the same market \u2014 the power plants that light American homes \u2014 it is effectively impossible to increase production of one without decreasing the other.But ever the salesman, Mr. Trump gave it a go and promised to restore the region\u2019s old coal economy and pump up its booming new gas economy.\u201cThe shale energy revolution will unleash massive wealth for America,\u201d he told an audience of chief executives from the energy industry. \u201cAnd we will end the war on coal and the war on miners.\u201dEnergy experts said Mr. Trump\u2019s pledges on gas and coal pandered to his audience while showing a lack of basic knowledge about energy markets.\u201cThere is a fundamental inconsistency between Trump\u2019s promise to \u2018bring the coal industry back 100 percent,\u2019 as he says, and any promises to use government policy to grow the market for natural gas,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard.\u201cThe primary cause of the tremendous fall in coal employment is low natural gas prices, due to increased supplies of natural gas from hydraulic fracturing,\u201d Professor Stavins said. \u201cIf the Trump administration wanted to help coal, it could ban fracking. But he can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201dThe United States is already on track to become the world\u2019s largest oil and gas producer, largely without specific policies to push new production. Over the last decade, breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, led to a boom in production of natural gas, which is now about 20 percent cheaper than coal. That boom, in turn, drove down demand for coal. Last year, natural gas overtook coal as the largest source of the nation\u2019s electricity.\u201cIf you produce more gas in a static demand environment, you\u2019re going to have a fuel fight between gas and coal,\u201d said Kevin Book, an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners, a nonpartisan energy analysis firm.It is also hard to see how Mr. Trump could use policy levers to expand production of natural gas. Over the last year, the historically high production levels of natural gas production glutted the market. Companies have idled fracking rigs as they wait for supply to tighten and prices to rise. Experts said that in a free market, the government cannot change that.\u201cNo president controls the market. It\u2019s pretty straightforward,\u201d Mr. Book said.Mr. Trump vowed to do so by ending regulations on fracking. \u201cI think probably no other business has been affected by regulation than your business,\u201d he told the gas executives. \u201cFederal regulations remain a major restriction to shale production.\u201dThat is largely false. The Obama administration has put forth regulations intended to govern the safety of fracking on public lands \u2014 a rule which would cover about 100,000 fracking wells, or about 10 percent of all fracking taking place in the United States. The vast majority of fracking occurs on state or private land and is governed by state and local regulations.Still, in his appeal to both sides of the fossil fuel equation, Mr. Trump is distinguishing himself from Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, who has put forward proposals to continue and increase environmental regulations on both coal and fracking.In a debate in March, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cBy the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place.\u201dShe has also vowed to uphold President Obama\u2019s climate change policy, the Clean Power Plan. The heart of the rule is a set of aggressive Environmental Protection Agency regulations intended to curb planet-warming carbon pollution, which comes mainly from coal-fired power plants. The rule has been temporarily suspended by a Supreme Court order, but if it is eventually upheld, it would most likely lead to the shutdown of hundreds of coal-fired plants \u2014 and an eventual freeze of the nation\u2019s coal markets.At a town hall event in Ohio in March, Mrs. Clinton said, inartfully but accurately, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\u201dBut her proposals are disliked in many parts of coal country, where Mr. Trump has put forth a more immediate and crowd-pleasing proposal: \u201cWe will scrap the Clean Power Plan,\u201d he pledged in Pittsburgh, as he has done before.That may please the coal industry, but it could work against natural gas, the fuel of choice for a market moving away from coal. Gas produces just half the carbon pollution of coal.\u201cIronically, if Trump really wants to do something as president for natural gas, he should support the Clean Power Plan,\u201d Professor Stavins said. \u201cYes, it will hurt coal, but it increase demand for natural gas.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Debate That Hillary Clinton\u2019s Polling Numbers Are Improving", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceThe post-debate polls are beginning to trickle in, and it already seems clear that Hillary Clinton has received a bump after the first presidential debate.A wave of high-quality battleground state surveys released on Friday showed her with a comfortable advantage in New Hampshire, Nevada, Florida and Michigan. The gains suggest she might lead by as much as five percentage points nationwide, up from about two to three points before last Monday\u2019s debate.It\u2019s hard to know whether the shift will last. If you\u2019ve been following The Upshot\u2019s coverage of polling over the last two years, you know that we\u2019re pretty circumspect about shifts in the polls. But no matter how you cut it, the debate is bad news for Donald J. Trump.To oversimplify, there are two basic ways to interpret it. One possibility is that every little twist and turn in polls represents a real shift in a volatile race. If that\u2019s the case, perhaps we\u2019ll look back and say that the debate was decisive: The race was very close before, and Mrs. Clinton took a clear lead after.The other interpretation is that the race is stable but that the polls are volatile, as changes in news media coverage affect the likelihood that people respond to surveys or are judged to be likely voters. If this idea is right, it\u2019s harder to evaluate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s debate bounce.From this point of view, big media events \u2014 like debates and the conventions \u2014 raise equally large questions about volatility in the polls.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.After all, the polls really can change for good after a debate or a convention. But other times, the overwhelming news coverage surrounding a debate performance or a political convention is exactly the sort of thing that would cause an illusory shift.Mitt Romney took a narrow lead after the first presidential debate in 2012, but there is considerable evidence that his gains were exaggerated. For that period, the Democrats became less likely than Republicans to respond to surveys \u2014 what pollsters call differential nonresponse.So there\u2019s good reason to be cautious about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s rise in the polls. But that doesn\u2019t mean it should be dismissed out of hand. After the first presidential debate in 2004, John Kerry truly did rally to make it a close race.Usually, a good way to test the durability of a swing in the polls is to ask whether it brings the race closer or farther from the so-called fundamentals, like the president\u2019s approval ratings.A shift that brings the polls in line with the fundamentals might be a little likelier to last than one that cuts the other way. Mr. Kerry\u2019s recovery, for instance, brought the tighter race implied by Mr. Bush\u2019s approval ratings. Barack Obama\u2019s gains in 2008 gave him the considerable advantage implied by the economy and Mr. Bush\u2019s low approval ratings. The opposite could be said of Mr. Bush\u2019s and Mr. Romney\u2019s surges in 2000 and 2012.This year, it\u2019s a lot harder to tell. That\u2019s in part because there is no incumbent president on the ballot, which always makes it a little harder to tell where the natural resting point of a race sits. But it\u2019s also because Mr. Trump is such an extraordinary candidate that many analysts believe the fundamentals will be less significant than usual.In lieu of the traditional fundamentals, here\u2019s something to consider instead: Over the longer term, Mrs. Clinton has led Mr. Trump by around five percentage points nationally.The debate has bumped her poll standing back closer to her longer-term average, and it seems plausible it could stay in that range. The debate has also reinforced doubts about whether Mr. Trump is prepared for the presidency. No matter how you interpret polls, Mrs. Clinton is in a decent position with less than 40 days to go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: \u2018Sticker Shock\u2019 in Los Angeles Housing", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).What does it take to be middle class in Los Angeles?That was the question Ross DeVol started out asking himself when he began calculating how much a resident would need to make to spend 30 percent of earned after-tax income on rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles County.The answer: a whopping $145,000.To arrive at the figure, Mr. DeVol used median rents in the county, with a two-bedroom landing at roughly $2,000, a figure that varies greatly, of course, on the exact location. (A two-bedroom in Santa Monica, for example, is far higher than a two-bedroom in Glendale.) Mr. DeVol then looked at tax brackets to arrive at his conclusion.It\u2019s not simply a matter of complaining about the rent being too high, Mr. DeVol explained. It presents a challenge to the economy, forcing many would-be Angelenos out of the city and into the surrounding suburbs or even out of state.The problem stems in part from the fact that more jobs have been created in the city than new housing. And though Los Angeles has not yet reached San Francisco-sized rents, economists like Mr. DeVol worry that it will stop the city from growing.\u201cIt becomes a real challenge for companies recruiting people,\u201d he said, invoking his own experience in trying to get new employees. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sticker shock in getting them to come here. What we think of as approaching the middle class barely gets you there here.\u201dThe median income in the county is roughly $45,000, Mr. DeVol said. And by some estimates people spend an average of half their income on rent today, he added.\u201cI really fear losing a big chunk of families and an economy that is vibrant enough to sustain it in the future,\u201d Mr. DeVol said.So over the summer, when a group of benefactors offered the main airport a $200,000 bronze statue of him \u2014 arms outstretched as if to welcome travelers \u2014 it seemed like a natural gift for the city.But, in a decision that has touched off debates over the role of public art and the meaning of Mr. Walton\u2019s legacy, the airport said, in effect, no thanks.Mr. Walton was born just outside San Diego, became a high school basketball star there and later, in the N.B.A., a household name. As a retiree, back in San Diego, he has been a prolific philanthropist.But in a letter to organizers this month, the airport brought up the costs of upkeep, and said it would be unfair to elevate Mr. Walton above other luminaries. It also faults the statue for not showing Mr. Walton with a basketball.In a statement on Monday, the airport said there was \u201cno question\u201d Mr. Walton deserved recognition, adding that it would consider displaying the statue for a short period.The public reaction, judging by discussion online, has been passionate. An unscientific poll showed strong support for the statue. But some called it \u201cugly\u201d or better suited to a sports bar.Organizers are hoping the controversy will lead the airport to reconsider.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

Their owner is Richard Adee, a beekeeper since 1957. A lot has changed since he began his career producing honey. For one, his family\u2019s income now depends mostly on pollination services that his some 80,000 hives of bees provide across the country.  The shift has caused new challenges, large and small, but one has remained a constant since the very beginning: the weather.\n            \n                \u201cYou just kind of have to go by what weather comes your way,\u201d says Adee, 87, who is co-owner of the largest beekeeping operation in the world, Adee Honey Farms, headquartered in Bruce, S.D. \u201cMost of the time you just have to wait it out.\u201d\n            \n                Honeybees work best at specific temperatures based on the individual crops they\u2019re pollinating and foraging, be it clover, almonds or sunflowers. If it\u2019s too hot, many of the bees will have to stay behind, flapping their wings to keep the hive cool. If it\u2019s raining or too cold, the bees won\u2019t work at all. As a result, Adee is often at the mercy of the weather, a position all too familiar for many businesses. It\u2019s estimated that weather has a $500 billion annual impact on the economy.\n            \n                Thankfully, today Adee has better options. There is more precise weather data available to meteorologists, scientists and farmers than ever before. Thanks to cognitive technology that allows machines to learn from data sets as varied as a barometric reading to a satellite photograph, we now have the tools to synthesize, analyze and act on that information to make better decisions. At the forefront of this technology is IBM Watson, and following the acquisition of The Weather Company  (which delivers up to 26 billion forecasts every day for 2.2 billion locations around the world), we\u2019ve entered a new era of weather forecasting, one that is changing the face of business and our daily lives.\n            \n\t\t\tA New Era In Weather Forecasting\n\t\t\n                n a recent day, the forecast called for a 50 percent chance of thunderstorms in the morning, with a high of 86 and a low of 56. While simple enough, forecasts like this have decades of history behind them. They\u2019re the result of a range of models developed by meteorologists to make a best guess based on a variety of conditions: atmospheric pressure, temperature, winds and more.\n            \n                        A single commercial colony of bees has up to 50,000 bees.\n                    \n                        Bees in a colony have an array of jobs: housekeeper, drone, builder, nurse, forager, even \u201cair conditioner.\u201d\n                    \n            \u201cHistorically, we stopped once we provided a basic forecast.

We\u2019re interested in \u2014 and analytics and cognitive technology starts to work into this \u2014 what you\u2019re going to do with that information now.\u201d\n        \n\t\t\tRichard Adee with his family\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRichard Adee with his family\n\t\t\n            This is the difference between predictive forecasting \u2014 or a simple best guess as to what the weather will be like \u2014 and prescriptive forecasting: the ability to expand on that forecast and provide concrete information on how best to react to it.\n        \n            Much of Adee\u2019s business is in pollinating industrial crops such as almonds, soy and apples around the country. Instead of letting Adee know that it might rain in the location of his almond clients in California in two weeks, a prescriptive forecast might provide information on which route will have favorable weather or even how many bees to transport to a specific location based on climate.\n        \n                    A single commercial colony of bees has up to 50,000 bees.\n                \n                    Bees in a colony have an array of jobs: housekeeper, drone, builder, nurse, forager, even \u201cair conditioner.\u201d\n                \n                    Bees can travel up to two miles to forage.\n                \n                    Crops that require bee pollination have increased 300 percent over the last 50 years.\n                \n\t        Where Data Comes From\n\t    \n                o achieve this kind of detail, a more varied, complex and expansive collection of data is required compared to what meteorologists have traditionally relied on.  Experts make the distinction between structured data that we typically find in a numerical spreadsheet or databases and unstructured data, which tends to be less digestible and more difficult to integrate and compare to other forms of data. In fact, 80 percent of all data today is considered unstructured (social media posts, news articles and research reports, for example).\n            \n            \u201cOnly about 20 percent of the world\u2019s data is available on the internet,\u201d says David Kenny, General Manager at IBM Watson. \u201cThe rest isn\u2019t on the internet because it doesn\u2019t naturally digitize.\u201d\n        \n                        Bees can travel up to two miles to forage.\n                    \n                        Crops that require bee pollination have increased 300 percent over the last 50 years.\n                    \n            To examine structured and unstructured data at the same time means collecting and managing data from thousands of weather stations, cell phones, satellite imagery, historical databases, newspapers, tweets, even the frequency of windshield wipers on Wi-Fi enabled cars \u2014 the list goes on. It\u2019s more than any one person or even a team of meteorologists could fathom.\n        \n            \u201cI can\u2019t possibly comprehend every possible scenario or research every potential storm and outcome that happened in history based on what I know today on a weather forecast,\u201d says Hertell. \u201cThat\u2019s what Watson helps us do.\u201d\n        \n            In a lot of ways, Watson augments the analytical abilities humans already possess. It can analyze things beyond just numbers, looking at unstructured data to map out the full picture, and in doing so can help us make better decisions based on the weather.\n        \n            \u201cWatson enables us to quickly uncover a lot more data relationships and patterns in a systematic way,\u201d says Peter Neilley, IBM Distinguished Engineer and SVP Global Forecasting Sciences for The Weather Company. \u201cWhat has changed is the mass of that computing and the scale which we can now apply to the problem. It\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg so far. Watson will help us get from addressing billions of dollars of economic impact to trillions of dollars of economic impact. That\u2019s what\u2019s new and cool.\u201d\n        \n\t\t\t\tToday, beekeepers like the Adees rely on traditional weather forecasting. Data from weather stations is plugged into a number of models that meteorologists can adjust based on specific circumstances.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Adees and farmers alike will use this information to roughly predict where and when to put their bees to match peak bloom or what kind of behavior the bees will demonstrate.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIn the near future, The Weather Company\u2019s existing array of data sources will be complemented by unstructured data, providing a bigger picture of the weather.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWith the help of human experts, Watson will be trained in how to analyze and synthesize this vast and varied array of data to provide actionable advice on how to make better decisions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWith this information, beekeepers can better predict when their bees will be needed and how to get them to their destination as safely as possible. Farmers may also discover new insights about planting crops that are beneficial for bees.\n\t\t\t\n\t        Of Bees and Sunflower Seeds\n\t    \n                ut how can all this technology help the growth of a sunflower seed? Well, it depends where you look. For Richard\u2019s son, Bret Adee, who is in charge of the pollination arm of the business, more accurate weather forecasting could lead to better decisions about where to put their bees and when. Cognitive technologies can help Adee more accurately predict when bloom conditions will be at their peak, which means his bees could produce more honey and lead farmers to have a higher yield of crops.\n            \n                        Over the last 10 years, honey bee populations have decreased by up to 40 percent.\n                    \n                        Insecticides, lack of crop diversity, and climate change are all factors in the decline of the honey bee population.\n                    \n            \u201cThe weather has such an influence on the wildflowers bees need, and a lot of times we miss the highest potential market because we misjudged the weather patterns,\u201d he says. If he could better forecast these patterns, thousands of dollars could be saved in fuel and labor, among other expenses.\n        \n\t\t\tAdee Honey Farms owns around 80,000 hives like those pictured here\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAdee Honey Farms owns around 80,000 hives like those pictured here\n\t\t\n            The logistics of getting the bees there could also be improved with Watson. To ship some 460 truckloads each year, Bret Adee chooses routes that are the least stressful for the bees. That means consistent temperatures of between 20 and 60 degrees, and as few stops as possible. Using cognitive technologies, Bret Adee and his team could identify the best routes, road conditions and temperatures to transport the bees, as well as take seasonal impacts like floods and droughts into account.\n        \n            Pollination is just one of many factors contributing to the delicate ecosystem allowing plants like sunflowers to grow.

{"Headline": "Souring on Donald Trump, Republicans Pour Money Into Senate Races", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Wealthy Republican donors, viewing Donald J. Trump as a losing cause, are turning their firepower toward several key Senate races, threatening to bury Democrats under a deluge of negative advertising.The group, which does not disclose its donors, is run by allies of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Karl Rove. It has already spent at least $25 million on other close Senate races, including those in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.The Freedom Partners Action Fund, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d aligned with Charles G. and David H. Koch, has spent at least $15 million on TV ads, a quarter of it in Pennsylvania, where Senator Patrick J. Toomey is in a tough re-election fight, at least in part because of voters\u2019 distaste for Mr. Trump.\u201cA lot of investors at our level are interested in a concrete plan and strategy,\u201d said Steven Law, the president and chief executive of One Nation and the affiliated Senate Leadership Fund super PAC.The race for the White House \u201cis too volatile for them to feel comfortable investing in, and they see that,\u201d Mr. Law said. \u201cAnd there is a pathway for us to hold the Senate majority, and they are very eager to invest in that.\u201dThe negative ad saturation has shown clear results in Ohio, where Senator Rob Portman, helped by several outside groups, has been hammering former Gov. Ted Strickland, his Democratic challenger, for nearly a year. Mr. Portman holds a sizable lead in polls.Democrats need to gain five seats to retake control of the Senate after the Republicans won it two years ago, or four if Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency, giving Tim Kaine, her vice president, a tiebreaking vote.Many Republican donors who either reject Mr. Trump or simply fear he will lose believe that maintaining control of the Senate is their only hope of standing up to major policy changes with Mrs. Clinton in the White House.\u201cThey decided that they couldn\u2019t be for Trump,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, who will most likely be majority leader if Democrats take back the Senate.\u201cThe Senate is their firewall, and they are going to do what they can to keep it. I wish we could change the rules, and I hope Citizens United is overruled,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, referring to the Supreme Court decision limiting the government\u2019s ability to restrict independent political expenditures. \u201cBut before that, we can\u2019t unilaterally disarm them.\u201dOne Nation and the Senate Leadership Fund reported raising $42 million in August \u2014 both an indication of Republicans\u2019 increasing worry about the Senate and White House races and a clear sign that their attacks will be unrelenting.\u201cAugust is almost always a month where you sit by the phone like the Maytag repairman, waiting for a donor to call,\u201d Mr. Law said. \u201cWhat was remarkable was not only the fact we could reach donors, but they reached out to us. There was intense interest fueled by the post-convention drop at the top of the ticket.\u201dGroups supporting Democrats have not been silent. The Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward have spent some $30 million combined on ads in competitive races, election commission records show. Democrats have also been aided by traditional allies: labor unions, environmentalists and supporters of abortion rights. But Republicans\u2019 outside groups remain significantly ahead in ad spending.Democrats\u2019 stronger candidate spending narrows some of the gap. Candidates can purchase advertising at a lower rate than PACs and other outside groups. But in exchange, they are subject to fund-raising limits of $2,700 per contributor per election, while outside groups can raise and spend unlimited funds.Some donors to groups supporting Republican Senate candidates are clearly in the camp that opposes Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. For instance, two major Senate Leadership Fund donors \u2014 Warren Stephens, an investment banker, and Paul E. Singer, who runs a hedge fund \u2014 previously gave $2.5 million each to an anti-Trump super PAC, according to reports filed with the F.E.C.Mr. Portman, whose courtly demeanor runs counter to the tenor of his attacks on Mr. Strickland, demonstrates what money and old-fashioned negative advertising can do. He amassed a large campaign fund and turned toward negative campaigning more than a year ago, attacking Mr. Strickland early in 2015 for his support of the Iran nuclear deal and never letting up.Mr. Portman has had other advantages: a giant grass-roots team with over 1,000 college interns; the support of the popular sitting governor, John Kasich; and a strong focus on issues like the state\u2019s opioid abuse problem.Republicans in Florida, Nevada and Missouri can expect additional PAC money for television, digital and mailed advertising, as well as other campaign support.How much will the outside groups spend at the end of the day? \u201cAs much as we can raise,\u201d Mr. Law said.Democrats laugh nervously, hoping that antipathy toward Mr. Trump will serve as a counterweight.\u201cNo matter how much special interest money Republicans dump into states to try and save their weak incumbents, they cannot escape Donald Trump at the top of the ticket,\u201d said Shripal Shah, a spokesman for the Democrats\u2019 Senate Majority PAC. \u201cWe\u2019re on offense across the map and are well positioned to win this November.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nicolas Sarkozy Is Back, but France Has Changed", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 One of the most popular items on the social networks as Nicolas Sarkozy opened his new presidential bid last month was a video of an interview he gave to the French news channel BFM-TV on March 8, 2012. Still president then, Mr. Sarkozy was seeking a second five-year term, with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande running against him. Asked whether he would quit politics if he lost, he firmly answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The journalist was taken aback. \u201cWill you quit politics?\u201d he asked again, incredulous. \u201cYou can ask me a third time,\u201d the president shot back. \u201cI\u2019m telling you: yes.\u201dFour years later, \u201cSarko\u201d is back. Just like his interviewer that day, nobody in France quite believed that this man, who admitted as early as 2003 that he thought all the time about running for president, could live without the adrenaline of a life in politics. In 2012, it took him a few months to recover from defeat, but soon enough he was maneuvering to take back his right-wing party, renaming it Les R\u00e9publicains and putting his people in charge. In a book published last January, \u201cLa France pour la vie\u201d (\u201cFrance Forever\u201d), a seemingly humbled Mr. Sarkozy acknowledged a few mistakes and tried to portray himself as a new man. This was the first stage of his campaign.In a way, this is reassuring: He has not changed. The image of a humbled, apologetic politician was short-lived \u2014 all the more so since it did him no favors in the opinion polls. Better go back to the original. The Sarko we knew is back, with a vengeance.It is not so easy to run again when you have been ejected from office by a clear majority of voters (he lost to Mr. Hollande by more than three percentage points). Neither is it easy to run again when every poll since you\u2019ve been back in the political arena shows an intense dislike among a large group of voters and a high rate of negative opinions. But one thing Nicolas Sarkozy, 61, does not lack is political ambition. However unpopular, he will do whatever it takes to come back.The fight will be harder this time, despite President Hollande\u2019s dismal standing in opinion polls. Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s problem is that he first needs to win a primary in November. He is no longer the champion of the right, but rather the challenger: His former foreign minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, 71, leads in the primary race. And a former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who is also running, is crucifying his ex-boss for comparing himself to de Gaulle. (\u201cCan you imagine de Gaulle under investigation?\u201d he lashed out recently, in a reference to long-running charges against Mr. Sarkozy of illegal campaign financing.)So why should France need Mr. Sarkozy in 2017 if it did not want him in 2012? Because, as he explains in his new book, this is not the same country. The situation created by the recent wave of terrorist attacks requires a strong, experienced man at the helm, this argument goes. \u201cI felt I had the strength to lead this battle at such a tormented moment in our history,\u201d he wrote. Some saw in the title \u201cAll for France\u201d a reference to a book written by Jacques Chirac for his 1995 campaign, \u201cLa France pour tous\u201d (\u201cFrance for All\u201d). By reversing the proposition, Mr. Sarkozy hopes that his new patriotic spirit will erase the worst memories he left \u2014 of his obsessive ego, his arrogance, his bragging and his bellicosity.Will he succeed? Convinced that next year\u2019s election will be fought on the right, rather than at the center, the former president is making a huge wager. The No. 1 issue of this campaign, he thinks, will not be the economy, which he did not have the courage to reform when he was in office, but France, war and Islam: It\u2019s the identity, stupid.This is a risky bet. Where Mr. Jupp\u00e9 aims to unify and pacify, Mr. Sarkozy is unabashedly divisive. Immigration, he says, took a wrong turn in 1976 when President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing allowed families to join economic immigrants in France. Since then, he argues, things have been out of control. He advocates stopping economic immigration for five years, reasoning that integrating immigrants is an old-fashioned concept that has failed. He paints France as a country \u201cforced\u201d by \u201cthe ideologues of multiculturalism and the sociologists of inequality\u201d to give up the mission of assimilating newcomers. \u201cAssimilate means not only acquiring French citizenship but also France\u2019s values, culture and way of life,\u201d he has written. \u201cWe are not Anglo-Saxons who allow communities to live side by side, ignoring each other.\u201dJust as Donald J. Trump wants to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d Nicolas Sarkozy wants to \u201cmake France proud again.\u201d Schoolbooks, he says, should \u201cmake our country loved, not make it feel guilty.\u201d He advocates \u201ca French Islam, not Islam in France.\u201d And oh, yes, of course he wants to ban the burkini.The whole question is whether, even in such tense times, the French are ready for another dose of Sarko. Patriotism is indeed on the rise, but not in a divisive way. Immigration and Islam are certainly worth a debate, and will most likely dominate the campaign in the coming months, but the country needs firefighters, not arsonists. Incendiary politics is Marine Le Pen\u2019s territory; Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s plan, obviously, is to siphon off as many votes as he can from her National Front. But he has been down that road before, and it has not served him well. Indeed, the mood has changed France since the current wave of terrorist attacks began in January 2015. But the turn has not been toward confrontation, and Nicolas Sarkozy may well have misjudged it.Sylvie Kauffmann, the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

By putting a hard number on his job-creation promises \u2014 even if far-fetched \u2014 Mr. Trump may be aiming to strengthen a campaign message that has been light on policy outside the issues of immigration and trade.And Mr. Trump has now twice revised his tax proposals during the campaign, first sharply scaling back plans for a $10 trillion tax cut and then, on Thursday, backing away from several ideas that drew criticism and mockery in the past.He partly rolled back his earlier proposals to reduce corporate taxation: Mr. Trump still proposes a 15 percent tax rate on corporate income, but it would no longer apply to business income reported on personal taxes, generally limiting the lower rate to the largest corporations. He also reduced a tax break that generated backlash because it would particularly benefit real estate developers.Mr. Trump also now proposes to cut federal taxes by $4.4 trillion, not $10 trillion; he insists the plan would ultimately cost the government only $2.6 trillion in revenue, with the difference made up in economic growth.Mr. Trump spoke loosely and plainly enjoyed himself, repeatedly teasing the well-tailored crowd about their own wealth and business ventures. He put his audience on notice that he would enlist some of them in government, to help renegotiate deals far larger than any they had dealt with before.\u201cHate to say it,\u201d Mr. Trump joked, \u201cbut your companies are peanuts.\u201dBut Mr. Trump also continued to cast himself as a champion of working-class interests, and in his remarks invoked nostalgia for the heyday of the American auto industry, steel manufacturing and coal mining. And Mr. Trump attacked his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, for having described some of his supporters as \u201cdeplorables\u201d for holding views she called bigoted.\u201cMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy can never grow as it did once before,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd boy, oh boy, did it used to grow.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s description of an economy growing more slowly than it did after World War II until 2000 is accurate. But his promise to return to that postwar growth rate and add 25 million jobs over the next decade would be difficult to attain, given the nation\u2019s shifting demographics.Part of the downshift in the growth rate since 2000 was caused by a working-age population that has grown less rapidly than in earlier eras. And that trend is unlikely to reverse, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism in his speech of \u201ccynicism that our labor force will keep declining.\u201dThe Congressional Budget Office projects employment will rise by 7.1 million over current levels by 2026 amid an increase in the labor force of eight million people.In effect, to add 25 million jobs by then, the number of people who seek to work would have to increase more than three times as much as the economists at the budget office think likely.One way would be to encourage more prime-age Americans who neither work nor look for work to do so. This group includes stay-at-home parents and those who see few possibilities in the work force, and their numbers have risen substantially since 2008. But even if the percentage of working 25- to 54-year-olds returned to its peak of the spring of 2000, that would add only about 5.2 million more potential workers compared with current levels.Another way would be to encourage people to retire later, extending the length of their careers. A third option would be to increase immigration levels sharply over the next decade so there are more potential workers born elsewhere.Beyond promising to put many more people to work, Mr. Trump pledged to attain 3.5 percent annual growth in gross domestic product over the next decade \u2014 versus the 2 percent that has been routine in recent years and that the Congressional Budget Office projects for the decade ahead; such growth would require a steep increase in businesses\u2019 productivity.The revised version of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan would still substantially reduce federal taxation, replacing seven tax brackets with three and taxing most income at lower rates.Under the plan, a married couple with $50,000 in taxable income would pay 12 percent in taxes, or $6,000, rather than 13 percent, or $6,572, under current law. Families with more income would save more. The top tax rate would drop to 33 percent from 39.6 percent.More Americans would avoid paying taxes entirely, although not as many as under Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier proposal. Mr. Trump said he wanted a $30,000 standard deduction for married couples instead of the $50,000 in his last plan. He also proposed a new limit of $200,000 on deductions by wealthy couples.Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals drew a friendly reception from his audience, particularly for his plan to reduce taxation on businesses.But he also offered reminders of the distance that separates him from many of the financiers and business leaders who typically fund Republican campaigns. He repeatedly attacked foreign trade in harsh language, and for the second time this week questioned the independence and legitimacy of the Federal Reserve.Mr. Trump charged that rather than simply doing what is right for the economy, the Fed made \u201cthe political decision every single time.\u201dAnd there was perhaps a subtler reminder of the divisive nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign: Terry J. Lundgren, the chief executive of Macy\u2019s and the chairman of the Economic Club of New York, did not attend the speech. Under Mr. Lundgren, Macy\u2019s pulled Trump-branded merchandise from its shelves last year, after Mr. Trump \u2014 who retaliated by repeatedly taunting Mr. Lundgren from the campaign trail \u2014 described undocumented immigrants from Mexico as rapists and drug smugglers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Angela Merkel Accepts Responsibility for Party\u2019s Losses in Berlin Election", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Throughout the almost 11 years Chancellor Angela Merkel has been in office in Germany, her nation has been reassuringly stable in the midst of tumult throughout Europe, maintaining a steady economy and stolidly predictable politics.\u201cIf I could, I would turn back time by many, many years to better prepare myself and the whole German government for the situation that reached us unprepared in late summer 2015,\u201d Ms. Merkel said after meeting with leaders of her party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union. \u201cNobody, including myself, wants a repeat of this situation.\u201dSince her decision to welcome refugees from Syria and other poor and war-torn countries, the effects across Germany and Europe have only grown more intense. The main political beneficiary of the backlash in Germany has been Alternative for Germany \u2014 a trend that has played out across much of the Continent, where far-right, anti-immigrant parties are on the rise in many countries.On Monday, instead of gathering with President Obama and other world leaders in New York at the United Nations, Ms. Merkel stayed home to shore up her political standing a year before general elections, deflecting questions about whether she would even run again.The chancellor defended her decision as \u201cabsolutely right,\u201d but she acknowledged that \u201cultimately, it led to a time when we did not have enough control over the situation.\u201d She pointed to legislation and efforts since then aimed at helping to regain control and integrate the new arrivals.Her conservative party\u2019s loss on Sunday in the state elections in Berlin, she acknowledged, was the result of the mass arrival of refugees and a resulting protest vote against the party.But there were several other reasons, she said, including the emergence of \u201ca post-facts world, where people are not necessarily interested in facts, they are just following their feelings.\u201dThe gut-driven behavior of voters and politicians this year \u2014 most stunningly seen in Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union \u2014 has upset faith in opinion polls and in institutions developed since World War II to contain the far-right or far-left thought that is now attracting populist support.Many Germans found their country\u2019s chaotic response to the influx of migrants worrying to the point that they felt a threat, whether real or perceived, to their personal stability and prosperity, said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\u201cTo many, the German state appeared not to be capable of handling this wave of migrants,\u201d Ms. Stelzenm\u00fcller said. \u201cThat raised questions of safety of their own personal life. That showed, right or wrong, their country\u2019s institutions were not as strong as people thought they are. The shock of the initial wave is still in people\u2019s bones.\u201dMs. Merkel said it was vital to recognize the economic roots of insecurity, suggesting that globalization and new trade patterns could have profound effects on people, from the German farmer to the young population of Africa.Making that connection, she argued, is essential for a decent future.Germany \u201cwon\u2019t let itself be rattled to its core,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen even in such a turning-point, indeed extremely unsettling, year as the past one.\u201dGermans in rural areas \u2014 where Christian Democrats hold more sway than in cities \u2014 are deeply worried that even if they are doing well, they have lost faith in their prospects for the future, she said.\u201cWhen the young people all leave the villages, when one can only with difficulty sell one\u2019s home,\u201d she noted, there is drama and uncertainty \u201cwhich thicken into a fear, or at the very least a worry about the future.\u201dAfter 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the spread of freedom across Europe, she said, made it seem that Europe was on a victorious course and could not be overtaken. Now, she added, \u201csomething has developed where we notice that in the globalized world, we are not necessarily in the forefront.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "VW Engineer Pleads Guilty in U.S. Criminal Case Over Diesel Emissions", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Volkswagen engineer pleaded guilty on Friday to conspiring to defraud regulators and car owners, in the first criminal charges stemming from the American investigation into the German carmaker\u2019s emissions deception.The plea by the engineer, James Robert Liang, a Volkswagen veteran, suggests that the Justice Department is trying to build a larger criminal case and pursue charges against other higher-level executives at the carmaker.Mr. Liang was central in the development of software that Volkswagen used to cheat pollution tests in the United States, which the company admitted last year to installing in more than 11 million diesels vehicles worldwide. He was also part of the cover-up, lying to regulators when they started asking questions about discrepancies in emissions.Mr. Liang\u2019s admissions, made in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, portray a broader conspiracy by executives, making Mr. Liang a potentially valuable resource for the developing criminal investigation. The Justice Department said Mr. Liang, who faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, would cooperate.The Volkswagen case comes at a time when the government is trying to get tough on white-collar crime and hold more individuals responsible. After being criticized for going soft on executives, the Justice Department introduced new policies last year that emphasized the prosecution of individual employees. And the Volkswagen case provides one of the first real tests of the government\u2019s commitment.\u201cThere\u2019s considerable pressure on the Department of Justice to see how far up the chain of management the knowledge goes,\u201d said Daniel Riesel, a principal at the New York-based environmental law firm Sive, Paget & Riesel.One way for investigators to do that was \u201cto indict and cut deals with lower-level people,\u201d he added. Mr. Liang is \u201ca high enough official who is culpable on his own right, and maybe in a position to start unraveling this chain of responsibility.\u201dThe Justice Department and several attorneys general have outlined a vast conspiracy that stretched back more than a decade. Mr. Liang\u2019s case followed the same broad strokes. Mr. Liang was also named as a main suspect in a suit filed against Volkswagen on Thursday by William H. Sorrell, the attorney general of Vermont.Volkswagen has maintained that the deception was limited to a small group of people and that top management was not aware of the cheating software. Volkswagen has denied that Mr. M\u00fcller was aware of any wrongdoing.The company would not comment on Mr. Liang\u2019s case, saying that it would continue to cooperate with the investigation.Mr. Liang\u2019s lawyer, Daniel V. Nixon, said that Mr. Liang was accepting responsibility for his actions. \u201cHe is one of many at Volkswagen who got caught up in the emissions scandal, and he is very remorseful for what took place.\u201dHe said Mr. Laing remained employed by Volkswagen.Mr. Liang\u2019s knowledge of the deception, laid out in the plea agreement, could provide important building blocks for the investigation.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Mr. Liang, who has worked for Volkswagen since 1983, was among one of the company\u2019s most prominent and respected engine developers. He is credited as the inventor in at least one European patent related to motor technology.As Volkswagen moved aggressively to capture a bigger share of the American market, Mr. Liang was part of a team of engineers at the company\u2019s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, tapped in 2006 to develop a new diesel engine. The engine needed to comply with stricter emissions standards in the United States, which would take force the next year.But the team faced a dilemma. To meet the new rules, it would have to compromise on mileage and design, a potentially costly change.Rather than take that risk, Mr. Liang and his team found another option: software that would trick the tests.If the so-called defeat device detected that the car was being tested, the full emissions control systems would kick in, throttling back the pollution spewing from the vehicle. On the road, those control systems were scaled back substantially, according to Mr. Liang\u2019s guilty plea. Those nitrogen oxide emissions, in some cases, were up to 40 times the legal limit.Mr. Liang moved to California in 2008 to help with the introduction of Volkswagen\u2019s new \u201cclean diesel\u201d vehicles in the United States. When Mr. Liang and other engineers met with regulators to certify the vehicles, they misrepresented the cars, according to the plea agreement. Hiding the existence of the defeat device, they said the cars were fully compliant with federal and state laws.By 2014, independent testing found discrepancies with Volkswagen\u2019s emissions. But Mr. Liang and others kept lying as they scrambled to find explanations that would appease regulators.In an email dated July 2, 2015, an unnamed Volkswagen employee sought advice on how to respond to questions from regulators, according to the indictment. Later that month, a Volkswagen employee warned, in a calendar invitation sent to Mr. Liang and other team members, that regulators are \u201cstill waiting for Answers. We still have no good explanations!!!!!\u201d\u201cThis is just the first shoe to drop in the Volkswagen criminal case,\u201d said David M. Uhlmann, a former chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Environmental Crimes Section and a law professor at the University of Michigan.\u201cThe facts make it a stronger case for individual accountability, because the defeat device can\u2019t be installed in a car by accident,\u201d he added. \u201cThere just appears to have been so much deception involved.\u201dA couple of months later, Volkswagen confessed. Along with the $15 billion settlement, it agreed to pay $1.2 billion to dealers in the United States. Its profit has tanked. Its share price has sunk.Increasing the criminal investigation only adds to the pressure on the company. But the Justice Department is stepping into complicated territory with Volkswagen.Germany does not usually extradite its own citizens, so American authorities would not likely be able to arrest Volkswagen employees there unless they surrendered voluntarily. The Justice Department could put pressure on other Volkswagen employees simply by indicting them. The suspects would not be able to leave Germany without risking arrest.German prosecutors in the state of Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is the backbone of the local economy, have been conducting their own investigation. But they have said they do not expect it to conclude until the end of the year.The action by American authorities may put pressure on the German prosecutors to aggressively pursue criminal charges. The prosecutor\u2019s office in Lower Saxony did not immediately reply to requests for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Roundabout Way, a Maine Town\u2019s Future May Turn on a Traffic Issue", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOOTHBAY, Maine \u2014 The craggy coast of Maine, dotted with lobster shacks, tidal inlets and fishing villages, has long been a popular summertime destination.But beneath the picturesque scenes here is a roiling debate over the area\u2019s future.The intensity of the debate is surprising, given that its proximate cause is a rather mundane bit of road construction and whether to add a traffic roundabout on Route 27, which runs down the spine of this peninsula.But the real cause of the inflamed passions is the man pushing the roundabout \u2014 a wealthy developer named Paul Coulombe (pronounced \u201cKuh-LOME\u201d), who has won as many admirers as adversaries in his few short years here.The debate will come to a head on Nov. 8, the same day as the presidential election, when the question of whether to build the roundabout will appear on the ballot. Although the roundabout would serve as a gateway to the entire region, only Boothbay\u2019s 2,502 registered voters can vote on it. For now, they appear just as split over the construction as they are over Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Mr. Coulombe has been buying up the town piece by piece with the intention of converting it from a comfortable old shoe of a place into a luxury destination to compete with other high-end coastal towns like Kennebunkport, Camden and Bar Harbor.He has upgraded the golf course and invested $50 million in the adjacent clubhouse. He has transformed a nearby lighthouse into a bed-and-breakfast that costs $500 a night. He has built for himself a $30 million, marble-laden mansion with, among other features, a 14-karat-gold chandelier modeled on one in Versailles, an infinity pool and 37 televisions.And he conveys confidence that he knows what is best for Boothbay.\u201cI think you need to open your doors and open your eyes and open your minds to a better future for the town,\u201d Mr. Coulombe told residents at a meeting in 2013 as he laid out his plan.\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t do the improvements on 27 at some point in time,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to choke you off.\u201d\u201cYou have a nouveau riche person who has decided to change Boothbay Harbor from a cozy, treasured spot to a destination point for the rich and wealthy,\u201d said Sumner H. Lipman, a lawyer who represents several clients with whom Mr. Coulombe has tangled.\u201cWhen he doesn\u2019t get his way, then he takes action to punish people until they give up,\u201d Mr. Lipman added.The roundabout has become a symbol of Mr. Coulombe\u2019s attempt to put his stamp on Boothbay and a proxy for an identity crisis that the town did not quite know it had. Suddenly, everyone is debating whether Boothbay\u2019s future lies in upscale development or in maintaining its more modest aesthetic.The $3.3 million roundabout development is a public matter, involving town property, the reconfiguration of Route 27 and the use of tax increment financing to pay for it. Voters will decide whether to authorize $1.15 million in bonds to finance the town\u2019s one-third share of the cost. (Mr. Coulombe would pick up one-third and the Maine Department of Transportation the other third.)Mr. Coulombe, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has said that the roundabout would reduce congestion, improve safety and create a welcoming gateway to several harbor towns. But mainly, he has indicated that it was part of his grand design to make the area more attractive to young families, strengthen the year-round economy and revitalize the region.Boothbay may be relatively affluent, but parts of the seasonal economy are flagging. With retirees moving in, the area\u2019s population is among the oldest and fastest-aging in the country. Young people are leaving, and school enrollment has plunged by a third over the past decade.\u201cThe fishing industry has been suffering for 20 years now and has been slowly dying away,\u201d said Michael Maxim, the manager of Abacus, a craft shop in adjacent Boothbay Harbor. An official with the chamber of commerce, Mr. Maxim supports the roundabout.\u201cWe have the potential for growth and have a lot of good things happening,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we could use a little bit of a swift kick.\u201dJulie Roberts, who, with her husband, Paul, owns Coastal Maine Popcorn Company, in Boothbay Harbor, is among the merchants who back Mr. Coulombe\u2019s plans. \u201cWe support anything he can do to bring business to town and make it nice for people so they want to come back,\u201d Ms. Roberts said.Opponents acknowledge that the economy needs a lift. But they resent Mr. Coulombe\u2019s trying to impose his will, complain that he is pricing out locals and say he is homogenizing this pre-Revolutionary War area.\u201cA lot of people feel like their heritage is being taken over by someone throwing his weight around,\u201d said Fred Kaplan, an author and historian who has led the opposition.As one letter writer to The Boothbay Register, the local newspaper, put it: \u201cThe things Mr. Too Damn Much Money wants to change are the reasons we come back year after year.\u201dBeyond that, Mr. Kaplan said, \u201cThe prime beneficiary of this development will be the developer himself.\u201dCritics say he is essentially buying off the town.One of the few who shrugs over the controversy, even as she plans to vote against the roundabout, is Bet Finocchiaro, who runs Bet\u2019s Fish Fry, a seafood shack near where the roundabout would go. Mr. Coulombe tried to buy her out, but she refused to sell.\u201cI like my town the way it is,\u201d she said as she breaded haddock for the dinner shift.\u201cEveryone is complaining that he bought the town,\u201d she mused. \u201cBut they sold it to him. They could have said no. I did.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018I Want to Win Someday\u2019: Tribes Make Stand Against Pipeline", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEAR CANNON BALL, N.D. \u2014 Verna Bailey stared into the silvery ripples of a man-made lake, looking for the spot where she had been born. \u201cOut there,\u201d she said, pointing to the water. \u201cI lived down there with my grandmother and grandfather. We had a community there. Now it\u2019s all gone.\u201dTo Ms. Bailey, 76, and thousands of other tribal members who lived along the river\u2019s length, the project was a cultural catastrophe, residents and historians say. It displaced families, uprooted cemeteries and swamped lands where tribes grazed cattle, drove wagons and gathered wild grapes and medicinal tea.That past has now become a poignant backdrop to protests over a $3.7 billion oil pipeline project that would cross a rancher\u2019s land just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s reservation and plunge under a dammed section of the Missouri River. The company building the Dakota Access pipeline across four states and 1,170 miles says it will transport oil safely and reliably. Opponents say a spill or break could poison the river.The protests have drawn thousands here to the Plains, stirring a new environmental movement for dozens of Native American tribes across the country who are supporting the Standing Rock Sioux\u2019s efforts here to block the pipeline. The fight is nearing a pivotal moment as a federal judge in Washington prepares to rule by Friday on whether to allow or block construction of a section of the pipeline near the tribe\u2019s land.History, like a river, runs deep here. And residents like Ms. Bailey say the pipeline battle has dredged up old memories and feelings about lost lands and broken treaties with the United States government, as well as their worries about the future of land and water they hold sacred.\u201cThe trauma we deal with today is a residual effect of 1958, when the floods came,\u201d said David Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.The federal government has paid millions in compensation over the years to tribes affected by the dam project, including more than $90 million held for the Standing Rock Sioux. But people here say they are still haunted by the memories of being told to leave their homes and seeing families drift apart. The tribe has spent more than 20 years trying to gain control of 19,000 acres of waterfront land that was taken through eminent domain during dam construction.\u201cJust about every part of their economy and living situation was impacted,\u201d Mr. Lawson said. \u201cThey lost their most important resources in the bottom lands.\u201dFor years, the legacy of the dam was perhaps the headline struggle for the Standing Rock Sioux. Now the pipeline has brought widespread attention, intense news media coverage and thousands of environmental pilgrims to this serene stretch of North Dakota.The Standing Rock Sioux have sued the Army Corps of Engineers, which approved an important permit for the pipeline, saying that building the pipeline would destroy sacred cultural and burial sites and raising concerns that a leak or spill would poison their water supply. The tribe has asked for a preliminary injunction.The Corps says it reached out extensively to tribes before it gave approval for the Dakota Access pipeline to cross bodies of water, including the Missouri. The Standing Rock Sioux, it says, canceled a meeting to visit the pipeline\u2019s proposed crossing across Lake Oahe. The tribe says it was not properly consulted.In legal filings, the Corps said the Standing Rock Sioux also could not point to specific sites that would be harmed by the pipeline. A tribal history expert later walked the route of the pipeline, and said he had found stone cairns and rocks arrayed in circles, spirals and other patterns that he said probably marked burial sites.As the judge\u2019s decision nears, tensions and fears of violence are rising.Last weekend, protesters upset that pipeline work crews were bulldozing what the tribe calls sacred ceremonial sites broke down a wire fence and surged onto a construction site. The sheriff\u2019s office here in Morton County called it a \u201criot,\u201d and said protesters had kicked workers, hit them with sticks and sent one to the hospital. Tribal officials say that the demonstrators were provoked, and that six were bitten by guard dogs brought in by the pipeline company\u2019s security guards.On Thursday, Gov. Jack Dalrymple announced that he was sending about a dozen National Guard troops to help state troopers at a traffic checkpoint about 30 miles up the road from the protest, and that he was putting others on standby. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier of Morton County said his officers would increase their patrols and their visibility around the demonstration itself.\u201cThe worst fear is that this gets escalated in some way and someone gets hurt,\u201d Sheriff Kirchmeier said in an interview this week. \u201cAt some point, there has to be an end game. This can\u2019t be going on for long periods of time.\u201dA total of 37 people have been arrested on trespassing and other charges, but no one has been charged in connection with the clashes on Saturday. Sheriff Kirchmeier said his office was still investigating.Theresa Pleets, 81, said she had a deep personal stake in coming out to the protest camp, a field speckled with teepees, campers, tents and fire rings. She grew up in a two-room log house along the Missouri River, where her parents would fill barrels with drinking water. After the river was dammed, she said, her parents were relocated to a small, government-built house.\u201cI want to beat the Corps,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to win someday.\u201dThe house where Ms. Bailey was born had just one room, she said. She arrived during a January blizzard in 1940, and her grandfather, Albert No Heart Sr., took a horse-drawn sleigh eight miles south to the town of Fort Yates to fetch a midwife, she said. She went away to boarding school, and worked for decades in tribal administrative offices. Now, she said, she tells stories of gathering firewood and wild berries in land that is covered by water.\u201cMy kids don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen I tell them how things were.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Did G.M. Create Tesla\u2019s Dream Car First?", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtRevolutionary technologies always start as impractical and expensive, Mr. Musk explained, so Tesla\u2019s first car would be a two-seat roadster that sold for $110,000. But by plowing profits from that car into research and production capacity, Mr. Musk promised that Tesla would quickly create a series of cheaper cars in higher volumes, all toward an almost mythical aim: creating a long-range electric car that could travel more than 200 miles on a single charge, but that cost less than $40,000 for the privilege.This year, Mr. Musk\u2019s white whale \u2014 a car that will get 238 miles per charge, and will sell for about $30,000 after a federal rebate \u2014 will finally make it to the roads. Mr. Musk\u2019s master plan has gone exactly as he promised, except for one tiny hitch.A first affordable long-range electric car, which I drove last month and which blew my mind, is not a Tesla. I had to fly from Silicon Valley to Detroit to drive it because the vehicle was invented not by a celebrated start-up, but by that hoariest clich\u00e9 of tarnished American manufacturing glory, Chevrolet, which is owned by General Motors.The Bolt is also proof that, in the car industry, size matters \u2014 that even if they may be slow to come around to the latest tech, big automakers can alter the car business even more radically than Tesla has, purely as a function of their bigness.But few industry analysts think Tesla will meet its production goals, and the very fact that there is a waiting list highlights its fundamental hardship. Tesla paved the way for the broad acceptability of electrics, but the Model 3 is, at this point, merely a concept car. G.M.\u2019s Bolt goes on sale this year, and the company will probably be able to make enough to satisfy everyone who wants one.It\u2019s a delicious irony: Cocky billionaire makes grand promises in a blog post. Ten years later, he gets his wish, in the worst way.Before we get to the Bolt\u2019s implications, let me describe the car. Most of the lower-priced fully electric cars on the road today \u2014 vehicles like the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3 or Volkswagen e-Golf \u2014 are afflicted with a problem that is a nonstarter for many Americans. They get, at most, around 100 miles per charge. That is enough for a lot of people to get to work and back, but not enough to let them feel entirely comfortable about it.At the other end of the spectrum are Tesla\u2019s luxury rides, the Model S and Model X, which each get more than 200 miles per charge, enough to put to rest any range anxiety. But relief comes at a cost. After federal rebates, the S starts at $66,000, and the X starts at $74,000.The Bolt isn\u2019t a luxury car. It\u2019s surprisingly spacious inside (it could easily accommodate two car seats for my children) and has a nicely designed touch-screen infotainment panel. But it looks and largely drives like a generic compact car. What is revolutionary about the Bolt is that it bridges category distinctions \u2014 it brings luxury car electric range at mass-market prices. In fact, it beats the luxuries. In their cheapest configurations, every Tesla gets a lower range than the Bolt.\u201cNormally for electric vehicles we talk about going from point A to point B and back to A,\u201d said Darin Gesse, G.M.\u2019s product manager for the Bolt. \u201cThis car is designed to go from A to B to C to D and back to A, so it has more of a lifestyle focus, and it\u2019s not just a commuter car.\u201dMost of G.M.\u2019s advantages come down to size and operational efficiency. Tesla has had to build a huge factory to produce the Model 3\u2019s batteries at scale. G.M. batteries are being outsourced to the electronics giant LG Chem. Tesla has had to retool a car-making facility in Fremont, Calif., for its own purposes, while G.M. is tapping into its existing production system. At the company\u2019s Orion Assembly plant outside of Detroit, I saw Bolts on the same line as gas-powered Chevy Sonics and Buick Veranos. Robots and workers seamlessly shifted between the Bolt and more traditional cars as if nothing was different.Can Tesla compete with these advantages? Tesla fanboys (they exist) might point out that the Model 3 will have some luxury appointments that the Bolt lacks, including the option to upgrade to Tesla\u2019s semiautonomous driving system, and access to the company\u2019s network of quick-charging stations. Tesla also has brand cachet and exclusivity that elude Chevy. And when its battery factory is running at scale, it should be able to produce batteries at a lower price, bumping up its profitability.Tesla declined to comment for this article, but analysts I spoke to are skeptical of its plans. One question is whether Tesla will hit its production goals. The company made about 50,000 cars in 2015, and it is on track to produce about 82,000 this year, despite some recent setbacks.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have quality right, you start building cars really quickly, and then a defect happens, and you can\u2019t stop yourself from producing hundreds or thousands of defective vehicles,\u201d Mr. Niedermeyer said.\u201cWe have 108 years of manufacturing know-how,\u201d Pam Fletcher, G.M.\u2019s chief electric vehicles engineer, told me. \u201cThis is what we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why It\u2019s Safe to Scrap America\u2019s ICBMs", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn recent years, Russia and the United States have started rebuilding their Cold War nuclear arsenals, putting the world on the threshold of a dangerous new arms race. But we don\u2019t have to repeat the perilous drama of the 20th century. We can maintain our country\u2019s strength and security and still do away with the worst of the Cold War weapons.The American plan to rebuild and maintain our nuclear force is needlessly oversize and expensive, expected to cost about $1 trillion over the next three decades. This would crowd out the funding needed to sustain the competitive edge of our conventional forces and to build the capacities needed to deal with terrorism and cyberattacks.The good news is that the United States can downsize its plans, save tens of billions of dollars, and still maintain a robust nuclear arsenal.First and foremost, the United States can safely phase out its land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, a key facet of Cold War nuclear policy. Retiring the ICBMs would save considerable costs, but it isn\u2019t only budgets that would benefit. These missiles are some of the most dangerous weapons in the world. They could even trigger an accidental nuclear war.If our sensors indicate that enemy missiles are en route to the United States, the president would have to consider launching ICBMs before the enemy missiles could destroy them; once they are launched, they cannot be recalled. The president would have less than 30 minutes to make that terrible decision.This is not an academic concern. While the probability of an accidental launch is low, human and machine errors do occur. I experienced a false alarm nearly 40 years ago, when I was under secretary of defense for research and engineering. I was awakened in the middle of the night and told that some Defense Department computers were showing 200 ICBMs on the way from the Soviet Union. For one horrifying moment I thought it was the end of civilization. Then the general on the phone explained that it was a false alarm. He was calling to see if I could help him determine what had gone wrong with the computer.During the Cold War, the United States relied on ICBMs because they provided accuracy that was not then achievable by submarine-launched missiles or bombers. They also provided an insurance policy in case America\u2019s nuclear submarine force was disabled. That\u2019s not necessary anymore. Today, the United States\u2019 submarine and bomber forces are highly accurate, and we have enough confidence in their security that we do not need an additional insurance policy \u2014 especially one that is so expensive and open to error.As part of the updates to America\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the government is also planning to replace nuclear-armed submarines and bombers. If we assume that the Defense Department is critically analyzing the number of systems needed, this makes far more sense than replacing ICBMs. The submarine force alone is sufficient to deter our enemies and will be for the foreseeable future. But as technology advances, we have to recognize the possibility of new threats to submarines, especially cyberattack and detection by swarms of drones. The new submarine program should put a special emphasis on improvements to deal with these potential threats, assuring the survivability of the fleet for decades to come.Instead of overinvesting in nuclear weapons and encouraging a new arms race, the United States should build only the levels needed for deterrence. We should encourage Russia to do the same. But even if it does not, our levels of nuclear forces should be determined by what we actually need, not by a misguided desire to match Moscow missile for missile. If Russia decides to build more than it needs, its economy will suffer, just as during the Cold War.Russia and the United States have already been through one nuclear arms race. We spent trillions of dollars and took incredible risks in a misguided quest for security. I had a front-row seat to this. Once was enough. This time, we must show wisdom and restraint. Indeed, Washington and Moscow both stand to benefit by scaling back new programs before it is too late. There is only one way to win an arms race: Refuse to run.William J. Perry was secretary of defense from 1994 to 1997. His recent memoir is \u201cMy Journey at the Nuclear Brink.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Pledges to Lift All Sanctions Against Myanmar", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama pledged on Wednesday to lift all remaining sanctions against Myanmar, seeking to reward the country\u2019s recent moves toward democracy after decades of brutal military rule.\u201cIn part because of the progress that we\u2019ve seen over the last several months,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the Oval Office, as he sat beside Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, \u201cthe United States is now prepared to lift sanctions that we have imposed on Burma for quite some time.\u201cIt is the right thing to do in order to ensure that the people of Burma see rewards from a new way of doing business and a new government,\u201d the president said.\u201cCongratulations on the progress that has been made,\u201d he told Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was under house arrest as a political prisoner when Mr. Obama was elected president. \u201cIt is not complete, and I think Daw Suu is the first one to indicate that a lot of work remains to be done, but it\u2019s on the right track.\u201dBut the move was quickly criticized by leaders of some human rights groups, who said they worried that eliminating sanctions was premature given the slow pace of change in Myanmar, also known as Burma, where the military still controls a large portion of parliamentary seats and important government ministries.\u201cIf the issue was growing Burma\u2019s economy, there are plenty of other ways to do that without pulling off all of these important restrictions, which have given Suu Kyi much-needed leverage over the military, with whom she still has battles ahead,\u201d said John Sifton, the deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cIf the issue is leverage, the decision today makes almost no sense: Obama and Suu Kyi just took important tools out of their collective tool kit for dealing with the Burmese military, and threw them into the garbage.\u201dIt remained unclear exactly when the remaining sanctions would be lifted; they apply to trade in jade and precious stones, and to doing business with some of Myanmar\u2019s military officials or their affiliates. Restrictions imposed by Congress, including sanctions related to North Korea and those governing arms sales and military cooperation, will remain unless lawmakers vote to lift them.But, at that time, he left in place an official government finding of a state of emergency for Myanmar, which calls the country an \u201cextraordinary threat.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Obama sent Congress official notice that he was restoring trade benefits to Myanmar that were revoked in 1989 because of concerns over worker rights, allowing it to qualify for a program that allows poor countries to export thousands of products duty-free to the United States.Since taking power six months ago, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has moved to heal ethnic conflicts that have long plagued Myanmar. She invited a team led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, to begin investigating the plight of the Rohingya, a group of about a million Muslims living in dire conditions in western Myanmar.And crucial political changes have yet to be made, like amending Myanmar\u2019s Constitution to remove the military\u2019s control over 25 percent of parliamentary seats, its ability to dissolve Parliament in times of national emergency and its control over the nation\u2019s security, defense and border ministries.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said she was grateful to the United States for enacting sanctions that pressured Myanmar to restore human rights, but added that the time had come for the restrictions to be lifted. She also said she was eager to draw foreign visitors and investment to her country.Saying her first priority was \u201cnational reconciliation and peace,\u201d Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi also conceded that she had to do more to shift the government toward civilian rule.\u201cWe have a Constitution that is not very democratic, because it gives the military a special place in politics,\u201d she said.Obama administration officials have argued that freeing Myanmar from economic sanctions need not wait until the country liberalizes entirely, and that doing so will improve the chances that democracy will take hold there. It is also an important legacy issue for Mr. Obama, who said during a visit there in 2012 that it was time to open the United States\u2019 relationship with Myanmar, despite the fact that it was not yet a \u201cperfect democracy.\u201dOn Wednesday, the White House insisted that Mr. Obama had not been swayed by a concern for his legacy to remove the sanctions before Myanmar had demonstrated more progress on its transition to democracy.\u201cThe president was quite interested in making as much progress as we can to support the Burmese people and the Burmese government in pursuing democratic reforms, but the decision to lift the national emergency was driven by the progress they made in Burma \u2014 not by the election calendar in the United States,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Negative Interest Rates Explained", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s central bank is reviewing its economic policies, asking why they have failed to kick-start growth, as intended. Its much-anticipated report is due on Wednesday. One target is negative interest rates \u2014 an unconventional tactic adopted in Japan and Europe that turns the usual rules of borrowing and lending upside down.Negative interest rates mean depositors pay money to save their money, a reversal of the normal rules of economics.In this case, the depositors are banks. Like regular people keeping accounts at a local bank, lenders hold their unused cash at central banks like the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. Normally, they receive a small amount of interest in return.But with negative rates, central banks charge a fee instead. The idea is to encourage banks to put their money to more productive use, lending it to households and businesses. Negative rates are supposed to then ripple through economies by lowering the cost of borrowing for everyone \u2014 something that should encourage economic growth.Those with ultra-low inflation or deflation, meaning falling prices associated with weak economic growth. The European Central Bank, which oversees monetary policy for countries that use the euro, introduced negative rates in 2014. Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, which are not part of the eurozone, also have negative rates.Japan\u2019s central bank followed in January, announcing that it would charge commercial banks a fee of 0.1 percent on a portion of their reserves that they keep with it.The bank is trying to lift consumer prices, which have been sliding for most of the past 20 years. Falling consumer prices hurt corporate revenues, keeping companies from raising wages or spending on new projects.But the bank\u2019s efforts are foundering. Its main tool has been an extensive bond-buying program, similar to policies adopted by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank. Bond-buying injects money into a country\u2019s financial system. From there, it is supposed to flow to the rest of the economy.It worked for a while, but recently the effect has faded. Prices are falling again, and the bank needed to try something new.Yet deflation has not vanished: Core consumer prices fell 0.5 percent in July. Nor has there been an explosion of new bank lending, as businesses say they can\u2019t find enough profitable uses for funding, even if the money is cheap.And deflation itself undermines the effectiveness of negative rates. If corporate revenues are shrinking because of falling prices, companies will find that even the most generous loan becomes harder to repay. Many potential borrowers are still telling bankers, \u201cNo thanks. Keep your cash.\u201dNot the bankers. Between the new fees they are paying the central bank and a general decline in lending income, profits at commercial banks are being squeezed by negative rates. Some analysts also think negative rates hurt broader public confidence. Policy makers are trying to show creativity in finding ways to revitalize their economies \u2014 but out-there tactics like negative interest rates risk looking more like desperation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Does Immigration Actually Cost Us?", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the fringes of the immigration debate, you have Donald Trump and his small band of nativists peddling fears and falsehoods. For those of us who inhabit a fact-driven reality, you have a growing body of credible research demonstrating the benefits of immigrants and the burdens of following Trump\u2019s radical proposals.Immigration is primarily a redistributive policy, transferring income from workers to owners of capital and from taxpayers to low-income immigrant families.These opposing views demonstrate the complexity of the core findings in the academy\u2019s report, which is multifaceted enough to allow for competing interpretations. The report suggests that immigration is not a clear-cut issue in which one side is right and the other wrong, but that there are both costs and benefits.The crux of the problem is that the plusses and minuses are not distributed equally. The academy found, for example, that the willingness of less-skilled immigrants to work at low pay reduced consumption costs \u2014 the costs to consumers of goods and services like health care, child care, food preparation, house cleaning, repair and construction \u2014 for millions of Americans. This resulted in \u201cpositive net benefits to the U.S. economy during the last two decades of the 20th century.\u201d These low-wage workers simultaneously generated \u201ca redistribution of wealth from low- to high-skilled native-born workers.\u201dThe frequent harshness of these trade-offs in real life is masked by the academic language of the report, which points out that native-born workers who are substitutes for immigrants \u201cwill experience negative wage effects\u201d \u2014 in other words, lower wages.The report continues:In summary, the immigration surplus stems from the increase in the return to capital that results from the increased supply of labor and the subsequent fall in wages. Natives who own more capital will receive more income from the immigration surplus than natives who own less capital, who can consequently be adversely affected.Immigration is integral to the nation\u2019s economic growth. The inflow of labor supply has helped the United States avoid the problems facing other economies that have stagnated as a result of unfavorable demographics, particularly the effects of an aging work force and reduced consumption by older residents. In addition, the infusion of human capital by high-skilled immigrants has boosted the nation\u2019s capacity for innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological change.The academy\u2019s report provides ammunition to both sides in the contentious debate over whether immigrants raise state and local tax burdens for education, health care and other welfare benefits or whether those costs are more than compensated for through taxes paid by immigrants:For the 2011-2013 period, the net cost to state and local budgets of first generation adults is, on average, about $1,600 each. In contrast, second and third-plus generation adults create a net positive of about $1,700 and $1,300 each, respectively, to state and local budgets. These estimates imply that the total annual fiscal impact of first generation adults and their dependents, averaged across 2011-13, is a cost of $57.4 billion, while second and third-plus generation adults create a benefit of $30.5 billion and $223.8 billion, respectively.immigrants do not pay enough in taxes to cover their consumption of public services at the present time.If we claim we are for family, then we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system. The American people support comprehensive immigration reform not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2014 and it is \u2014 but because they know it strengthens families, strengthens our economy, and strengthens our country.When politicians talk about \u201cimmigration reform\u201d they mean: amnesty, cheap labor and open borders. The Schumer-Rubio immigration bill was nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties. Real immigration reform puts the needs of working people first \u2013 not wealthy globetrotting donors. We are the only country in the world whose immigration system puts the needs of other nations ahead of our own.The intensity of the conflict over immigration is on view in the contrasting arguments of pro- and anti- immigration forces on a relatively obscure issue, remittances sent by immigrants to their families in their native countries.The academy\u2019s report disputes that claim, citing studies showing that very small adverse economic consequences result from remittances, and numerous benefits, includinghaving a substantial and important role in moving funds from rich to poor countries, which is needed to speed up global growth and reduce cross-country inequality and possibly also international migration.Immigration fuels the economy. When immigrants enter the labor force, they increase the productive capacity of the economy and raise GDP.\u201d In addition, she continued, \u201cimmigrants grease the wheels of the labor market by flowing into industries and areas where there is a relative need for workers \u2014 where bottlenecks or shortages might otherwise damp growth. When immigrants enter the labor force, they increase the productive capacity of the economy and raise GDP.But, Orrenius acknowledges there are downsides. Immigrationlowers the wages of competing workers, while raising the return to capital and the wages of complementary workers. In other words, the immigration surplus does not accrue equally to everyone. It goes primarily to the owners of capital, which includes business and landowners and investors.Orrenius points out where the disadvantages of immigration primarily accrue:Competing workers\u2019 wages fall, at least in the initial transition period as the economy adjusts to the new labor inflow. Research suggests that previous immigrants suffer more of the adverse wage effects than do natives. Research also suggests any negative wage effects are concentrated among low-skilled \u2014 not high-skilled \u2014 workers.This conclusion, which is supported by many of the empirical studies included in the report, goes to the heart of a Democratic dilemma, which the party rarely addresses publicly.Among Democrats of all ethnicities and races, support for immigration and immigrants has risen steadily.The economic winners from rising immigration levels are closely associated with the establishment wing of the Republican Party: \u201cbusinesses and landowners and investors,\u201d as Orrenius noted. It is just this wing that Trump ran against during the primaries.The National Academy notes the tension between winners and losers throughout the report:The arrival of immigrants raises the overall income of the native population that absorbs them: the immigration surplus. This surplus is directly related to the degree to which immigration changes wages and returns to capital. In the simplest models, the more wages decline, the larger the surplus.There is, however, no agreement on the scope or size of the lost wages resulting from immigration.Jennifer Hunt, a professor of economics at Rutgers and a member of the academy panel, wrote in an email that \u201cwhat we did not come to a consensus about was a number for the wage decrease experienced by native high school dropouts.\u201dNot only was there no consensus on the academy panel on the size of the wage loss among native-born high school graduates, among immigration scholars there is a sharp debate over whether there is any loss at all.Economic theory implies that immigration should lower the wage of competing workers and increase the wage of complementary workers. For example, an influx of foreign-born laborers reduces the economic opportunities for laborers \u2014 all laborers now face stiffer competition in the labor market. At the same time, high-skill natives may gain substantially. They pay less for the services that laborers provide, such as painting the house and mowing the lawn, and natives who hire these laborers can now specialize in producing the goods and services that better suit their skills.Borjas separately concluded that all high-school dropouts experience a substantial wage loss from immigration of 6.3 percent in the short run and 3.1 percent over the long haul as labor markets adjust to the increased number of workers.Katz said in an email exchange that his more recent work with Claudia Goldin, also a Harvard economist, has convinced him \u201cthat immigration is at most a small contributor to the awful real and relative wage performance of U.S. high school dropouts,\u201d whose relative wages \u201cfell by 40 percent compared to college graduates\u201d from 1980 to the early 2000s.Katz\u2019s bottom line:The effects of immigration range from 0 to a few percentage points and are swamped by the impacts of slowdown in U.S. education supplies, technological change, and eroding labor market institutions (unions, minimum wages, rising outsourcing/fissuring of the workplace).In an email exchange, Card wrote that his own research suggests that the effect of immigration on native-born workers without high school degrees \u201cis zero.\u201dWhile the most common assumption is that a larger work force drives down wages, in practice, \u201cwhen you look at the evidence, larger population normally increases productivity,\u201d Card wrote.If the anti-immigration forces gain ground in this election, such victories will prove short-lived. For one thing, the rise in global trade and financial transactions has been steady over the past 35 years.For the past several centuries, the world has experienced a sequence of intellectual revolutions against oppression of one sort or another. These revolutions operate in the minds of humans and are spread \u2013 eventually to most of the world \u2013 not by war (which tends to involve multiple causes), but by language and communications technology. Ultimately, the ideas they advance \u2013 unlike the causes of war \u2013 become noncontroversial.\u201cAs technology reduces the cost of transportation and communications to near the vanishing point, achieving this equalization is increasingly feasible. But getting there requires removing old barriers and preventing the erection of new ones,\u201d Shiller writes, concluding thatUltimately, the next revolution will likely stem from daily interactions on computer monitors with foreigners whom we can see are intelligent, decent people \u2013 people who happen, through no choice of their own, to be living in poverty.Before we get there, though, this year\u2019s candidates have made irreconcilable proposals on immigration.I want good people to come here from all over the world, but I want them to do so legally. We can expedite the process, we can reward achievement and excellence, but we have to respect the legal process. And those people who take advantage of the system and come here illegally should never enjoy the benefits of being a resident \u2014 or citizen \u2014 of this nation. So I am against any path to citizenship for undocumented workers or anyone else who is in this country illegally. They should \u2014 and need to \u2014 go home and get in line.If you work hard, if you love this country, if you contribute to it, and want nothing more than to build a good future for yourselves and your children, we should give you a way to come forward and become a citizen. And you know what? The majority of Americans agree. They know it\u2019s the right thing to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: The Nissan Titan Takes on the Big Boys", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenUNLIKE in the car market, American brands rule the full-size pickup market in the United States; the Detroit Three sold more than two million vehicles combined in 2015. On average, Ford sells more F-150s in a week than Nissan Titan sold all year.Granted, Nissan loyalists \u2014 truck owners are nothing if not faithful \u2014 knew the second generation was imminent. So sales of the Titan might reflect the powerful name more accurately in 2016. And given that the first generation began production way back in late 2003, Nissan dealers must have been desperate for new metal.And this time Nissan is offering a new configuration. The XD model, which creeps up on the three-quarter-ton segment, is more than a foot longer than the standard half-ton Titan and can be had with a V8 diesel. Although the two ride on different frames, both are fully boxed for strength.My CliffsNotes assessment of a 5.6-liter V8 gas-powered XD Pro-4X is this: job well done. Now that the Titan covers about 80 percent of the configurations offered by the American brands, many buyers of those trucks might be happy in a Nissan, if brand loyalty did not run so deep.Modern pickup trucks are quiet and comfortable, and Titan moves toward the head of the pack.The V8 is responsive off the line. And even if it does not have quite the hand-of-God torque that the diesel delivers at the get-go, the gas V8 provides satisfying and measured authority throughout its power band, producing 390 horsepower and 394 pound-feet of torque. That compares with the Cummins diesel version, which delivers 310 horsepower and 555 pound-feet.The Pro-4X model tested with its 10.6 inches of ground clearance comes without side steps. Old Labradors will growl at it. BASE jumpers will be tempted to leap off it.Capability? The 4WD XD can tow up to 12,300 pounds and the payload is rated at a full ton. Nissan moved the 7-speed gearbox selector up to the steering column to free space on the console for cup holders.The Environmental Protection Agency does not rate the fuel economy of pickup trucks that, like the XD, are bigger than a half-ton. That I averaged only 16 miles a gallon in mixed driving should surprise no one.The XD\u2019s bed is 6.5 feet long, a standard Titan\u2019s is 5.5. The Pro-4X tested has hill-descent control, electronic differential with low-gear, trailer sway control, adjustable trailer braking and cameras specifically designed for hooking up a trailer solo. In short, it does what truck owners demand.If you cannot tie your cargo down with the bed\u2019s adjustable rail system, chances are you should not be trying to move the load to begin with. Optional watertight lockable cargo boxes in the bed are removable to make more space, but can function even with a bed cap installed. And party animals take note: They double as coolers.Skil saws can be run off the 110-outlet near the tailgate. A miss: The bumpers have no boot cutouts.Nissan has increased the quality of the cabin materials, but hey, so have all manufacturers. The seats are especially comfortable and supportive, but construction workers may not buy the premium models with climate-controlled seats and a heated steering wheel.While the touch-screen interface is straightforward,the screen is small and lacking support for Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.Don\u2019t need the Crew Cab\u2019s voluminous back seat? Wait for the single-cab model that\u2019s on the horizon. Simone Biles would be impressed with the Crew\u2019s back seats that flip and fold every which way. There\u2019s storage space for tools under them.Strongly suggesting that the Titan does not merely look rugged, Nissan is providing a warranty of five years or 100,000 miles, bumper to tow hook. Starting at around $36,000 \u2014 $53,000 as tested \u2014 the polished Titan has no problem working for a living.But even with all that power, its toughest task may be luring loyalists from other brands into the Nissan fold. That\u2019s heavy lifting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Fact Checks of the First Debate", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn reality, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, began as an Al Qaeda affiliate that sprang up in Iraq as the Sunni insurgency amid the power vacuum created by the American invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein\u2019s government in 2003. It was largely defeated and pushed into Syria during the Obama administration\u2019s first term, when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state. It eventually split from the original Al Qaeda and rebranded itself as ISIS, sweeping back into Iraq in 2014, when she was out of office.\u2014Charlie Savage_____On Mrs. Clinton blaming Russia for conducting cyberattacks, saying Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia were playing a \u201clong game.\u201dShe\u2019s right, but the United States has not yet publicly named Russia as the attacker against the Democratic National Committee, much less the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs.\u201cThe United States has much greater capacity,\u201d she said, seeming to threaten that the United States could respond in kind. She appeared to be referring to Washington\u2019s offensive cyberability, made clear in the American attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, code-named \u201cOlympic Games,\u201d which played out while she was secretary of state. Again, the United States has never admitted to that cyberoffensive action.Mr. Trump seemed to try to deflect responsibility away from Moscow. \u201cIt could be Russia,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it could also be China.\u201d United States intelligence officials disagree: This most recent round of attacks, they concluded with \u201chigh confidence,\u201d indeed originated from Russia.\u2014David E. Sanger_____On Mr. Trump saying the Islamic State would never have come into power if the United States had stayed in Iraq.The assertion is impossible to disprove, but it\u2019s unlikely that 10,000 troops remaining in Iraq would have made much of a difference \u2014 especially in Syria and Libya, where the United States never had troops.\u2014David E. Sanger_____On Mr. Trump saying that the United States should have taken Iraq\u2019s oil.It is an assertion that he made a few weeks ago, and one that was roundly criticized at the time. Seizing Iraq\u2019s oil \u2014 or the resources of any country \u2014 is illegal under international law, and doing so would have likely prompted condemnation from around the world. In purely practical terms, seizing Iraq\u2019s oil would have required tens of thousands of American troops to protect Iraq\u2019s oil infrastructure, which is spread out across the country and largely above ground. It also is probably safe to assume that Iraqis themselves would have objected to their country\u2019s main source of wealth being used to enrich another country.\u2014Matthew Rosenberg_____On Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation that the withdrawal of troops left a vacuum in Iraq and Syria, which allowed the Islamic State to take root.In fact, Mrs. Clinton advocated arming moderate rebels in Syria and said afterward that Mr. Obama\u2019s refusal to do so may have left a vacuum there. She also privately backed a Pentagon proposal to leave a larger residual force in Iraq than the administration ended up leaving.\u2014Mark Landler_____On Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that many NATO countries do not contribute their full share to NATO.Mr. Trump was correct in asserting that many NATO countries do not contribute their full share to NATO \u2014 a complaint that Mr. Obama and a former secretary of defense, Robert Gates, have also voiced. But he was wrong about NATO failing to fight terrorism. NATO was in Afghanistan starting in 2003 \u2014 part of the battle against Al Qaeda.\u2014David E. Sanger_____On Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to the Iraq war.\u2014Steve Eder_____On Mrs. Clinton\u2019s assertion that the United States needs an \u201cintelligence surge\u201d to help prevent terrorist attacks by homegrown violent extremists.\u2014Matt Apuzzo_____On Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the United States is \u201cnot updating\u201d its nuclear arsenal and the Iran nuclear deal.Mr. Trump is wrong. The United States has a major nuclear modernization program underway, at a cost of tens of billions of dollars. On the Iran nuclear deal, he complained that the United States paid $1.7 billion in cash to Iran. It did. But it was Iran\u2019s money, for military goods never delivered to Iran after the Iranian Revolution. (The principal was $400 million; the remaining $1.3 billion was interest owed in the ensuing three decades.)\u2014David E. SangerOn Mr. Trump saying that China is \u201cdevaluing their currency\u201d to gain an economic advantage. This is an outdated accusation. Countries that hold down the value of their currency can sell goods in other countries more cheaply. And many economists see evidence that China suppressed the value of its currency for years, contributing to its rise as an industrial power. But in recent years, China has sought to stabilize and even increase the value of its currency, part of a broader shift in its economic policies. There is no evidence that China is presently engaging in currency devaluation.\u2014Binyamin Appelbaum_____On Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Ford is leaving the United States and taking \u201cthousands of jobs\u201d with it.Mr. Trump described a dire situation for the United States\u2019 industrial economy, saying that \u201cFord is leaving,\u201d referring to the auto giant, and that \u201cthousands of jobs are leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They\u2019re all leaving.\u201dOhio and Michigan have, indeed, suffered major manufacturing job losses over the past generation. But in the past year, Ohio has gained 78,300 jobs, and Michigan has gained 75,800 jobs. In August, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in Michigan and 4.7 percent in Ohio, both in line with the national rate.\u2014Neil Irwin_____Mrs. Clinton on Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan: Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan would increase the federal debt by \u201cover $5 trillion,\u201d and that it would penalize middle-income families.The Trump campaign, however, insists that the final cost would be just $2.6 trillion. This is based on a stripped-down version of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan \u2014 one that is inconsistent with his campaign\u2019s public promises. It also assumes that lower tax rates would encourage much stronger economic growth, reducing the cost.\u2014Binyamin Appelbaum_____Mr. Trump said that the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, \u201cis the worst trade deal\u201d in American history, and possibly in world history.More than 20 years after its passage, NAFTA remains a political lightning rod. But the evidence suggests it wasn\u2019t a big deal in economic terms. Indeed, the Congressional Research Service concluded in 2015 that the \u201cnet overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest.\u201d The reason: Trade with Canada and Mexico comprises a small portion of American economic activity.\u2014Binyamin Appelbaum_____On Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cwe have a trade deficit of almost $800 billion a year,\u201d blaming trade deals for this.He has the number wrong. The United States trade deficit was about $500 billion in 2015, and is on track for a similar number this year. He is likely referring to the trade deficit in goods, which was $762 billion last year. But that was counteracted by a $262 billion surplus in services.In other words, while the United States imports more physical goods than it exports, it exports more services, including things like financial services, tourism, and software.On Mr. Trump and the Federal Reserve.Mr. Trump said the Federal Reserve is \u201cdoing political things\u201d by holding interest rates at a low level. He charged that the Fed would raise rates as soon as Mr. Obama left office.This is a baseless accusation. The Fed has held borrowing costs at historically low levels since the financial crisis to encourage economic growth. Some Fed officials would like to raise rates slightly. Some want to wait a little longer. But Fed officials are uniform in dismissing the idea that politics is playing a role in this debate, and outside experts see no evidence that the Fed is misleading the public.In attacking the Fed, Mr. Trump is plowing across a line that presidential candidates and presidents have observed for the past several decades. There has been a bipartisan consensus that central banks operate most effectively when they are shielded from short-term political pressures. Indeed, President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s insistence that the Fed should not raise rates in the early 1970s played a role in unleashing a long era of inflation \u2014 and in convincing his successors that it was better to leave the Fed to its technocratic devices.\u2014Binyamin Appelbaum_____Mrs. Clinton said she had \u201choped it would be a good deal\u201d but that when it was negotiated, she did not agree with the terms. In fact, Mrs. Clinton spoke out more than 40 times in favor of the trade deal, saying it would be a \u201cstrategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia,\u201d without making her support contingent on how it would turn out.\u2014Mark LandlerOn Mrs. Clinton\u2019s accusation that Mr. Trump said climate change was a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. Mr. Trump responded, \u201cI do not say that.\u201d\u2014Coral DavenportOn Mr. Trump\u2019s loan from his father.\u2014Steve Eder_____On Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that the 2008 Clinton campaign was behind questions of President Obama\u2019s birthplace.In defending himself for raising questions about Mr. Obama\u2019s birthplace, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s confidant Sidney Blumenthal pushed those questions on a McClatchy reporter when Obama was running for president in 2008.\u2014Megan Twohey_____On Mr. Trump\u2019s comments toward women:At the end of the debate, Mrs. Clinton slammed Mr. Trump for comments he made about a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, pointing out that he had called her \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201cMiss Housekeeping.\u201d\u2014Megan TwoheyOn Mr. Trump\u2019s statements on \u201cstop-and-frisk.\u201dMr. Trump objected to Lester Holt\u2019s characterization that \u201cstop-and-frisk,\u201d the New York Police Department practice targeting minority and high-crime areas for searching people, had been found to be unconstitutional racial profiling. Mr. Trump said that the judge who issued that ruling had the case taken away from her, and that New York\u2019s new mayor had opted not to go forward with defending the policy.\u2014Charlie Savage_____On Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that murders are up in New York City. \u2014Steve EderAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Decline in U.S. Auto Sales May Signal End of Six-Year Boom", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 It was a good run while it lasted.But a bigger-than-expected decline in the August auto sales numbers reported on Thursday indicated that the industry\u2019s long and robust growth cycle may have reached its end.For six years, since the end of the economic recession, automakers have enjoyed a steadily growing market in the United States, as monthly sales routinely surpassed those of the previous year.On Thursday, though, manufacturers reported that overall sales in August fell about 4 percent compared to a year earlier. The decrease was larger than generally forecast by analysts, who said it probably signaled the end of the pent-up demand among consumers who put off replacing their aging vehicles during the depths of the recession.The slowdown could force some companies to pump up incentives on poorly selling models and possibly curtail production at some assembly plants.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the auto industry has finally peaked,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst with auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.Industry analysts estimated that sales for the month totaled slightly more than 1.5 million vehicles, and the closely watched, seasonally adjusted annual sales rate dipped below 17 million.The pace of sales is still healthy, particularly when compared with recession-level sales of 10.4 million in 2009.But analysts are now casting doubt on whether this year\u2019s sales will match last year\u2019s record number of 17.4 million vehicles. And even an incremental decrease in the overall market will heighten pressure on some companies to add more discounts and pare back production of certain models.\u201cWe don\u2019t see the industry taking a huge dip, and this is still a high level of sales,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the car-shopping site Autotrader.com. \u201cThe big question is how each automaker is going to react to slower demand.\u201dThe industry\u2019s comeback in the United States has yielded big profits for most automakers in recent years, and allowed them to increase investments in global markets as well as new technology like automated driving features.But the growth could not continue indefinitely, according to analysts who have studied the industry\u2019s cyclical sales patterns.\u201cThere has never been a streak longer than six years dating back to 1920, so it would actually be unusual if the industry were to rise this year as well,\u201d said Tom Libby, an analyst with the research firm IHS Markit.The industry has outperformed the overall economy for several years, particularly in sales of pickup trucks purchased by construction and energy companies.Consumers have also taken advantage of easier availability of credit, as well as a variety of leasing options that had dried up when the industry fell on tough times financially.And while new-car prices continue to rise, the underlying demand has softened.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of pent-up demand now like we did coming out of the economic crisis,\u201d said Bryan Bezold, an economist for Ford Motor.Ford was among several automakers that posted sharp reductions in sales during August compared with 2015.General Motors, the nation\u2019s largest automaker, said that it sold 256,000 vehicles during the month, which represented a drop of 5.2 percent.G.M. has taken some criticism on Wall Street for scaling back on less profitable sales to rental-car companies and other corporate fleets. Instead, the company has focused on retail sales to consumers, which generally produce healthier profits-per-vehicle.Despite the decline in August, a G.M. official expressed confidence that the industry may still match or exceed the sales record set last year.\u201cWe think the industry is well-positioned for a sustainable high level of consumer demand,\u201d said Mustafa Mohatarem, the company\u2019s chief economist.Ford said its sales fell 8.8 percent in August to about 213,000 vehicles. Its passenger cars fell more than 25 percent during the month, even as sales of its popular trucks and sport utility vehicles remained relatively steady.\u201cIt was not a pretty month for Ford,\u201d said Ms. Krebs of Autotrader. \u201cTheir car sales nose-dived and truck sales flattened out, and the question is, what will they do to turn this around?\u201dOther automakers also reported sharp declines in sales of traditional passenger cars, as buyers continued to gravitate toward S.U.V.s that provide more space and functionality.The three big Japanese carmakers reported lower United States sales. Toyota was down 5 percent, Honda was down 3.8 percent and Nissan was off 6.5 percent.Some automakers bucked the trend, particularly those that sell mostly S.U.V.s. Fiat Chrysler, for example, reported strong demand for its Jeep models. And Land Rover, which specializes in luxury S.U.V.s, had a rise of 15.4 percent.But the popularity of S.U.V.s and trucks cannot make up for big declines in passenger cars. According to the firm Autodata, car sales fell over 12 percent in August, as truck and S.U.V. sales rose about 2 percent.That imbalance may force some companies to consider scaling back production of cars to better align output with demand.\u201cAn end to the growth curve was inevitable,\u201d said Mr. Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. \u201cNow the automakers\u2019 focus will shift from simple growth to market share and managing inventories.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Rules Out Immigration Plan That \u2018Brexit\u2019 Backers Espoused", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Outlining the first, tentative details of how she intends to leave the European Union without damaging Britain\u2019s economy, Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday ruled out the type of immigration curbs championed by prominent supporters of withdrawal before June\u2019s referendum on quitting the bloc.Her comments highlight the difficult balancing act she faces now that her favored sound bite \u2014 \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d \u2014 has reached the end of its shelf life. She is facing a growing clamor for clarity on issues like migration curbs and calls to maintain the unfettered access to the European market that many businesses and financial institutions prize.She received little help on Monday in fleshing out that detail from the minister responsible for negotiating Britain\u2019s exit, David Davis. Speaking to Parliament, he provided few details, but he argued that Mrs. May had rejected a points-based immigration system because it was \u201ctoo open-ended.\u201d He added that Britain\u2019s new plans might be \u201cmore rigorous.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Mr. Davis said he wanted to build a \u201cnational consensus\u201d around a negotiating position for Brexit but added that the government in Scotland \u2014 where voters largely favored remaining in the European Union \u2014 would not be given a veto over withdrawal.\u201cWe will, by the end of this process, have left the European Union, and put the sovereignty and supremacy of this Parliament beyond doubt,\u201d he said.As a member of the European Union, Britain is part of Europe\u2019s single market of around 500 million people but, as a quid pro quo, accepts the free movement of workers across national frontiers.Many employers want to keep the right to recruit foreign workers, and one business federation, the Institute of Directors, said a points-based system, already used by Britain for non-European migrants, was \u201chopelessly bureaucratic, governed by 13 different acts of Parliament and creating 1,400 categories of immigrant.\u201dBut curbing immigration from the European mainland was one of the main demands of the Leave campaign, and on Monday, Nigel Farage, the former leader of the pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party, criticized Mrs. May\u2019s dismissal of the points-based immigration system.Other critics complain that several pledges from the Leave campaign that persuaded voters to support withdrawal \u2014 including a promise of millions of pounds a week in health care spending \u2014 now lie in tatters, suggesting that the British people were misled.Britain\u2019s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.Yet the greater unknown is whether foreign-owned manufacturers and financial institutions will abandon Britain if Brexit restricts their access to European markets or leads to import or export tariffs with the Continent.Those worries were underscored in a blunt warning, made public on Sunday, from Japan, which said its companies might move some operations if Brexit was mishandled.Aside from a steep fall in the British pound, the economic fallout from the vote has so far been less pronounced than critics had predicted, and on Monday there was positive survey data from the important services sector.However, ministers are aware that these are early days and that Britain has yet to start formal negotiations on its exit, something Mrs. May has said will not happen before next year. In an interview broadcast Sunday, Mrs. May also sought to manage expectations by telling the BBC that Britain needs to be prepared for some \u201cdifficult times\u201d and that the withdrawal will not be \u201cplain sailing.\u201dBut while British lawmakers on Monday also discussed a petition, signed by more than four million people, demanding a fresh vote, the government adamantly opposed a second referendum.Mr. Davis told Parliament that there must be \u201cno attempt to delay, frustrate or thwart the will of the British people\u201d and \u201cno attempt to engineer a second referendum because some people didn\u2019t like the first answer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Business Class Poses a Unique Fire Hazard", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn mid-May and again in late June, business-class passengers on Qantas flights from Australia to the United States dropped their smartphones into the mechanism below their seats.What happened next, in each case, wasn\u2019t pretty. The electronically activated seat crushed the phone, damaging the battery, which began heating uncontrollably.Both times, as other travelers watched in alarm, flight attendants were able to retrieve the devices \u2014 in one case, already flaming \u2014 and submerge the phones in water to cool them down. The planes landed without further incident.\u201cIt\u2019s a small number, considering how many flights we have,\u201d said Sharna Rhys-Jones, a spokeswoman for Qantas. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s happening all the time. But we are asking people to be a little bit more aware of where their phones are.\u201dLittle wonder, then, that Qantas has imposed a ban on Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which have a propensity to spontaneously catch fire.Qantas is not the only airline to have had such episodes with reclining business-class seats. Air France has had three in-flight smoke or fire events that were set off in the same way.And the Qantas and Air France incidents do not fully illustrate the hazard, according to N. Albert Moussa, founder of BlazeTech, a fire safety company.\u201cIf you take the same device and crush it differently in the seat, you could release the energy much faster,\u201d Mr. Moussa said.Economy seats, which are much less complex and do not move on a track, tend not to have the mechanisms that could trap and crush a phone.Qantas and Air France have modified their preflight safety announcements to warn passengers not to move their business-class seats if their digital devices fall. But some wonder if asking passengers to pay closer attention to the location of their phones is sufficient.In business class, many seats are fitted with a shield meant to prevent items from dropping into the moving parts below. But the shields are not required. Laura Brown, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman, said airline seat makers are required to ensure only that body parts \u2014 not dropped objects \u2014 cannot be trapped in seat mechanisms.Vern Alg, an aircraft interiors consultant, described it as a case of learning by experience. \u201cYou build a seat with the idea that you\u2019ve thought of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as the seat goes into service and people test it, you find other avenues for things to get down into the mechanism.\u201dWith more passengers carrying more devices onboard, as well as the growth of business class and ever more elaborate seats, the evolution of cabin design ought to be thoroughly investigated, said Merritt Birky, a former fire and explosion specialist at the National Transportation Safety Board who is now a private consultant.\u201cAny fire onboard an aircraft is a serious problem,\u201d Mr. Birky said. \u201cAnd if the seats are involved, if the mechanism of the seat is involved, it should be part of the investigation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Verge of Extinction, a Chinese Fishing Village Resists", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYumingzui Village JournalYUMINGZUI VILLAGE, China \u2014 On a moonless night, when there was nothing in the air except the smell of rotting seaweed and the songs of drunken fishermen, Wang Xinfeng sneaked onto a boat by the dock and sailed into the darkness.Like his father and grandfather before him, Mr. Wang, 53, made a living combing the Yellow Sea for flounder, herring, fat greenling and yellow croaker. But now the government, hoping to limit environmental damage and encourage villagers to find new jobs, had banned fishing during the summer.Mr. Wang, desperate to pay medical bills, had taken to venturing into the water at night to avoid detection.\u201cI was raised at sea \u2014 this is my home,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a rough life, I have to fish.\u201dFor centuries, residents of Yumingzui, a village of 562 people in the eastern province of Shandong, enjoyed a quiet life by the ocean, harvesting enough fish, sea cucumbers and abalone to support a prosperous seafood trade. While nearby villages fell victim to tourism and development, Yumingzui persevered, clinging to ancient fishing rites and homes made of seaweed.The plan has prompted fear among the people of Yumingzui, many of whom trace their ancestry back hundreds of years. Some are wrestling with the loss of a place they consider sacred. Others have deep anxieties about adopting a modern lifestyle, worried about prospects for a new career and the high cost of amenities like electricity.Many fishermen have pledged to keep fishing, even after the village is destroyed.\u201cWhat else can I do, become an accountant?\u201d Mr. Wang said as he carried buckets of bait and trash through ankle-high mud.Yumingzui, named for the cries of the fish that were said to surround its shores, was once a fisherman\u2019s paradise. Its location near the southern tip of Qingdao, a major port city once occupied by Japan and Germany, gave it access to a booming market for seafood.Across eastern China, overfishing has become a crisis, and species that were once common, like eel and Spanish mackerel, are now scarce. In 2014, fishermen caught 13 million tons of fish, official statistics show, exceeding the national limit by more than four million tons.In hard-hit areas, the government has sought to promote tourism as an alternative to fishing, encouraging villagers to lead tours and open hotels and restaurants. In some towns, bulletin boards offer guidance on being good hosts, reminding people to dress nicely and dutifully respond to questions from visitors.In recent years, dozens of villages have been demolished to make room for resorts catering to the growing middle class, with names like Golden Sand and Mangrove Tree.The increase in tourism has helped spread prosperity to villages like Yumingzui, but the high demand for seafood has also brought destruction to the environment.\u201cI love the sea, but not everybody respects the rule of nature,\u201d said Liu Qiang, 46, who was born and raised in Yumingzui. \u201cTourists are the reason fishermen are exploiting the sea.\u201dMr. Liu said that today, it takes him about two weeks to catch the same amount of fish he could catch in one day in the 1990s.When word came several years ago that Yumingzui would be razed to make way for a resort, villagers protested. Some traveled to Beijing in hopes of persuading officials to reconsider the decision.To ease the concerns of villagers, the government offered apartments in a modern complex called South Island Tower, complete with German-style architecture, high-speed internet and palatial entryways.But several residents said they were still unsatisfied.Chen Ruifen, 70, who moved to the village a half century ago when she married her husband, a fisherman, said she thought the plan would benefit local officials, not ordinary people.\u201cWe don\u2019t even have money to put any decorations on our walls,\u201d said Ms. Chen, a sweet potato, radish and wheat farmer.As she sat at the entrance of her courtyard home, her hands dyed purple from picking mulberries, Ms. Chen recounted how she had pleaded with officials to keep her home.\u201cI\u2019m getting old and dying soon,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else I can do.\u201dAcross town, in a house overlooking the southern shore of the village, Xue Li, 45, said he would miss waking up each day to blue skies and the wail of the sea breeze. He stared into the distance as the sun set on a row of high-rise apartments across the bay.\u201cThese are our roots,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody wants to move.\u201dHis son, Xue Shenye, 17, who is studying to become a cook, disagreed. For young people, he said, Yumingzui is quaint and isolated.\u201cWe can\u2019t live like this forever,\u201d he said.Many fishermen said they would continue to pursue their lifestyle after they relocated, partly because they considered it a duty, and partly because they did not have other options.Xue Qingbin, 48, who has fished near Yumingzui for more than three decades, said the challenges posed by environmental destruction were becoming more apparent. He said there were now only three good months of fishing each year. Still, with a daughter in college and a son in middle school, he said he had no choice but to fish.\u201cWe need money to pay for our children\u2019s education,\u201d he said, \u201cand now we\u2019re getting old and can\u2019t find other jobs.\u201dAfter fishing all night, Mr. Wang returned from the sea shortly after 8 a.m. with a bucket of jellyfish. It was a disappointing catch, and he said he felt the ocean had been particularly unkind that day.Mr. Wang crossed a beach riddled with the remains of crabs and the skeletons of boats that had been abandoned long ago. He set down his bucket, looked to the horizon and said a prayer for the next day\u2019s catch.Adam Dean contributed reporting, and Karoline Kan contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Novel Tells the Story of a Family Who Lost Everything", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In The early chapters of his second novel, \u201cArk,\u201d Julian Tepper introduces three generations of the once-wealthy Arkin family through a series of phone calls that shift perspective from one speaker to another to another. It\u2019s an efficient and notably cinematic technique: One may recall the introduction of the grown-up children in Wes Anderson\u2019s film \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums,\u201d which also uses correspondence to usher each character onscreen. (This could explain why the book jacket explicitly aligns \u201cArk\u201d with Anderson\u2019s work.) But in a novel, cinematic methods and the omniscient narration necessary to pull them off can lead to little hiccups of confusion, as when we first meet Rebecca Arkin, the nearest thing the book has to a protagonist: \u201cRebecca was in the middle of lunch. The man keeping her company was Randy Nobel, her colleague at the firm.\u201d If this were a movie, the audience, having seen \u201cthe man keeping her company,\u201d would of course implicitly understand to whom the narrator is referring \u2014 but a novel has no such visual cue, so when \u201cthe man\u201d is mentioned here, I went back just to make sure he hadn\u2019t been brought up previously.To be sure, Tepper has good reasons to rely on Hollywood devices, the primary one being the sheer number of characters populating this relatively short work. There\u2019s Ben Arkin, the artist-patriarch, who has assiduously worked for decades in his unrenovated loft on artwork that has never sold. There\u2019s Ben\u2019s long-\u00adsuffering wife, Eliza, who to add insult to injury must sell her mother\u2019s diamonds for the money to fight a lawsuit. Ben and Eliza\u2019s children \u2014 Doris, Oliver and Sondra (the last of whom is the one suing the family) \u2014 ran an unsuccessful record label their father repeatedly financed and are now all in various states of disrepair and dormancy. And then there is Oliver\u2019s daughter, Rebecca, the responsible lawyer trapped in the middle. Throw in Ben\u2019s assistant, Rebecca\u2019s mother, Oliver\u2019s new wife and sundry other \u00adspouses, employees and business relations of the Arkin clan, and you can see the need for some swift way to bring these people together. It\u2019s not hard to imagine the TV show \u201cArrested Development\u201d as another influence: Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything. .\u2008.\u2008. (In this reading, Rebecca is the Michael Bluth character just trying to hold it all together.)\u201cArk\u201d works better when it gets past the obligatory lineup of the dramatis personae and onto the more novelistic sections. An epistolary exchange between the exasperated Rebecca and her filmmaker mother, for instance, creates some of the most touching returns on the theme of lost fortunes. After relating the story of an agonized Ben lamenting that he\u2019s a \u201cpoor, poor man,\u201d Rebecca writes:\u201cCan you imagine a person who had firsthand experience of Depression-era poverty sitting in his multimillion dollar SoHo loft with his multimillion dollar house in the Hamptons just a short car ride away going on about how he was poor? What does that mean, Mom? It confuses and frightens me. There\u2019s some fundamental principle to money which I don\u2019t understand.\u201dAmid lawsuits and scuffles over inheritances, Rebecca\u2019s brief meditation provides a much needed window onto a reasonable, less privileged perspective, and the letter surprises with its comparative depth. Rebecca is the mass around which the whole novel orbits, its plausible center, even though she and her family see things in precisely opposite ways.Despite some early stumbles, \u201cArk\u201d is an engaging and entertaining novel, and an insightful take on just how easy it can be to slip from the upper class. Its characters are funny, too, in that offensive way we seem to forgive mainly in the rich or elderly. The wealthy, of course, have long gotten away with everything \u2014 but now, the novel suggests, with money dwindling and economies struggling, they\u2019ll finally get what they deserve: to be just like the rest of us. A tragic fate, indeed.Jonathan Russell Clark is a staff writer for Literary Hub. His essays have also appeared in The Atlantic, Tin House and Rolling Stone, among other publications.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cellphones, Not Banks, May Be Key to Finance in the Developing World", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The increasing digitization of finance, and the move away from cash, could add 6 percent to the annual economic output of the world\u2019s developing nations over the next 10 years, according to a new report from the McKinsey consulting firm\u2019s research arm.The report, released on Wednesday, says that developing nations \u2014 and to a lesser extent developed economies like the United States \u2014 lose enormous amounts of economic potential from the continuing reliance on cash and the difficulty many businesses and individuals encounter when trying to gain access to the financial system.The mobile phone, however, has provided a new and cheaper way to provide basic financial services to nearly everyone in the developing world.The 124-page report from the McKinsey Global Institute says that 80 percent of the people in the developing world currently have mobile phones, and by 2020 that will rise to 90 percent.A growing number of start-ups are already providing financial services through cellphones, often without a bank being involved. In Kenya, for instance, more than 70 percent of adults are using a digital money system known as M-Pesa that started less than a decade ago.Susan Lund, one of the co-authors of the McKinsey report, said that as her team crunched the numbers on the impact of digital finance, even she was surprised by the impact it could have on the broader economy \u2014 some $3.7 trillion in additional annual economic activity by 2025.\u201cI thought this was about financial services,\u201d Ms. Lund said. \u201cI now think of this more like basic infrastructure for a modern economy, as opposed to just something that banks do.\u201dAny effort to provide more financial services to the developing world is likely to encounter both resistance and skepticism, given the somewhat spotty record of past financial projects aimed at helping the poor.The flow of financial investments into emerging economies has, in the past, played into currency and financial crises around the world.In the more recent past, elite institutions like McKinsey have also promoted the use of microlending in the developing world, which was aimed at bringing people out of poverty by giving them credit.Ms. Lund acknowledged the lackluster results from microlending. She said that the economic growth projected by McKinsey did not rely much on expanded credit to individuals.Instead, she said, most of the opportunity comes from the transition to digital payments from cash, which can significantly increase productivity and open up a whole set of economic opportunities that aren\u2019t available when people rely on cash.The McKinsey report said that for individuals, the average cash transfer can require three or four hours in developing countries, because of the time required to travel to, and wait at, a financial institution.For businesses and governments, reliance on cash leads to lost time, the \u201cleakage\u201d of money \u2014 read theft \u2014 and missed opportunities to transact with the broader world.Moving countries away from cash has been hard because it has required the addition of new and expensive physical facilities and bank branches. But with the spread of mobile phones, providing financial services costs 80 to 90 percent less, the McKinsey report says.In Kenya, for instance, people who used to rely on cash and services like Western Union can now send money to relatives across the country using M-Pesa.Economists have recently begun to highlight the broader economic benefits of this sort of transition.Once people move to digital money, companies can also do so more easily and governments can distribute funds electronically, leading to less corruption and missing money.With money in a digital account, saving money and planning for the future also becomes easier.The research on these topics has turned financial inclusion and innovation into one of the big priorities at Bill Gates\u2019s family foundation.Perhaps the biggest question facing efforts like those of the Gates Foundation is how hard it will be to spread technology like M-Pesa to other countries.There are many efforts to replicate M-Pesa elsewhere in Africa and Asia, but most of them have been somewhat slow to take off.India is currently in the midst of a large effort to move individuals into electronic financial accounts.Ms. Lund said that in addition to having mobile phones, countries need regulations that allow for the development of new financial technology and start-ups that address the existing landscape. Any new efforts will also face resistance from the existing financial players in developing countries.But Ms. Lund noted that the most expensive requirement for moving forward, the mobile networks, are now in place.\u201cThere are a lot of pieces that have to come together. It\u2019s not so easy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike building roads and ports \u2014 at least the hard infrastructure is in place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Deportation Nation", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt\u2019s ridiculous that Donald Trump\u2019s immigration proposals \u2014 not so much a policy as empty words strung together and repeated \u2014 should have propelled him as far as they have. This confounding situation hit peak absurdity on Wednesday.It started with Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, in Mexico City. It was surreal because Mr. Trump has spent his entire campaign painting Mexico as a nation of rapists, drug smugglers and trade hustlers who would have to pay for the 2,000-mile border wall that Mr. Trump was going to build. But instead of chastising Mr. Trump, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto treated him like a visiting head of state at a news conference, with side-by-side lecterns and words of deferential mush.Mr. Trump then headed back over the border, shedding his decorum by the time he got to Phoenix.In a strident speech given over a steady roar of cheers, he restated his brutally simple message: Criminal aliens were roaming our streets by the millions, killing Americans and stealing our jobs, and he\u2019d kick them all out with a new \u201cdeportation force,\u201d build the wall and make America safe again.The speech was a reverie of immigrant-fearing, police-state bluster, with Mr. Trump gushing about building \u201can impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall,\u201d assailing \u201cmedia elites\u201d and listing his various notions for thwarting evil foreigners. He said the immigration force might deport Hillary Clinton.By now we should all know better than to take what Mr. Trump says on any given Wednesday as somehow truer than what he said the previous Wednesday, or will say the following Wednesday, and whether what he tells the Mexican president or a crowd in Phoenix is more honest than what he says at a presidential debate or in a campaign ad.The details may change. Mr. Trump and his surrogates may talk about a real or \u201cvirtual\u201d border wall, electronic workplace verification, this or that entry-exit system, an aggressive deportation force or more gradual \u201cattrition through enforcement.\u201d They may talk about legalization someday, years from now, or never. Those talking points ultimately don\u2019t matter \u2014 a President Trump wouldn\u2019t have the resources to deport 11 million people. He has no workable plan to seal the border, build a wall or repair the economy once he destroys it by devastating the immigrant work force. He would, however, be able to make millions of immigrants miserable, and break up their families, and damage the country.To mock him for emptiness is almost too easy. But the fear and loathing that he has tapped into, that so easily won him the nomination, are real. They are real in Arizona, home to one of the nation\u2019s worst state immigration laws, where the political and law-enforcement powers have been arrayed for years against Latino immigrants.Which is what makes Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to speak in Phoenix so perversely appropriate. While Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for a locked-down deportation nation are largely a nativist fantasy, immigrant communities in Arizona have lived with the reality of what the Trump vision leads to: the brutal racial profiling and policing abuses of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a staunch Trump ally, who echoes and inspires Mr. Trump\u2019s vicious talk about immigrants as criminals. As Sheriff Arpaio seeks a seventh term this fall, his opponents are pushing back, with protests and get-out-the-vote campaigns, to stop the sheriff\u2019s re-election.Arizona, home of Minutemen vigilantes and a powerful grass-roots immigrant-rights movement, has long been a national bellwether on immigration policy. It was a fitting backdrop to Mr. Trump\u2019s hollow proposals, and his relentless lies about the dangers that immigrants pose to the lives of \u201cour American citizens.\u201d Tornadoes are hollow at the center, too, and they do a lot of damage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Outcry Erupts Over Miami Beach\u2019s Pesticide Spraying to Curb Zika", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI BEACH \u2014 As Miami Beach works to blunt the spread of Zika \u2014 a virus that is taking a toll on tourism here \u2014 the city is wrestling with a separate predicament: a fast-growing outcry over the aerial spraying of naled, the pesticide used to kill adult mosquitoes.The activists want a two-week moratorium on the spraying, which has been done twice in the last two weeks, to see if there is a decline in the number of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which carry the virus, with the continued use of more conventional methods. Naled, which is approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, is supplementing the hand spraying and truck spraying of a different chemical intended to kill larvae.A Miami Beach commission meeting this past week was packed with protesters who criticized the use of the pesticide, and booed or shouted down scientists and doctors who spoke of its safety and the need to control the Zika virus here before it turns into a more serious problem. Miami-Dade County, the only area in the country besides Puerto Rico with active local Zika transmission, is one of 29 counties under a state public health emergency.\u201cNone of us wants to hurt the economy,\u201d said Michael Capponi, a longtime nightlife promoter on Miami Beach. \u201cWe want to combat Zika. We want to put out there that when there is something this dangerous, we ought to look at it.\u201dSo far, the protests have failed to persuade the county or the state to alter its plans to spray very low doses of naled across 1.5 square miles of South Beach, a densely populated area and Miami Beach\u2019s tourism hub. Another early morning spraying is scheduled for Sunday and a fourth for next Saturday.The state and county said Friday that they would pursue a more aggressive spraying strategy after Gov. Rick Scott announced a new cluster of active local transmission farther north in Miami Beach. The active transmission zone is now 4.5 square miles, triple the size it was. It reaches 63rd Street and covers most of the island.On the advice of the federal and state governments, the Miami-Dade County mayor, Carlos A. Gimenez, first ordered aerial spraying in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July when active Zika transmission was discovered there, north of downtown.More conventional pesticides, officials said, were failing because mosquitoes had grown resistant. Naled was sprayed there with little fanfare on four occasions, and officials reported a steep drop in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The spraying was called off soon after.On Friday, Mr. Scott said that the state expected to lift the advisory on the zone of transmission in Wynwood.The same strategy is playing out in Miami Beach, where active transmission was discovered in mid-August. Mosquito control officials say they are seeing a reduction in the mosquito population since the aerial spraying began. But the reaction has been decidedly different on this island of mostly wealthy, beach- and nightlife-loving people, and those who cater to them.Protesters here are drawing inspiration from Puerto Rico, where Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla rebuffed pressure this summer from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to spray naled. Puerto Rico is now in the throes of an epidemic, with nearly 20,000 reported cases of Zika. As of Friday night, Florida had 93 cases of local transmission. The virus is particularly dangerous for pregnant women because it can cause severe brain abnormalities and other problems in fetuses.\u201cNo one likes the aerial spraying. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t want it. We have a choice. Do we become Puerto Rico, or do we eliminate or eradicate this virus?\u201d said Mayor Philip Levine of Miami Beach, who emphasized that the federal government had found naled to be safe in the dose being used.Mr. Levine said a balance must be struck between fear of naled and protecting pregnant women.But residents said they were also seeking a balance, arguing that the level of Zika mosquitoes in Miami Beach is not so alarming to warrant continued use of naled. They argue that people are out and about in Miami Beach on weekends at 6 a.m., which is typically when the spraying occurs.\u201cMy main issue is that all safe options should be explored before you take something out that on the labels says can cause birth defects,\u201d said Diane Fragale, a holistic practitioner.Ms. Fragale, who lives near the aerial spraying, said she did not believe it was a coincidence that hours after the first naled application she developed sties in her eyes, something she said had never happened. Ms. Fragale said she had followed the county\u2019s advice and shut off her air-conditioning and stayed indoors.Naled, which is known to kill bees and, depending on toxicity levels, fish and birds, is not new to Florida or other states. It has been sprayed in Florida for decades across six million acres. But those are mostly unpopulated.Naled is used mostly to reduce the population of salt marsh mosquitoes, which bite at night and do not typically live in urban environments. Entomologists say it is rarely sprayed in urban areas in the morning. But that is when naled must be sprayed, typically in a fine mist, to come in contact with the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which lives in small urban spaces.That kind of spraying \u201cis very uncommon,\u201d said Grayson C. Brown, the director of the public entomology laboratory at the University of Kentucky. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to get them. They are really kind of stuck.\u201dSeveral South Florida counties have used naled for a long time. Collier County does aerial spraying over populated areas, like Naples, when the mosquito count warrants it. Until recently, there had not been any complaints from residents saying they had fallen ill, said Patrick P. Linn, the mosquito control director there. But that is changing.\u201cWe have been receiving a fair stream of calls from concerned citizens that are either becoming aware of this or activists that have misgivings about the use of this chemical,\u201d Mr. Linn said.Broward County said it would not use naled on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and has used other pesticides sprayed by hand or from a truck.Ahn Ton, who is in charge of mosquito control in Broward, said the naled mist \u2014 which is sprayed in very fine droplets that float in the air, seldom touch ground and kills mosquitoes on contact \u2014 is not as effective because Aedes aegypti hide in nooks and crannies where the mist cannot reach them.\u201cIf you are spraying by air, you are hoping that those mists will land in the mosquitoes, and because they are hiding it\u2019s hard to get them at any particular time,\u201d he said.But Mayor Levine said Zika spreads easily because it is asymptomatic in most people, making the hot spots hard to find. In his view, emergencies warrant extraordinary measures, and he supports the county\u2019s decision to spray.\u201cWe have a big problem and the experts are telling us this is what we have to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be irresponsible not to listen to the experts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Big Debt Worries George Soros. Should It Worry You?", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut some say the biggest danger of all may be on the other side of the world, in China.How big a danger does China\u2019s fast-growing debt load present to the country, or the world?The traditional view is that rapidly rising debt eventually leads to an economic crisis. That can happen in several ways. In Greece, the culprit was the government, which built up more debt than it could handle. In the United States, the risks lurked in the finances of banks and households.In the case of China, the problem is primarily in the corporate sector. China\u2019s big companies \u2014 especially those owned by the state \u2014 have done much of the borrowing. Higher debt means companies will have to spend more on interest and paying it back, and less on investing and hiring.That is where a vicious cycle could come in. Less spending on investing and hiring hurts the overall economy, hitting corporate bottom lines and making it even harder for companies to pay off debt. Bad loans rise. Banks freeze lending. Confidence in the financial system can be shaken, leading to a full-fledged banking crisis.China, which has the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States\u2019, plays a crucial role in generating global growth. Such a situation in China could ripple across the world.On the other hand, a number of economists say China\u2019s mountain of debt is not as scary as it appears.Qu Hongbin, chief economist for Greater China at HSBC, and his team argue that China\u2019s debt is simply a result of the way its financial system works. For a variety of reasons, China\u2019s corporations and households stash more money away than their peers in other countries. That cash piles up in banks and is turned into loans, resulting in China\u2019s high level of debt.Since the debt is backed by all that savings, it is not as risky, Mr. Qu contends. \u201cConcerns about China\u2019s debt levels reaching a critical threshold and posing a systemic risk are overblown,\u201d the HSBC team wrote in April.Others argue that China\u2019s debt is less of a threat because it is to a great degree backed by the government. Much of it comes from state-run banks, which are the primary lenders to China\u2019s large state-run companies. That means Beijing can stop banks from pushing borrowers too hard and would be more inclined to shore up the financial system, preventing the crisis that a more free-market economy might suffer.The debt, too, is largely domestic, making China less likely to be pushed into a crisis by problems outside its borders, which have toppled debt-heavy emerging economies in the past.Other economies, furthermore, have debt similar to or even bigger than China\u2019s. Debt in the United States, for instance, is roughly equivalent when compared with the size of America\u2019s economy. Japan\u2019s is much larger, at nearly four times the size of its national output.Still, there is ample evidence to suggest that a large expansion of debt almost always has disastrous consequences.Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist at the research firm Capital Economics, has studied more than 25 years of collapses in developing economies. He concludes that the pace of debt accumulation is more important than the overall level of debt in determining whether a country will face a financial crisis. China\u2019s pace of debt accumulation is well above the threshold he identified as indicating the potential for crisis.Some economists say that even if China dodges a full-scale crisis, it may not be able to escape the damage caused by its rising debt. They fear that China could fall into a yearslong slump like Japan, which has regularly suffered little or even no growth ever since its own banking crisis more than two decades ago.In China\u2019s case, the problems created by such an outcome would be much more painful, since it would enter that slow-growth period with its people at a much lower standard of living.Brandon Emmerich, general manager for North America at Wind Information, a data provider, says $4 of new credit is necessary to generate just $1 of additional gross domestic product \u2014 the worst ratio since the depths of the last financial crisis. One reason, Mr. Emmerich recently wrote in a newsletter, is that \u201cmost new debt in China goes to pay off old obligations rather than invest in new value-creating projects.\u201dAfter analyzing corporate bonds issued in China, he calculated that 42 percent of the money raised since 2015 was earmarked to pay off existing loans or expiring bonds, compared with only 8 percent in 2014.China has long defied predictions that it is heading for a crash, and perhaps it will prove the doomsayers wrong yet again. But Beijing\u2019s policy makers must limit the increase in debt without inflicting a severe blow to growth. That delicate balancing act is hard to manage, but Beijing may be left with no other choice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coming Soon, Economists Hope: Big Spending on Roads, Bridges and Ports", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The docks at the Port of Oakland are a tangle of cranes, shipping containers, railroad tracks and snaking lines of trucks waiting to load and unload cargo.Streamlining this kind of traffic is one of the few ideas Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton agree on.Mr. Trump, taking a page from liberal economists, said he would fund his plan by borrowing several hundred billion dollars, but has offered no specifics. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s more detailed proposal, by contrast, would be paid for by a business tax overhaul aimed at collecting additional revenue from companies that have parked assets abroad.These are only plans, of course. Either would have to get through Congress and the inevitable acrimony over any proposal to raise taxes or add to the national debt.\u201cThe next administration will be in prime position to deliver on a comprehensive infrastructure plan,\u201d said Tom Jensen, vice president for transportation policy at UPS.Infrastructure spending, unlike many other forms of government outlays, holds the power to give the economy a sustained lift for decades down the line.First comes the addition of jobs \u2014 particularly the kinds of higher-wage blue-collar jobs that have been lost in recent years \u2014 and spending on products like concrete and steel to build new roads and repair worn-out bridges. After that initial jolt, the economy would continue to reap the important but harder-to-measure benefits of fewer delays, faster internet connections and more reliable power.You can see much of that here at one of the nation\u2019s busiest ports, an export hub that sends tons of important California products like Napa Valley wine, Central Valley almonds and Silicon Valley Teslas to China\u2019s growing middle class.In one of the few things they agree on, both Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have said they would spend billions more on America\u2019s aging roads, bridges, hospitals, schools and public transportation systems.Aiming to gain other ports\u2019 market share, Oakland has embarked on a number of projects \u2014 some big, some small \u2014 to add cargo and speed things up. There are new traffic-reducing measures, such as an appointment system for trucks picking up cargo and extended hours at its largest terminal.It is also working on several infrastructure projects: This year, the port applied for a $140 million federal grant to build a bridge over a choked intersection where trucks waste time waiting for trains to pass. A half-mile away sit 14 new rail lines that are part of a new operation where shippers can transfer products from one container to another without leaving the port.Shipping companies often make these transfers at off-site warehouses \u2014 wasting more time and money. The Port of Oakland, which acts as a landlord, is hoping its investment will entice companies to move more cargo to its docks.This would not just give the port more rent. The economy would also gain additional jobs as private sector shippers added their own money to erect buildings near the port\u2019s rail connection, and fill them with machines.The federal government, with its wide latitude to spend on ambitious projects, is in a singular position to make investments no one else will.But the government\u2019s power to act has also set off a robust debate about how much more it should spend on infrastructure and how it should be funded. Spend too little, and the nation\u2019s backbone deteriorates and the cost of future repairs mounts. Spend too much too fast, and the government could crowd out private investment, possibly leading to higher inflation and pushing up interest rates.In a telephone interview, Mr. Summers laid out his case: The federal government can borrow at something like 1 percent interest a year, and through enhanced productivity it would reap something like 3 percent a year in higher tax receipts.\u201cI am as worried about the debt burden on my children\u2019s generation as anybody, but deferring maintenance on the foundation of our economy is a much greater risk to them,\u201d Mr. Summers said.Decades ago, the federal government spent big. The Interstate System of highways spawned new suburbs, and transportation grants helped build rail networks like the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, whose commuter trains hum past the Port of Oakland as they travel to and from San Francisco.Now the United States has more people and a bigger economy. But relative to its gross domestic product, the nation spends only about half as much on infrastructure as it did during the 1950s and \u201960s.The costs are substantial, if hard to see. Neglect the water system, and you may have leaky pipes and larger bills, or even lead contamination. Rough roads equal more flat tires. Substandard internet connections add to the isolation of rural communities.Each day, UPS drivers in northern New Jersey and New York City lose an average of 16 minutes \u2014 often much longer \u2014 to heavy traffic. Six years ago the company started dispatching an additional 61 drivers to make sure everyone hit their stops, and it would need more drivers if traffic got worse.Of course, even if tens of billions of dollars more were set aside for road improvements, that would not on its own guarantee that traffic congestion would ease. Infrastructure may be among the most bipartisan of federal spending areas, but politics in general can be a problem. One of the persistent criticisms from economists is federal lawmakers\u2019 tendency to spread cash across the country instead of focusing on places where the economic payoff would be greatest.An increase in infrastructure spending would still lift the economy, Mr. Winston said, \u201cbut my God, wouldn\u2019t it be so much better if we were more thoughtful about what we do with the money we have?\u201dThis, at least, is where the nation\u2019s D-plus grade turns out to be good news. Economists say infrastructure\u2019s productivity lift is greatest when investment is being raised from low levels. Put another way: The more broken down the nation becomes, the harder it is to find something that does not need to be fixed.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about bridges to nowhere,\u201d Mr. Summers said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about bridges that are on the verge of collapsing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marriage Falls in China, Transforming Finances and Families", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Liu Zhenfeng got married at 25. The usual trappings of family life followed \u2014 a daughter, a home, furniture, toys.That daughter, Song Zongpei, now 28, is taking a different path. Ms. Song shares a rented apartment in Beijing with two roommates and is focusing on her career and her finances. She does not see marriage or motherhood in her immediate future. \u201cAt this stage, the most important thing for me is personal development,\u201d Ms. Song said.Fewer Chinese people are getting married, a shift with profound implications for China\u2019s economic and social life. The decline in marriages means a decline in the number of babies, and potentially less spending on homes, appliances and other family-related purchases \u2014 the kind of spending China needs to drive economic growth.But the marriage slump \u2014 caused in large part by China\u2019s aging population and the legacy of its harsh one-child policy \u2014 has a silver lining. It also stems from the rise of an educated population of women. Specialists in economics, demography and sociology say some of those women are delaying marriage to build careers and establish financial footing, resulting in a more empowered female population that no longer views marriage as the only route to security.\u201cBecause they are highly educated, they hold well-paid jobs, they lose the financial incentive to get married,\u201d says Zhang Xiaobo, a professor of economics at Peking University\u2019s National School of Development.China continues to emphasize marriage in its official media, entreating women not to wait for Mr. Right. But demographics and changing social mores make that a tough sell.Last year, 12 million Chinese couples registered for marriage, making it the second consecutive year the number has declined. Divorces, which stem from some of the same trends, reached 3.8 million last year, more than twice the level of a decade ago.Those trends test cultural notions of family that go back hundreds of years. While arranged marriages have largely faded in China, parents remain deeply involved in the nuptials of their offspring, chasing down leads on potential suitors and hounding their children during holiday visits about marriage plans.Ms. Liu, Ms. Song\u2019s mother, agrees that her daughter should wait for the right match, but she still hopes that she finds someone. \u201cI want her to have a happy life,\u201d Ms. Liu said, \u201cand I think it\u2019s more secure to have a family.\u201dIt could also lead Chinese consumers to put more money away in the bank or under mattresses. Families of prospective grooms in China often save money for years to buy a home for a couple before they marry to give them financial stability. Families save more, to buy bigger homes, if brides are hard to find, said Mr. Zhang, the Peking University professor.But Chinese consumers could simply spend money on something else \u2014 with single young people leading the pack. Some of the decline in marriage stems from the growth of a group of young, educated urban women who no longer need to wed to achieve financial security.Cheng Guping, a 30-year-old from Hangzhou in eastern China who works at a start-up and is pursuing a doctorate in economics, is one of those women. She cited her professional and educational obligations as the reason she and a recent boyfriend broke up. \u201cI felt that our level of affection wasn\u2019t enough yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see how far I can go on my own.\u201dSuitable mates are simply hard to find, said Ms. Cheng, who describes many men her age as \u201cnot mature or irresponsible.\u201d Referring to another former boyfriend, she said: \u201cWhen we wanted to do something, or go for food, he only liked to act cute and say with a smile, \u2018We\u2019ll do whatever you like.\u2019 It made me feel like I had a son.\u201dBusinesses are preparing for the shift. The jewelry industry expects sales growth to slow in China as marriage declines. In response, many stores are offering a greater variety of jewelry, such as cheaper gems to entice dating couples who have less money.\u201cEven though they are not getting married,\u201d said Annie Yau Tse, the chief executive of Tse Sui Luen, a jewelry chain based in Hong Kong, \u201cpeople still need someone to be with them, and they still want love.\u201dJiajiashun, an online property agent, said it was planning to sell less expensive housing to cater to single buyers. Midea, a Chinese appliance maker, has been expanding its range of smaller rice cookers \u2014 giving singles a way to make fresh rice and avoid the refrigerated leftovers that leave many Chinese cold. \u201cWe are concerned about the changes in family structures in China,\u201d according to Huang Bing, chief product manager of Midea\u2019s small domestic appliances division.In Chinese homes, the shift raises questions about family ties and filial responsibilities.For example, married couples in China traditionally care for aging parents. Wu Jingjing, 29, can see the burden that the aging population could be for her generation. \u201cThere\u2019s a group of people who will feel very much crushed by being in the middle layer, being the pillar of a family while raising both the children and their parents,\u201d said Ms. Wu, who works for an internet company. \u201cI think that sense of collapse will happen in 10 or 20 years.\u201dHer mother worries about who will care for her daughter if she does not marry. \u201cWe can still care for her now, but we won\u2019t be here forever,\u201d Zhai Liping, 53, said. \u201cWe hope she will find someone who cares for her, so we can feel more reassured.\u201dStill, Ms. Wu is single and she said she is still determined to wait until she meets the right person.\u201cBack in the old times, many people met because they were introduced and just wanted to find a partner to live through everyday life,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were very few people who had a free relationship based on love. Now lots of people reject that kind of old attitude and want to find the suitable person.\u201dAmie Tsang reported from Hong Kong, and Zhang Tiantian from Beijing.

{"Headline": "For Rudy Giuliani, Embrace of Donald Trump Puts Legacy at Risk", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWeeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, with bodies still being pulled from the smoldering rubble, New York\u2019s mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, delivered an emotional address before a hushed United Nations.He spoke with blunt force about the need for the world\u2019s countries to unite in a global battle against terrorism. But he also sounded a powerful note of inclusion and unity, reminding the delegates \u2014 many of them Arab or Muslim \u2014 that New York was a city of immigrants, within a nation of immigrants.\u201cLike the victims of the World Trade Center attack, we\u2019re of every race, we\u2019re of every religion, we\u2019re of every ethnicity, and our diversity has been our greatest source of strength,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing that renews us and revives us in every generation \u2014 our openness to new people from all over the world.\u201dAt the time, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s political promise seemed limitless. But after a calamitous presidential run in 2008, his once-outsize profile shriveled.Mr. Giuliani is now back on the national political stage, serving as one of Donald J. Trump\u2019s most prominent advisers and most vocal defenders. Once an outspoken advocate of a bipartisan immigration overhaul, he is championing a candidate who has vowed to build an \u201cimpenetrable physical wall\u201d on the country\u2019s southern border and severely restrict immigration from Muslim countries.He has assumed his new role with apparent relish, embracing some of the most controversial tactics of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, including its penchant for unsubstantiated assertions: Last week, Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Trump had abandoned his insistence that President Obama was born outside the United States, even though Mr. Trump has never done so publicly.Mr. Giuliani has also questioned Hillary Clinton\u2019s mental and physical health, buttressing his charges with debunked internet memes. \u201cGo online and put down \u2018Hillary Clinton illness,\u2019 take a look at the videos for yourself,\u201d he said last month.But the Trump campaign has given Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, the chance to mold a potential president, and to do battle with an old rival he deeply dislikes, one who he bitterly insists received special treatment from the F.B.I.A Trump victory could open the door for Mr. Giuliani to return to public office, perhaps as head of the Department of Homeland Security or even Secretary of State.But his ardent support for Mr. Trump could, alternatively, come at a cost to his legacy, as it has put Mr. Giuliani starkly at odds with other right-of-center Republican figures who have described the nominee as a dangerous threat to the nation and have refused to support him.This is a source of deep concern to a large cadre of former Giuliani aides, people who recall him as the steely, compassionate leader of post-9/11 New York, and as the mayor who presided over a historic reduction in crime in the decade before \u2014 a period when he also denounced the most extreme elements of the Republican Party, advocated stricter gun control and signed a landmark domestic partnerships bill.In a telephone interview, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that a large segment of people who have worked with him over the last three decades have recoiled from Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Among other things, his former aides have expressed concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s questioning of the impartiality of a judge because of his Mexican heritage, and belittling the Muslim parents of a slain Army officer.\u201cThey don\u2019t know him as well as I do,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s not a racist bone in his body.\u201dThe real Donald Trump, he said, \u201cis a guy without these prejudices.\u201dSince Mr. Giuliani\u2019s speech at the Republican convention in July, when he fulminated about the dangers of a Clinton presidency in tones that struck many as over the top, he has been a frequent presence by Mr. Trump\u2019s side, trying to steady the Republican candidate\u2019s wobbly campaign.He accompanied Mr. Trump to Mexico on Aug. 31, and then introduced him before his immigration speech the same night in Phoenix, even donning a white \u201cMake Mexico Great Again Also\u201d hat for the occasion. Mr. Giuliani has played a significant role behind the scenes, too, urging Mr. Trump to tone down his remarks and rethink his immigration plan. He also took control of a private campaign round-table discussion of national security recently, in which he addressed the room as often as Mr. Trump did, according to someone in attendance.Former Giuliani aides discern other imprints on the Trump campaign: Mr. Trump\u2019s policy addresses about school reform and his recent outreach to black voters in Detroit, they said, contained echoes of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s mayoral re-election campaign in 1997, when he argued with black New Yorkers that Democrats had let them down.Mr. Giuliani still has his defenders.\u201cRudy Giuliani presided over the single greatest transformation of a major American city in our history,\u201d said Anthony V. Carbonetti, a longtime adviser. \u201cIt sickens me to hear people diminish that simply because they disagree with his politics.\u201dMr. Giuliani said that he did not share all of Mr. Trump\u2019s views, but that on the issues that mattered most, the economy and foreign policy, they were in sync. He said he believed that Mr. Trump had made adjustments in his approach, including on immigration.On paper, at least, the two men have much in common. Both are relatively socially liberal and twice-divorced products of neighborhoods outside Manhattan, where they eventually gained fame. Both are pugnacious, with hearty appetites for conflict and for attention from a news media they often condemn as biased.But there are significant differences. Mr. Giuliani is a well-read student of history who absorbs himself in the details of policy debates. Mr. Trump skims briefing books and prefers to get his information from cable news.Mr. Giuliani waited until the New York primary to declare his support for Mr. Trump, then did so cautiously, saying he was troubled by some of the candidate\u2019s more personal attacks on his rivals. But once Mr. Trump won the nomination, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s tentative embrace became a bear hug.The relationship between the two dates back decades, to when Mr. Trump was actively developing real estate in New York.Mr. Trump was not a major donor to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s campaigns, but in 1999, the mayor came under fire for a deal that allowed Mr. Trump to build a 72-story condominium tower on the East Side of Manhattan, far bigger than the zoning code had contemplated. That same year, Mr. Giuliani spoke at the funeral of Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred, calling him \u201ca giant.\u201dMr. Trump lent his airplane to Mr. Giuliani at least twice in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11. He let the mayor and Gov. George E. Pataki fly to Washington for President George W. Bush\u2019s first address to Congress. There was a catch, though: The plane had been grounded at La Guardia Airport after the attacks. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Giuliani\u2019s aides to help get the restriction lifted. They did.Mr. Trump has sat in Mr. Giuliani\u2019s box at Yankee Stadium, and each attended the other\u2019s most recent wedding: Mr. Giuliani to Judith Nathan, Mr. Trump to Melania Knauss.Now, they share a common adversary.Mr. Giuliani had planned to run against Mrs. Clinton for the Senate in 2000, but dropped out of the race after a prostate cancer scare.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have a lot of use for either of the Clintons,\u201d said Jerome Hauer, who was Mr. Giuliani\u2019s emergency management director but later had a falling out with him. Mr. Hauer recalled having to persuade the mayor to let him give a briefing to President Bill Clinton in 1998.\u201cI think there\u2019s a significant animus towards Hillary, almost a vendetta,\u201d Mr. Hauer said.Mr. Giuliani said he never considered running for president this year, despite a political climate that could have been more favorable to him. He also brushed aside speculation that he covets a cabinet position, saying his decision to support Mr. Trump was animated by his concern for the country\u2019s security.It is those moments that many of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s former aides hope he will be remembered for, not his full-throated support for Mr. Trump.\u201cRudy is being called on to defend the indefensible,\u201d John Avlon, the editor in chief of The Daily Beast and a former Giuliani speechwriter, said recently on CNN. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect his best self, but it should not define him in the totality of his career.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prediction Markets Score the Debate a Rout: Clinton Over Trump", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceAccording to the people who put money on the line in the political prediction markets, Hillary Clinton clearly won the first debate.Here\u2019s why the markets are a useful scorekeeper. When the final bell rings and the pugilists return to their handlers, you turn to the refs to see who won, only to discover there\u2019s no way to score the fight. Post-debate commentary doesn\u2019t work for the same reason Spin Alley isn\u2019t insightful \u2014 it\u2019s dominated by partisans cheerleading their favorite candidate. But prediction markets have a way of ferreting out people\u2019s real beliefs, because they back those beliefs with their own money.When he boasted of his temperament, the audience laughed, and the market tilted further against him.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.I have been watching these markets for years, and it is highly unusual to see such a large shift. After all, many factors beyond the debates are relevant to the November election. Many of these factors \u2014 such as the candidates, their positions, the state of the economy and even their way with words \u2014 are already baked into the prediction market prices.These changing prediction market prices don\u2019t directly reflect who was more persuasive, but rather which candidate most exceeded expectations. Traders were already aware of the relative eloquence of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump before the debate. This means that the change in a prediction market price tells you how much each candidate overshot or undershot those expectations. And so it would have been possible for Mrs. Clinton to have made her case more eloquently than Mr. Trump, but if traders had already expected it, the markets wouldn\u2019t have moved.So my interpretation is that Mrs. Clinton did more \u2014 she beat expectations about how she would perform. Or alternatively, Mr. Trump did less, significantly undershooting expectations of a more presidential performance, and thus hurting his chances of winning the White House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed, With 3 Officials in Dissent, Stands Firm on Interest Rates While Noting Improving Economy", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A divided Federal Reserve, struggling to decide how soon to prune its economic stimulus campaign, said on Wednesday that it would wait at least a little longer.The Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, although most of its officials said they expected to raise rates by the end of the year.Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said she saw no reason to rush. The economy keeps bubbling along without boiling over. \u201cWe\u2019re generally pleased with how the economy is doing,\u201d she said at a news conference. \u201cThe economy has a little more room to run than might have previously been thought. That\u2019s good news.\u201dBut concern is growing among some Fed officials that the central bank is waiting too long to resume moving borrowing costs back toward normal levels. The decision to wait passed by a vote of 7 to 3, the narrowest margin in almost two years. Ms. Yellen said Fed officials had \u201cstruggled\u201d to reach a consensus, though she said the disagreement was mostly about a narrow question of timing.The Fed\u2019s latest round of economic projections reflected a broad consensus; 14 of the 17 Fed officials surveyed anticipated at least one rate increase this year.The Fed\u2019s next meeting is in November, concluding six days before the presidential election, but the Fed is widely expected to defer any decisions until its final meeting of the year in mid-December. Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that the Fed would not consider politics in making its decision, but that line, often repeated by Fed officials, is regarded as tactful rather than truthful.Fed officials cited the uncertain consequences of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union as a reason they did not want to raise rates in June. They are unlikely to act on the eve of a presidential election that could have larger economic consequences.Federal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.\u201cThe Fed will not want to be seen as influencing political outcomes,\u201d said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed-income at BlackRock.Even the decision to wait, however, exposes the Fed to continued attack by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who has repeatedly charged that Ms. Yellen is delaying necessary action to help Democrats.Ms. Yellen was pressed repeatedly about the Fed\u2019s motives Wednesday. \u201cI can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions.\u201dThe Fed decided to wait despite an upturn in economic conditions after a weak start to the year.\u201cGrowth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of the year,\u201d its statement said. It noted consumer spending remained relatively strong, while business investment remained relatively weak, a pattern that continues to defy easy explanation.The Fed also said it now saw the chances of faster growth as \u201croughly balanced\u201d against the risks of economic disruption, an improvement over its bleaker outlook in recent years.\u201cOur decision does not reflect a lack of confidence in the economy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.(Ms. Yellen, however, indicated the Fed did not include the presidential election in this assessment. Asked, for example, about the economic consequences of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to impose higher tariffs on imports, she declined to answer, calling that a \u201cpolitical issue.\u201d)So why did the Fed decide to wait? Ms. Yellen said that the growth of the labor market had exceeded the Fed\u2019s expectations while inflation remained sluggish, suggesting the economy had room to grow.One sign of progress is the continuing rebound in the share of American adults in their prime working years, between the ages of 25 and 54, who are working or looking for work.\u201cMore people, presumably in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages, have started actively seeking and finding jobs,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cThis is a very welcome development both for the individuals involved and for the nation as a whole.\u201dThe three dissenters, all of whom voted in favor of raising interest rates by a quarter-point in September, were Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City; Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; and Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.The statement did not explain their votes, but all three described their concerns in the weeks before the meeting. Mr. Rosengren, a longtime proponent of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign, has become increasingly concerned that the Fed, by waiting too long to raise rates, will need to move more sharply, a pattern that often ends in a recession.Notwithstanding the debate about when to take the next step, Fed officials are increasingly agreed that they will not be raising rates for very long. As recently as last September, Fed officials predicted the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate would rise to 3.4 percent by the end of 2018. On Wednesday they predicted it would reach just 1.9 percent by that time, and that it would top out at 2.9 percent.Fed officials are increasingly reconciled to the reality of a downturn in global interest rates that has dampened the force of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign even as the Fed stands still. The central bank stimulates the economy by pushing borrowing costs below normal levels. The decline in market borrowing costs means that the normal level has been falling toward the Fed\u2019s rate.The Fed remains in a better position to raise rates than other major central banks, which are struggling to drive up inflation in the face of even lower interest rates and weaker growth.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economic Expansion Is Helping the Middle Class, Finally", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncomes and OutcomesFor years, the standard knock on this economic expansion has been twofold: Growth has been slow, and big businesses and wealthy investors have been its major beneficiaries, rather than middle-class wage earners.And it has been a fair criticism. At least until recently.The growth rate is still disappointingly slow, but that second part no longer appears to be true. After all these years, the fruits of the recovery are now being delivered more broadly. While all the attention is focused on new census data confirming the change, it is actually a broad range of evidence that makes the case compelling.Those new census numbers don\u2019t come as a complete shock. And there\u2019s little reason to think they\u2019re a statistical aberration. Rather, they are broadly consistent with a body of evidence that shows inflation-adjusted incomes for the mass of Americans have finally started to rise in a meaningful way.One dirty secret of economic analysis is that there is no perfect way to measure the financial well-being of 320 million Americans. Every measurement of income is flawed in its own way. So the best we can do is look at how people are doing from a range of measures, understand the differences among them and what they show.For example, the median household income numbers released Tuesday aren\u2019t adjusted for changes in the size of a typical household. Two individuals making $50,000 and living separately form two middle-income households; if they move in together, they form a single high-income household. Shifts in how many people marry, divorce or cohabitate can shift the apparent median household income without changing the underlying economic well-being of the middle class.You could look at income measures per person rather than per household, such as per-capita disposable personal income data compiled by the Commerce Department. But because that is an average, it can mask shifts in distribution. If a billionaire like Bill Gates walks into a bar, the average wealth of the people therein will be astronomical, but it doesn\u2019t mean the typical patron can now afford to switch from drinking Miller Lite to Dom P\u00e9rignon Champagne.Flaws acknowledged, that measure has showed consistent annual real per-person after-tax income growth since the start of 2014, and that number is up 10.3 percent since the expansion began in mid-2009.Or maybe you want to focus more on the status of wages, rather than broader measures of income. After all, it is people\u2019s earnings from a job, rather than from a pension or investments, that reflect underlying economic conditions. One way of looking at that is the Labor Department\u2019s data on average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory employees, a longstanding data series on what working stiffs take home in wages.It has also been rising, at around a 2.5 percent rate before factoring in for inflation, which has been low enough to make that extra 2.5 percent in hourly pay add up to a gain in purchasing power. Part of the story behind the good median income numbers for 2015 is that oil prices fell sharply that year, pulling down inflation and helping the after-inflation income gain look higher.Or maybe you want to adjust shifts in income for things like the value of tax credits and social welfare benefits, and the value of health care and other benefits received. The Congressional Budget Office does that math \u2014 but with such long time lags that the 2013 numbers were published only recently.So how does the current economic expansion stack up according to some of the more readily available measures of income? How did Americans fare in the period from 2010 to 2015, for example, compared with the five-year periods following the end of the previous two recessions (that would be 1992-1997 and 2002-2007)?The 5.6 percent rise in median household income from 2010 to 2015 is a great deal better than in the mid-2000s expansion and somewhat worse than in the mid-1990s recovery. Using inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers, the mid-1990s and current expansion are about the same, compared with no gain in the mid-2000s. Both the poorest and richest Americans did better in the 1990s but worse in the mid-2000s.Interestingly, that pattern reverses when looking at per-capita personal income. That measure was strongest in the mid-2000s, perhaps reflecting strong income gains at the top of the ladder (there\u2019s Bill Gates walking into a bar again).So the good news is that this expansion is generating stronger income growth for typical American families than they experienced in the early part of this century. The bad news is that it falls short of the results from the mid-1990s. The five-year time horizon used here \u2014 1992-1997 \u2014 understates the strength of that expansion, because the economy was in an all-out boom from 1998 to 2000. The median household still makes 1.6 percent less in inflation-adjusted terms than it did in 2007, before the global financial crisis.It\u2019s worth celebrating the real progress finally being made in getting the benefits of the expansion spread more broadly. But we will need the caveat that it isn\u2019t hard to find evidence that the gains could be stronger still.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Monsanto Whistle-Blower: $22 Million Richer, but Not Satisfied", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameWinning isn\u2019t everything.So says the man who recently received $22 million after bringing to light multiyear accounting violations at Monsanto, the agribusiness and chemicals giant. Even though his is the second-largest award issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission under its five-year-old program to encourage whistle-blowers to come forward (after a $30 million award in September 2014), it feels, he told me, like something of a hollow victory.\u201cThe company got fined and some money changed hands, but that\u2019s not the answer,\u201d the whistle-blower said in a telephone interview. \u201cManagement not being held accountable, that still bothers me. I went into this to get that fixed, and that didn\u2019t get fixed.\u201dThe $22 million award generated a flurry of interest in the Monsanto case and in the S.E.C.\u2019s program. But the whistle-blower, who remains anonymous because he is unsure about his future career path and does not want his involvement in the case to damage it, has not told his story publicly until now.People who try to flag wrongdoing in the workplace endure immense hardships and are often harmed in the process. In spite of safeguards, many are identified, driven from their jobs and branded as troublemakers in their industries. This makes it difficult for them to find new jobs.Happily, none of this happened to the truth teller in the Monsanto matter, who held a financial job at the company. Still, the process was anything but easy, he said, causing friction with co-workers.\u201cNobody else feels what you feel internally, so you have a hard time understanding why people don\u2019t see it as you do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way you can go through this: It\u2019s got to be something from deep within that drives you.\u201dA Monsanto spokeswoman said it would be inappropriate to comment on the award.The S.E.C. concluded that the company had improperly accounted for millions of dollars of incentive rebates offered to distributors of its Roundup herbicide. In its settlement with Monsanto, the S.E.C. said the problematic accounting began in 2009 and continued through 2011.The trouble started, the S.E.C. said, when the economy was in a tailspin and Monsanto\u2019s customers were flocking to less expensive generic versions of Roundup. Recognizing that sales of the product were coming in well below what the company had forecast to investors, Monsanto decided to change its accounting policies on customer rebates, the whistle-blower said. Monsanto essentially shifted the costs of the rebates into fiscal 2010 while keeping the sales associated with the rebates in 2009.Although the S.E.C. did not accuse the Monsanto employees of intending to violate the law, it said in its settlement order that \u201cas a result of the improper accounting, Monsanto met consensus earnings-per-share analyst estimates for fiscal year 2009.\u201d Meeting such estimates is crucial: When companies report results that are below expectations, their stocks often plummet.In 2010, the company again shifted some rebate costs into the next year. The actions inflated Monsanto\u2019s reported profit by $31 million over the two years, according to regulatory filings.In the enforcement action, the S.E.C. named three midlevel employees involved in the improper activities. They paid a total of $135,000 in penalties. One had retired from Monsanto, the S.E.C. said, but the other two still work at the company. Both are accountants and were barred from appearing before the S.E.C. as accountants for one to two years.It was frustrating, the whistle-blower said, that the S.E.C. took no action against others at Monsanto who, he said, knew about the improprieties.\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult when your company is doing something you know is wrong but you\u2019ve got everybody around you saying it\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d the former employee recalled. \u201cThe Monsanto culture is very tightknit. Everybody has stock options and everyone is financially at risk. So they go with the flow.\u201dIn agreeing to the settlement, Monsanto said it was committed to \u201coperating its business with the utmost integrity and transparency and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\u201dThe S.E.C. also declined to act against Deloitte, Monsanto\u2019s auditor. This puzzles Mr. Meissner, the whistle-blower\u2019s lawyer, knowing what he does about the facts of the matter.\u201cBringing cases against auditors would put a stop to a good deal of accounting fraud,\u201d Mr. Meissner told me. In accounting cases like this one, \u201cthere should also be an action against the outside audit or an explanation of why there isn\u2019t one,\u201d he added.Deloitte declined to comment.As is its custom, the S.E.C. would not say why it had not pursued an enforcement case against Deloitte.But the agency has increased the number of cases it has brought against auditors in recent years. In fiscal 2015, the S.E.C. brought 76 cases against individuals and companies. In 2013, it brought 37.The S.E.C. employees who worked with the whistle-blower on the Monsanto matter made his job easier, he said, and were very familiar with the accounting issues. They were also advocates within the agency for the former employee, his lawyer said.Still, it was the whistle-blower who took the risks, Mr. Meissner said. \u201cHere you have someone who tries to do the right things internally, gets stymied and does what you\u2019re supposed to do \u2014 reach out to the authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cHe flew to Washington many times to assist them on his own expense without any guarantee of anything.\u201dWhat is the whistle-blower doing now, with the case over and the bounty in hand?\u201cHe left Monsanto during the course of the investigation and went to work for another company in a similar position,\u201d Mr. Meissner said. \u201cHe is very happy there.\u201dHe said he plans to continue working.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

True, it covers most of the same territory and is run by some of the same thugs. But the Marxist ideology is gone, and so is the superpower status. We\u2019re talking about a more or less ordinary corrupt petrostate here, although admittedly a big one that happens to have nukes.I mention all of this because Donald Trump\u2019s effusive praise for Vladimir Putin \u2014 which actually reflects a fairly common sentiment on the right \u2014 seems to have confused some people.On one side, some express puzzlement over the spectacle of right-wingers \u2014 the kind of people who used to yell \u201cAmerica, love it or leave it!\u201d \u2014 praising a Russian regime. On the other side, a few people on the left are anti-anti-Putinists, denouncing criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s Putin-love as \u201cred-baiting.\u201d But today\u2019s Russia isn\u2019t Communist, or even leftist; it\u2019s just an authoritarian state, with a cult of personality around its strongman, that showers benefits on an immensely wealthy oligarchy while brutally suppressing opposition and criticism.And that, of course, is what many on the right admire.Am I being unfair? Could praise for Russia\u2019s de facto dictator reflect appreciation of his substantive achievements? Well, let\u2019s talk about what the Putin regime has, in fact, accomplished, starting with economics.So Mr. Putin\u2019s economic management is nothing to write home about. What about other aspects of his leadership?Finally, what about soft power, the ability to persuade through the attractiveness of one\u2019s culture and values? Russia has very little \u2014 except, maybe, among right-wingers who find Mr. Putin\u2019s macho posturing and ruthlessness attractive.There are good reasons to worry about Mr. Trump\u2019s personal connections to the Putin regime (or to oligarchs close to that regime, which is effectively the same thing.) How crucial has Russian money been in sustaining Mr. Trump\u2019s ramshackle business empire? There are hints that it may have been very important indeed, but given Mr. Trump\u2019s secretiveness and his refusal to release his taxes, nobody really knows.Beyond that, however, admiring Mr. Putin means admiring someone who has contempt for democracy and civil liberties. Or more accurately, it means admiring someone precisely because of that contempt.When Mr. Trump and others praise Mr. Putin as a \u201cstrong leader,\u201d they don\u2019t mean that he has made Russia great again, because he hasn\u2019t. He has accomplished little on the economic front, and his conquests, such as they are, are fairly pitiful. What he has done, however, is crush his domestic rivals: Oppose the Putin regime, and you\u2019re likely to end up imprisoned or dead. Strong!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Rural Women in India Chase Big-City Dreams", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "Experiments like one in Bangalore, luring migrants to fill factory jobs, collide with an old way of life that keeps women and girls in seclusion until an arranged marriage.Supported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 The factory floor is going full throttle when the new girls walk in. Everywhere is the thrumming of sewing machines, the hum of fans, the faint burning smell of steam irons. On narrow tables that run between the machines, half-assembled Marks & Spencer miniskirts are thrust forward by fistfuls. The tailors, absorbed in the task of finishing 100 pieces per hour, for once turn their heads to look.The new girls smell of the village. They have sprinklings of pimples. They woke well before dawn to prepare themselves for their first day of work, leaning over one another\u2019s faces in silence to shape the edges of each eyebrow with a razor blade. Their braids bounce to their hips, tight and glossy, as if woven by a surgeon. On their ankles are silver chains hung with bells, so when they walk in a group, they jingle.But it is impossible to hear this sound over the racket on the factory floor. The tailors glance up for only a moment, long enough to take in an experiment. The new workers \u2014 teenagers, most of them \u2014 have been recruited from remote villages to help factories like this one meet the global demand for cheap garments. But there is also social engineering going on.Experiments like the one in Bangalore run against deep currents in India, whose guiding voice, Mohandas K. Gandhi, envisioned a socialist future built on the small-scale economy of the village. They also collide spectacularly with an old way of life, in which girls are kept in seclusion until they can be transferred to another family through arranged marriage.Bangalore is the first city the 37 trainee tailors have seen. They are dazzled by the different kinds of light. Picking their way through the alleys around the factory, a column of virgins from the countryside, they stare up at an apartment building that towers over the neighborhood and wish their mothers could see it.Among them are two sisters, Prabhati and Shashi Das. They have come from a village at the end of a road, a place so conservative that the single time they went to a movie theater, their male cousins and uncles created a human chain around them, their big hands linked, to protect them from any contact with outside men. They are, as far as they know, the first unmarried women who have ever migrated from the village to work.Neighbors in the village are waiting to see what happens. The nasty ones say, with obvious relish, it will end badly. They whisper about migrant workers whose eyes were removed by organ traders while they slept. They say Prabhati and Shashi will be \u201cused this way and that.\u201dStill, they go. Prabhati, at 21, is stubborn and able, and Shashi, two years her junior, pretty and fizzing with suppressed laughter. The two sisters hook pinkies when they walk down the lane that leads to the factory.\u201cAll the flirts and ruffians in the whole world must have been born on this lane,\u201d Shashi grumbles, but she is laughing. Attention is like water to her.The sisters are waiting, too, to see what will happen to them. They are both at the age when they could be summoned at any moment to be displayed to a family of strangers as a potential daughter-in-law. And each of them wants something else, something impossible.It is late May, the first day of their factory summer \u2014 of love letters folded into squares and dropped onto work stations; of fevers sweated out on the floor of a bare hostel room; of supervisors shouting in a language they do not understand, a couple of words \u2014 \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cfaster\u201d \u2014 gradually becoming clear; of capitalism, of men and of a bit of freedom.It all started in March, in the drippy jungle of rural Odisha, when two distant relatives happened to meet on the roadside.One of the men had found employment as a \u201cmobilizer\u201d for Gram Tarang, a for-profit agency contracted by India\u2019s government to recruit and train workers. He mentioned that Gram Tarang was offering a cash incentive \u2014 roughly 450 rupees, or about $6.75, a head \u2014 to mobilizers who identified young women willing to enroll in a training program for garment factory jobs.The second man, Hemant Das, perked up, sensing the approach of a change of career. Hemant had an underfed look and teeth rimmed with tobacco stains. Among the first college graduates from his family, he had tried his hand at laying bricks, tutoring schoolchildren, programming computers, setting up wedding tents and waiting tables before finally falling back on the only job widely available to men here, working as a field hand for 200 rupees a day.Hemant was from a village called Ishwarpur, and as it happened, idle young women were something Ishwarpur had in great quantity. That they could be monetized came as good news.On its economic merits alone, Hemant figured, the government scheme would prove tempting: After two months of training, their daughters would be placed in a factory in the industrial center of Bangalore, where they would earn the legal minimum wage, 7,187 rupees per month, or about $108, which is more than most of their fathers make. Six months after arriving in Bangalore, they would be free to return home if they wished.Hemant set out the next day with a fistful of pamphlets and an uncharacteristically sunny disposition. But as he made his rounds of local families \u2014 30 of them, at least \u2014 they shook their heads. No. \u201cLetting go of female children is dishonorable, in itself,\u201d explained Pramanand Das, who presides over an informal family council.Minati Das, the mother of a 19-year-old, got to the point quicker. \u201cNot everyone wants a daughter-in-law who is a working woman,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think she has lost her chastity.\u201dThe village had its own plan for these young women. Upon reaching adulthood, they would be transferred to the guardianship of another family, along with a huge dowry that serves as an incentive to treat them well. The transfer is final. Once married, the new bride cannot return to visit her parents without permission, which is given sparingly, so that the bonds to her old home will weaken.She must show her submission to the new family: She is not allowed to speak the names of her in-laws, because it is seen as too familiar, and in some places she is not allowed to use words that begin with the same letters as her in-laws\u2019 names, requiring the invention of a large parallel vocabulary. Each morning, before she is allowed to eat, the daughter-in-law must wash the feet of her husband\u2019s parents and then drink the water she has used to wash them.Hemant would have been completely out of luck if he had not thought to try Karuna Das, who had two daughters of marriageable age. Karuna was a sinewy day laborer, and he had roamed far from the village in his younger days to work in iron foundries in Chennai and Hyderabad. The gossip was that Karuna agreed to enroll his eldest daughters because he was unable to scrape together 100,000 rupees for dowries. That was undoubtedly the case.It was also true that Karuna did not care much what other people said. He had never behaved like a poor man. When word spread that he had agreed to send Prabhati and Shashi, the village elders convened emergency meetings to determine whether this violated \u201cpurdah,\u201d or separation between the sexes, and whether this would damage the marriage prospects of their own daughters. Women stopped by to tease the girl\u2019s mother, Radha Rani, who wept inconsolably.It turned out that Karuna had not been asking for permission. He instructed his daughters to pack four or five changes of clothes. Go see what the world is like, he told them. \u201cThey were reluctant to go anywhere because they were a bit scared,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them being scared is O.K. O.K., you\u2019re scared. Now you have to move on.\u201dPrabhati has never seen a train, much less ridden in one, and on the 33-hour journey to Bangalore the earth seems to heave under her. As miles of paddy fields slide by, she vomits. Thatch roofs are replaced by peaked roofs, and she vomits. When they reach south India, rain begins to hit the window in fat spatters.It had come as news to Prabhati that the training program involved traveling 900 miles. But some intention had hardened within her. She wanted to prove the neighbors wrong. She did not care about her marriage prospects because, after examining the marriages that surrounded her in Ishwarpur, she decided she did not want to marry at all.\u201cI will go to Bangalore,\u201d she told her parents. \u201cIf I come back, then you can get me married. If I don\u2019t come back, you can\u2019t get me married.\u201dShashi sits beside her retching sister and strokes her back. She had not wanted to come. Happy enough with a future as a housewife, she had focused her energy on making mischief. Among friends, she introduced herself as \u201c45 kilograms of hotness.\u201d Out of the corner of her mouth came a stream of dirty jokes, and she made the other girls dissolve in helpless laughter by comparing breast sizes to vegetables (including, mournfully, a kernel of corn).Working on an assembly line was not Shashi\u2019s idea of fun. But Prabhati plunged forward, and, as usual, Shashi cruised along in her wake.The sisters, lugging a bag of clothes, sit with 35 other girls from Odisha who are making the same journey.They have all dressed in baggy purple-and-gray uniforms, with ID cards swinging from their necks. Their parents had made last-minute attempts to keep them from leaving, which had to be repelled with sustained tantrums. A girl called Baby, who is 18 and bespectacled, said that she had secured her mother\u2019s permission only by refusing to eat for two days.\u201cThey wanted me to come home,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not going home.\u201dThe Gram Tarang instructors had taught them an anthem about self-sufficiency, and they sing it on their journey to Bangalore, again and again, for comfort.The sun has not yet risen when they arrive at the hostel that will be their new home for the next six months: 137 women in 15 unfurnished rooms, every inch covered with girlish flotsam, underwear and bras drying on the window grates, sentimental verses penciled on the walls.Prabhati and Shashi\u2019s room is being painted, so on the first night 25 of them crowd into two rooms, so tight that one of their roommates stretches out on the kitchen counter. \u201cI thought there would be beds,\u201d murmurs one, and the chaperone from Gram Tarang looks exasperated.\u201cThey complain, \u2018You could have given us this, you could have given us that,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWe sweetly explain that it is not possible. They don\u2019t have the bed system in Bangalore.\u201dBut the girls are too keyed up to sleep. Climbing onto the roof, they can see the sun rising over a landscape of other roofs, where, in all directions, migrants seek a breath of quiet. There they can gaze up at the 22nd story of an apartment building, where residents come out to hang their laundry on balconies. It is the most amazing thing they have ever seen: big people looking tiny.\u201cI want to see what I haven\u2019t seen,\u201d murmurs one of the girls, sleepily. \u201cI want to see what I don\u2019t even know exists.\u201dBaby says something about her eventual return to India, and when someone corrects her, she looks up sharply.\u201cBangalore is in India?\u201d she asks.For the first few weeks, everything is new. Stepping out of the hostel, the trainees are surrounded by men: Men on balconies, men on scooters, men lounging in doorways, staring. The road is plastered with signs saying \u201ctailors wanted,\u201d and one girl gives a yelp of alarm, mistaking them for wanted posters.On the day of a Hindu festival, Prabhati peers down from the roof at a troupe of transgender dancers, smiling and twitching suggestively as men press in around them. When one bends down so that an onlooker can stick a folded bill in her cleavage, Prabhati is so shocked that she has an impulse to reach for a stone and throw it.\u201cIf this happened in the village,\u201d she says, \u201cyou would all be dead.\u201dIn rural Odisha they like to say that \u201ca girl\u2019s shyness is her jewelry.\u201d But here, there is no space for the newcomers unless they make space for themselves. To cross the street \u2014 a throbbing two-lane road coursing with auto rickshaws, clattering cargo trucks, scooters carrying whole families \u2014 requires stepping in front of the slower-moving vehicles, if necessary stopping them with their bodies. The girls waver, and then they plunge.Much of what they learned in the village must be unlearned here. One evening when Baby begins preparing dinner, several of her roommates protest. She is menstruating, and caste tradition dictates that menstruating women must live in isolation, sleeping alone and taking care not to step into the kitchen, lest they contaminate the food and water. So two of the younger roommates cook, emerging an hour later with a glutinous, inedible glop. At this point, Baby is irritated. Menstruating women are allowed to work in the factory, aren\u2019t they? She walks into the kitchen, and the scent of spices and onions fills the room. After a brief discussion, they agree that the menstruation rules will be void for as long as they are living in Bangalore. Then they stuff themselves with food and fall into a deep sleep.When they are introduced to a factory supervisor and dive to touch her feet, a traditional gesture of respect toward elders, the supervisor jumps back as if she has been stuck with a hot poker. She then assumes a slight crouch, as if preparing to defend herself from further reverence.Back in their bedrooms, the girls laugh hysterically at this. From childhood, they have been told that it is disrespectful for a girl to laugh out loud in the presence of elders. In the event of irrepressible laughter, girls must cover their mouths with anything at hand: the corner of a dupatta, a hand, a washcloth. This lesson, too, flies out the window. In the hostel they laugh like tractors. They laugh so loud they spit their water out.\u201cI\u2019m giving you 25 seconds to thread this needle,\u201d the supervisor says in Hindi. The recruits, whose native language is Oriya, barely understand. Thirty-seven tailors bend their heads, trying to guide frayed threads through a maze of eight loops.At the K. Mohan & Company Exports Private Limited, the girls have entered a world of machines: massive industrial extractors, laser cutters, a rapid-response protocol that kicks in when a needle tip breaks off.And yet, incredibly, garments worn in the West are still made by humans \u2014 nearly all of them women, working exhausting hours, with few legal protections and little chance of advancement, for some of the lowest wages in the global supply chain.As the trainees practice sewing straight lines on pieces of scrap fabric, supervisors pace the aisle, hoping to spot one with machinelike dexterity and speed. One of them slows, and then stops, beside a girl called Cuddles, the daughter of a truck driver. The supervisor blinks, looks again. This is \u2014 there is no other word for it \u2014 talent. She has covered the fabric with seams as straight as the lines on ruled notebook paper.Cuddles is among the first in the group to be integrated into an assembly line, bent over, eyes straining. Her task is to stitch together three small tags for the Marks & Spencer stretch corduroy skirt: one that identifies the brand, one that gives washing instructions and one the size, a scrap so tiny that it is nearly impossible to hold straight between finger and thumb. If she allows a tag to slip to the floor, or fly away in the gusts from the ceiling fan, her salary will be docked. She will be under pressure to complete this task 100 times per hour for eight hours, with one half-hour break for lunch, for a base daily wage of around $2.A man with a loft of dyed black hair steps out of his office to greet the group. This is N. Manjunath, the assistant general manager for human resources at the factory. He is recruiting rural workers through the government program because he is desperate: City-dwellers are no longer interested in factory jobs like these, with their low pay and punishing conditions, and attrition rates are high. Migrant women are more docile. This is what Manjunath is hoping.Prabhati, Shashi and the other recruits take seats in a canteen, and sit with their hands folded in their laps. They are to work every day but Sunday. They can collect their pension in 40 years. Should they die on the job, state health insurance will cover funeral costs.They are drowsy. The numbers fly by them in flocks. When a response is expected, they chorus \u201cYes, miss,\u201d or \u201cYes, sir,\u201d as they would to a schoolmaster.Any questions?\u201cCan we work on Sundays?\u201dManjunath thinks of himself as a kind man. But the complications of employing village girls have strained his last nerve: the weepy petitions for leave to return to the village for essential functions, like a father having a hemorrhoid removed; the domestic squabbles, which on one occasion ended in the consumption of toilet cleaner; and the \u201clove cases,\u201d in which a tailor, upon forming a romantic attachment in the factory, is summarily ordered home.Lately, when the girls come to him with complaints, he listens skeptically, with a sardonic smile. He assesses this latest batch of recruits, the second from Odisha, as \u201clackadaisical.\u201d He believes they have come here for an adventure, and will gravitate back to the village as soon as their parents tell them to come home.He is right to worry. After six months on the job, when the government incentives are paid out, around half the trainees brought in by Gram Tarang return to their villages. Only 40 percent stay longer than a year.It comes down to this: If the village has a plan for the girls, so does the factory. Leading them through the rows of machines, Manjunath wags his finger.\u201cDon\u2019t get married too soon,\u201d he warns them.Within two weeks of their arrival, one of the sisters\u2019 roommates has eloped straight from the factory gates, not even stopping by the hostel to pick up her clothes. Those who remain spill their secrets to one another. Tanushree Behera sleeps entangled with a girl she calls her wife. Jayasmita Behera is divorced, having left her husband less than two weeks after the wedding.\u201cIf I had stayed,\u201d she says, \u201cmy life would have been destroyed.\u201dSitting cross-legged on the floor, they compare notes on evasive maneuvers they use to avoid being shown to prospective in-laws, like Roadrunner slipping away from Wile E. Coyote. Shradhanjali Mallick, the beauty among them, says she used to have success with bouts of hysterical crying, but that moving to Bangalore has been more effective. \u201cHow can they marry me off if I am not physically present?\u201d she asks innocently, and Prabhati laughs. \u201cLet them hold a wedding of mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the only kind of wedding they will be able to pull off.\u201dThis is not something Prabhati can laugh about at home. Her views on marriage were set in stone several years back, when a young wife in her village was set on fire in a domestic dispute. Prabhati has been arguing for years that she should be allowed to remain single, that her parents should proceed to fixing a marriage for Shashi, who is pretty and will get better offers. \u201cI will become a nun,\u201d she says. But her parents flick away her comment, casually, as if it were a fly. So she thinks of escape.This is a subject she cannot discuss with her sister. Three years ago, Prabhati came across a mobile phone that a secret boyfriend gave Shashi as a way of keeping in touch, rigged, as if for espionage, with no audible sound or light, to be switched on at times when they have agreed to speak. Prabhati snatched the phone away and informed her father. Shashi screamed at her father that day \u2014 don\u2019t break that phone! \u2014 but she never saw it again. For months, she could not look him in the eye.The sisters were never as close again. When it comes to the future, Prabhati and Shashi keep their own counsel.By the first week of June, the new girls are praying for Sunday to arrive. Their joints hurt. Their backs hurt. They come home from the factory with fingers punctured by needles or sliced by industrial clippers. Sitting still for eight hours is strange and new, and at times, the boredom is maddening. They sing to their machines. They pull hairs out of their chins. Baby amuses herself by giving herself little scratches on the wrist.They are locked into the hostel except for \u201cout passes\u201d on alternate Sundays, which are granted by the factory human resources staff. A Gram Tarang \u201clife skills\u201d instructor makes the rounds inside the hostel, selling them 600-rupee jars of an Herbalife energy drink, which she tells them will help them keep up with the pace of work in the factory. It does give them energy \u2014 it includes caffeine and maltodextrin \u2014 but it also gives them diarrhea and eats up their remaining cash. This is no small problem, because they are running out of money for food.They count the days until June 10, when they will be paid for their first two weeks of work. Prabhati and Shashi, who had left home with 5,000 rupees, or about $75, find themselves with 100 rupees between them. \u201cIf there\u2019s no salary today, it\u2019s going to be a problem,\u201d Prabhati says.On June 10, they are not paid. Three more days pass, and they still are not paid. Outside the factory window the sky has turned black and the air is churning; a curtain of monsoon rain is about to sweep in.About 15 girls walk into Manjunath\u2019s office, hearts pounding, to demand their pay. He looks up from his desk, annoyed. The usual genial expression has vanished from his face. He explains that he cannot solve their problem: The company has opened bank accounts for them, but the bank has not delivered their A.T.M. cards. Anyway, he dismisses the suggestion that the girls are running out of money. And who, he wonders, has given them the idea that they can make demands? He surveys the group in search of its leader.\u201cMy clear understanding is that if you have a basket of fruits and only one is not good, it will spoil the other fruit,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou have to take one out.\u201dWhen Jayasmita steps forward to say they have not eaten since yesterday, he swivels his head in her direction. He does not speak Oriya. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d he asks a caseworker.The girls are promised an advance for rice and are ordered to leave his office. They shuffle out. They had been planning to stop working unless they were paid immediately, but their strike has lasted less than five minutes. Jayasmita slumps against a wall, and vows never to try anything like that again.\u201cWhen you come to a new city,\u201d she says, \u201cyou have to learn to care for yourself, and not bother with others.\u201dThe money for the first two weeks\u2019 work comes through three or four days later \u2014 after withholdings for pension, health insurance, lodging, food and kitchen furnishings, a grand total of 1,874 rupees, or roughly $28. This sum must last them for the next month. In the hostel room where Prabhati and Shashi stay, the amount of the paycheck is not relevant. They have never earned money before, only asked their fathers for it. A wave of happiness washes over all of them. They do not feel like girls, they say: They feel like boys.They transfer credit \u2014 30 rupees, 50 rupees \u2014 to the cellphones of their mothers, brothers, sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law and boyfriends, as if they were distributing sweets to celebrate some windfall.Unable to wait, they call their families from cubbyhole A.T.M.s to share the news. This is not always welcome. Cuddles transfers a balance of 50 rupees to her father\u2019s phone, but he considers it shameful to accept money from a daughter. He calls her, angrily, to say, \u201cNever do that again.\u201d Cuddles doesn\u2019t care; she has never been so happy.Prabhati and Shashi are among the last to receive their A.T.M. cards. They find a bank machine in between Krishna Jewelers & Pawnbrokers and Blooming Buds India Playschool. Leaving the A.T.M., Prabhati feels joy, but she is not the type of person who shows it. She scans the street, looking for some way to celebrate, and finally asks a man if she can borrow his bicycle for a moment. She climbs on top of it and pedals as hard as she can, her braid flying behind her. Then, taking note of his look of worry, she swings the bicycle around and returns it to its owner.Shashi dances down the stairs and most of the way home. The money sends a wild thrill through her, so that she wishes she could fast-forward through the next month, and the month after that, and after that. So that life is a long string of paydays.The two sisters make a pact: They will stay in Bangalore at least a year. They spend much of their paychecks on nose rings for each other, tiny specks of 22-carat gold. They place them on each other in front of their roommates, beaming, their faces so close together that they could be kissing.Then Prabhati lies down on her stomach, full length, cheek to the cool linoleum. She is not feeling well.It is strange that one of the first girls to falter is Prabhati, who was the most resolute about staying in Bangalore.She has contracted a fever that comes and goes for two weeks. She stops eating and then stops talking; her eyes are so hollow that you could place a handful of rice in them. Shashi stays home, combing her sister\u2019s hair and forcing her to bathe.Minati Mahji, who has lived in the hostel for six years, observes them wearily. Of 130 women who arrived at the same time, only she and her four roommates have stuck it out. She tried switching to another factory, but it was no better, and she wound up back in the hostel. Her pay has crept up to 9,800 rupees, or $146 per month.She has seen wave after wave of young women arrive from the countryside, freshly hatched, and she knows how it usually ends \u2014 with the girl\u2019s disappearance into that old world as a daughter-in-law. \u201cWhatever they are planning, it doesn\u2019t happen like that,\u201d she says.Even through her fever, Prabhati knows she wants to stay. She tries to keep her illness from her family, handing her crisp new 500-rupee bills to a street-corner doctor who seems to give all his injections in the buttocks. It is Shashi who tells their father that her sister is sick. Her father calls the Gram Tarang training center, demanding that Prabhati be sent home, and the training center calls the factory.On the day she is to board a train to return to Ishwarpur, Prabhati stands at the edge of the roof, tears streaming down her face, and watches her younger sister walk down the lane toward the factory.The mood in the hostel sags. \u201cThe day she left, she told me: \u2018I told you I would stay a year. And I couldn\u2019t even stay for two months,\u2019 \u201d Jayasmita recounts.Minati doubts Prabhati will return. The family, having violated custom once by letting the daughters go, is not likely to do it twice. \u201cPeople mean to come back,\u201d Minati says. \u201cBut they don\u2019t come back.\u201dOn the assembly line, someone covers Prabhati\u2019s sewing machine with plastic sheeting. Three weeks later, two burly men come to push it to an area marked \u201cidle machines.\u201dJust like that, Prabhati is back in her mother\u2019s thatch hut, feeding kindling into a clay oven. Coming home is like falling into cotton. Rice is sprouting up through great reflective planes of water, so vivid it hurts your eyes to look at it.The neighbors stop by, seeking an outcome to the family\u2019s experiment. \u201cSo, are your daughters back from their jobs?\u201d asks one, in a voice thick with self-satisfaction.Prabhati\u2019s mother, Radha Rani, takes her to a country witch, who traces shapes around her head with a broom and declares that someone has cast an evil eye on her. He blows on her, a holy wind. Outside there is the smell of things growing. Prabhati sleeps as if she is under a spell. When she calls her sister, hoping to arrange for her return to Bangalore, Shashi sounds far away.It turns out factory life agrees with Shashi. She has been absorbed into an assembly line expected to produce 100 pairs of khaki chinos an hour. In the morning she takes her seat among hillocks of pants, and spends the next eight and a half hours in a work-trance, punctuated by the shouting of supervisors and a half-hour break for lunch. A whiteboard lists the per-hour target. They are always behind.Behind her in the assembly line, a potbellied man in his late 30s peppers her with the gustatory queries that pass for small talk in south India. Have you eaten today? Are you hungry? Do you want to eat more? She swivels in her chair to ask him, \u201cWould you like me to shove these pants down your throat?\u201dShashi finds it interesting that she, the screw-up in the family, is the one becoming a city person. She examines her face in the mirror for signs that she is becoming paler. She tells the family that Prabhati should not return, and that she cannot send money home this month. Instead, Shashi arranges for a meeting with Sunil, a boy from a neighboring village whom she wants to marry.Six years ago, when Sunil first asked Shashi to meet him in person, she was escorted by a female cousin and was too shy to look at Sunil\u2019s face. When he sat on the chair, she would go to the bed. When he went to the bed, she would go to the chair. Finally he told her to stop and listen. She sat still. Whatever it was he said to her, it made her feel that he was her own.\u201cI love him, you know?\u201d she says. \u201cI do not know whether he is good or bad.\u201dSince that day three years ago when Prabhati discovered the cellphone Sunil had given her, Shashi has been proceeding cautiously with a plan to persuade her parents to agree to her choice for a husband. She and Sunil have chosen names, Situ and Sukhi, for a girl and boy. \u201cIf I work for a long time,\u201d she says, \u201cand I really insist on it, there is a chance.\u201dNow that her sister is gone, it is no longer necessary for Shashi to keep this a secret. It is a blessed relief, like taking off a shoe that is cutting into a tender part of your foot.On the August day when her third paycheck comes in, Shashi doesn\u2019t tell anyone what she has planned. Leaving the hostel means breaking curfew, but she persuades her friends to go with her. The small group threads its way along the darkening street, past rotting cauliflower and coconut shells. The girls are headed to a bright shop where smartphones are displayed in glass cases.The shopkeeper is about 25, his shirt unbuttoned to reveal a glint of gold chain. He has seen many girls like these, provincials, fishing out coins at the vegetable market. He does not hide his disdain. But when Shashi announces that she wants to buy a 4,000-rupee Lava A59 smartphone, he is suddenly wide awake, respectful.Shashi\u2019s face is a mask of concentration as she repeatedly counts the bills and arranges them into a fan to show the shopkeeper. The girls around her are hushed. The amount is more than half her month\u2019s pay. It is the weightiest decision she has ever made.When they step back onto the street, something flickers across Shashi\u2019s face \u2014 triumph \u2014 and she pumps her fist. Back at the hostel, she drops her new purchase into the hands of her roommates, who immediately go through it, looking for WhatsApp, which they discovered the week before.Sunil will be calling soon. He has been badgering Shashi to make this purchase so she can send pictures over the internet. She disappears into the bathroom to splash cold water on her face. She is gone a long time. She lies for a moment on the floor, staring at the ceiling. Then she dials a number in the village.\u201cElder sister,\u201d she says. \u201cI got my phone!\u201dSeptember has arrived, and every day there is a new reason Prabhati cannot return to Bangalore. Her mother has stomach cramps. Her younger siblings\u2019 tuition bills are due. No adult male is available to accompany her on the train journey. Prabhati mentally reviews the cost of the ticket: 1,350 rupees for the train, 300 more for the auto rickshaw from Majestic Station. She jokes, a little nervously, that she should steal the money. A voice in her head tells her that if she doesn\u2019t go now, she never will.And yet that voice is becoming fainter. She can feel the village\u2019s drowsy peace overtaking her. Her mother says, in an offhand way, that it is time to start finding a groom. This is not how it was supposed to go. Shashi ensconced in the city, and Prabhati stuck in Ishwarpur. \u201cBefore, I was at home, and I didn\u2019t know anything, and it was O.K.,\u201d she says, dully. \u201cNow I know something, and it\u2019s not O.K.\u201dBack in Bangalore, the factory girls\u2019 fathers have begun to call. They expect them to come home on leave in December, after the six-month factory stint is up.Jayasmita\u2019s father says a marriage proposal has come from a man in Cattuck. \u201cI tell them I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cThe moment I heard talk about marriage, I hung up.\u201d Shradhanjali says she will return, and plans to wriggle out of yet another proposal. \u201cIf possible, I\u2019ll fight it off,\u201d she says, but sounds uncertain.\u201cYou know where you\u2019ll find her in a year?\u201d Jayasmita says, teasingly. \u201cAt her in-laws.\u201dThe factory girls seem less afraid every month.Shashi sees her boyfriend, Sunil, as planned. He takes the overnight train in from Kerala, where he has migrated for work. They meet at a nearby gas station and walk in a park for most of the day, holding hands. At 4 p.m., he returns to the train station and boards another overnight train back to Kerala. She uses Facebook and WhatsApp to communicate with him, as if the internet were two tin cans attached by a piece of twine. Every time they get into a fight, she uninstalls the apps.Her smartphone has become an appendage. She presses it to her ear while she is walking down the lane, striding over rats flattened into the pavement. Waking in the night, she rolls over and checks it for new messages. A group of her friends are toying with the idea of leaving the hostel, seeking higher-paid work at another factory.She is amazed at how far she has come.On an outing last Sunday, she arranged to meet a male cousin, another migrant worker, and a group of them strolled together at the edge of a highway overpass, breathing in the exhaust from 12 lanes of traffic. They don\u2019t have money to step into a restaurant, so they sit on a pipe on the ground outside a Toyota dealership, in the bright sunshine, comparing phones.That\u2019s another thing: Shashi and her friends are not the new girls anymore. The new girls are arriving from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. Their braids are tight and glossy. Dropping their bags in their rooms, they climb up to the roof to gaze at the 22-story building, which is the most amazing thing they have ever seen.Their eyes widen at the girls from Odisha, in their jeans and T-shirts. The girls from Odisha regard them with friendly condescension. They invite them into their rooms, as if they\u2019ve been here forever.This article was reported over four months by Ellen Barry in Bangalore and Ishwarpur, India.

{"Headline": "Time for a Realignment", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s a good chance many of you will be switching political parties over the next 15 years. You may be a corporate executive who\u2019s voted rock-solid Republican for decades, but you may be a consistent Democrat by 2024. You may be an African-American community activist in Cleveland, but don\u2019t be surprised if you someday call the Republican Party home.The fact is that political parties can swap constituencies in unexpected and dramatic ways. Over American history there\u2019s been a general pattern: a period of party stability; then some new issue comes to the fore that divides the country in new ways; old party coalitions fall apart and new ones emerge.African-Americans were once Republican, but the Great Depression brought economics to the center and F.D.R. lured them the other way. New England professionals were once Republican, too, but the rise of Barry Goldwater-Ronald Reagan Sun Belt conservatism turned them Democratic.We seem to be at one of those transformational moments now. Something bigger is afoot this year than the relative deficiencies of Trump and Clinton.In the first place, many of the existing partisan mentalities are dying out. This is the last presidential election in which two baby boomers will be running against each other. In the years ahead, politics will no longer be defined by the hidden animosities of the Vietnam era, by the sexual revolution/culture war issues of the 1970s.Future candidates will not be nostalgic for some white America of ancient memory or the union-heavy labor markets of the 1950s. They\u2019re not going to be fired up by the \u201cparadise lost\u201d hot buttons that excite the old guys who watch Fox News.Politics is catching up to social reality. The crucial social divide today is between those who feel the core trends of the global, information-age economy as tailwinds at their backs and those who feel them as headwinds in their face.That is to say, the most important social divide today is between a well-educated America that is marked by economic openness, traditional family structures, high social capital and high trust in institutions, and a less-educated America that is marked by economic insecurity, anarchic family structures, fraying community bonds and a pervasive sense of betrayal and distrust.The Republican Party is now a coalition of globalization-loving business executives and globalization-hating white workers. That\u2019s untenable. At its molten core, the Republican Party has become the party of the dispossessed, not the party of cosmopolitan business. The blunderers at the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable bet all their chips on the G.O.P. at the exact instant it stopped being their party.Now imagine a Republican Party after Donald Trump, led by a younger candidate without his bigotry and culture war tropes. That party will begin to attract disaffected Sanders people who detest the Trans-Pacific Partnership and possibly some minority voters highly suspicious of the political elite.The Democratic Party is currently a coalition of the upscale urban professionals who make up the ruling class and less-affluent members of minorities who feel betrayed by it. That\u2019s untenable, too. At its molten core the Democratic Party is the party of the coastal professional class, the 2016 presidential ticket of Yale Law and Harvard Law. It\u2019s possible that this year the Democrats will carry every state that touches ocean.Just as the Trump G.O.P. is crushing the Chamber G.O.P., the Clinton Democrats will eventually repel the Sanders Democrats. Their economic interests are just different. Moreover, their levels of social trust are vastly different.We don\u2019t normally think that politics is divided along trust lines. But this year we\u2019re seeing huge chasms depending upon how much trust you feel toward your neighbors and your national institutions. Disaffected low-trust millennials see things differently than the Hollywood, tech, media and academic professionals who actually run the party.This sort of divide is being replicated all around the world. The distinctly American feature is race. If the Republicans can drop the racial wedges \u2014 which admittedly may be a big ask \u2014 and become more the party designed to succor those who are disaffected from the globalizing information age, then it might win over some minority voters, and the existing party alignments will unravel in short order.Polls suggest Democrats will win among college-educated voters and Republicans among whites without college degrees. The social, mental and emotional gap between those two groups is getting wider and wider. That\u2019s the future of American politics. Republicans are town. Democrats are gown. Could get ugly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Move to End Myanmar Sanctions Promises a Lift for Its Economy", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExperts said on Thursday that the removal of American sanctions would benefit the country\u2019s economy by stimulating the growth of smaller businesses, even as wealthy individuals and companies blacklisted because of their close ties to the former military government also stand to benefit.\u201cA level playing field helps mainly small and medium-sized industries in Myanmar, not the cronies who have thrived under sanctions for years and are geared up to circumvent them,\u201d said Richard Horsey, a political analyst and former United Nations official in Yangon, the country\u2019s economic capital.Human rights advocates, however, said that the move was premature and that the United States was giving up its leverage over the military and its allies, who retain considerable influence over the government and the economy.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who serves as state counselor and foreign minister, shares power with the military, which has independent control over the armed forces, borders and home affairs. The military also holds a quarter of the seats in Parliament, giving it the authority to block any change to the Constitution.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi spent 15 years under house arrest before her party, the National League for Democracy, swept landmark elections last year. Since coming to power, she has made securing peace and reconciliation her government\u2019s top priority.\u201cUnity also needs prosperity, because people, when they have to fight over limited resources, forget that standing together is important,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make sure that our people are better off materially in order to strengthen our political initiative.\u201dIn May, Mr. Obama lifted some sanctions that had barred American citizens and companies from doing business with Myanmar.Officials in Myanmar\u2019s new government, which took office in April, hope that the lifting of most remaining sanctions will prompt American companies to invest, bringing capital, technology and better business practices to the country, said U Ye Min Oo, a member of an economic committee that advises the National League for Democracy.Joint investments between American firms and companies run by government cronies would be one possibility, said Mr. Ye Min Oo, a businessman who previously worked for one such person \u2014 U Tay Za, who is blacklisted.\u201cIf they lift the sanctions, all the people will get the benefit,\u201d Mr. Ye Min Oo said. \u201cWhat Myanmar wants is more investment from Americans.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s move appears to be part of a strategy to diminish China\u2019s influence in the region. China, which borders Myanmar, helped prop up the military government during the sanctions era and has major investments in the country.Mr. Ye Min Oo said the lifting of sanctions would reduce China\u2019s power while bolstering the economy.\u201cChina invests a lot, but most of their business is joint venture with the government,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Chinese investment made the government stronger, not economic development.\u201dSean Turnell, who advises the Myanmar government, said that sanctions were a drastic way of trying to restructure an economy from outside.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like starving the patient to starve the disease,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be preferable to use domestic policy and domestic institutions to do that.\u201dEven so, human rights advocates were critical of Mr. Obama\u2019s decision. Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said the lifting of sanctions would reduce the ability of the United States to push for greater protection of rights in Myanmar.\u201cThis amounts to an incredibly premature and shortsighted lifting of sanctions against senior military officers, military-connected companies, and crony capitalists,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the turning point in Burma when U.S. corporate interests and realpolitik considerations about China triumphed over human rights and rule of law.\u201dBut Mr. Obama, while addressing concerns over China, also faced a direct appeal from Myanmar\u2019s leader to lift the sanctions.\u201cWe think that the time has now come to remove all the sanctions that hurt us economically,\u201d Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said as Mr. Obama sat by her side, \u201cbecause our country is now in a position to open up to those who are interested in taking part in our economic enterprises.\u201dU Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, pointed out that expectations for her government were high and that she needed to deliver on the economy.For that to happen, lifting sanctions is crucial.\u201cWhile we are going for political reform, we need to work on economic reform too, to develop the economic and social situation of the people,\u201d he said.As for the cronies, he said, the government will leave them unpunished and will hope that they wield their economic power for the benefit of the country.\u201cWe have a policy that we can leave the past of these tycoons alone, but they must not be doing wrongdoing again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will bring them to do good for the general public.\u201d\u201cWith our continuing participation in the economic growth of Myanmar as good corporate citizens, we hope to make a difference for the people and Myanmar,\u201d the company said by email.Wai Moe contributed reporting from Yangon, Myanmar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2018Angry\u2019 Face", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGray MatterWhen Hillary Clinton participated in a televised forum on national security and military issues this month, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, tweeted that she was \u201cangry and defensive the entire time \u2014 no smile and uncomfortable.\u201d Mrs. Clinton, evidently undaunted by Mr. Priebus\u2019s opinion on when she should and shouldn\u2019t smile, tweeted back, \u201cActually, that\u2019s just what taking the office of president seriously looks like.\u201dThe implication of Mr. Priebus\u2019s comment was a familiar one: A woman making stern-looking facial movements must be angry or upset. A man who looks the same, on the other hand, is focusing on the important matters at hand.This is a classic example of a psychological phenomenon that my lab has studied: how people perceive emotion differently in men\u2019s and women\u2019s faces. It\u2019s something for Americans to consider as they watch the first debate between Mrs. Clinton and Donald J. Trump on Monday.To reinforce our findings, we repeated the study using androgynous faces, created on a computer by melding male and female features. We then produced \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d versions of each face by adding gender-typical hair. Our test subjects, who were unaware of this ruse, were again more likely to attribute an internal, emotional cause to the poses in the faces with female hair, and more likely to attribute a situational cause to the poses in the faces with male hair.Or as we summarized our discovery: \u201cShe\u2019s a bitch, but he\u2019s just having a bad day.\u201dToday, these stereotypes are playing out on the national stage. Polls indicate that Mrs. Clinton is seen as a more credible candidate than Mr. Trump, yet less trustworthy and likable. This discrepancy is surely rooted, in part, in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s violations of female stereotypes. When she acts \u201cpresidential,\u201d she is seen as harsh and cold. In contrast, when Mr. Trump insults his critics or rails against immigrants, many people attribute his anger to the situation (terrorism, the economy) rather than to something about his inner nature. She\u2019s ingenuine; he\u2019s giving voice to the feelings of his fellow Americans.Most of us recognize gender stereotypes when they\u2019re blatant. But when stereotyping is more subtle, as shown by the facial photo studies, we all succumb and often don\u2019t realize it.Keep this in mind when you watch the debate on Monday. Will you perceive Mrs. Clinton as running warm and cold, but Mr. Trump as responding to the ups and downs of the debate? When each candidate presses a point, will you see Mrs. Clinton as being irate but Mr. Trump as simply trying to best his opponent? If so, ask yourself: Is it possible that you\u2019re channeling unconscious, cultural biases, and can you rise above them?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Porsche 911 Turbo, a Mix of Performance and Balance", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrivenI HAVE two vivid memories of the Porsche 911 Turbo.There was the first one I ever saw, parked in Duluth, Minn., in the spring of 1976. It was brown. Brown never looked so fast.The more recent encounter was a new 2017 Turbo S model, in Lava Orange, at Thunder Hill Raceway Park outside of Sacramento. This one I drove. Hard.That brown first-generation Turbo belonged to the son of Jeno Paulucci. Jeno made his initial fortune creating Chun King canned Chinese food. Yep, Chinese food. By an Italian-American. In Duluth.That old car pumped out a seething (for the day) 245 horsepower and was known for its tail-happy dynamics. All I knew is that I now foolishly wanted a whale tale on my dad\u2019s Delta 88.While all 2107 911s are turbocharged, the Turbo is the 911\u2019s 911. The Turbo is equally at home grabbing a gallon of milk or slaying supercars on closed courses. With all four of its wheels in action, the S coupe model tested from rest to 60 miles an hour in 2.8 seconds. Stuttgart produces more aggressive cars, like the 911 GT3 RS, but the Turbo has more balance.Imagine what the good people of Duluth would think of 580 horsepower (more than twice as much) and up to 553 pound-feet of torque produced by the 3.8-liter flat-6 engine.Granted, at 3,527 pounds the new 911 weighs some 900 pounds more than the original Turbo. But the Turbo\u2019s electronic nannies, which might have more computing power than was available to the entire state of Minnesota in the late \u201970s, will virtually assure the 911 always remains shiny side up.Thunder Hill is nearly five miles of off-camber corners, elevation changes and blind whoop-de-dos. Hurley Haywood, a much decorated endurance driver, offered two Info McNuggets.One: \u201cI use the 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission in auto mode. You can\u2019t do any better.\u201dTwo: \u201cTrust the car, it will save you every time.\u201dAnd with that, the other drivers and I eased onto the track slowly, and then, very fast.Pushing the Sport Response button on the steering wheel provides 20 seconds of engine overboost and aggressive shift calibration. Top speed is 205 miles an hour. I regularly flirted with 140 miles an hour at the end of the long straight section before massively scrubbing off speed to enter turn 1E. Ceramic brakes, standard on the S, do not fade. At all. Even under constant punishing.Did I mention it was 104 degrees?With some cars, these conditions can trigger gauge cluster messages that suggest stopping for a Coke while the drivetrain cools down. Not so with the Porsche.There\u2019s a distinct feeling the Turbo S is built twice as strong as it needs to be. The eight cars on hand, including a few Cabriolets, ran constantly for five hours, stopping only for fuel. The sole hiccup? A windshield rock chip.Mr. Hurley was right. The PDK gearbox (the only one available) is a savant. Porsche\u2019s electronic power steering provides good road feel, rare for the tech. My fingertips and keister knew exactly when all four tires were drifting in a controlled and precise way that the first Turbo never knew.The stability control feathers in as deftly as a Jedi mind trick, going full Darth Vader only when the driver does something stupid, which I\u2019ll admit to. Once. I\u2019ll claim professional evaluation.With no servicing whatsoever, I drove the tangerine Turbo away from the track south to Monterey, Calif., for the Pebble Beach Concours weekend. Then, picking up my son in San Jose, we motored northward along the coast. I volunteered to deliver the Turbo S to the Seattle press fleet.In 1,200 civilian miles, I learned that the Turbo S is livable as an everyday car, with a ride quality a skosh firmer than a standard 911. Porsche\u2019s new touch-screen user interface with Apple CarPlay is a welcome improvement. The cabin is moderately quiet, and fuel economy is good for an overachiever.Seeing 26 m.p.g. on specified premium fuel, the car beat the E.P.A. estimate of 19 city, 24 highway. We were not lollygagging.A base 911 Turbo retails for about $160,000, and the Turbo S tested will lighten your lunch money account by $196,000. That buys a lot of pizza rolls. Jeno Paulucci created those too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modern Housing With Village Virtues", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesWorking families in the United States have many struggles today: expensive child care, not enough time to cook healthy meals, disconnection from nature, a sense of social isolation \u2014 what the sociologist Robert Putnam famously called \u201cbowling alone\u201d \u2014 and more. Older Americans, a booming population, often end up segregated generationally and in dire need of care and companionship.What if there was a potential salve to all of these struggles? One that was introduced to Americans 25 years ago, but hasn\u2019t yet gone to scale?That potential solution is cohousing, a form of shared living in which groups of families with their own private homes (usually about 15 to 40 households) also share common spaces \u2014 a kitchen and eating area, often a garden, tool shed, or laundry facilities, or all of them, and a set of principles and practices about living interdependently.Since 2013, I have experienced the benefit and challenges of living in cohousing as a resident of Temescal Commons, an interfaith community in Oakland, Calif. The principles of these communities vary, depending on their size and type (urban vs. rural, religious vs. secular, intergenerational vs. over 65); still, most groups hold in common a belief that a high quality of life is achieved not through self-sufficiency, but through a village mentality. Families will often share meals, yard work and repair labor, sometimes even cars; they also help one another spontaneously in many other ways.Louise Dunlap, 78, has rented a studio apartment in a nine-unit cohousing community for the last six years. \u201cInterdependence,\u201d she says, \u201cgoes beyond turning the compost and fixing the washing machine. I get a chance to share meals and deep conversations. There\u2019s a kind of love that grows out of these connections \u2014 not romantic love, not family love, but something about our common humanity. I wish everyone could experience this.\u201dThe first distinctive cohousing community in America, Muir Commons, was built in Davis, Calif., in 1991 by the architects Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett, who became familiar with cohousing while studying architecture in Copenhagen in the 1980s. They have written an authoritative book on cohousing in America and today run their architectural firm, the Cohousing Company, from Nevada City, Calif.Europeans have been the pioneers in this particular form of shared living; there are more than 700 cohousing communities in Denmark alone. In comparison, according to the latest count done by the Cohousing Association of the United States, there are only 160 established in just 25 states across the country.So why have we been so slow to catch on?First, there\u2019s a lack of awareness. People often picture hippie communes when they hear \u201ccohousing.\u201d Alice Alexander, the executive director of the Cohousing Association, draws this distinction: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with communes, but cohousers actually value privacy and structure highly.\u201dAnother big hurdle is financing. When they set out in 2009 to create a 24-unit cohousing community in downtown Durham, N.C., Alexander and her co-founders were turned down by 10 institutions before getting a loan. The project didn\u2019t officially open until 2014.The problem, Alexander says, is that \u201cbanks have no mechanism set up to get a loan for a cohousing community to buy land or fund marketing so you can find your \u2018tribe.\u2019 \u201dTraditionally, many people who want to build a home finance the purchase of the land themselves and then use the property as collateral for a building loan. But if you\u2019re buying the larger piece of land necessary to build a comprehensive cohousing community, the cost can be prohibitive. Alexander says that National Cooperative Bank is on the cutting edge of trying to figure out new mechanisms, but it\u2019s slow going. Cohousing communities are typically structured and incorporated as homeowner associations, condo associations or housing cooperatives.But there are alternatives to building from the ground up. More recently, people have been gravitating toward what is called \u201cretrofit cohousing,\u201d in which neighbors transform an existing neighborhood over time. There are 11 retrofit cohousing communities operating in the United States today, and more in development, according to the Cohousing Association.Americans\u2019 interest in cohousing is growing. The Cohousing Association knows of 120 communities currently in formation. The 2015 National Cohousing Conference was the largest yet, and dozens of architectural firms and real estate developers have specialized in working on these types of communities. At Alexander\u2019s community alone, 300 people are on a waiting list.According to Alexander, aging baby boomers are driving the expansion; many want to downsize and find supportive communities. Additionally, millennials, many of whom experienced co-op living in college, are just starting their families. They are accustomed to a sharing economy that subscribes to many of cohousing\u2019s principles and practices.For some, the many benefits of cohousing make the challenges of creating or finding such a community feel worth it. In expensive cities, it can be cost-effective and stimulating, intellectually and emotionally, to share regular meals in a group. Rather than depending on the nuclear family unit to meet all emotional needs, cohousing participants have a wide range of people to talk to.Cohousing also can provide a safety net at times of natural disasters like heat waves or hurricanes. Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist, has found that the tight-knit bonds that are formed set these neighborhoods apart \u2014 more so, even, than money or preparedness \u2014 in effectively surviving such calamities.As a result, Petaluma Avenue Homes, as it\u2019s called, has had a mix of people, some of whom love the cohousing aspect, and some of whom are understandably lukewarm to the experience, quite possibly because they\u2019ve been subjected to the obligatory bureaucratic requirements and vetting often required of the poor by government agencies.Nevertheless, Friedland retains faith in the concept. \u201cDevelopers, architects, builders, we could all learn from the design principles of cohousing \u2014 the common house, moving the parking out of the central space, having the front porches, the centrality of the gardening. All of these are based on human experience and a balance of privacy and connectivity.\u201dOf course another formidable hurdle is how difficult it is to predict the dynamics of a complex group. Many cohousing communities fall apart early on because they fail to agree on principles, practices and finances.\u201cLife together hasn\u2019t been a Cinderella story,\u201d Kate Madden Yee, a founding member of Temescal Commons Cohousing, has written. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, hanging in there with one\u2019s fellow cohousers, despite disagreements, disappointments and disillusionment. Yet therein lies the reward: In our time together, my neighbors and I have learned a thing or two about how to not only create, but negotiate our common life with more ease and compassion.\u201dTwenty-five years in, although the experiment is still small scale, it has yielded a generation of Americans who grew up in cohousing. Many are evangelical about the ways in which the experience has shaped who they are.Ravenna Koenig, now 26, grew up in Vashon Island Cohousing in Washington. \u201cIt taught me communication,\u201d she says, \u201cnot just as a tool, but as a value. When you share your home with 17 other families, all those conversations that you\u2019d normally just have with your spouse or your kids \u2014 about what to do when two kids from different families get in a fight, or whether to prioritize filling potholes or weeding the garden first \u2014 those conversations become much bigger. You have to learn how to articulate what you want, and empathize harder than you ever thought you could.\u201d Advertisement"}

The initiative will also sponsor sessions for directors to hone their story pitches, as well as connect them with financiers because, Ms. Menin said, research shows that financing is a major hurdle for female filmmakers.The city office, which recently expanded to cover more creative fields, including advertising, digital distribution and music, was traditionally used to promote the TV and film industry in New York. Local production is already at an all-time high, Ms. Menin said; there were 336 films shot in the city in 2015, compared with 242 in 2014, and 52 episodic prime time TV shows. \u201cWe believe we have a responsibility as an office to focus on other initiatives, such as diversity and inclusion, and so that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she said.

The Harsh Ones.", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not unusual for theater, like many of the arts, to address a pressing social or political issue. But what strikes me as unusual this fall is that most of such work comes from notable black female playwrights: Sarah Jones, Anna Deavere Smith and Lynn Nottage all have new (or new to New York) works that grapple with problems preoccupying contemporary culture.Lynn Nottage explains how a broken city gets a turn onstage in her play \u201cSweat.\u201dIn shaping this well-wrought drama about factory laborers facing bleak futures, Ms. Nottage and her director, Kate Whoriskey, drew on interviews with residents of a Pennsylvania city ranked among the poorest in the country. Mostly set in a bar where the workers hang out, the play explores the tensions \u2014 racial, interpersonal and otherwise \u2014 that tear at the fabric of the community, as jobs in manufacturing that once provided a solid middle-class living for millions of Americans grow scarce.I probably don\u2019t need to remind you that anger at the decline of the rust-belt economies has been much discussed in the presidential election this year. But as in her previous plays, including \u201cIntimate Apparel\u201d and \u201cRuined,\u201d Ms. Nottage nimbly avoids the didactic in her exploration of the fallout from the collapse of manufacturing. \u201cSweat\u201d handily earns its grabby title, pulsing with the intensity of drama drawn directly from the hard-lived experiences of its characters.Her new show, \u201cNotes From the Field: Doing Time in Education,\u201d focuses on how the failings of public schools are ineluctably intertwined with the high incarceration rates of young men, and young black men in particular.And, finally, this fall Ms. Parks becomes only the second black woman to have a series of productions dedicated to her work at the Signature Theater, after the pioneering playwright Adrienne Kennedy. Ms. Parks\u2019s \u201cresidency\u201d will comprise four plays, spanning both this season and next.It may well be a coincidence that the season will bring us a rich handful of plays by black women addressing issues reverberating through American culture today (and yesterday, and the day before). Or it may be an indication that while many playwrights continue to concentrate on staple American-theater themes of troubled families and personal strife, black women are using their gifts to widen our perspectives and confront truths that it might be more comfortable to ignore.Advertisement"}

Mr. McCrory, on Tuesday and Wednesday, said he encouraged \u201call public and private institutions to both respect and allow our nation\u2019s judicial system to proceed without economic threats or political retaliation.\u201dMr. McCrory did not specifically criticize the A.C.C., but this week, he described the N.C.A.A. as \u201ca multibillion-dollar, tax-exempt monopoly\u201d that had not demonstrated respect for student-athletes.The speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Tim Moore, said the decisions by the N.C.A.A. and the A.C.C. were \u201cvery unfortunate.\u201d\u201cNo one ever wants to lose events under any circumstances, but these organizations are certainly entitled to host their events wherever they choose,\u201d Mr. Moore, a Republican who supports H.B. 2, said. \u201cThe truth remains that this law was never about and does not promote discrimination.\u201dMr. McCrory\u2019s Democratic rival, Roy Cooper, the state\u2019s attorney general, said in a video released Wednesday that the governor had shown \u201cno leadership.\u201d\u201cThis is not just about sports,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cThis is about communities in North Carolina suffering real economic blows.\u201dThe conference, which said it would announce future sites, has just a few weeks to relocate its first affected championship, for women\u2019s soccer, which had been scheduled to take place in Cary beginning Oct. 30, and less than three months to find a new venue for its marquee event, the football championship game, scheduled for Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte on Dec. 3.Six other championships featuring sports like men\u2019s and women\u2019s swimming and diving, men\u2019s golf and baseball are scheduled to be held at in-state venues. The men\u2019s A.C.C. basketball tournament, frequently held in the state, was already set to be staged at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.Some championships hosted by specific universities will not be affected, like the men\u2019s and women\u2019s cross-country championships at North Carolina State.Beyond those championships and regular-season A.C.C. games, the other major college sports event set to take place in the state is the Belk Bowl, which will pit an A.C.C. football team against one from the Southeastern Conference on Dec. 29 in Charlotte.The Charlotte Sports Foundation, which hosts the Belk Bowl and the A.C.C. football championship, said in a statement Wednesday that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the football title game was moving, adding, \u201cWe recognize the economic impact moving the game and its events have on the Charlotte area.\u201dFrank Kay, a spokesman for the host organization, said there were no talks about relocating the Belk Bowl.Mr. Swofford had presaged the A.C.C.\u2019s decision in a statement late Monday night, saying that the N.C.A.A.\u2019s action \u201ccontinues to build upon the negative impact\u201d the law \u201chas already had on the state\u201d and adding that he personally felt the law should \u201cbe repealed as it\u2019s counter to basic human rights.\u201dCharlotte, which is North Carolina\u2019s largest city and which Mr. McCrory governed as mayor for 14 years, has been especially hard hit by the fallout from the law. In addition to the A.C.C. title game, the National Basketball Association\u2019s 2017 All-Star Game was withdrawn from the city this summer in reaction to the law.Charlotte\u2019s municipal efforts to strengthen legal protections for transgender people were part of what prodded the General Assembly to pass H.B. 2.\u201cThe cancellation of the 2016 A.C.C. football championship is a blow to Charlotte\u2019s visitor economy and is irreplaceable at this late date,\u201d said Tom Murray, the chief executive of the Charlotte Regional Visitors\u2019 Authority, which estimated that the A.C.C.\u2019s 2015 football title game had an economic impact of more than $32 million.But the mounting economic toll spreads far beyond Charlotte, ensnaring cities like Greensboro and Cary, which is just outside Raleigh and had been scheduled to host N.C.A.A. championships in baseball, lacrosse, tennis and soccer.Mayor Nancy Vaughan of Greensboro, whose father was a longtime A.C.C. official, said in an interview Tuesday, \u201cWe are in the process right now of bidding games and tournaments for the next four years, so we are really looking at the possibility of a five-year drought.\u201dScott Dupree, the executive director of the Greater Raleigh Sports Alliance, said that for sports events in North Carolina, this week has been \u201cunprecedented and historically bad, probably the worst ever in terms of lost business and damage to our brand.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thousands March in Venezuela to Demand President\u2019s Ouster", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Thousands took to the streets here on Thursday to demand the ouster of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in what appeared to be the year\u2019s largest display of frustration with Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse and leadership.The march, which protesters called \u201cthe taking of Caracas,\u201d was organized by political opponents of the country\u2019s ruling leftists. The marchers took over a major highway and several avenues in Caracas, the nation\u2019s capital, and poured into the city\u2019s plazas in an effort to gain momentum for a referendum to recall Mr. Maduro.But the discontent was far greater than mere political frustration in a country that has spiraled into economic ruin. Some protesters traveled for hours from parts of Venezuela where they said they could no longer find enough food. Others said they could not find work, or that their cities were plagued by violence and suffering from a lack of government presence.Ivonne Mej\u00edas, 42, who wore a headband of yellow, blue and red, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, said the situation had become so difficult that she had not been able to bake birthday cakes for her children this year. Her family of four gets by on just $25 a week, Ms. Mej\u00edas said, and she has taken to making pi\u00f1atas to earn extra money.\u201cSometimes I want to kill myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI am frustrated, I am out of control, I am fighting with this world. This isn\u2019t my life. My soul splits in two when my kids beg for something \u2014 for an ice cream, for a cookie \u2014 and I can\u2019t give it to them. The most difficult thing is getting food.\u201dV\u00edctor Guilarte, 45, a mechanic from a Caracas suburb, said his work had vanished because his neighbors had become so poor they could not afford car repairs. Two weeks ago, he said, he visited his family in another state and found the situation even worse.\u201cI came back feeling destroyed \u2014 they had no food,\u201d he said. \u201cI am tired of Maduro and his government, tired of crime, of hunger, of them telling us we have plenty to eat. I want a referendum, and if there is no referendum, I want him to resign.\u201dMr. Maduro called on his supporters to take to the streets to stage a counterprotest, which drew crowds dressed in red, the color of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s leftist movement.The government also appeared to be cracking down on opponents. Days earlier, Daniel Ceballos, an opposition leader under house arrest on charges of inciting violence, was transferred to a jail cell. The government said he had planned to agitate for violence during the protest. Other opposition parties said members had either been arrested or gone into hiding.In a nation where the price of bread rises each week, along with the length of bakery lines, there has been no shortage of anger and desperation.The spring was characterized by droughts that stalled the nation\u2019s hydroelectric system. Blackouts rolled across the country, shutting off the lights in homes and emergency rooms. Mr. Maduro announced a cut in the workweek, to four days \u2014 and later to two \u2014 to conserve electricity.By summer, the nation\u2019s food supply was dwindling. The lines where Venezuelans had been accustomed to waiting for food turned into mobs that attacked bakeries, butcher shops and groceries. Delivery trucks were also attacked, their contents looted. The government ordered the food supply to be transported under armed guards.That dire situation led many to make long journeys to the capital to vent their complaints on Thursday.It was unclear how many participated in the march, and government officials had sought to forestall a large demonstration. Official roadblocks appeared Wednesday night at tunnels leading to Caracas, snarling traffic for hours as the police questioned passengers about their motives.Gerardo Molina, 21, a political science student from Zulia, a state in Venezuela\u2019s far west, made a 16-hour bus journey to join the march, a trip he said would have taken eight hours if the police were not monitoring the roads.Mr. Molina expressed the worry typical of many young Venezuelans who fear they may never inherit the rich petro state that had given their parents assurances of a comfortable life. Many young people have simply packed their bags and sought a future in other South American countries where the economies are more prosperous.\u201cYoung people are the ones who suffer the most because we feel we have no future,\u201d Mr. Molina said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this country, which is why I came to this march.\u201dMarly Torrealba, 37, a single mother, came by bus from Barlovento, a city once known for its cacao production. Ms. Torrealba complained that the government had abandoned the city to organized crime, and it was now rocked by killings, extortions and kidnappings.\u201cFarm workers have abandoned the crop because of crime,\u201d she said, \u201cand the criminals charge us protection money and rob everything in sight.\u201dWhile the Maduro government was the target of the protests, much seemed to be at stake for Venezuela\u2019s political opposition, which has struggled to translate the anger of the country\u2019s collapse into popular support.The opposition, riding a wave of discontent with Mr. Maduro, took over the National Assembly in January. Its members promised to enact free-market reforms that would revive the collapsing economy; free a number of jailed political leaders; and, most crucially, have a referendum that they said would remove Mr. Maduro from office within months.None of that has come to pass. Mr. Maduro, backed by a Supreme Court controlled by leftists, quickly managed to block the opposition\u2019s reform measures, overturning a bill to free political prisoners and using the courts to grant himself expanded presidential powers over the objections of Congress.Even the movement to recall him has been stalled. Opposition politicians promised to hold a vote this year on the referendum, which would force leftists to hold a new election if Mr. Maduro lost. However, the country\u2019s electoral body issued a timetable in which the vote would be held next year; if Mr. Maduro were removed, his handpicked vice president would serve out the end of his term, which ends in 2019.Opposition leaders vowed on Thursday to redouble their efforts to remove the president.\u201cEveryone wake up Maduro if he can manage to sleep,\u201d Henrique Capriles, an opposition leader, wrote on Twitter. \u201cAll of Caracas is mobilizing itself for the referendum.

{"Headline": "Daily Report: Samsung Compounds Its Smartphone Woes", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsSamsung has a serious problem with things burning up, and not just in its smartphones. Time, market capitalization, and possibly long-term brand value are all in flames.It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. The company announced it would recall about 2.5 million phones over two weeks ago, about 10 days after the first reports of battery fires and explosions started appearing out of China.But some stores appeared to continue selling the phone after the recall was announced, and the company appears to have no good way of contacting affected customers, who may well be all over the world.Nor did the South Korean government aid Samsung, despite the importance of Samsung to South Korea\u2019s economy and the country\u2019s generally strong industrial policy.It\u2019s not like the signals weren\u2019t there. The United States flight authorities, along with those of many other nations, instructed people not to use their Galaxy 7 phones on airplanes. One of our reporters on a flight this week heard warnings about Samsung three times on a single flight.It doesn\u2019t help that YouTube is starting to see many videos purporting to show the phone exploding, in ways that look nothing like the damage seen earlier.

In the new videos, however, it explodes in a cloud of smoke \u2014 sometimes white, sometimes black.If anyone is benefiting from Samsung\u2019s woes, it\u2019s Apple, Samsung\u2019s main smartphone rival. On Tuesday, Apple botched upgrades of its new smartphone operating system for a while \u2014 \u201cbricking,\u201d or rendering useless, phones that got the upgrade.

{"Headline": "As Britain Confronts \u2018Brexit,\u2019 a Canadian Takes Center Stage: Mark Carney", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 On a soggy morning in late June, as Britain absorbed the staggering news that it had voted to abandon the European Union, a stone-faced Canadian took to national television to offer assurances that the world was not ending.Mark Carney, the first foreigner to head Britain\u2019s central bank in its 322 years of existence, was suddenly a crucial figure in the improvised effort to manage the fallout of the so-called Brexit vote.Even those who lavish praise on his leadership suggest the bank may be out of ammunition. Whatever happens from here \u2014 whether Britain slides into recession or escapes that fate \u2014 may depend more on whether the Treasury unleashes government spending than on anything Mr. Carney may be considering.\u201cHe\u2019s a very cool, collected person, and he indeed rose to the occasion, but there are clear limits to what he can do,\u201d said Richard Portes, an economist at the London Business School, who counts Mr. Carney a friend. \u201cThey can\u2019t seriously counteract the underlying real economic effects of this.\u201dHis detractors in the Conservative Party argue that Mr. Carney tried to scare the electorate into voting to stay in Europe with exaggerated forecasts of economic damage, then acted precipitously to cut interest rates even as the economy proved resilient.If Mr. Carney feels misgivings, he betrayed none during an appearance at a Parliamentary committee last week.\u201cI\u2019m absolutely serene,\u201d he said. \u201cI absolutely feel comfortable in the decision that I supported and the committee took in August to supply monetary policy stimulus.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.\u201cIt\u2019s rubbish,\u201d said John Van Reenen, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any Brexit yet. In terms of the economic effects, we are looking at what happens when we leave the European Union.\u201dStock markets and consumer spending have held up better than anticipated, but the full impact will not be known for at least several months.A slowdown in investment is expected, as multinational companies hold off on expanding operations in Britain until its future trading relationship with Europe is clear. Major banks are actively exploring shifting parts of their businesses out of Britain, a potentially significant blow.But one worry does seem to have been dispatched \u2014 the threat that the vote could deliver a shock to the global financial system. Here, Mr. Carney draws plaudits for the performance art aspects of central banking.As the referendum result reverberated on the morning of June 24, markets plunged from Tokyo to London to New York, erasing $2 trillion in global wealth. The sell-off conjured talk of another Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that collapsed in 2008, setting off the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.The vote ostensibly kicked off torturous divorce proceedings with Europe that jeopardized Britain\u2019s exports while threatening to send major banks scrambling to abandon London.No one appeared to be running things. Prime Minister David Cameron would soon declare his pending resignation. The man in charge of the budget, George Osborne, disappeared from the scene. The opposition Labour Party commenced bloody recriminations.As he stepped in front of the cameras at the Bank of England, the yellow light of a chandelier glowing in a hallway behind him, Mr. Carney appeared to be the only powerful figure in Britain who was at once awake, sober and not about to begin spending more time with the family.He had long carried a reputation as the supreme grown-up in every room. Britain had just taken a leap into the wild unknown. Here was the one person who had remembered to pack provisions.\u201cThere was a general need to bring about some restoration of confidence in the economy,\u201d said Charles Goodhart, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, and now a professor at the London School of Economics. \u201cMark Carney as governor of the Bank of England was one of the few remaining figures of authority in place who could tell people that things were not falling apart.\u201dThat Mr. Carney operates with a North American accent appears to have lent him some immunity as politicians who supported the referendum have accused him of stoking fears.\u201cIf he\u2019d been a Brit, people would have been able to say, \u2018Oh, you would say that, because you went to that school, or belong to this club,\u2019\u201d Mr. Van Reenen said. \u201cHaving someone who\u2019s a bit of an outsider, it gave him more robustness in defending what he was doing.\u201dBorn in Canada\u2019s remote Northwest Territories (population, 44,340), Mr. Carney grew up primarily in Edmonton. He spent 13 years traveling the globe for Goldman Sachs and assumed the governorship of Canada\u2019s central bank in 2008.If bankers expected that his Goldman ties would make Mr. Carney a pliable regulator, they were in for disappointment. His central bank forced Canadian institutions to reserve more of their capital than lenders elsewhere. That limited Canada\u2019s exposure to the global financial crisis.In 2011, as central bankers drafted new rules aimed at preventing another financial crisis, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, famously excoriated Mr. Carney behind closed doors: The proposed rules discriminated against American bankers, Mr. Dimon charged.Mr. Carney held his ground. \u201cIf some institutions feel pressure today,\u201d he declared in a speech two days later, \u201cit is because they have done too little for too long.\u201dMost observers assume Mr. Carney prefers to avoid more monetary loosening, allowing the Treasury to take the lead, but will not hesitate if economic growth deteriorates.Given that the vote was, on one level, a call for limits on immigration, some celebrate Mr. Carney\u2019s prominent role as a sign that British openness endures.\u201cThe only grown-up in the room turns out to be an immigrant,\u201d said Ricardo Reis, an economist at the London School of Economics.But if the electorate had in mind limiting the influx of Polish plumbers and Syrian refugees, Mr. Carney presents a different sort of immigrant. He bears degrees from Harvard and Oxford. He is married to the British economist Diana Carney. His pay package runs 874,000 pounds a year, or nearly $1.2 million.Still, the presence of a Canadian heading the institution that watches the money attests to Britain\u2019s continued willingness to import high-level talent.The English Premier League, the pinnacle of global soccer, is stocked with top players from every shore. Chefs, architects and theater directors flock to London.\u201cThe U.K. is the epicenter of what is frequently known as the Wimbledon effect,\u201d Mr. Goodhart said. Before Andy Murray won the tennis tournament for the first time in 2013, no Briton had taken the trophy for 77 years, yet people cheered the winners.\u201cWe don\u2019t care about the identity of the person,\u201d Mr. Goodhart said, \u201cas long as they are doing the right thing for us in the U.K.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chinese Mystery: Who Owns a Firm on a Global Shopping Spree?", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPingyang County\u2019s verdant hills still hint at a long-lost China. Rice paddies and villages surround its bustling towns, and in the fields, farmers wade into the mud to plant seedlings as they have for thousands of years.American regulators are now asking who these shareholders are \u2014 and whether they are holding their stakes on behalf of others.The questions add to the mystery surrounding a company that seemed to come out of nowhere, surprising deal makers with offers to pay more than $30 billion for assets around the world.Anbang\u2019s shopping spree is part of an outflow of money from China that has reshaped global markets but has often been shrouded in secrecy, sometimes by prominent Chinese looking to shift their wealth abroad without attracting attention at home. That poses a problem for international regulators trying to identify the buyers behind major acquisitions and to assess the riskiness of these deals.In many ways, Anbang and Mr. Wu appear to be archetypal products of China\u2019s mix of freewheeling capitalism and Communist Party dominance, a formula that has fueled nearly four decades of untrammeled growth.But he does not appear in Anbang\u2019s filings as an owner.It is common in China for the wealthy to have their shares in companies held in others\u2019 names. Known in Chinese as baishoutao, or white gloves, these people are often trusted relatives or acquaintances. Many defend the practice as a way to protect their privacy in a nation where riches can be a political liability. But others say white gloves can be used to hide ill-gotten gains and thwart corruption investigators.Anbang did not respond when asked if Mr. Wu was a shareholder and declined to answer questions about its owners.The company, a spokesman said, \u201chas multiple shareholders who have made all required disclosures under Chinese law. They are a mix of individual and institutional shareholders who made a commercial decision to invest in the company. Anbang has now grown to be a global company thanks to the support of these long-term shareholders.\u201dFor investors and regulators, white gloves can make it difficult to evaluate the financial health of a Chinese buyer. Ownership may be concentrated in the hands of a few people, posing hidden risks, and companies with government connections could be vulnerable to political shifts or become magnets for corruption.\u201cIt is very important for businesses to know who they are ultimately doing business with, and for investors, what they are investing in,\u201d said Keith Williamson, a managing director in Hong Kong at Alvarez & Marsal, a firm that carries out corporate fraud investigations.Separately, the Chinese magazine Caixin reported in May that Chinese regulators were examining Anbang\u2019s riskier financial products. It is unclear where that inquiry stands or whether Anbang\u2019s ownership structure is being investigated.Questions about Anbang\u2019s owners come as Chinese companies make deals around the world \u2014 sometimes representing efforts by China\u2019s powerful to move money out of the country, as the economy slows and the party tightens its grip on everyday life.China has encouraged some capital outflow to improve the performance of its investments and expand its influence. But the subject of the elite moving money overseas is politically sensitive, raising questions about the source of their wealth and their confidence in the Chinese economy.Luo Yu, the son of a former chief of staff of China\u2019s military, said China\u2019s most politically powerful families had been transferring money out of the country for some time.\u201cThey don\u2019t believe they will hold on to power long enough \u2014 sooner or later they would collapse,\u201d said Mr. Luo, a former colonel in the Chinese Army whose younger brother was a business partner with one of Anbang\u2019s founders. \u201cSo they transfer their money.\u201dThen there was Mr. Wu, who was born Wu Guanghui but was known as Wu Xiaohui from a young age. Relatives said he grew up in a Catholic family; a crucifix sat on his aunt\u2019s dining room table, and she wears a necklace with a portrait of the Virgin Mary.Mr. Wu married Zhuo Ran, a granddaughter of Deng, the Chinese leader who brought China out of the chaos of the Mao era. Together, Mr. Wu, Ms. Zhuo, Mr. Chen and their relatives owned or ran the companies that controlled Anbang, according to company filings.Anbang leapt onto the global stage with last year\u2019s purchase of the Waldorf Astoria and its aborted bid for the Starwood chain. By this year, Anbang\u2019s assets had swelled to $295 billion.It is not clear what prompted Anbang\u2019s sudden interest in overseas assets. But the shift came after a reshuffling of its ownership structure that also led to the injection of more than $7.5 billion into the company.Company documents filed with Chinese agencies show that the number of firms holding Anbang\u2019s shares jumped to 39, from eight, over six months in 2014. Most of those firms received large injections of funds. At the same time, Anbang\u2019s capital more than quintupled.Ms. Zhuo disappeared from the ownership records by the end of that year. Many of Mr. Wu\u2019s relatives did as well. Mr. Wu and Mr. Chen had disappeared earlier from the records.Mr. Zhu, who does not appear to have owned shares, disappeared in paper filings from Anbang\u2019s roster of directors by 2009, though he was listed as a director on online government filings as late as 2014.Mr. Wu, Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhu did not respond to requests for comment, and Ms. Zhuo could not be reached. In March, Mr. Zhu told Chinese reporters that he was not an Anbang director.Anbang\u2019s current shareholding firms are not well-known names in China, and some appear to have been set up just to hold Anbang shares. One lists its address as the empty 27th floor of a dusty Beijing office building. Two more list an address at a mail drop above a Beijing post office.Using corporate filings, The Times compiled a list of nearly 100 people who own shares in the firms and traced about a dozen to Pingyang County or nearby. Reporters visited the area, in China\u2019s eastern Zhejiang Province, and interviewed dozens of residents, including several whose names appeared on the list. They also interviewed an uncle, an aunt and a nephew of Mr. Wu.The latter two, as well as others in the area, said one name matched that of his sister, Wu Xiaoxia. The family members said several other names matched those of Mr. Wu\u2019s extended kin, including two cousins and others on his mother\u2019s side of the family. Through their various stakes in Anbang shareholding companies, these people control a stake representing more than $17 billion in assets.Other names matched local acquaintances of Mr. Wu, including Huang Maosheng, a local businessman who confirmed in a brief phone interview that he had a business relationship with Mr. Wu but declined to elaborate.One village leader and neighbors identified the names of four of Mr. Huang\u2019s relatives \u2014 including some whom they described as common workers \u2014 from among those on the list. Their Anbang holdings represent about $12 billion in assets.Another resident, Mei Xiaojing, said two names on the list matched those of her relatives. Asked if she knew Mr. Wu, she said, \u201cWell, yes,\u201d then ended the phone conversation and did not respond to subsequent calls.

{"Headline": "N.C.A.A. Moves Championship Events From North Carolina, Citing Anti-Gay-Rights Law", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmong the events affected is the Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament, the N.C.A.A.\u2019s most prominent annual event, which had six first- and second-round games scheduled to be played in Greensboro in March.In a statement explaining the decision by its Board of Governors, which is largely made up of institutional presidents and chancellors, the N.C.A.A. said: \u201cN.C.A.A. championships and events must promote an inclusive atmosphere for all college athletes, coaches, administrators and fans. Current North Carolina state laws make it challenging to guarantee that host communities can help deliver on that commitment.\u201dBut Monday\u2019s decision is sure to have real economic ramifications, and it could presage further activism by sports leagues against state or local laws they see as antithetical to their principles or disagreeable to their national fan bases.\u201cThis is an incredible statement from the N.C.A.A.,\u201d said Hudson Taylor, the executive director of Athlete Ally, a nonprofit organization that fights homophobia and transphobia in sports. \u201cI think this is making it clear that any state or city wishing to host N.C.A.A. championships has to protect and respect their L.G.B.T. constituents.\u201dChris Sgro, a Democrat in the North Carolina House of Representatives and the executive director of Equality N.C., a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights advocacy group, said the decision showed that the law \u201cis hurting our economy, our reputation, and our people every day.\u201dThe North Carolina law, which was signed by Gov. Pat McCrory in March but is still commonly referred to as House Bill 2, nullified local government ordinances establishing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. But it gained widespread attention for its stipulation requiring people in publicly owned buildings to use restrooms that correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificate.The N.C.A.A.\u2019s president, Mark Emmert, said in the organization\u2019s statement: \u201cFairness is about more than the opportunity to participate in college sports, or even compete for championships. We believe in providing a safe and respectful environment at our events.\u201dBut in explaining its decision, the N.C.A.A. emphasized the uniqueness of North Carolina\u2019s situation, noting, for instance, that several cities and five states, including New York, have moved to bar state-sponsored travel to North Carolina. Such a ban could include college athletes and staff members, the N.C.A.A. said.Already, the University of Vermont had canceled a women\u2019s basketball game to be held at the University of North Carolina, and the State University of New York at Albany had canceled a men\u2019s basketball game at Duke.In addition to men\u2019s basketball, the affected championships are for women\u2019s soccer, women\u2019s golf and women\u2019s lacrosse in Division I; baseball in Division II; and men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer in Division III. Some championship tournaments decide games based on home-field advantage, and Monday\u2019s move will not affect any game locations dictated by the regular-season success of North Carolina-based teams.North Carolina \u2014 Charlotte, specifically \u2014 is also home to the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s annual football championship game, which is not administered by the N.C.A.A. In a statement Monday night, the conference\u2019s commissioner, John Swofford, said, \u201cH.B. 2 was previously scheduled to be thoroughly discussed at this week\u2019s A.C.C. Council of Presidents meeting, so it would be premature to make any decisions or announcements regarding A.C.C. championships until our membership is able to discuss. The league\u2019s longstanding commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion will continue to be a central theme to our discussions.\u201dSwofford added, though, \u201cOn a personal note, it\u2019s time for this bill to be repealed as it\u2019s counter to basic human rights.\u201dThe office of Governor McCrory, a Republican, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and aides to the Republican leaders of the General Assembly were similarly quiet. But a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Republican Party, Kami Mueller, described the decision as \u201cso absurd it\u2019s almost comical.\u201d\u201cI wish the N.C.A.A. was this concerned about the women who were raped at Baylor,\u201d Ms. Mueller said in a statement, referring to a recent scandal involving Baylor University\u2019s football program. \u201cPerhaps the N.C.A.A. should stop with their political peacocking \u2014 and instead focus their energies on making sure our nation\u2019s collegiate athletes are safe, both on and off the field.\u201dWith Mr. McCrory embroiled in one of the nation\u2019s closest governor\u2019s races, Democrats quickly used the N.C.A.A.\u2019s announcement to assail Mr. McCrory once more about the law.\u201cThese tournaments pump money into our economy and give our communities and fans a chance to showcase our incredible tradition of college sports,\u201d said Ford Porter, a spokesman for Roy Cooper, the Democratic nominee for governor. \u201cNow, our ability to host these events at the highest level has been eliminated because of Governor McCrory and H.B. 2.\u201dChad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights advocacy group, said in a statement, \u201cIt\u2019s long past time state lawmakers repealed this vile law, and if they don\u2019t, the majority of voters opposed to H.B. 2 will ensure they pay the price in November.\u201dA trial about the law is expected next year, but the decision by the N.C.A.A. could focus immediate attention on how the University of North Carolina has approached the statute.After Judge Thomas D. Schroeder\u2019s ruling in late August, the university said in a statement that it had \u201cbeen caught in the middle of a conflict that we did not create between state law and federal guidance\u201d and that it would \u201cfully comply\u201d with the judge\u2019s 83-page decision.Private institutions have not felt such pressure because the law does not apply to their campuses. In April, Duke University issued a harshly worded statement that called for the law\u2019s repeal and said university administrators \u201cdeplore in the strongest possible terms the new state law.\u201dLiam Stack contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charles L. Schultze, 91, Dies; Advised Presidents on Economic Policy", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles L. Schultze, an economist who was President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s budget director and President Jimmy Carter\u2019s chief economic adviser, died on Tuesday at his home in Washington. He was 91.His death was announced by the Brookings Institution in Washington, where he was a research scholar for 45 years.Mr. Schultze spent nearly his whole career working on national economic and fiscal policy, either from the inside as a government economic adviser or from the outside as a university professor and research fellow.He came to be regarded as a leading expert on the workings of the federal government and its budget. He is credited with devising a powerful new way of analyzing the effects of the federal deficit on the larger economy. But he often met with frustration in persuading political leaders to act on his advice.Charles Louis Schultze was born across the Potomac from Washington, in Alexandria, Va., on Dec. 12, 1924. A 1942 graduate of Gonzaga College High School in Washington, he was at Georgetown University when he interrupted his education to enlist in the Army in 1943. He served for three years in the infantry and was awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star. After his service, he finished his bachelor\u2019s degree at Georgetown and earned a master\u2019s there as well, both in economics.While pursuing advanced degrees, he worked for the Democratic National Committee and then in a succession of government posts, including a stint at the Korean War-era Office of Price Stabilization. He was awarded a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Maryland in 1960. His doctoral thesis and much of his early research was on the causes of inflation.Mr. Schultze served on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1952 to 1959, then left to teach at Indiana University. It was there that he wrote that the best way to gauge the effect of a fiscal policy \u2014 say, a given rate of taxation and spending \u2014 was to ask not what size budget surplus or deficit would actually result, but rather what the outcome would be if the economy were running at, or nearly at, full employment.Mr. Schultze\u2019s ideas explained why the Kennedy administration\u2019s tax policies, including tax cuts, were stimulating the economy even though they were also shrinking the deficit, which in those days most economists took as evidence of the opposite effect.He showed that the policies had stimulated new investment and employment fast enough to more than make up the federal revenue lost in tax cuts, an effect they would not have had if the economy were already healthy and unemployment were low.President John F. Kennedy responded by hiring Mr. Schultze as deputy budget director. He was promoted to run the Bureau of the Budget by President Johnson in 1965. At one point he was criticized as having helped Robert S. McNamara, Johnson\u2019s secretary of defense, obscure the rising costs of the war in Vietnam in the 1967 federal budget.In 1968, the year the Republicans retook the White House, Mr. Schultze returned to teaching and became a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the liberal-leaning research and policy studies organization.President Carter chose the blunt, gregarious Mr. Schultze for chief economic adviser at the beginning of his administration in 1977, a time when economic stagnation and high inflation were among the leading political issues.Mr. Schultze quickly assembled an economic stimulus plan. But nearly all his proposals for fighting inflation were blocked on political grounds, and he found himself on the losing side of arguments within the administration over energy, farm policy and other economic issues.Returning to Brookings after Mr. Carter failed to win re-election, Mr. Schultze wrote frequently on budgetary and economic issues. When President Ronald Reagan\u2019s policy makers asserted in the 1980s that steep tax cuts would once again stimulate a big increase in total federal revenue, Mr. Schultze called their argument \u201cnonsense\u201d and a misreading of his work during the Kennedy years.He also backed the use of statistical sampling methods to reflect hard-to-count population groups in the 2000 census.Mr. Schultze was president of the American Economic Association in 1984 and had been a senior fellow emeritus at Brookings since 1996. He wrote numerous articles and books at Brookings, including \u201cMemos to the President: A Guide Through Macroeconomics for the Busy Policymaker\u201d (1992). He was a frequent contributor to The American Economic Review.Mr. Schultze married Rita Irene Hertzog in 1947. She died in 2014. He is survived by their daughters, Karen Hoffman, Lynn Jones, Kathleen Schultze, Carol Kasunic and Mary Chris Weintrob; a son, Kevin; 16 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.Asked in the 1960s, when he was budget director, what he did in his spare time, Mr. Schultze said: \u201cSleep. With six kids and a house to take care of and some reading to do, there isn\u2019t much time left for anything else.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be high when you\u2019re buying and selling stock,\u201d Mr. Schultze advised.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other 13 Women Testifying Against Cosby ... if the Court Lets Them", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome knew him for only a day. Others built friendships over months, even years, and introduced him to their mothers, an aunt, even a 9-year-old son, they say.But all 13 women say the same thing: Bill Cosby finally gave them a pill, or some other intoxicant, sometimes hidden at the bottom of a fizzing glass of champagne or a glass of wine or soda, and they awoke hours later having been sexually abused.The prosecution has asked the court to allow the women to testify, and the judge\u2019s ruling, expected in coming months, will be critical to Mr. Cosby\u2019s fate.\u201cIt could be the most important ruling in the case,\u201d said Benjamin Brafman, a defense lawyer in New York who is not involved in the Cosby case. \u201cIt is no longer just one person making the allegations.\u201dFor the women, their testimony could represent a final legal opportunity to address what they contend was Mr. Cosby\u2019s criminal behavior. Most never came forward decades ago, when they say the episodes occurred. Even civil cases against him have largely been prevented by statutes of limitation.But this sort of evidence is not often admitted in criminal cases. Ordinarily, prosecutors in Pennsylvania and most other states cannot introduce evidence or accusations of prior bad behavior. It is viewed as too prejudicial for a jury as it sifts through the facts of the case that is actually before it. Mr. Cosby\u2019s legal team said it would fight to block the women from testifying.There are circumstances, though, in Pennsylvania and other states where such evidence is permitted \u2014 for instance, when it shows conduct so similar it can be argued that it demonstrates a common scheme or plan, a kind of unique fingerprint of criminal behavior.In the Cosby case, prosecutors say in court papers that the women\u2019s accounts form such a pattern \u2014 that he befriended each of them, mentoring some, drugging and assaulting them all, just as, they say, he did Ms. Constand.Twelve of the 13 women say Mr. Cosby offered them alcohol or pills or both. One woman said she drank a glass of soda, which she says she believes was laced with a drug.Ms. Constand says Mr. Cosby had evolved into her mentor, invited her to his home, gave her pills and wine, then molested her while she was incapacitated. Mr. Cosby has denied all of the women\u2019s charges.Prosecutors did not name the women in their court papers. But 11 of them \u2014 Janice Baker Kinney, Therese Serignese, Linda Kirkpatrick, Heidi Thomas, Margie Shapiro, Lise-Lotte Lublin, Donna Motsinger, Rebecca Lynn Neal, Linda Brown, Cindra Ladd and a woman who identified herself only as Kacey \u2014 have previously come forward to publicly detail their allegations, and their identities are clear from the information made public in the court filing.One woman, Ms. Serignese, says Mr. Cosby assaulted her in 1975 or 1976 when she was 18 or 19 after they met in a hotel gift shop and he invited her to a show and gave her pills.Another, Ms. Motsinger, has accused Mr. Cosby of assaulting her in 1972, a time when she was working at a restaurant in Sausalito, Calif. He took her to one of his shows but then assaulted her after giving her wine and a pill, she said.Over the course of four days in 2005 and 2006, Bill Cosby answered questions posed to him by a lawyer for a woman who said Mr. Cosby had drugged and molested her.Ms. Motsinger, now 75, said she could not discuss why she agreed to testify but said of the trial, \u201cIt\u2019s one step closer to justice.\u201dWhile most of the women who have agreed to testify had once been public with their identities and accusations, even going so far as to participate in news conferences, they did not want to comment further at this point.Patricia Leary Steuer, 60, who has accused Mr. Cosby of drugging and assaulting her but is not among the 13 women, said, \u201cNone of us want to jeopardize the outcome of the trial by speaking in a way that would make the prosecutor\u2019s job more difficult.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe\u2019re all voluntarily being very quiet.\u201dTwo of the 13 women, a former flight attendant and a woman identified in court papers as having worked at the Playboy Club in New York, do not appear to have ever come forward publicly.Efforts by prosecutors to introduce \u201cprior bad acts\u201d evidence are limited, said Lynne M. Abraham, a former Philadelphia district attorney and judge, because they can backfire. Even in cases in which defendants are convicted, there is the chance the decision will be overturned on appeal when a higher court rules that including other, prior evidence was, in fact, prejudicial.That happened in a recent case involving a senior official in the Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia who was convicted on charges related to failing to stop child sexual abuse by some priests. Prosecutors introduced historical evidence, but appellate courts later decided that the evidence had impaired the jury\u2019s ability to deliver a fair verdict.\u201cIt is sometimes successful, and sometimes it falls flat on its face,\u201d Ms. Abraham said.Mr. Cosby\u2019s lawyers say they will show that the women\u2019s testimonies fail to meet the criteria for inclusion, because, they say, for example, the accusations are decades old or uncorroborated.Isabelle A. Kirshner, a criminal defense lawyer in New York, said a judge would also have to take into account the time and resources involved in cross-examining so many accusers. \u201cHe will ask, \u2018Do we really want to have in effect 13 separate trials?\u2019\u201d she said.Detectives who reopened the investigation into Ms. Constand\u2019s allegations last year interviewed nearly 50 women who brought accusations against Mr. Cosby, according to court documents. Kevin R. Steele, the Montgomery County district attorney, chose to offer the testimony of just 13 in the interests of \u201cjudicial economy,\u201d the documents say.One of the 13 is a former masseuse; another was a cocktail waitress. Some were models and aspiring actresses. According to prosecutors, the women often met Mr. Cosby through their work, and he would win their trust with career advice, or invitations to dinner \u2014 as, they say, happened in Ms. Constand\u2019s case.At least nine of the 13 women are white, and Mr. Cosby\u2019s legal team has complained that the prosecution is tainted by racial bias. A statement from his team this month took particular issue with Gloria Allred, a feminist lawyer with a knack for drawing media attention, who presided at news conferences in which many women aired their accusations against Mr. Cosby. Ms. Allred had at one time represented at least seven of the 13 women planning to testify.\u201cShe calls herself a civil rights attorney, but her campaign against Mr. Cosby builds on racial bias and prejudice,\u201d the statement said.Ms. Allred responded with her own statement: \u201cThis is not an issue of racial bias. Instead, it is an issue of whether or not Mr. Cosby has committed acts of gender sexual violence.\u201dJoseph Cammarata, a lawyer for Ms. Serignese, said any effort to undermine the prosecution\u2019s case by focusing on race or attacking the characters of the women would be quickly overshadowed by the facts.\u201cThere is a certain pattern here: It is very compelling and powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, did it happen, or did this not happen?\u201dSusan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Cuomo Aides Charged in Federal Corruption Inquiry", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal corruption charges were announced on Thursday against two former close aides to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a senior state official and six other people, in a blow to the governor\u2019s innermost circle and a repudiation of the way his prized upstate economic development programs were managed.The charges against the former aides, Joseph Percoco and Todd R. Howe, and the state official, Alain Kaloyeros, were the culmination of a long-running federal investigation into the Cuomo administration\u2019s efforts to lure jobs and businesses to upstate New York\u2019s limping economy by furnishing billions of dollars in state funds to developers from Buffalo to Albany.The charges mark the second major inquiry of the Cuomo administration by the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan; eight months ago, after investigating Mr. Cuomo\u2019s handling of an anticorruption panel that he had created and abruptly shut down, Mr. Bharara said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to prove a federal crime.\u201dAt a news conference at which he announced the charges, Mr. Bharara was asked if he would essentially give Mr. Cuomo a \u201cclean bill of health\u201d again.\u201cThere are no allegations of any wrongdoing or misconduct by the governor, anywhere in this complaint,\u201d Mr. Bharara replied. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201dIf the charges did not hit Mr. Cuomo directly, they did hit him in a peripheral and personal manner: Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe were both loyalists of Mr. Cuomo and his father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, for whom they had also worked. Andrew Cuomo once referred to Mr. Percoco as \u201cmy father\u2019s third son, who I sometimes think he loved the most.\u201dMr. Cuomo had also spoken highly of Dr. Kaloyeros, depicting him as a visionary in the field of nanotechnology, which Mr. Cuomo has heralded as a potential boon for the state economy.The resulting investigation yielded a rich narrative of three trusted counselors to Mr. Cuomo conspiring to help the favored contractors, rigging bids and doling out other favorable treatment. The complaint also portrayed the defendants as trying to conceal the schemes, sometimes in unusual ways.In emails and other correspondence, Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe referred to bribe money as \u201cziti,\u201d a term used in \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d the complaint says. Mr. Percoco, Mr. Howe and others also called one another \u201cHerb\u201d as a term of endearment, while discussing the arrangement.Mr. Bharara said at a news conference on Thursday that he hoped the case would go to trial \u201cso that all New Yorkers can see, in gory detail, what their state government has been up to.\u201dMr. Percoco, who had served as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315,000 in bribes. In addition, corruption charges were announced against another former aide, a senior state official and six other people.Mr. Percoco, who had served as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315,000 in bribes from 2012 to 2016 from two companies: Competitive Power Ventures, an energy company that was seeking state approval to build a power plant in the Hudson Valley, and COR Development, a major developer in the Syracuse area that ended up with several large state-funded economic development projects.In one instance cited in the complaint, prosecutors say Mr. Howe sent an email to Dr. Kaloyeros saying he had \u201cvitals for Buffalo and Syracuse friends.\u201d He was working with a prominent corporate donor, LPCiminelli, a builder based in Buffalo, to create a request for proposals that effectively made LPCiminelli the only eligible bidder.Neither the energy company nor the developers in Buffalo and Syracuse are named in the complaint, but several defendants charged are among the companies\u2019 top officials.They include Peter Galbraith Kelly Jr., who oversaw lobbying and public relations for Competitive Power Ventures, which is based in Maryland and Massachusetts; Steven Aiello, the president of COR Development; and Joseph Gerardi, another executive at COR. The complaint also charges Louis Ciminelli, the founder of LPCiminelli; and Michael Laipple and Kevin Schuler, two other LPCiminelli executives.Mr. Kelly is accused of offering and paying Mr. Percoco more than $287,000 in bribes in exchange for Mr. Percoco\u2019s help. The payments were made to Lisa Toscano-Percoco, Mr. Percoco\u2019s wife, who was ostensibly employed as a consultant to Competitive Power Ventures\u2019s educational outreach arm starting in 2012.Competitive Power Ventures wanted Mr. Percoco\u2019s help obtaining a state contract worth approximately $100 million to finance its power plant in the Hudson Valley, as well as millions of dollars in energy credits for a power plant it was building in New Jersey.The COR executives, Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi, were accused of giving Mr. Percoco about $35,000 in bribes to use his position in the governor\u2019s office to promote the company\u2019s economic development projects.According to the complaint, they sought Mr. Percoco\u2019s help in reversing a decision by the state\u2019s economic development agency that would have forced COR \u2014 Mr. Cuomo\u2019s largest donor in central New York \u2014 to make an expensive labor peace agreement; pushing the state to release payments that it owed to COR; and getting a $5,000 raise for Mr. Aiello\u2019s son, who worked for Mr. Percoco at the governor\u2019s office.The charges in the complaint included bribery, extortion under color of official right, and wire fraud and honest services fraud conspiracies.\u201cMr. Percoco performed services honestly and within the bounds of the law at all times,\u201d Mr. Bohrer said.A lawyer for Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi declined to comment. Mr. Kelly\u2019s lawyer, Daniel M. Gitner, said his client was innocent and \u201cwill be exonerated.\u201d LPCiminelli, citing its three executives named in the complaint, said it was \u201cconfident that all company officials acted appropriately and legally\u201d and would be vindicated.Virtually all the state-funded projects were shaped under the umbrella of the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute and its subsidiaries. The institute is headed by Dr. Kaloyeros, a physicist who has become something of an economic development guru in Albany.Dr. Kaloyeros had been given free rein by Mr. Cuomo to conceive of high-tech economic development projects that could create jobs across the state.Michael C. Miller, a lawyer for Dr. Kaloyeros, said his client was innocent and \u201clooks forward to being exonerated.\u201dDr. Kaloyeros also was hit with separate charges on Thursday filed by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. Dr. Kaloyeros and Joseph Nicolla of Columbia Development, an Albany-area firm, were accused of colluding to make sure Columbia was awarded contracts to build multiple SUNY Polytechnic projects.Mr. Cuomo said Dr. Kaloyeros had been suspended without pay.When news of the investigation into the governor\u2019s former aides broke in April, his office quickly cut ties to both men and ordered its own internal investigation. The results of that inquiry have not been released.Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Thursday that if the allegations were true, he would be \u201csaddened and profoundly disappointed.\u201d\u201cI hold my administration to the highest level of integrity. I have zero tolerance for abuse of the public trust from anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, a friend should be held to an even higher standard.\u201dJesse McKinley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But their records in government have been mixed at best, or, in the case of Zimbabwe, deeply tarnished.\u201cWe\u2019re in the lingering days of these liberation movements,\u201d said Roger Southall, a professor emeritus at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and an expert on liberation movements. \u201cThey\u2019re not suddenly going to lose power,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ll go on organizationally. But they\u2019ve certainly lost their shine, the hopes that they were embodied with, and, in South Africa, that process has been hugely accelerated by the Zuma presidency.\u201dMany African nations gained their independence in the 1960s after former colonial rulers withdrew from the continent. But the liberation movements took up armed struggle against colonial powers or white settlers, in that way gaining greater moral authority. In the constellation of liberation movements, none shone brighter than the A.N.C. and its most famous leader, Nelson Mandela.To liberation movement leaders like Mr. Zuma, who said last year that the A.N.C. \u201ccomes first,\u201d even before the nation, nothing remains more vital than the movement. Many leaders have described their movement in religious terms, including Mr. Zuma, who until last month often said that the A.N.C. would rule \u201cuntil Jesus comes.\u201dThe qualities that were prized in liberation leaders and movements have often proved detrimental in government.\u201cThe A.N.C. is now being forced to change into a political party,\u201d said Rekgotsofetse Chikane, a university student leader and A.N.C. member who is the son of a famous party leader, the Rev. Frank Chikane. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a political party in name, it is still a liberation movement through its actions \u2014 the way it thinks about how it\u2019s going to deliver services, the way it builds its rhetoric and the way it defends itself.\u201dBecause of its past as a liberation movement, the younger Mr. Chikane said, the A.N.C. practices a \u201ccentralized democracy\u201d in which leaders simply give commands and are not used to a give-and-take with other party members or with voters.Given the strength of South Africa\u2019s democratic institutions compared with those of its neighbors in the region, Mr. Chikane said he was optimistic that the party would successfully transform itself. But he said it would be an arduous process because many in the party, shocked by last month\u2019s elections, were focused simply on retaining power through two more presidential elections, or through 2024.\u201cThose who\u2019ve been pillaging the state in one way or another will pillage as much as possible until the last possible moment, so that when the game is over, they will be set for the rest of their lives,\u201d Mr. Chikane said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see with parastatals,\u201d he added, referring to state enterprises.Zimbabwe\u2019s economy is in free fall; government workers, who make up most of the 10 percent of Zimbabweans fortunate enough to be employed in the formal sector, are being paid weeks late because of the government\u2019s severe cash shortage.In turn, Ms. Mujuru and her allies have said that Mr. Mugabe \u2014 an intellectual who was imprisoned for years before becoming one of the liberation movement\u2019s political leaders \u2014 was not a war veteran. He did not see combat, they said, and did not even have a nom de guerre.Ms. Dongo, who also fought during the war of liberation and was known as Tichaona Muhondo, or We Shall See in the War, led the latest riposte against Mr. Mugabe and his liberation credentials.The back-and-forth has reinforced the popular impression that the country\u2019s politicians make up a class out of touch with the nation\u2019s problems.\u201cPeople are concerned about the bread-and-butter issues of this country and not how this and that became a hero or turned into a villain,\u201d said Richmond Gumbo, a student who was reading newspapers in the library of the University of Zimbabwe in Harare recently.He added, \u201cLeaders need to bow down to the needs, the basic needs of the people, and not to brag about how they fought in the liberation war over 36 years ago.\u201dJeffrey Moyo contributed reporting from Harare, Zimbabwe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Outlines Vision of More Job Opportunities for People With Disabilities", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Of all the attacks that Hillary Clinton and her fellow Democrats have tried against Donald J. Trump since he captured the Republican presidential nomination, one has stood out for its emotional force and persuasive power: No one, it seems, can abide Mr. Trump\u2019s mockery last year of a reporter\u2019s physical disability.And as Mrs. Clinton strains to make a more affirmative case for her own candidacy, after a summer focused largely on hammering Mr. Trump, her campaign believes that a focus on an often-overlooked constituency \u2014 voters with disabilities \u2014 can accomplish both goals at once.On Wednesday, without mentioning the Trump episode, Mrs. Clinton discussed her vision for an \u201cinclusive economy\u201d with expanded job opportunities for what she called \u201ca group of Americans who are, too often, invisible, overlooked and undervalued \u2014 who have so much to offer, but are given far too few chances to prove it.\u201cThat\u2019s been true for a long time,\u201d she said, \u201cand we have to change it.\u201d\u201cWhether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country,\u201d she said in a gymnasium at a youth center here.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign plainly views the contrast as critical to its strategy for the remainder of the race, including the highly anticipated first debate with Mr. Trump on Monday. Mrs. Clinton has said often that she can handle the personal insults from him, but that what gets her piqued are attacks on groups that Mr. Trump has appeared to bully.And she is in good company. \u201cMaking fun of that reporter was just not only in bad taste, it just demonstrated the character of him,\u201d said Christine Griffin, a lawyer and disability policy advocate in Boston. \u201cThe disability community is very upset by that, but if you look at the poll numbers, so is the rest of society.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s team did not entirely hold its fire on Wednesday. Hours after she left the stage, her campaign held a conference call in which supporters condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s mocking of Mr. Kovaleski. \u201cYou\u2019d have to go back 50 years or more to find someone who would actually think that way,\u201d said Tom Harkin, the former Iowa senator who introduced the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.The campaign also featured the infamous clip of Mr. Trump in a new ad starring Anastasia Somoza, a disability rights advocate who was born with cerebral palsy and has known Mrs. Clinton since she was 9.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person with a disability on the planet who has never been made fun of,\u201d said Ms. Mizrahi, who has dyslexia and is raising a child with physical disabilities. \u201cEvery person with a disability knows what it\u2019s like to live with stigma.\u201dMs. Mizrahi also lamented that Mr. Trump had often \u201cconflated the word \u2018stupid\u2019 with the word \u2018loser,\u2019 \u201d as she put it, warning that such thinking could hinder the job prospects of people with intellectual disabilities.On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton did not go there, infusing her half-hour address with the earnest zeal that she tends to summon more readily during policy speeches than in campaign rallies.She ticked off statistics, noting that nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability, and strayed from her prepared remarks \u2014 \u201cI want you to hear this because this is not well known,\u201d she interjected at one point \u2014 to urge people to listen.She spoke of her own policy agenda for people with disabilities, which includes a program aimed at helping people with autism and a pledge to eliminate the \u201csubminimum wage\u201d paid to some people with disabilities, which she called \u201ca vestige from an ugly, ignorant past.\u201dAnd she described what she viewed as the \u201cultimate test\u201d of a society: \u201chow we treat our fellow human beings, especially the most vulnerable among us.\u201dThe closest she came to mentioning Mr. Trump was at the end, when she repeated a common campaign refrain: \u201cLove trumps hate.\u201dUntil then, Mrs. Clinton seems likely to return to the theme often. Some of her most affecting moments on the campaign trail have come when people have approached her on rope lines or during round-table discussions about their struggles caring for disabled family members, and she has often turned to the subject spontaneously.The crowd on Wednesday appeared grateful for the consistent attention.In lieu of a sign, Geannie Bastian, 35, who uses a wheelchair, held up her college degree, saying it represented Mrs. Clinton\u2019s commitment to improving educational opportunities for disabled people.She said Mrs. Clinton was wise not to discuss Mr. Trump in the room. Everyone, she said, knew his record well.\u201cI know what that gesture is,\u201d she said, recalling Mr. Trump\u2019s imitation of Mr. Kovaleski. \u201cI\u2019ve had kids do this my entire life.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer reported from Orlando, and Amy Chozick from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Spicy Spoils of China\u2019s Boom, at Hao Noodle and Tea", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In the hedonist\u2019s view of American immigration patterns, bad times for chefs in China are good times for dumpling chasers and noodle hunters in New York. When experienced cooks couldn\u2019t make a living there for political or economic reasons, they came here. Conversely, over the last decade or so, the hypertrophic Chinese economy has left the kitchens of our Chinatowns somewhat flattened, with fewer high peaks of talent standing out in the landscape.The traditions invoked by the menu come mainly from Beijing, Shanghai and Ms. Zhu\u2019s hometown, Chongqing. The interpretations are contemporary. The portions are generally bigger than a street snack but smaller than one of those platters that descends with a thunk on the Lazy Susans of Chinatown. The food is sometimes arranged with an attention to negative space that can make you wish you saw less plate and more food. Balancing any spareness, though, are the spicy intensity of some dishes and the stripped-down purity of others.The chefs are virtuosic fryers, able to express many nuances in the simple language of crust. The coating on the fish fritters is almost as soft as cake crumbs, a pale gold tinted green by seaweed powder. It\u2019s a subtle partner for the delicate fish inside.Crispy shrimp saut\u00e9 has a more rugged crunch, almost in fried chicken territory, with dark, thrilling slips of dried chiles clinging to it. Between the two extremes are the wonderful cubes of creamy tofu inside a crisp and ultrathin shell; they\u2019re like mozzarella sticks refined to the nth degree.Everything on the menu\u2019s many pages gets a color photo, and it all looks good. Mostly, it is. Lunch or dinner might start with chilled appetizers like the fresh and tender clams in a stack of quietly seasoned Chinese chives; or the juicy smoked sole, marinated in sweet soy sauce. Both were exceptional. So was the chilled salad of poached grape tomatoes. Fizzy on the inside and infused with plum syrup, they were a quick respite from the weather on a muggy summer day.Cold sliced beef shank, a Sichuan notion, pulled its punches on the night I tried it. But other cold appetizers from that region, like the translucent logs of mung bean jelly stacked up under a chile and fermented black bean sauce, landed all the expected body blows and uppercuts. There are excellent wood ear mushrooms, floppy and crisp at the same time in their dressing of vinegar and a dose of chile oil that will sneak up on the unwary.The more familiar dishes are some of the least interesting. Sweet and sour pork with pineapple was less sugary than usual, but I still left it alone. Seafood pancakes are tough and oily triangles that lack the tender layering that makes scallion pancakes so appealing. Something called rainbow salad is a plate of quinoa and carrots that you\u2019d be happy enough to find at the company cafeteria.All danger of dullness is obliterated, though, when Madam Zhu\u2019s Spicy Fish Stew shows up. It\u2019s a Sichuanese inspiration, with a flaky fish in a lightly sour green broth so packed with fresh chiles that it brought all conversation, not to mention rational thought, to a standstill.The noodles and dumplings are toward the back of the menu, and tend to arrive near the meal\u2019s end. The bacon sticky rice shumai, sheer wrappers that barely contain their stuffing, have instantly entered New York\u2019s gallery of great dim sum. Everybody at my table marveled, too, at the half-moons called clay pot dumplings: These tender wrappers of cooked egg folded over pork and water chestnuts are something like omelets crossed with pierogies that moved into a bowl of soup.The only part of the menu I found unreliable was, oddly enough, the noodles. On a night when the restaurant was at full capacity, the Taiwanese pork noodles were monotonously sweet, and the dan dan noodles were an unfocused blur. But they and other dishes \u2014 there\u2019s a fascinating and novel bowl of fresh tomato soup with ragged hand-pulled flat noodles and gingery pork meatballs \u2014 were excellent on slower days. I wondered if the kitchen had simply been moving too quickly.To gloss one of the eight words in the restaurant\u2019s name: The tea is very good. There is delicate silver needle and white peony, pungently herbal green tea grown at high elevations, and a fine aged oolong, among others. The servers never seem to suggest tea, but once you order it they do remember to refresh your pot with hot water until the leaves have given all they\u2019ve got.Even the people at my table who are normally unmoved by Chinese sweets were impressed by the desserts. Slippery, cool taro soup was soothingly bland, which is no put-down. The rosewater jelly was the real surprise, broken into shards as sparklingly clear as cold vodka.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

Art galleries and book shops, once signposts of a city\u2019s cultural exuberance, have disappeared. Even Starbucks has closed one of its cafes.\u201cThe situation is terrible, and it\u2019s been bad for a while,\u201d said Mehmet Emin, 44, who works at a hotel cafe off Istiklal and owns a luggage store on it. \u201cThis is the economic heart of the city. For years, shops opened and business was good.\u201d\u201cPeople are very much on edge,\u201d said Mesut Arici, 27, who works at a shoe store near where that bombing occurred. \u201cI\u2019m very worried and on edge, but what can we do? Life has to go on.\u201dThe elements of Istiklal\u2019s decline were evident well before the recent downturn. For years, the city\u2019s intelligentsia bemoaned the changes taking place not just on the street, but in the entire neighborhood, called Beyoglu. Once a cosmopolitan place of old cinemas, bookshops, outdoor cafes and dive bars, it had evolved under the Islamist government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan into a tacky urban space dominated by chain stores and faux-Ottoman shopping malls.The government, Ms. Yapici noted, has removed the protected status of some historical buildings to make way for new ones. It also changed the law to allow longtime tenants, whose rents had been below market rates, to be evicted. These tides claimed one of the most famous places on the street, an old corset shop.What replaced the old hangouts were chain stores, fast-food restaurants, fancy cafes and shopping malls, all of which are now feeling the effects of a declining economy brought on by a fall in tourism.Critics say that the government, in pursuing an Islamist agenda, also made it more difficult for bars and restaurants to obtain liquor licenses and \u2014 most troubling for many of Istanbul\u2019s liberal elites \u2014 ordered cafes in some areas to stop setting up tables on the streets.\u201cErdogan killed that street,\u201d said Ergun Cagatay, 80, a photographer who for decades has captured the city with his camera, standing in one of Beyoglu\u2019s back streets that was once a popular outdoor space. Asked why the president would do such a thing, he said it was because, as an Islamist, Mr. Erdogan has an \u201callergy for drinking.\u201dOf course, Turkey is a deeply religious country and many Turks are happy that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government cleaned up some of the seedy places of Beyoglu.\u201cThere used to be some very disgusting places, with prostitutes near mosques,\u201d said Rahzim Akcan, who runs one of the oldest restaurants in the neighborhood, Haci Abdullah Saray, which opened in 1888.But at lunchtime on a recent day, the dining room was empty. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no tourists. Maybe only a few Arabs.\u201dCuneyt Celil Can, whose family owns several buildings on Istiklal, said the loss of the outdoor cafes had sent people elsewhere, \u201cwhere they can smoke, drink and eat freely.\u201d For the first time in 35 years of owning property on Istiklal, he said, he has an entire building vacant, because a law firm left after the bombing.In the heart of European Istanbul, Istiklal \u2014 which means independence in Turkish \u2014 was once called the Grande Rue, modeled on the wide boulevards of other European cities. From the late Ottoman Empire until the 1930s, it was more common to hear French spoken there than Turkish, as the area was mainly for foreigners and Muslim Turks were a minority there.European powers built their embassies and churches there during the Ottoman Empire, and the avenue has long been the anchor of a section of the city with a European flair that sets it apart from the centuries-old mosques and wooden houses in the old city, just across the Golden Horn waterway.Back then, residents called the area \u201clittle Paris\u201d or, less optimistically, a \u201csecond-class Paris,\u201d said Brendan Freely, a historian and longtime chronicler of Istanbul life who has written a book about the neighborhood with his father, John.For Istiklal\u2019s old-timers there is, always, the allure of nostalgia for a time when no one would think of stepping onto Istiklal without being dressed in their finest, men in suits and women in dresses and hats.\u201cEveryone used to come here and shop,\u201d said Ali Ihsan Batur, who runs a tiny chocolate shop on Istiklal that has been in his family for 99 years. \u201cIf they heard about a new perfume in Paris, they would come here to try it.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou would have a bar next to a synagogue. And there were lots of cinemas.\u201dNowadays, with so many Syrian refugees in the city, and Arab tourists seeming to outnumber Europeans, Arabic signs have gone up at cafes and shops off Istiklal, and narghile cafes \u2014 where patrons smoke flavored tobacco out of water pipes \u2014 have proliferated.Sinan Sokmen, who runs a tour guide business in Istanbul and lives in Beyoglu, lamented that one of his favorite restaurants, which had a coat check and required a reservation, is now a narghile cafe.At one end of Istiklal, near Taksim Square and next to the French Cultural Center, Ahmet Aslan has a red cart from which he sells simit, a standard Turkish street delicacy that is a cross between a pretzel and a bagel, covered in sesame seeds.In recent years, he said, \u201cit was packed. You couldn\u2019t even stand without people brushing up against you.\u201d Back then he sold up to 600 simit a day, but now only 100 or so.Waving a hand, he said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s empty.\u201dCeylan Yeginsu and Safak Timur contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.P.O. for Postal Savings Bank of China Gets Help From Beijing", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s biggest banks are struggling with a slowing economy, rising bad debts and shrinking profits.So to raise more than $7 billion in the world\u2019s largest new share sale in two years, a stodgy Chinese bank has sought a little help from its friends.But only a fraction of those shares will be held by nongovernment investors, as Chinese state-run companies have already pledged to buy up most of them.The big I.P.O. is shining a light on the practice, called cornerstone investing, of inviting big investors to buy up large chunks of shares before a company goes public. Though it is less common in other markets, it has been increasingly used by Chinese state firms going public in Hong Kong, where government-controlled companies purchase growing numbers of shares to ensure a smooth offering.Banks tend to go along with the practice because it helps get deals done, but it has come under criticism in the past because it can give plugged-in investors preferential access to new offerings.Postal Savings Bank declined to comment.On the face of it, the I.P.O. recalls a period a decade ago, when an initial wave of offerings by China\u2019s biggest state banks on overseas stock markets resulted in megalistings attracting eager investors among foreign funds and Wall Street banks.Optimism about China\u2019s banks soared with the country\u2019s double-digit economic growth rates, and lenders like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and the Bank of China surpassed traditional names like Citigroup and Bank of America to become the biggest banks in the world by market value.That enthusiasm has been replaced by an increasing wariness of problems with China\u2019s traditional growth model, which relied heavily on state-directed investment to support economic growth. That led to mountains of debt and rampant industrial overcapacity in areas like mining, steel making and other manufacturing businesses.Shares in China\u2019s big banks now trade at less than the reported value of their assets \u2014 a signal that investors do not believe the banks\u2019 books or that they expect more problem loans will crop up.With Postal Savings Bank, more than 75 percent of the shares in the bank\u2019s I.P.O. were presold to so-called cornerstone investors, big buyers that get priority by promising not to sell their stakes for six months. All six cornerstone investors in the deal are entities affiliated with the Chinese government.That state support included about $2 billion from China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation and investments from Shanghai\u2019s main port operator, a regional airline operator and the country\u2019s main power grid company.The postal bank I.P.O. comes amid a relative lull in big listings in Hong Kong. And the deals that have gone through have increasingly relied on cornerstones \u2014 a sign that underlying demand from retail or small investors may be lackluster.For example, cornerstone investors accounted for nearly 80 percent of the shares offered in the June listing of CDB Leasing, a state-backed aircraft leasing company. Last month, Everbright Securities, a state-controlled brokerage, sold nearly 70 percent of its I.P.O. to cornerstones.Last year, cornerstone investors accounted for a record 41 percent of all I.P.O.s in Hong Kong, according to figures from Dealogic, a financial data provider. The previous high was 36 percent in 2012, a difficult year for new listings.Cornerstones last year bought almost $14 billion worth of the $33.6 billion in shares sold through 49 new listings in the city, according to Dealogic.The growing influence of cornerstones in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny, but so far regulators and lawmakers have taken a relatively hands-off approach.\u201cOne undesirable side effect of I.P.O. cornerstone investment is that it takes the pricing process further away from the normal market forces and may have a distortive effect on the company\u2019s market value,\u201d the council wrote in its recommendations.To date, Hong Kong regulators have not moved to limit cornerstone investing. A spokesman for the stock exchange said on Wednesday that it had researched the issue and \u201cfound no conclusive evidence that cornerstone investments narrow the shareholder base.\u201d He added that after last year\u2019s review, the listing committee \u201cdecided that no additional regulation is warranted at this stage.\u201dPostal Savings Bank agreed to sell 12.1 billion shares at 4.76 Hong Kong dollars each, near the bottom of the market range. The offering was helped along by an unusually high number of underwriters \u2014 26 banks in total worked on the deal.Emily Feng contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Next President Can Stop North Korea", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s been a banner year for North Korea. The government in Pyongyang has already conducted 17 missile tests and two nuclear tests, including the most recent nuclear explosion on Friday. And there are still three and a half months left in 2016.Satellite photos of North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site indicate that at least three more tests are possible at a moment\u2019s notice. Since North Koreans often celebrate important dates with spectacular shows, the approaching 10th anniversary of its first nuclear detonation on Oct. 9 might be the perfect occasion.Even more alarming is that at this rate, Pyongyang may be able to deploy more powerful nuclear weapons and more dangerous delivery systems more quickly than previously expected. Last year, researchers at the institute where I work concluded that by 2020 North Korea could field an intercontinental ballistic missile able to reach the United States. But if Pyongyang tests the missile that has appeared in recent military parades, it could be sooner. The simple hydrogen bomb the North Koreans were expected to have by 2020 now may be ready and mounted on a missile earlier.All of this bad news should, just in time for a new presidential administration, put to rest the misconceptions that have driven the United States\u2019 failed North Korea policy, especially the idea that China, Pyongyang\u2019s closest ally, will solve the problem.Beijing would certainly prefer that Kim Jong-un give up his nuclear weapons. And the Chinese do occasionally use their economic ties with North Korea to pressure Pyongyang. But China\u2019s overriding priority will continue to be keeping North Korea as a stable buffer against American influence in South Korea. No amount of cajoling from Washington will cause China to squeeze North Korea with enough sanctions that it will give up its weapons or risk the government\u2019s collapse.The next administration must recognize that the United States, not China, is the indispensable nation when it comes to dealing with North Korea. Our allies, who look to us to provide leadership, already know this. So do the Chinese, who insist that only Washington can persuade the North Koreans to stop their bad behavior. North Korean officials have even told me in private that it is true for them, too.If a new administration understands that the United States must take the lead, it can use the substantial diplomatic, military and economic power at its disposal to manage and potentially resolve this challenge. At the core will be a willingness to take all necessary steps to protect our allies, even measures that can anger China, like the recent decision to deploy advanced missile defenses in South Korea. A new administration should also seek to tighten sanctions, just as the Obama administration is doing, recognizing that, because of China\u2019s enduring support for the government in Pyongyang, sanctions will always fall far short of pressuring North Korea the same way they did Iran.A successful strategy will have to include a new diplomatic initiative aimed at persuading the North to first stop expanding its arsenal and then to eventually reduce and dismantle its weapons. To persuade the North Koreans to do this, Washington will have to address their security concerns. In the short term, that may mean temporarily suspending or modifying some American-South Korean military exercises. In the longer term, it may mean replacing the armistice in place since the end of the Korean War with a permanent peace agreement.These initiatives will be met with skepticism not only in the United States \u2014 where many people believe that negotiating with North Korea is a waste of time \u2014 but also in Pyongyang. As a North Korean official, who believes a new administration will just tear up previous agreements, said to me earlier this year, \u201cIt\u2019s easier for us to build nuclear weapons than to be involved with you for decades only to have agreements turn into useless scraps of paper.\u201dNevertheless, there are signs that North Korea is interested in dialogue. On July 6, the government issued a pronouncement ostensibly seeking denuclearization talks with the United States, specifically mentioning Kim Jong-un\u2019s name in support of this initiative.One reason North Korea may be motivated to consider denuclearization is economic. Since taking office in 2011, Mr. Kim has been committed to improving his country\u2019s economy. He seems to believe that nuclear weapons would allow even more focus on that objective. Nevertheless, he has deliberately left room to ease off the nuclear track and explore a dialogue, perhaps reflecting an understanding that there are limits to what his country\u2019s economy can achieve while it is isolated from the international community. Of course, no one is na\u00efve enough to take these statements at face value. Talks between governments are the only way to know for sure.As the Obama administration winds down, little can be done to change policy at this point. Moreover, the North Koreans are unlikely to be responsive to new initiatives since they know that the next American administration will have its own approach.

{"Headline": "In Afghanistan\u2019s Farm Belt, Women Lead Unions and Find New Status", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShibar JournalSHIBAR, Afghanistan \u2014 In this lush farm belt deep in central Afghanistan, women have been the organizing force behind a new wave of small village farm unions.That seems to have brought some changes. In a reversal of tradition, husbands tend to walk after their wives, trailing a couple of steps behind with rolled-up sleeves and sun-beaten faces. And critically for this impoverished region, the unions have established modest supply chains at the market in the center of Bamian Province. Over just a few years, they have introduced new vegetables to their humble dinner plates.\u201cIn the old days, only potatoes and wheat were grown here,\u201d said Zainab Husseini, a part-time high school biology teacher and the full-time farming union leader in the village of Iraq-ulya. \u201cNow we introduced cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, beans and other vegetables.\u201dThe unions, in updating age-old agricultural traditions, have helped ensure a more reliable and diverse food supply in an often famine-struck region. In the process, the women who run the groups are finding new status and empowerment. They are no longer greeted as the mother of Ahmad or the wife of Mahmoud, but rather \u201cunion leader Gul Bahar\u201d or \u201cdeputy union leader Reza Gul.\u201dThe unions have put the women of Bamian on the front line of a critical struggle: the effort to shape a sustainable Afghan economy, away from dependence on foreign aid. Agriculture must surely be a crucial part of the program if that is to happen.Close to 40 percent of the population remains below the poverty line of $1.35 a day, Afghan officials say. According to the World Bank, more than 80 percent of the Afghan population \u2014 and about 90 percent of the poor \u2014 live in rural communities. Agriculture is therefore central not just to countering widespread malnutrition in remote areas, but also to creating sustainable jobs.Assadullah Zamir, Afghanistan\u2019s minister of agriculture, says one area that requires focus is linking farmers to local and national markets, and helping their crops compete with cheap imports by imposing tariffs on, for example, Pakistani vegetables.\u201cThe production has increased with programs and training, and the market is not enough; it is not sufficient,\u201d Mr. Zamir said.If Afghanistan can better manage its water resources and establish decent connections between farms and markets \u2014 a critical problem in the middle of a war where battles are fought with roadside bombs and security checkpoints \u2014 the agriculture sector could create two million to five million sustainable new jobs, or even double the industry\u2019s percentage of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, according to Afghan officials and economic analysts.But here in remote Bamian, the terrain itself poses a huge challenge to bringing crops to market.To get to Shibar, one must drive from the provincial capital of Bamian for about an hour, up a narrow dirt track carved along the mountains. The car slowly winds its way so high along the mountaintop that the clouds hang nearly at arm\u2019s length. Then, even more slowly, as the path descends in spiraling bends, the car splashes through sudden creeks of snow melt that run through narrow gorges.After the Taliban destroyed giant Buddha statues in 2001, Bamian Province became associated mainly with one thing: potatoes. Lots of potatoes. In 2015, Bamian produced nearly 350,000 tons of potatoes, about 60 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s total consumption, according to the country\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture.But an overabundance of that single product became a headache for farmers in Shibar, leaving them vulnerable to trader exploitation and struggling to meet their own basic food needs for most of the year.During harvest season, the potatoes are sold wholesale at dirt-cheap prices: roughly $150 a ton. The farmers have no way of holding on to the potatoes for the winter months, when wholesale prices double. The approximately 500 cold storage facilities built in Bamian with the help of the Afghan government in recent years are simply not enough. (The smaller facilities hold about 15 tons, and the larger community ones about 60 tons.)That realization forced the Afghan government and its international partners a few years ago to encourage growing new crops, and women like Ms. Husseini took the lead in Shibar.About five years ago, Ms. Husseini tapped into a local women\u2019s rights group she was leading to form small farmers\u2019 unions and seek help from the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture. The ministry, which formally recognized the unions in 2013, provided sample plots where farmers could plant improved seeds and learn new techniques from visiting trainers, like using different plant spacing or drip irrigation systems.\u201cIn the old days, the potatoes were this small,\u201d Ms. Husseini, the union leader in Iraq-ulya, said, picking up a tiny rock. \u201cWhen traders would come, they would set aside half of it as not good. Now they want all of it. Each potato weighs one kilogram on average.\u201dThere are now eight village farmers\u2019 unions in Shibar, each comprising about 30 women. In addition to improving potato production, they have turned to new vegetables and, more recently, even started fruit orchards.In her small vegetable plot, Najia, the deputy union leader in Iraq-ulya, grew lettuce, cabbage and tomatoes last year. The lettuce brought her about $70, the tomatoes about $80 and the cabbage about $40.Najia is also in charge of the unions\u2019 relations with the market in Bamian\u2019s provincial capital, supplying fresh vegetables to six shops that they have established deals with \u2014 a very small market, but a start. Every time other union members have crops to sell, they all bring their produce to Najia, who arranges for a vehicle to take them to the market.But getting to the market is incredibly costly: Renting a small truck to take the goods there on the bumpy, narrow road out of Shibar costs about $20 \u2014 a large sum, considering how little the farmers currently make.The Afghan government, which often uses nongovernmental organizations as implementing partners, prioritizes the extremely poor for many of its agricultural projects. So even a small grant like giving a family a sheep or a cow, as well as teaching them ways to grow and sell their products, makes a big difference.\u201cWhen we go back two years later, for example, each of them have expanded that to at least three or four sheep, or sold some of the sheep to buy a cow,\u201d said Dr. Mariam Habib, who ran one of these small-grant programs in Bamian.With their increased economic activity and their handle of the cash flow, women say they also notice a change in their standing in the community.\u201cEveryone invites me to parties, and they even consult me on matters now,\u201d one gaptoothed older woman, waving her hands, told a visiting delegation of officials recently. She could not be reached for identification afterward.But in Shibar, as they increase production and earn more, some of the female union leaders bemoan a compromise that is forced on them: The new potatoes taste different.\u201cThe new potatoes are now white in the middle and have a great market, but they don\u2019t taste the same,\u201d said Asma, the deputy chief of one union. For her own cooking, she grows the old seeds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Actually, Income in Rural America Is Growing, Too", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic TrendsOne problem, though: The number is wrong. Median household incomes in rural America actually grew 3.4 percent in 2015, according to policy experts who study the census numbers closely.\u201cRural\u201d has a very narrow meaning to the Census Bureau. Here, we\u2019re using the word for what the bureau would term \u201cnonmetropolitan.\u201dBut that report wasn\u2019t devised to provide solid estimates in fine-grained geographic detail. One reason is that the Current Population Survey\u2019s sample is too small for precise geographic estimates. Its sample is 100,000 addresses; the American Community Survey\u2019s sample is 3.5 million. So on balance, the American Community Survey estimates will generally be better for smaller geographic areas than the Current Population Survey. The trade-off is that the C.P.S. asks more in-depth questions regarding income and poverty.In 2014, the C.P.S.\u2019s estimate of rural America was 50 million. After the boundary change in 2015, that number fell to 44 million. \u201cIf rural America were a state, it would be a big state; it is one where exactly where you draw the line matters,\u201d said Arloc Sherman, a co-author of the report. \u201cAnd they really changed the line a lot.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear why the census even included those numbers in the initial big income report in the first place. To be fair to the census researchers, this number was not labeled statistically significant in the report \u2014 meaning that the researchers couldn\u2019t be sure if they were actually detecting a real change in income for rural households in 2015. But this lack of significance turned out to be a detail that few reporters noticed.Perhaps part of the reason the news media didn\u2019t see the problems in the C.P.S.\u2019s number was that the narrative of a divergence between rural and urban America seemed too irresistible. It confirmed suspicions about a link between people\u2019s economic anxieties in rural America and the rise of Donald J. Trump.In many cases, data further complicates our view of the world, making things murkier instead of clearer. By contrast, the sharp differences in rural and urban income growth suggested by the C.P.S. felt like a gift from the statistics gods.But our loss is clearly the American people\u2019s gain, because it shows that the recovery is even more broadly shared than we thought.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why This Economy Needs Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThis year, the media has been focused largely on the election process \u2014 campaign managers, speaking styles, every slip and misstep. That\u2019s been entertaining, but the policy differences between the two sides are much more important, and the most crucial difference may be over economic policy.Donald J. Trump has campaigned very clearly for change \u2014 a policy upheaval to promote faster growth, repair the economic stagnation and end the corrupt pay-to-play system that favors the well heeled. Hillary Clinton has pledged to extend and build on the policies of the Obama administration.There is no doubt who has the better plan. Our economy is growing at only 1.1 percent per year, a fraction of our average rate, and the Congressional Budget Office forecasts just 2 percent annual growth (in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product) for the next 10 years.Yes, we went through a deep recession, but it ended in 2009. The recovery has been the weakest in decades, and the first that has actually pushed median incomes down. Business investment and profits are lower now than a year ago. Counterproductive federal policies squash small businesses with inane regulatory sprawl that affects hiring, taxes, credit and medical care.The result is a stagnant economy that leaves out millions of Americans who would like to work and get ahead, and a devastating report card on the Obama White House.To restart growth, Mr. Trump would immediately lower tax rates, including for middle-income voters, and simplify the tax code. Americans would be able to exempt average child-care expenses from taxes, and Mr. Trump\u2019s administration would eliminate the death tax, which falls especially hard on some small businesses and farmers.To help create a flood of new business investment and jobs, the Trump plan would reduce corporate tax rates to 15 percent while eliminating or capping many tax deductions. This would simplify the tax system, making us much more competitive with countries and a magnet for new jobs.Mrs. Clinton wants to go in the opposite direction, depressing job growth with an uncompetitive corporate tax rate, higher taxes on estates and short-term capital gains, and a 4 percent surtax on the most successful individuals.She insists that the Trump plan will cause a bigger deficit and a recession, but she is basing that on her party\u2019s view that tax rates don\u2019t matter much to growth and investment; Mr. Trump knows they do. The Moody\u2019s study Mrs. Clinton cites so often says Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would cause higher fiscal deficits but would also create faster growth and a surge in new jobs. It assumes that the Fed would raise interest rates to over 6 percent, causing a recession it attributes to Mr. Trump. A much more likely outcome is faster growth without the spike in interest rates or a recession.Mr. Trump agrees with those who are concerned about the national debt. He wants to help the private sector to grow faster and to create a debt limit that would rein in our debt-to-G.D.P. ratio, which has skyrocketed under President Obama.Critics of tax cuts say the government can\u2019t afford his plan. But what the economy can\u2019t afford is the current inept tax system, slow growth and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s $1.1 trillion in tax hikes.Mr. Trump would immediately halt the crush of new federal regulations on business. In 2015 alone, the Obama administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations \u2014 hidden taxes that add a lead weight on our businesses. To grow faster, the economy has to have relief from this central planning and regulatory overreach. And Mr. Trump would seek consumer choice in education and health care and a repeal of Obamacare.The scant economic gains in the past eight years are even weaker for most Americans than the G.D.P. data indicates because federal policy favored gains for the haves, not the have-nots. Your prosperity is increasing if you work in finance, issuing bonds or trading currencies, or you lobby or arrange government contracts. If not, you\u2019ve most likely gone backward financially.Mr. Trump is proposing to overturn that stagnant, corrupt system. An important part of his transformation is a new trade policy that encourages American jobs rather than undercuts them. His position has been demonized by the press as protectionism, but the reality is that our trade system is broken. Bad deals harmed American workers and gave access to United States markets without achieving vital conditions like intellectual property protection in China.The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, grew to 1,700 pages, yet still allowed Mexico to enforce its value-added tax on American products while exporting goods to the United States duty-free. The even more complicated Trans-Pacific Partnership would allow foreign companies to challenge United States laws in an international court, but it would do nothing to guarantee that countries couldn\u2019t use currency manipulation to benefit their exporters over ours.Voters will have an opportunity to decide for or against a government that\u2019s failing on health care, taxes, trade, cost control and regulation. One candidate wants higher tax rates. The other would lower them. One candidate thinks the economic recovery has been successful whereas the other thinks it left millions of Americans out. One candidate has spent her lifetime seeking the presidency. Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t.As Thomas Jefferson said, \u201cA little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.\u201d It\u2019s time for one now.David Malpass is a senior economic adviser to the Trump campaign.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Software Is Booming. But Why Now?", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This is the year artificial intelligence came into its own for mainstream businesses, at least as a marketing feature.Salesforce chose this date to pre-empt Oracle, the world\u2019s largest business software company, which on Sunday evening began its annual customer event in San Francisco. High on Oracle\u2019s list of new features: real-time analysis of enormous amounts of data. Oracle calls its product Oracle A.I.There are big pushes in A.I. in agriculture, manufacturing, aviation and pretty much every other sector of the economy.It\u2019s all very exciting, the way great possibilities are, and clearly full of great buzzwords and slogans. But will other companies see any value in all this or understand if A.I. has value for them?\u201cNo one really knows where the value is,\u201d said Marc Benioff, co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cI think I know \u2014 it\u2019s in helping people do the things that people are good at, and turning more things over to machines.\u201dMr. Benioff wasn\u2019t selling Einstein\u2019s capabilities short. He was talking about the long-term value of artificial intelligence, which is passing through a familiar phase \u2014 a technology that is strange and new, that sometimes overpromises what it can do and is headed for uses not easily seen at the start.Cloaked inside terms like deep learning and machine intelligence, A.I. is essentially a series of advanced statistics-based exercises that review the past to indicate the likely future, or look at current customer choices to figure out where to put more or less energy.Perhaps a better question than \u201cWhat is the value?\u201d of this explosion of advanced statistics is \u201cWhy now?\u201d That shows both the opportunity and why many companies are scared about missing out.Much of today\u2019s A.I. boom goes back to 2006, when Amazon started selling cheap computing over the internet. Those measures built the public clouds of Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, among others. That same year, Google and Yahoo released statistical methods for dealing with the unruly data of human behavior. In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone, a device that began a boom in unruly-data collection everywhere.Suddenly, old A.I. experiments were relevant, and money and cheap data resources were available for building new algorithms. Ten years later, computing is cheaper than ever, companies live online and in their phone apps, and sensors are bringing even more unruly data from more places.Amazon, Google and the rest have exceptional A.I. resources for sale, but many older companies are wary of turning their data over to these upstarts. That, along with fear of a competitor getting on top of A.I. first, is a big motivation for some to try things out.Salesforce is selling Einstein as a system that can work predictive magic without having to look at your data, in what Mr. Benioff calls a \u201cdemocratizing\u201d move that will create millions of A.I. users who are not engineers.He said this on his way to attend a series of customer focus groups around the country, however \u2014 strong evidence that customers don\u2019t get it yet, even if they\u2019re willing to try it.\u201cThere\u2019s fear of Google and Microsoft controlling everything, and there\u2019s a desire to apply A.I. to anything that\u2019s digital,\u201d said Michael Biltz, managing director of Accenture\u2019s technology vision practice. \u201cPeople are going to have to experiment, most likely first on pain points like security and product marketing.\u201dHow will we know when the A.I. revolution has taken hold? A technology truly matures when it disappears. We don\u2019t marvel at houses with electricity now, or the idea of driving to work at 60 miles an hour. We can say \u201cphone\u201d and mean a hand-held computer with NASA-level processing power and a professional-quality camera for taking selfies with our drones.A.I. is probably heading for the same places, invisibly sorting through lots of data everywhere to continuously update and automate most of our lives. Goodness knows what the weird new tech thing will be about at that point.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rebounding Economy Remains Fragile for Many", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The eye-popping improvement in economic fortunes last year raises the question: If incomes are up and poverty is down, why is Donald J. Trump\u2019s message of economic decay resonating so broadly?The answer is in plain sight. While the economy finally is moving in the right direction, the real incomes of most American households still are smaller than in the late 1990s. And large swaths of the country \u2014 rural America, industrial centers in the Rust Belt and Appalachia \u2014 are lagging behind.\u201cWe ain\u2019t feeling too much of all that economic growth that I heard was going on, patting themselves on the back,\u201d said Ralph Kingan, the mayor of Wright, Wyo. \u201cIt ain\u2019t out in the West.\u201dThe recent upswing is real. While economic growth has been modest, the expansion is now in its eighth year. The economy has added millions of jobs and incomes increased last year for households on every rung of the economic ladder. The economic gains have been particularly strong for people who live in the nation\u2019s large metropolitan areas and for those who have college degrees.Yet the repeated assertions by Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, that the middle class is being decimated and the economy is in decline ring true to his supporters. Many Americans, even those who are prospering, remain pessimistic about the fragile recovery. Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival, has been careful to acknowledge the economy\u2019s problems alongside its progress.The economic dislocations of recent decades may be contributing to the polarization of the electorate, according to research by David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By emphasizing the nation\u2019s economic troubles, the candidates are going where the voters are.\u201cThere is this undercurrent of economically driven dissatisfaction that works to the benefit of candidates who are noncentrist, and particularly right-wing candidates,\u201d Mr. Autor said.In Wyoming\u2019s coal-rich Powder River Basin, where mines have laid off hundreds of workers in a wave of bankruptcies, workers scoffed at the reports of rising wages and falling unemployment.Not here, they said.\u201cWe are waiting on the election with high hopes that we do get a Republican in there who does understand about working men and women,\u201d said Mark Perkins, 49, who shut down his electrical storefront in the coal town of Wright earlier this year as he lost once-plentiful jobs servicing mines and large generators.Mr. Perkins said miners and their families had been streaming away from town as the unemployment rate in surrounding Campbell County soared to 7.5 percent in July, from 3.8 percent a year earlier. Families dropped keys on counters and bolted, Mr. Perkins said, leaving quiet streets and a deep resentment at the economic policies supported by President Obama and Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI\u2019m just doing small electrical jobs to dog-paddle my way through till Mr. Trump gets elected,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see very many Hillary \u2014 or Killary as we call her here \u2014 fans. She was so vocal about putting us out of work and putting us down. We\u2019re the scum of the earth.\u201dEven in regions that are prospering, many workers have seen little wage growth in recent years. The rise in median income was driven mostly by increased employment rather than wage gains.Cheri Klug, 56, works as a cashier at a Walmart in southern Minnesota, making almost $12 an hour. Her husband, Dave, 62, draws federal disability benefits.Mr. Klug said life seemed to get a little harder with every passing year.\u201cI see everything increasing except my benefits and my wife\u2019s wages,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton has proposed an increase in the minimum wage to $12 an hour, which would modestly increase the couple\u2019s income, but Mr. Klug said he planned to vote for Mr. Trump. He likes the idea of a businessman in the White House, he said.Moreover, he does not like the idea of a government-imposed pay increase. His wife has spent eight years climbing up to her current pay grade, he said, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair for workers who have just joined Walmart to be lifted to the same level.David Pilot, 56, works as an analyst for a telecommunications firm in Colorado Springs. He said his pay had increased modestly in recent years, by no more than 2 percent a year. Before the recession, he said, he sometimes got 6 percent raises.Mr. Pilot works in the service sector, as most Americans now do, but he said he was voting for Mr. Trump because of his promises to return industrial jobs to America.\u201cI like the fact that he recognizes we are playing on an unlevel field,\u201d Mr. Pilot said. He added that he did not think globalization had done any harm to his own career, but that he knew other people who lost work when companies moved overseas.Polls also show that Americans remain pessimistic about the nation\u2019s economic prospects. They are worried that the floor is going to fall away from under them, just as it did in 2008.Last week, 26 percent of people surveyed in Gallup\u2019s poll of Americans\u2019 confidence in the economy rated current economic conditions as excellent or good, while 30 percent labeled them poor. Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed said their economic outlook was \u201cgetting better\u201d compared with 57 percent who said it was \u201cgetting worse.\u201dSheryl Fetzer, 58, who lives in suburban Columbus, Ohio, said she missed the 1990s.\u201cEverybody was fat in the \u201990s,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody had money. It\u2019s not like that today.\u201dThe gloom is deepest, however, in the regions where the recovery has been weakest.Sara Flynn, 55, says she is lucky to be living in \u201cGod\u2019s country,\u201d otherwise known as Hebron, Ky., but she is still trying to regain her footing since her high-end design business collapsed in 2010 at the height of the recession.She got a job paying $8.25 an hour as a cashier in a big-box store, working her way up to supervisor at nearly double the salary, but she hated it.\u201cOne day I just said \u2018I can\u2019t do this anymore,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Flynn, who quit last year. With a degree in architectural design and drafting and contacts in the business, she quickly moved to another job at a kitchen design store, but got laid off after six months when business fell off. Having learned how to type on an electric typewriter in high school, she is now taking a computer course at the Brighton Family Center, a nonprofit in Newport, Ky.Ms. Flynn has four sons in their 20s. Two graduated from college and two did not.\u201cThe ones with the degrees have really good jobs,\u201d she said. As for two who have high school diplomas, \u201cWell, they\u2019re still living at home.\u201d One is juggling three different restaurant jobs, while the other works at a pizzeria and turned their yard into a makeshift service center where he fixes cars.Ms. Flynn said her parents were \u201cdyed in the wool\u201d Democrats. Her father worked at G.E. for most of his life, designing airplanes, before retiring with a pension, while her mother raised six children.But Ms. Flynn said she planned to vote for Mr. Trump. She said she had liked Mr. Trump ever since watching his television show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and she believes him when he says he can \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a bygone era, that\u2019s when America was great,\u201d Ms. Flynn said of her parent\u2019s generation. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been like that for me.\u201dAn article on Thursday about workers who have been left behind despite the economic recovery misstated in one instance, and in some copies, the surname of a Colorado telecommunications analyst.

Trump tells it, his first solo project as a real estate developer, the conversion of a faded railroad hotel on 42nd Street into the sleek, 30-story Grand Hyatt, was a triumph from the very beginning.But that book, and numerous interviews over the years, make little mention of a crucial factor in getting the hotel built: an extraordinary 40-year tax break that has cost New York City $360 million to date in forgiven, or uncollected, taxes, with four years still to run, on a property that cost only $120 million to build in 1980.The project set the pattern for Mr. Trump\u2019s New York career: He used his father\u2019s, and, later, his own, extensive political connections, and relied on a huge amount of assistance from the government and taxpayers in the form of tax breaks, grants and incentives to benefit the 15 buildings at the core of his Manhattan real estate empire.Since then, Mr. Trump has reaped at least $885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies for luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings in New York, according to city tax, housing and finance records. The subsidies helped him lower his own costs and sell apartments at higher prices because of their reduced taxes.Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has made clear over the course of his campaign how proud he is that \u201cas a businessman I want to pay as little tax as possible.\u201dWhile it is impossible to assess how much Mr. Trump pays in personal or corporate income taxes, because he has refused to release his tax returns, an examination of his record as a New York developer shows how aggressively he has fought to lower the taxes on his projects.Mr. Trump successfully sued the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch after being denied a tax break for Trump Tower, his signature building on Fifth Avenue. Two decades later, in a lawsuit that spanned the administrations of Mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg, he won a similar tax break for Trump World Tower, a building on First Avenue with some of the city\u2019s highest-priced condominiums in 2001.The tax breaks for those two projects alone totaled $157 million.The tax break at the 44-story Trump International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle came to $15.9 million.No possible subsidy was left untapped. After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Mr. Trump lined up a $150,000 grant for one of his buildings near ground zero, taking advantage of a program to help small businesses in the area recover, even though he had acknowledged on the day of the attacks that his building was undamaged.In seeking those subsidies, Mr. Trump is not that different from many other developers. But the level of subsidies he has received along with his doggedness in claiming them seem at odds with his rhetoric as an outsider candidate who boasts of his single-handed success and who has denounced what he calls the pay-to-play culture of politics and a \u201crigged\u201d system of government.Without addressing specific questions about his pursuit of tax breaks and other subsidies, Mr. Trump in a telephone interview defended going after them. \u201cIn many cases, they made the difference between building and not being able to build,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten incentives in other parts of the world as well.\u201dIn the mid-1970s, eager to make his mark in Manhattan, the 30-year-old Mr. Trump focused his attention on the failing Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street, next to Grand Central Terminal. The owner, the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad, was keen to sell.But Mr. Trump insisted that the project was not viable without a tax break from the city.\u201cFred was a big macher in Brooklyn,\u201d said Martin J. McLaughlin, a lobbyist who worked for Donald Trump in the 1990s. \u201cHe had an extremely close relationship with Beame and Carey.\u201dMr. Trump visited a young city official, Michael Bailkin, who devised a plan centered on a 40-year tax abatement, still the longest ever granted by the city, under which the state would own the land beneath the hotel and lease it to the partnership for $1 a year.\u201cI viewed him as another developer, one with limited experience, but coming from a family with a lot of experience,\u201d Mr. Bailkin recalled in an interview.Mr. Trump had one other qualification. \u201cHe did say,\u201d Mr. Bailkin added, \u201cthe administration would support it.\u201dMr. Ravitch said in a recent interview that he responded frankly after Mr. Trump laid out the project: \u201cIt\u2019d be great to have a Hyatt on 42nd Street. I thought it\u2019d be successful. But I don\u2019t think it should be exempt from taxation.\u201dMr. Trump stood up, Mr. Ravitch recalled, \u201cand said, \u2018If you don\u2019t give me an exemption I\u2019ll have you fired.\u2019\u201dMs. Sunshine did not respond to requests for comment.In the end, after phone calls from Mr. Beame and other Democratic politicians, Mr. Ravitch and the agency\u2019s board voted to approve the project, though the partners in the hotel had to pay a modest rent for the land based on a percentage of their profits and allow for subway entrances to be built nearby.Mr. Trump said the decision was made on the merits. \u201cWe were a contributor like many people were contributors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there never was a quid pro quo.\u201dEven before it opened, though, Mr. Trump had infuriated the new mayor, Mr. Koch, by reneging on the promise to allow for access to the subway on the east and west sides of the hotel.Mr. Trump eventually granted the western easement and allowed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build a stairwell, but shed his responsibility for the other entryway.City officials initially estimated that the tax break on the Hyatt was worth $4 million a year to Mr. Trump. But according to a recent analysis conducted by the city\u2019s Finance Department at the request of The New York Times, the actual annual giveaway was far higher: $6.3 million in 1983, rising to $17.8 million in 2016. The combined value of the forgiven taxes is $359.3 million, with four years left on the abatement.Over the same period, the hotel\u2019s owners have paid the city $202.5 million in rent and fees, according to the state agency overseeing the project, Empire State Development.Mr. Trump said the tax break did what it was supposed to do. \u201cThe hotel was a great success for the city,\u201d he said. \u201cIt regenerated interest in that area.\u201dBut early on, the city suspected something was amiss with the rent payments, when the total dropped in 1986, despite rising profits. A 1989 review by Karen Burstein, the city\u2019s auditor general at the time, found that Mr. Trump and Hyatt owed the city $2.9 million for 1986, having used \u201caberrant and distortive\u201d accounting methods to reduce their obligation.\u201cThis was subsidized by city residents,\u201d Ms. Burstein said recently of the tax break. \u201cThe last thing you do is cheat the very people who are your partners.\u201dAfter the city and state demanded payment, the hotel partners sued them in 1990. The suit was settled in 2004. Neither court files nor the city\u2019s Law Department have a copy of the agreement, but a city official who requested anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter, said that the city recouped $850,000.When the Hyatt opened, Mr. Trump was already at work on a second project: Trump Tower, the 58-story, bronze-glass building that would become his home, the headquarters for his company and a tourist attraction.The idea was to raze the Bonwit Teller department store, whose prestigious Fifth Avenue address he described as a \u201cTiffany location.\u201dTo build what he called \u201cthe ultimate vision of an elegant life seen through a golden eye,\u201d Mr. Trump wanted a 10-year property tax break under the city\u2019s 421-a program, which was created in 1971 to stimulate housing construction. As the city\u2019s economy rebounded, 421-a and programs like it were coming under criticism as giveaways to developers.The Koch administration rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s application, saying the project did not qualify because he was replacing a store with hundreds of employees and annual sales of $30 million, rather than an \u201cunderutilized property.\u201dMr. Trump sued the city in 1981. Justice Arnold L. Fein of the Appellate Division ruled in the city\u2019s favor, writing that 421-a \u201chardly contemplates the grant of benefits at the most choice, already adequately utilized location in Manhattan to create residential luxury apartments.\u201dMr. Trump appealed and in 1984, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that the city\u2019s action had \u201cimpermissibly erected a barrier to the benefit,\u201d and Mr. Trump was entitled to the tax abatement.Mr. Trump said at the time that the abatement was worth $7 million to $10 million over 10 years.The Finance Department, however, said in its recent analysis that the value of the benefit totaled $22.5 million. Mr. Trump later got an additional $15 million tax break under a separate program for renovating the tower\u2019s commercial space.Mr. Trump continued to fight the Koch administration\u2019s attempts to restrict the tax breaks or to require developer concessions, such as subsidized apartments, in return. After the administration refused to provide tens of millions of dollars in benefits for another project, on the West Side of Manhattan, Mr. Trump declared: \u201cthe city under Ed Koch is a disaster.\u201dIt is easy to understand why the tax breaks were so important to a developer like Mr. Trump.During a building\u2019s two- to three-year construction phase, when there is no rental or sales money coming in, a 421-a tax abatement can save a developer millions of dollars in taxes, because the property is taxed at the rate in effect before improvements are made. Once a building is completed and its apartments are sold, the benefits accrue to the buyers, significantly lowering taxes and making the apartments more appealing.\u201cIt was a great selling point,\u201d said Charles P. Reiss, a retired executive vice president for development at the Trump Organization. \u201cFor condos, the monthly fee was greatly reduced.\u201dThe benefit declines over time, with the apartment owner paying full taxes after 10 years.After winning the court battle over Trump Tower, Mr. Trump received 421-a tax benefits from the Koch administration worth $20.8 million for his Trump Plaza and Trump Palace projects.During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Mr. Trump built a number of New York projects without taxpayer subsidies. But he continued to chase benefits, large \u2014 and small.For instance, he sought, and received, a tax abatement worth $48,000 for the conversion of a condominium tower called Trump Parc East under Mr. Giuliani.And after the Sept. 11 attacks, he obtained a $150,000 grant for 40 Wall Street, an office tower eight blocks from ground zero, through a small-business recovery program.In the hours after the attacks, Mr. Trump told German television that his property \u201cwasn\u2019t, fortunately, affected by what happened at the World Trade Center.\u201dAt the other end of the spectrum, there was the 10-year tax abatement he got on seven apartment buildings in Trump Place-Riverside South in which he held a partial stake.According to the Finance Department analysis, the city forgave a combined $331.8 million in property taxes on the buildings, which were completed from 1998 to 2005.Under the revised rules governing the 421-a program, Mr. Trump was required to set aside 700 of the 3,494 apartments \u2014 roughly 20 percent \u2014 for low- and moderate-income tenants.Ms. Glen, then an assistant commissioner at the city\u2019s Division of Housing Finance, judged the project ineligible for public benefits.After the city\u2019s court battle with Mr. Trump over Trump Tower, the City Council had passed legislation dictating that 421-a benefits no longer be used to demolish usable buildings at public expense.In a letter to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Ms. Glen said Trump World Tower was to be built on the site of a functioning office building, and denied him the tax break.Mr. Trump sued and a State Supreme Court judge ordered the city to review his application. After that suit stalled, he filed a second one that ended in 2003 with a settlement that granted Mr. Trump a 10-year exemption worth $119.5 million for the 371-unit condo, according to the Finance Department.To meet his obligation to build affordable housing, Mr. Trump paid another developer $9.65 million for 124 units earmarked for low- and moderate-income tenants elsewhere in the city., according to court records. He also had to forego a tax abatement during construction.In 2002, apartments at Trump World Tower sold for an average of $1,046 per square foot, or $1.5 million for a small two-bedroom.\u201cHis whole MO is to exploit the government for everything he could get,\u201d said Jerilyn Perine, the city housing commissioner during the Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations. \u201cIn the end, the letter of the law gave it to him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers Pay More for Health Care as Companies Shift Burden, Survey Finds", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState health insurance exchanges created under the new health care law are in turmoil. By contrast, the employer market \u2014 where the majority of Americans still get their coverage \u2014 seems like a bastion of stability.\u201cWe see historic moderation in premiums and health spending and costs,\u201d said Drew Altman, the chief executive of the Kaiser foundation, a nonprofit in Menlo Park, Calif., that closely tracks the health insurance markets.But underneath some of those figures, some important changes are underway. The biggest shift is that workers continue to pay an ever-greater share of their medical bills, a trend for several years now. That is why Mr. Altman said that despite the overall moderation in costs, \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel that way to average people.\u201dThe latest survey helps shed some light on the quickly evolving insurance industry. Here are a few highlights.Annual family premiums rose an average of 3 percent, about in line with the average increase in workers\u2019 wages, to $18,142 a year, according to Kaiser, which surveyed more than 1,900 employers.This continued a significant slowdown in price increases. In the period since 2011, the premiums for plans covering a family rose 20 percent, compared with 31 percent from 2006 to 2011, and a 63 percent increase from 2001 to 2006.How long will this last? Mr. Altman says he is doubtful that the reprieve from sharply rising costs is permanent and that he thinks rates will go up again, especially if the economy heats up. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re living in a new world,\u201d he said.Exactly why the increases have been so modest in recent years is up for debate. The Obama administration argues that some measures in the federal health care law have helped slow the rise in health care costs. Some other experts tend to point to the lingering effects of a sluggish economy as well as the push by employers to shift more costs onto workers.While employer-sponsored plans typically have much lower deductibles than the most popular plans found on the exchanges, more employees have deductibles, and those deductibles are increasing.Over all, employees have deductibles that are about 50 percent higher than they were five years ago. Four out of five covered employees pay a deductible, which averages about $1,500 each, Kaiser found. Employees who get insurance through a smaller company have deductibles that now average $2,100.Workers are also paying a greater share of the premiums, contributing $5,277 annually toward a family plan, nearly a third of the total cost.The move by employers and insurers to push more health costs onto workers is significant, said Mr. Altman, who describes it as a stealth move to \u201cskimpier insurance.\u201d Proponents of higher cost sharing say that asking people to pay more of their medical bills causes them to be more discriminating about what health care they use.Remember the days of being able to go to any doctor or hospital of your choice? Many employers still choose plans that let workers visit a doctor out of network, although employees are paying increasingly more for the privilege.But more companies are opting for less choice for their employees. This year, slightly fewer than half of workers are enrolled in so-called preferred provider organization plans, or P.P.O.s, compared with 58 percent in 2014. While you pay more when you go outside the plan\u2019s network, you are still covered if you go to a doctor or hospital that does not belong.Employers started turning to these plans in the 1990s, when resistance to health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.s, grew. Employers and insurers tend to favor more restrictive plans because they usually contain costs better.As a result, some employers are dropping P.P.O.s in favor of the more restrictive plans, Mr. Altman said. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to see that reverse,\u201d he said.The trend toward narrower networks is also seen in plans offered on the exchanges, where the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform recently estimated that two-thirds were H.M.O.s offering a sharply limited choice of doctors and hospitals this year.There is also little proof that companies are cutting workers\u2019 hours to avoid the law\u2019s requirement that they offer full-time workers health insurance. Employers with at least 50 full-time workers are required to offer benefits or pay a penalty. More than 90 percent of companies with at least 50 workers are offering coverage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Ugly Campaign, Condensed Into One Debate", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial\u201cDebate\u201d is an iffy word for an exercise in which candidates are prompted by moderators to dole out their stump speeches bit by bit under hot lights while a clock counts the seconds and every quip and jab and stumble is used to keep score and proclaim a \u201cwinner.\u201dBut when just one candidate is serious and the other is a vacuous bully, the term loses all meaning.Monday night\u2019s confrontation between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was a spectacle, for sure: the sheer reality-TV hugeness of it, the Super Bowl audience of tens of millions. \u201cDebate of the Century,\u201d said The Drudge Report. \u201cAmerica on the Brink,\u201d said The Huffington Post. For once, the hype may have been about right, given the tightness of the polls and the nearness of the election.There was a fundamental asymmetry to the exercise, because of the awful truth that one of the participants had nothing truthful to offer. But seeing them on the same stage distilled exactly who they have been throughout this campaign.Standing at the lectern, interrupting and shouting, playing the invisible accordion with his open hands, filibustering, tossing his word salads \u2014 jobs and terrorism and Nafta and China and everything is terrible \u2014 Mr. Trump said a lot. But as the debate wore on, he struggled to contend with an opponent who was much more poised and prepared than any of the Republicans he faced in the primaries.Ninety minutes was never going to be enough time for Mr. Trump to redeem his candidacy, even if by some miracle he had wanted to, if he had suddenly developed a coherent set of policies and principles, an agenda against which Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals could be weighed and reviewed, and a baseline level of decency.The moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, announced the preset themes of \u201cachieving prosperity,\u201d \u201cAmerica\u2019s direction\u201d and \u201csecuring America,\u201d then meekly retreated into silence as Mr. Trump went on the attack, blaming Mrs. Clinton for ISIS and joblessness and globalization, depicting the country as a living hell for black Americans, a land beset by illegal immigrants and gangs with guns, with police officers afraid to stop them. \u201cIt\u2019s all sound bites,\u201d he said at one point, meaning to disparage Mrs. Clinton, but unwittingly describing the emptiness of his own words.Depending on how your lenses are polarized, Mr. Trump met/exceeded/failed to meet expectations, which were low to begin with. He has lied compulsively since he entered the race, and he was caught again on Monday night with his pants on fire (repeating, among other lies, his slander that Mrs. Clinton invented the birther slur against President Obama). But anything short of dropping his pants in the Hofstra University auditorium would still have left him with the support of a large portion of the American electorate.Mrs. Clinton also met/exceeded/failed to meet expectations, which were different for her. She had to have just enough levity, mixed with substance, to be stern but not shrill, funny but not flippant, smart but not pedantic, able to stand up to bullying. On balance, she pulled it off, swatting his attacks aside and confidently delivering her own criticisms from higher, firmer ground.A more appealing and competent set of primary candidates might have stopped this. A responsible Republican Party, mindful of the national interest, not obsessed with thwarting President Obama, might have stopped it. In a better political era, both parties \u2014 not just the Democrats \u2014 would have nominated qualified candidates who could answer Americans\u2019 concerns about terrorism and war, climate and the economy, immigration and racial healing, education and public safety.But not this year. The Republican field was winnowed to the worst of the worst. Which gave the debate its strange, potentially tragic dimension. It\u2019s absurd that the fate of the race, and the future of the nation, might carom this way or that based on a 90-minute television ritual so tainted by falsehoods.Advertisement"}

But in a time of rising nationalism, those who see the upside of globalism have become a distinct \u2014 and often embattled \u2014 tribe.Last week, the globalists had a big family reunion in New York. The gathering was focused on the United Nations General Assembly, but a growing array of side conferences and summits and dinners also attracted concerned internationalists of every stripe: humanitarians, leaders of nongovernmental organizations, donors, investors, app peddlers, celebrities.Again and again, in private conversations and in public forums, the globalists spoke of feeling besieged. Take the valedictory address of former President Bill Clinton, the paterfamilias of the globalist reunion. The Clinton Global Initiative is one of the major factors in helping to transform what had been a week centered on United Nations diplomacy into a broader Davos-on-the-Hudson for international aspirations.Mr. Clinton spoke of the globalist vision of a \u201cnonzero-sum\u201d world in which everyone wins together and of how that idea was under attack by \u201czero-sum\u201d tribal politics.\u201cArgentina has suffered decades of populism,\u201d Mr. Clinton said in welcoming Mr. Macri. Mr. Clinton told Mr. Khan that he was \u201can example of positive interdependence.\u201d But the panel\u2019s insight was limited by the absence of anyone who could explain populist ire with authenticity \u2014 who could explain why, as Mr. Clinton put it, \u201cthe intensity of the feelings of people resisting our being pulled together outweighs the intensity of those who are winning from this.\u201dThe advocates of a more densely enmeshed world seemed caught in a bind. Their project has long been to get people to enlarge the sphere of their worry, to look beyond national boundaries.I asked Mr. Clinton after his conference about the challenge of balancing help for Kenya with care for Kentucky, in an age when Kentucky anger threatens to push the United States toward less engagement in foreign problems.\u201cWhat you call \u2018Kentucky anger\u2019 is being fed in part by the feeling that the most powerful people in the government, economy, and society no longer care about them, or look down on them,\u201d Mr. Clinton responded via email. \u201cThe pain and road rage we see reflected in the election has been building a long time,\u201d he added.\u201cWhen opportunities are increased in one part of the world,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, \u201cthere are often positive effects where you might least expect them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blazes in Southeast Asia May Have Led to Deaths of Over 100,000, Study Says", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe study, led by experts in public health and atmospheric modeling from Harvard and Columbia, estimated that 91,600 people in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia and 2,200 in Singapore may have died prematurely because of exposure to fine particle pollution from burning forests, in particular carbon-rich peatlands.The particles, known as PM 2.5 because they are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller, are also typical in diesel emissions, among other things. When inhaled, they can cause severe health problems, including asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease.The Indonesian government said last year that only 19 people died as a result of the 2015 crisis.The crisis began in August 2015 after fires were deliberately set in the regions of Sumatra and Indonesian Borneo to clear land for palm oil plantations and other agricultural uses. Although the practice has been occurring for decades, an especially long dry season, caused in part by a strong El Ni\u00f1o, resulted in what scientists say were the worst fires and haze ever recorded.Multinational palm oil companies, pulp and paper companies, the smaller plantations that sell to them, traditional farmers and even day laborers were accused of starting the fires.At the height of the crisis, the air quality index in Borneo rose to above 3,000, one of the highest one-day levels ever recorded. A reading above 300 is considered unhealthy to humans. Emissions of greenhouse gases from fires alone on the worst days were higher than daily emissions in the United States, which has a far bigger, industrialized economy.Haze is an annual problem in Indonesia, but the country has faced severe conditions in 2013, 2006 and 1997, which was until last year the worst on record.\u201cThis study is a good wake-up call,\u201d said Herry Purnomo, a scientist at the Center for International Forestry Research, a global scientific organization based in Bogor, Indonesia, near Jakarta, the capital.\u201cWe need to evaluate and verify this on the Indonesian side,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is against the official Indonesian government figure of 43 million Indonesians being exposed to particles from the fire, but only 500,000 suffering minor health problems. That\u2019s now hard to believe.\u201dThe study states that it focused only on adults, so the number of children and infants who might have died or the pregnant women who might have had miscarriages remains unknown.The study\u2019s release on Monday came as the Indonesian authorities again battle forest fires in the regions that were ablaze in 2015, although heavy seasonal rains have made the situation far less severe.According to government and private-sector data, there were only 12,000 hot spots \u2014 fire clusters spotted by orbiting satellites \u2014 at the height of the fires in August, while in 2015, there were more than 30,000.As the fires returned this year, the national police halted investigations in July into 15 companies in the Sumatran province of Riau for reportedly starting fires to clear land in 2015. The decision, which cited lack of evidence, angered the public and environmental groups.This month, a team of investigators from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry sent to investigate new man-made fires in Riau was taken captive by a mob paid to stop them from documenting evidence of mass, illegal land clearing at a palm oil plantation there, said Novrizal Tahar, a ministry spokesman.The seven-member team was held for two days, with their captors threatening to burn them alive and throw their charred bodies into a nearby river, ministry officials said. The investigators were forced to delete photographic evidence but managed to keep some aerial drone photographs.The captors were neither arrested nor taken in for questioning, the national police said.The estimated 100,000 deaths from the 2015 fires, the return of haze this year and an apparent lack of law enforcement have caused Indonesian environmentalists to throw up their hands in disgust at what they claim is a dysfunctional legal system.\u201cIndonesia\u2019s response to forest fires is being hampered by a crisis in law enforcement,\u201d said Yuyun Indradi, a forest campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia.\u201cThe aerial photos released by the detained investigators show that some of the burned area had been cleared for planting with oil palm, a common but illegal practice in plantation development,\u201d he said. \u201cThe area hit by fire consisted of peatlands, where first indications are that active drainage was underway, which has also been banned by government directive since last year\u2019s fires.\u201dThe Environmental Ministry initially brought the cases against the 15 companies from the 2015 disaster, which include suppliers as well as major Indonesian pulp and paper and palm oil companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Standoff Between Big Oil and Big Corn", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRevaluedA decade ago, lawmakers in Washington tried to address a trifecta of thorny challenges with one simple fix that has turned out to be anything but easy to assess.The problems: an overreliance on foreign oil, rising greenhouse gas emissions and tepid economic growth.The logic was straightforward. More ethanol production would in theory reduce America\u2019s dependence on oil from the Middle East. Because biofuel generally releases less in greenhouse gases than fossil fuel when burned, all that ethanol would be good for the environment, too. And by stimulating demand for domestically produced ethanol, made largely from corn, the mandate would prop up farmers and refiners.In the intervening years, the ethanol industry has ballooned into an economic juggernaut. Last year, the industry contributed an estimated $44 billion to the economy.Those numbers are set to become bigger. The Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the mandate, effectively increased the amount of ethanol required to be added to gasoline to 17.4 billion gallons this year, an annual increase of about 9 percent over 2015. The mandate calls for production to nearly double to 36 billion gallons by 2022, and in theory, much of that will be cellulosic ethanol, made from crops other than corn, like sugar cane and switch grass.Yet even as the Renewable Fuel Standard exerts its powerful sway, there is hardly consensus about whether it has delivered on the lofty promises lawmakers made a decade ago.Indeed, depending on whom you ask, the Renewable Fuel Standard is either one of the best policy decisions to come out of Washington in decades or a special-interest boondoggle that costs taxpayers billions of dollars and harms the environment.Supporters of the mandate claim it has reduced America\u2019s dependence on foreign oil, helped the environment and spurred economic growth, all while saving consumers money.To back up these claims, Ms. Skor and her allies proffer reams of data that portray ethanol as a solution for many of the country\u2019s problems. They say ethanol has made America less reliant on Middle Eastern oil, saved consumers up to $1 a gallon at the pump and spared the air from vast clouds of harmful carbon emissions.Of course, Ms. Skor has a vested interest in advancing this narrative. Were the Renewable Fuel Standard to be repealed, many of the companies that support Growth Energy would lose millions of dollars.Critics of the ethanol mandate are just as adamant that it has been a colossal failure. They point out that domestic oil and natural gas production has surged in recent years as a result of hydraulic fracturing. They argue that because ethanol refineries are consuming so much corn, the cost of food is going up. And many say that when ethanol production and carbon dioxide absorption by crops like corn are factored in, ethanol is no better for the environment than gasoline.As with supporters of the ethanol mandate, many ardent critics are beholden to their own special interests. Among the most vocal antagonists of the law is the American Petroleum Institute, with members including Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Big Oil has been opposed to the Renewable Fuel Standard from the beginning \u2014 after all, as more ethanol is blended into gasoline, the less oil it sells.The debate has become binary. Depending on which army of lobbyists you believe, the Renewable Fuel Standard is either an unqualified success or an unmitigated disaster. But of course, the truth is rarely quite so simple.There\u2019s no doubt that thanks largely to the enormous increase in domestic oil and gas production, America\u2019s energy security is not the concern it was a decade ago. Yet it is also true that the strong rise in ethanol production has helped.\u201cDid it give us energy independence? No,\u201d said James H. Stock, an economics professor at Harvard. \u201cHas it been helpful? Sure.\u201dAs for the promise that more ethanol would mean less harmful emissions, the data is decidedly mixed. Several independent analyses, including authoritative studies from the Department of Energy\u2019s Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, suggest that ethanol releases significantly less greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline.\u201cThere\u2019s an assumption that anything that\u2019s not oil has got to be good,\u201d Mr. DeCicco said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201dWith so many dueling claims and special interests at play, it\u2019s hard to know what to think. In this overheated debate, any assertion about ethanol\u2019s worthiness or lack thereof is immediately shot down by the other side.Congress is well aware that the Renewable Fuel Standard is mired in controversy. House and Senate subcommittees held hearings on the mandate this year in the hope that some consensus might emerge. That didn\u2019t happen, though.Instead, emissaries from both camps descended on Capitol Hill armed with studies that made their case in the most striking terms, pitting the interests of agricultural behemoths against those of oil giants.The truth is probably somewhere in between. The Renewable Fuel Standard probably hasn\u2019t been the most effective environmental policy. America was going to become less reliant on foreign oil with or without it, the direct beneficiaries were too few and too localized, and the climate science was frustratingly inconclusive.But the perfect should not be the enemy of the good, and the ethanol mandate has not been a catastrophe. What it has become is a political battleground, another reminder that when competing interest groups try to dictate energy policy, the truth becomes cloudy.Advertisement"}
