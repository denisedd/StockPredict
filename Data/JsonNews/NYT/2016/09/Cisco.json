{"Headline": "\u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 Season 2 Finale: Fade to Black", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. RobotEnding a season of unremitting bleakness with an unambiguous, unhappy ending would have been harsh of \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d but understandable. Ending it on a note of near-total uncertainty, with virtually none of its major story lines resolved for either good or ill, is somehow even crueler.We learn the lethal nature of the vast hacker conspiracy\u2019s \u201cStage 2\u201d (note how its architects eschewed the more neutral \u201cPhase 2\u201d for its appropriately cancerous alternative) \u2014 blowing up the building where E Corp is warehousing all its paper records and killing everyone inside \u2014 but we don\u2019t find out if the plan went through.We catch up with on-the-lam fsociety co-founders Mobley and Trenton at the big box electronics retailer where they now work, but so does Dark Society assassin Leon; we don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll kill them before Trenton gets the chance to enact her so-crazy-it-just-might-work scheme to undo everything the 5/9 hack has done. (We don\u2019t learn what that scheme is, either.)We discover along with Darlene that the F.B.I. agent Dom DiPierro and her colleagues have fsociety\u2019s supposedly secure organization mapped out to every last low-level associate and unwitting patsy, but we aren\u2019t shown whether this knowledge breaks her resolve or strengthens it. We don\u2019t see the archvillains, the E Corp chief executive, Phillip Price, or the Dark Army overlord, Whiterose, at all.Sure, the show tosses a few crumbs our way \u2014 Cisco\u2019s dead, Darlene and Tyrell Wellick are alive, Romero was killed by a random stray bullet, Joanna Wellick\u2019s mysterious phone calls and evocative gifts are part of a campaign of vengeance by Scott Knowles, whose pregnant wife was murdered by Tyrell.But in the main, the way the final scenes before the credits and the subsequent \u201cstinger\u201d end \u2014 the world fades to black on a gutshot Elliot, gunned down by Tyrell, as his Mr. Robot persona flickers out; Manhattan plunges into darkness as Angela heads out to meet her wounded friend, who seems to have survived the shooting but about whose condition we know nothing else \u2014 stand for the rest of the episode. \u201cMr. Robot\u201d Season 2 didn\u2019t so much end as slip into darkness.A quick Google search for \u201c23 burning questions the \u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 season finale must answer\u201d or the like will indirectly indicate just how many people will be unhappy with this approach. So much of Season 1\u2019s visceral pleasures \u2014 the cyberthriller sequences, the shocking twists, the anticapitalist triumphalism, the ragtag band of losers, loners, racial minorities and emotional outcasts taking on the system and winning \u2014 were stripped away or rendered moot as Season 2 went on.But two quotes from the episode \u2014 one from a character, one from a song on the soundtrack \u2014 point the way to appreciating the season finale, and the season as a whole, for the crazily confident act of artistic self-immolation it was. The first comes from Agent DiPierro, talking to Darlene about \u201cThe Careful Massacre of the Bourgeoisie,\u201d the fake slasher movie that served as a sort of tonal Rosetta Stone for the season\u2019s horror-movie vibe. \u201cIt\u2019s not really scary, but gory,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know how those two things aren\u2019t really the same?\u201dThe implication is that while gore can be fun, fear is where greatness lies. Blowing up E Corp or taking down Price and Whiterose or ending on some similarly pyrotechnic note would have been the equivalent of empty-calorie splatter \u2014 giving us the emotional roller-coaster ride evoked by the series\u2019 constant Coney Island iconography but returning us safely to the starting point. It\u2019s better to be difficult and delay gratification; to be disturbing and relegate violence to terrifyingly irrational outbreaks of the sort visited on Cisco, Darlene and Dom by the Dark Army, or on Joanna by an enraged Scott, who beats her nearly to death, or on Elliot by Tyrell, whom he believes is a figment of his imagination until the moment he gets shot in the stomach with the gun of his distraught partner in crime.The second quote is a question, and a musical one at that. It\u2019s posed by Kenny Rogers (and his duet partner Sheena Easton, by way of original writer-performer Bob Seger) over the season\u2019s closing minutes: \u201cWe\u2019ve got tonight \u2014 who needs tomorrow?\u201d To focus solely on the answers, or lack thereof, the finale provides about the show\u2019s future is to ignore the many dark delights on offer even now. There\u2019s actor Martin Wallstrom as Wellick, a presence withheld from the screen almost entirely until this final episode, when he is called upon to unleash a lifetime of mind-warping fear, frustration, ambition and emptiness as he tearfully turns on the one man he\u2019s ever felt understands his drives.There\u2019s Brian Stokes Mitchell as Scott, in an oddly similar place of devastation and dread, sobbing and begging for forgiveness one moment, exploding in a graphically brutal assault the next. There\u2019s Stephanie Corneliussen as Joanna Wellick, a supremely loathsome cocktail of vulgarity and cruelty, who begins her meeting with Scott by graphically describing her arousal over his latest mind game and ends it with shouting how glad she is that his unborn baby died. There\u2019s Carly Chaikin and Grace Gummer as Darlene and Dom, two \u201cJersey girls\u201d who could not look and sound more exhausted by the cat-and-mouse game they\u2019ve played.There\u2019s Rami Malek as Elliot Alderson and Christian Slater as his Mr. Robot persona, and the ultrarare use of a hand-held camera, swirling around them as they argue about who was really calling the shots \u2014 as vivid an illustration of our inability to control our destructive impulses as you\u2019ll find on TV, if you stop taking the split-personality aspect so literally and see how it speaks to so much more.Would any of this be materially improved if the E Corp building were blown to bits, or if anything similarly definitive and prosaic happened? Like the singer of the song, this season finale (literally) turned out the light and (figuratively) asked us to come take its hand \u2014 a risk, but one eminently worth taking. \u201cWe\u2019ve got tonight, babe. Why don\u2019t you stay?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Could I Possibly Learn From a Mentor Half My Age? Plenty", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow on earth did I become an \u201colder worker?\u201dIt was only a few years ago, it seems, that I set out to climb the ladder in my chosen field. That field happens to be journalism, but it shares many attributes with countless other workplaces. For instance, back when I was one of the youngest people in the room, I was helped by experienced elders who taught me the ropes.Now, shockingly, I\u2019m one of the elders. And I\u2019ve watched my industry undergo significant change. That\u2019s why I recently went searching for a young mentor \u2014 yes, a younger colleague to mentor me.Wait, isn\u2019t that backward?I sought a mentor to help me develop a specific new skill \u2014 and something entirely outside my comfort zone \u2014 namely, how to use Snapchat, the smartphone-based photo and video service that is popular among teenagers and young adults. Not coincidentally, Snapchat is also being used as a newsroom tool at The New York Times to reach new readers.I didn\u2019t need to look far to find my mentor: Last year The Times\u2019s resident Snapchat expert, Talya Minsberg, 27, moved into a cubicle just a few rows from mine. Her job title alone \u2014 social strategy editor \u2014 is a clear sign of our changing world.\u201cMy job didn\u2019t exist five years ago,\u201d Talya pointed out. That\u2019s another eye opener. The job I hold, assignment editor at The Times, has existed for generations.My experience with Talya taught me far more than the basics of a new form of video storytelling (which was already asking a lot). Along the way I learned important lessons about the strengths and weaknesses of the middle-aged brain, and how learning new things can keep it in top working order. It also made me realize that organizations and individual workers could do a lot more to bridge the gaps between generations. Each age group has untapped resources that can benefit others at a different stage of life.In the beginning, I felt a little awkward about reaching out to Talya at all. A part of me felt that at my age (mid-50s) it was somehow unseemly for me to ask for help, particularly from one so young.Ms. Arbit suggested a possible reason for my awkwardness: Baby boomers tend to have to a hierarchical view of the workplace \u2014 an \u201corg chart\u201d mind-set that imagines power filtering down from the top. Millennials, by contrast, may see the office as more of a horizontal network, she said.At the same time, as a younger person conversant in the trendiest technology, Talya seemed imbued with a kind of glamour. I felt as if face-to-face communication was too old-fashioned a way to set up meetings with her. Even though she sat just a few desks away, it didn\u2019t seem right to come up to her and say, \u201cCould you meet at noon on Wednesday?\u201d the way I might easily do with an older colleague.Email seemed old-fashioned, too. So instead we set up our meetings using her preferred method: Google Calendar. To me, the practice of deciding unilaterally on an open time felt presumptuous, and to reject someone else\u2019s suggestion seemed rude. But that\u2019s not how Talya viewed it \u2014 to her, it was the most convenient way of arriving at a suitable time because the participants can view each other\u2019s calendars.In one of our early Google Calendar-arranged meetings, I informed Talya why I was asking her to teach me Snapchat: \u201cI want to be on fleek!\u201dVery slowly, Talya taught me Snapchat fundamentals. It was not easy, partly because the software is not intuitive. In fact, as Talya put it, it can be \u201creally weird and hard to understand.\u201dAs you age, your dendrites \u2014 the antennas by which neurons receive information from other neurons \u2014 begin to shrink, he said. This is especially noticeable in the prefrontal cortex, which handles higher-order brain functions like focusing, staying on task and forming long-term memories.The decline in these areas begins in your 40s and 50s and worsens from there, he said. This can make it tougher to focus. There\u2019s also more of a limit to how many thoughts people can carry in their heads simultaneously.\u201cYour mind\u2019s bandwidth is smaller,\u201d he said. \u201cYou learn at a slower rate because less information is getting in.\u201dAll of these abilities tend to be at their peak when people are in their 20s \u2014 Talya\u2019s age. Before the age of 30, people\u2019s brains possess more plasticity, meaning they can learn more easily.That sounds depressing. Isn\u2019t there any mental upside to getting older?Yes, there is, Professor Miller said. Older people tend to be more disciplined and diligent, he said, which can compensate for learning deficits. Based on their greater experience in the world, they are also very good at putting ideas and thoughts into categories \u2014 the very basis of knowledge and wisdom.It\u2019s true: \u201cThe older brain is a wiser brain,\u201d he said. But it can also get into a rut because of its lack of plasticity.The brain is like a muscle that benefits from mental exercises such as learning new things. The more you put your brain through its paces, the easier it will be to learn the next thing. \u201cIt\u2019s always important to keep yourself cognitively engaged,\u201d Professor Miller said.As Brandon McMillan, host of the TV show \u201cLucky Dog\u201d \u2014 in which he rescues a dog from a shelter and trains it before placing it in a forever home \u2014 has said: \u201cYou can teach an old dog new tricks. You just can\u2019t teach them as fast.\u201dTalya explained that each individual photo or video of a story can last up to 10 seconds. Each 10-second segment can be connected to another. A story can be as long as you want it to be, but each segment cannot exceed 10 seconds.That gives the resulting video a \u201craw, authentic\u201d feel, Talya said, which appeals to many of its acolytes. Another appeal: The stories are ephemeral and disappear after 24 hours (although you can archive them on your phone).My mentor and I set a goal of producing a Snapchat video for the official New York Times channel. But I was nervous. \u201cI don\u2019t even do video,\u201d I said.Talya was reassuring, calling it \u201cjust about the easiest video product.\u201d Once you shoot something, you either send it or delete it. \u201cThere\u2019s no editing. It\u2019s a very different way of thinking,\u201d she said.First, I began following 20 or so people and organizations, and Talya described what they do well (or poorly). Then I created some practice stories on my personal account (which had two followers), and she critiqued those.After my third, a video diary of a weekend trip to Hudson, N.Y., she pronounced me ready to \u201ctake over\u201d the New York Times Snapchat channel, with its worldwide viewership.My first Snapchat story for The Times was of a Nasdaq MarketSite opening-bell ceremony for Scripps Networks Interactive, which owns the Food Network and HGTV. My second was about a cat cafe in Brooklyn. The third was about a textiles trade show in Manhattan. Although the stories disappeared from the channel after 24 hours, we archived them, and you can see the last two online. (I neglected to save the first one \u2014 so much for being on fleek.)My Snapchat skills are far from advanced, but I think my second video is better than the first, and the third one is better than the second, thanks to Talya\u2019s mentoring. I was able to bring my decades-long journalistic experience to bear on a new technology, with mixed but promising results.It was exhilarating to see my progress \u2014 and embarrassing to witness my missteps, like putting my finger over the camera at the close of the cat cafe video. (But have you ever tried to record yourself while trying to keep a cat on your shoulder?)At times I was afraid that creating Snapchat stories required more mental energy than my shrinking dendrites could handle. It took several hours to do a two-and-a-half minute story.Before the mentorship, I had been ready to dismiss Snapchat out of hand. I came to understand that it is more creative than I realized. It\u2019s fascinating to string together photos and videos, along with captions, drawings and emojis, into a story. Snapchat\u2019s constraints \u2014 the 10-second limit to individual segments, the 24-hour existence of stories, the inability to edit \u2014 were a bracing mental challenge. They stretched me as a journalist and a person.So, the reverse mentorship was extremely beneficial, but there was one way in which it could have been better: I could have tried to mentor Talya at the same time. The best cross-generational mentorships work in both directions, Ms. Arbit of BridgeWorks said.\u201cWhat do I have to offer?\u201d I asked her, suddenly discounting three decades of career experience, which was ridiculous.But I think older workers at times do minimize their value, or their value is minimized by others, as society glamorizes the latest glittery technology. Sometimes the old way of doing things can inform and improve the new, and older workers may be the ones with the wisdom to realize this.Twitter: @phylliskorkkiAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Fights Internet Directory\u2019s Transfer; Techies Say He Just Doesn\u2019t Get It", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republican from Texas does not appear to have the ability to inspire another insurgency so close to an election that will determine control of the Senate. He may not have the interest either. His technical theories about the registration of domain names \u2014 the \u201c.net\u201d and \u201c.world\u201d suffixes of internet addresses \u2014 have been discredited by engineers.But his move to block the Obama administration through a short-term spending bill needed to keep the government open past Sept. 30 demonstrates that the former Republican presidential candidate remains eager to keep his name in lights, even at the expense of his colleagues\u2019 efforts to get back to the campaign trail.\u201cI am hopeful and optimistic that leadership will follow through and protect the internet,\u201d Mr. Cruz said on Thursday, when asked if he would prevent the short-term spending measure from moving forward without his internet provision.Mr. Cruz\u2019s hobbyhorse is the administration\u2019s plan at the end of the month to transfer its oversight of domain name registrations to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a multinational private organization based in Los Angeles. Out of the United States\u2019 control, the openness of the internet would be in jeopardy, Mr. Cruz has warned, with Russia, Iran and China positioned to use their influence on Icann to determine what content appears on the web.\u201cImagine an internet run like many Middle Eastern countries, that punish what they deem to be blasphemy,\u201d Mr. Cruz warned in a Senate hearing he led earlier this week. \u201cOr imagine an internet run like China or Russia, that punish and incarcerate those that engage in political dissent.\u201dTechnologists and administration officials say Mr. Cruz simply does not understand how the web operates. The government\u2019s current job of domain name administrator is largely clerical and cannot influence editorial decisions on the web, they say.\u201cIt sounds like a fairy tale to anyone who understands how the internet works,\u201d said Andrew Sullivan, chair of the Internet Architecture Board, a nonprofit group of network engineers and tech firms such as Google and Cisco.The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said the administration is committed to meeting its Sept. 30 deadline.\u201cThe industry technology experts, business community and the largest internet companies \u2014 like Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2014 have described it as imperative that the transition move forward,\u201d he said.The issue involves the deep plumbing of the internet and the system of addresses and domain names that route traffic around the web. It highlights a broader policy struggle among nations over who should govern the internet, which may have been born in the United States but now counts 3.4 billion global users.The administration and tech firms that support the plan say Icann is a neutral body with advisers from around the world that will simply act as the keeper of the internet\u2019s master directory of domain names.\u201cAny delay would add a degree of instability and make the prospect of government control of the internet more likely, not less,\u201d said Kathryn Brown, president of the Internet Society, a nonprofit organization that advocates open internet policies.But Mr. Cruz\u2019s allies point to Icann\u2019s sketchy track record, including its chaotic 2014 expansion of domain names that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues for the group.But his leverage is diminished. While Mr. Cruz can slow passage of the spending bill, he does not have enough followers to kill it. House conservatives, while supportive of his policy goal, are interested in other issues, like halting the Syrian refugee program.\u201cThis internet issue is not on the front burner, no,\u201d said Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cThe Syrian refugee piece resonates more back home.\u201dDemocrats are far more worried about protecting money for Planned Parenthood to help fight the Zika virus, pesticide use and other matters related to Zika.Mr. Cruz does have the backing of influential Republican leaders such as Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. Last week, four House and Senate Republicans sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker asking for the administration to stop its plan.It is a twist for Mr. Cruz, a Republican who has railed against big government, to argue for more government control and less private enterprise.\u201cSince the internet\u2019s inception, the United States government has stood guard over critical internet functions,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.During the hearing on Wednesday, he interrupted and silenced one government witness who disagreed with his logic. He displayed a large poster-board exhibit with quotations from a Washington Post editorial criticizing Icann for malfeasance. Another exhibit showed a former Icann leader who went on to advise the Chinese government.At one point, Mr. Cruz warned Commerce Department employees that they would be breaking the law if they followed orders to hand over domain name administration to the organization.An article on Friday about efforts by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, to block the administration\u2019s plan to end federal oversight of the internet misstated part of the name of a government agency. It is the National Security Agency, not the National Security Administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 Season 2, Episode 10: Anatomy of a Murder", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. RobotThe ugliest scene in this week\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot\u201d is also its most elegantly constructed. It serves as the climax and endpoint of the episode, which, like the previous few weeks\u2019 installments, had been a steadily mounting drumbeat of dread. Acting on equal parts intuition and plain good detective work \u2014 both of which are ignored by her superiors, as usual \u2014 the F.B.I. agent Dom DiPierro realizes that the two major fsociety suspects who\u2019d dropped off a wounded associate at a local E.R. had not fled the scene fearing discovery at all. They\u2019d simply stepped out for a bite to eat before returning to check on their comrade\u2019s condition, and if she wants to catch them before they return to the hospital, find it swarming with law enforcement, and fly the coop for real, she has to step out, too.So out she heads into the darkened Manhattan streets \u2014 cluttered with uncollected trash, sparsely populated by strapped civilians \u2014 searching for her quarry. The lights dim as she runs in the direction of the few restaurants left open at this time of night, with E Corp\u2019s rolling blackouts providing her sojourn the atmosphere of a dark fairy tale. Slowly our main vector of information shifts from sight to sound: the slap of her shoes on the pavement, the buzz of failing electrical wires, the keening whir of car alarms, squealing tires stopping short in the sudden absence of streetlights and stoplights, the pulsating hum and ominous strings of composer Mac Quayle\u2019s never-better score.A crosscut to Elliot and Angela, holed up on a subway car where she reveals her intention to turn herself in, prominently features fake ads reading, appropriately enough, \u201cPhase: Excellent Audio for Discerning Listeners.\u201d Their achingly romantic kiss, both a first and, it seems, a farewell, establishes a tone of terrible finality even before Angela is cornered by imposing figures, their faces obscured.The orchestral portion of the score has crested and fallen by the time we return to Dom, who runs, panting, to the foreground of a static shot showing the restaurant (in reality, Lupe\u2019s in Soho, for those who care) where her suspects, Darlene and Cisco, have retreated for a late meal. Still out of breath, she picks up her phone and summons all units to the location.While Dom inaudibly argues with Darlene and Cisco inside the restaurant, a motorcycle pulls up and one of the riders produces a machine gun and methodically strides across the street. Suddenly Dom sees what\u2019s coming and ducks. The Dark Army soldier opens fire, shattering the window and unleashing high-pitched screams from the diners inside as Darlene and Cisco disappear in the fusillade. Now the sirens are getting closer, and the walls of nearby buildings light up with the rooftop lights of approaching police cars. Dom returns fire from within and the attacker staggers back into the middle of the street. The remaining rider sizes up the situation, then abandons his associate and drives off just as the police pull up; the roar of the bike is so loud that it overwhelms the sound of the sirens even as it flees the scene.Like the Dark Army attacker Dom winged in China, this one shoots himself in the head. Dom runs out from the restaurant. By now the score has dropped out entirely. Roll credits, accompanied only by the deafening noise of the crime scene.The second season of \u201cMr. Robot\u201d has been a deliberately dispiriting experience. It\u2019s centered on the ultimate failure of fsociety\u2019s revolution. \u201cWe can\u2019t beat them,\u201d Angela says outright in this episode. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve tried. No matter what we do, we will always lose to them.\u201dWhile the show has never been quite this explicit on this point, it hasn\u2019t been any more upbeat about it, either. Now we\u2019re also discovering a second throughline: the cost to Elliot\u2019s friends and family as they suffer for a \u201cStage 2\u201d that his alternate personality planned, from which he himself remains isolated and insulated.\u201cThis was my plan,\u201d he tells viewers via voice-over, \u201cand I hid in a cage while everyone else took the risk.\u201d At one point in this episode he even enlists us as accomplices directly, asking us to search his apartment for secret clues as the camera pans around while he talks to Joanna Wellick\u2019s security guard.It\u2019s getting to the point where there\u2019s so much to say about each episode that moments as striking as Price asking a former colleague to pave the way for China\u2019s takeover of Congo and saying he\u2019d like to be the most powerful person on Earth since God, or Joanna Wellick dressing for her confrontation with Elliot while the Japanese hard-core band Bleach screeches in the background during the opening credits, can be comfortably reduced to mere asides.Advertisement"}

My grandfather was a coal miner and saloonkeeper. My parents were a truck driver and a beautician. I worked on the oil field pipelines of western Kentucky and in a chemical plant. I have some idea of what ordinary working stiffs go through. It is not easy. Automation, foreign competition and shifts in types of energy have taken a toll.Hard times are not an excuse for ignorance. I am now deeply ashamed of the citizens of Kentucky for promoting the absolute nothingness that is Donald Trump. A preening billionaire is going to create jobs out of thin air?

Despondent individuals have been known to provoke \u201csuicide by cop.\u201d But \u201csuicide by politician\u201d? That\u2019s new.Many in this country, having lost their jobs and sense of purpose, feel that they have nothing else to lose. Given the hardships in their lives, they\u2019re entitled to express anger, frustration and despair.But when they vote to empower the dangerous Mr. Trump, they won\u2019t just be putting their own lives at stake. Suicide by politician means the rest of us get taken out, too.GAYE BROWNPortland, Me.To the Editor:In the midst of a report about the economic problems in Kentucky coal country, Roger Cohen comes up with the incredible remark that Donald Trump can win the election \u201cin part because of the liberal intellectual arrogance that dismisses the economic, social and cultural problems his rise has underscored.\u201dAs a liberal, I consider this remark offensive and totally disconnected from reality. It is the Obama administration that has been pushing for infrastructure spending for years against Republican resistance in Congress. It is the Obama administration that rescued the auto industry and saved millions of jobs, also against Republican opposition.It is Republicans who have undercut and threaten to destroy Obamacare, the program that low-income and unemployed people, like Kentucky coal miners, can turn to when employer-sponsored health care disappears. It is what is known as the political left that is pushing for alternate energy industries that could provide new jobs to replace lost coal jobs. And so on, and on.JACK HERSCHLAGWoodland Park, N.J.To the Editor:I am tired of seeing articles about why people like Donald Trump and why people supposedly don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton. Writing about Mr. Trump, even in the guise of trying to explain him and his supporters, gives him traction. The more we are told that Mr. Trump is popular and the more his supporters are put in the limelight, the more people on the fence will be swayed to think there might be a choice in this election.Why go around looking for people who aren\u2019t wild about Hillary and trumpeting their voices? How about some frequent, front-page and in-depth coverage about all the people who are working hard to elect Hillary; those who think she is terrific; those who want a strong, determined, informed, smart and hardworking person as our next president?There are millions of us out here; give us a voice. Give Hillary a fair shot.KATHLEEN LEARNEDSeattleTo the Editor:After reading Roger Cohen\u2019s column about Donald Trump\u2019s appeal in coal country, my reaction was: What makes them think they\u2019re special? Since 2014, almost 200,000 Americans have lost their oil industry jobs. Dell, Cisco, IBM and other tech giants have each laid off thousands; one Wall Street analyst says more than 350,000 tech industry jobs could be lost this year alone. Even Walmart announced 16,000 job cuts.I cannot think of any job that hasn\u2019t changed dramatically or been eliminated in the last 20 years, including my own. Somehow a certain portion of underemployed Americans blame President Obama and think Donald Trump can fix their lives. Perhaps if close to 40 percent of newspaper journalists hadn\u2019t also lost their jobs in the last decade, we might have a more realistic, better informed public.SHEILA SORVARIAustin, Tex.Advertisement"}

In addition to the actors and their dialogue, each of these tightly constructed exchanges involves set design, sound design, cinematography and editing so distinctive, so breathlessly bold, they might as well be from different shows.Only the courage of this series\u2019 second season to follow its artistic convictions-cum-obsessions as far as they\u2019ll go ties them together.Let out of the van in a painfully perfect suburban garage (complete with a tennis ball on a string to prevent the front bumper from hitting the wall), she is escorted into a sumptuously appointed home with black-and-white d\u00e9cor and a series of family photographs on a wall with the subjects\u2019 faces blotted out by swathes of color. She\u2019s then led into a room that could have been part of the cosmic hotel suite David Bowman visited at the end of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d: a red floor; black walls; a skylight; a slowly leaking fish tank; a \u201chang in there\u201d poster, complete with dangling kitten; and a desk covered with antiquated technology (a rotary phone, a Commodore 64 and a paperback copy of the appropriately Kubrickian novel \u201cLolita\u201d).Here, as composer Mac Quayle\u2019s barely-there score rumbles like distant thunder, Angela finds herself face to face with a little girl \u2014 real-world interrogator or dream-world doppelg\u00e4nger? At first it\u2019s hard to tell \u2014 who asks her a series of gnomic questions from a computer game. Some are unnerving, particularly given the young age of the questioner and the beating she says she\u2019ll incur should Angela refuse to answer: \u201cHave you ever cried during sex?\u201d \u201cHave you ever fantasized about murdering your father?\u201d Others are as cryptically revealing as a BuzzFeed personality quiz: \u201cAre you a giraffe or a sea gull?\u201d \u201cAre you red or purple?\u201dThe question that unlocks the next stage of Angela\u2019s journey falls somewhere in between: \u201cIs the key in the room?\u201d Angela\u2019s non-answer prompts a call from the threatening red phone, the menace of which evokes similar scenes from the works of David Lynch as surely as the severe black, white and red environment recalls the Red Room from \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d At the other end of the line is a computerized voice that walks Angela through what feels like the beginning of a text-based adventure game involving a dark room with a locked door. Glancing at the red silhouette of the title character on the cover of \u201cLolita,\u201d Angela intuits that she has had the key all along, it\u2019s in her (or Dolores Haze\u2019s) clenched fist \u2014 the key is indeed in the room.So, after enough time passes for the fish in the draining tank to die, the door opens, and her tormentor is revealed: Whiterose, the Dark Army\u2019s transgender general. This self-described \u201cwoman of time\u201d has gone through all this time and trouble, she says, because she finds Angela\u2019s presence at the center of so many of the world-shaking events that have transpired since her and Elliot\u2019s parents died at E Corp\u2019s hands to be baffling.In order to make Angela fit her rigid schematic for how things are supposed to work, Whiterose demands she surrender not her proof of any misdeeds, but \u201cher belief\u201d that \u201cif you imagined or believed in something it would come true, simply by will.\u201d Like many of Whiterose\u2019s scenes this season, this can be read as a veiled commentary on her own transition, but it\u2019s more readily understood here as an implicit argument that she alone possesses this power. \u201cYes, actually, I did believe that,\u201d Angela says, giving in. \u201cBut I\u2019m slowly having to admit that\u2019s just not the real world.\u201dWhiterose, now seeming nearly as emotionally drained as Angela herself, responds, \u201cWell, I guess it all depends on what your definition of real is.\u201dWith that, the scene fades to black, and we re-emerge into the consciousness of Elliot, who\u2019d begun the episode with instructions to induce lucid dreaming in order to become the \u201csilent observer\u201d of his Mr. Robot personality, rather than the other way around.Was it all a dream? A subsequent visit by Angela to the home of her do-gooding lawyer friend, whom she orders to cease contacting her, indicates that it wasn\u2019t, but it\u2019s really unimportant.As Elliot puts it later, when he finds himself in a cab with the supposedly deceased Tyrell Wellick: \u201cThis is no longer a question of what I\u2019m seeing. No, we know that\u2019s not reliable. The question is, what am I not seeing.\u201d The answer by now is \u201cso very much.\u201dWe can\u2019t see the nature of \u201cStage 2,\u201d the plan Elliot devised with Whiterose and now does not remember. We can\u2019t see E Coins, the cryptocurrency a chortling Phillip Price crams down the throat of the United States government after his company\u2019s Whiterose-instigated $2 trillion bailout from China. We can\u2019t see Alexa, Amazon\u2019s proprietary artificial intelligence, whom a desperately depressed Agent DiPierro grills about love and loneliness as she drifts off to sleep following her near death at the hands of Whiterose\u2019s goons. We can\u2019t see whether Darlene and Cisco, those assassins\u2019 targets, are alive or dead.It\u2019s fitting that the episode ends with a version of \u201cEarth Angel,\u201d another \u201cBack to the Future\u201d music cue, one that plays as the time-displaced Marty McFly begins fading from sight. The message of \u201cMr. Robot\u201d is that human connection is being erased by forces beyond our ability to view. Like Angela, we\u2019re locked in a dark room, and the key leads only to more darkness. Be glad that a show this confident in its own black beauty exists to briefly light the way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 Season 2, Episode 9: A Bad Dream", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. RobotGranted, an episode that begins with the superhumanly handsome star Rami Malek stripping naked may direct the focus of many viewers elsewhere. Indeed, the opening sequence is intended to strip away more mysteries than just \u201cWhat does Elliot look like in the buff?\u201d It\u2019s here we discover that he wound up in the prison that he\u2019d transformed to his mother\u2019s house inside his mind not because of the 5/9 hack, but because his therapist\u2019s married ex-boyfriend called the police on him, still fuming at Elliot for hijacking his computer and stealing his dog. (In a particularly clever touch, the show has Elliot offer his guilty plea through a closed-circuit television screen; even when he\u2019s making a desperate attempt to pull himself offline by copping to a felony, he\u2019s still just a face on a screen.) \u201cThat\u2019s all you missed,\u201d Elliot tells us via voice-over. \u201cThat\u2019s everything.\u201dUnfortunately for him, things don\u2019t stay that simple for long. Once he\u2019s released from prison (via a sliding-door shot unintentionally reminiscent of a similar moment in this week\u2019s finale of \u201cThe Night Of\u201d), he\u2019s immediately embraced by his sister Darlene, wrapped up in both her arms and her troubles. As he tries to help her and her semi-estranged ex-boyfriend Cisco locate their missing comrades and suss out what the sinister Dark Army has planned for them all, he soon discovers that his Mr. Robot persona is taking control of him without his knowledge again. This time, however, there\u2019s a twist: He\u2019s able to watch this happen from an outside vantage point between zapping in and out of his own body. And his Mr. Robot half is no happier about this than he is, feeling it\u2019s a sign that their shared brain is \u201coverheating.\u201d The sight of Elliot looking on helplessly from afar as Mr. Robot carries on conversations for him is the series\u2019 most disturbing use of the split-personality device to date, proof that the \u201cshocking reveal\u201d element matters far less than its ability to make us uncomfortable, keep us off balance, and create a sense of mounting dread.That dread extends far beyond Elliot this week. His childhood friend Angela spends much of the episode involved in a hack entirely of her own design, using one of fsociety\u2019s specially rigged thumb drives to steal information pertaining to E Corp\u2019s cover-up of the toxic-chemical leak in her hometown. The show\u2019s trademark jittery electronic music and off-center framing make her maiden voyage into solo cybercrime a nerve-racking affair, but it\u2019s not until she winds up at the Nuclear Regulatory Agency\u2019s Washington office \u2014 waiting alone for hours under the blank black eye of a security camera, until a suspiciously cheery agent tries to lure her into a closed room at the end of a long, isolated hallway \u2014 that the fear really kicks in. \u2018When I finally let go and stopped struggling so much, that\u2019s when I survived,\u201d the F.B.I. agent Dom DiPierro tells her after the incident, comparing Angela\u2019s plight to a literal nightmare she\u2019d had about being drowned by a potential sexual partner. But the panic-stricken face of the actor Portia Doubleday \u2014 her severe ponytail serving to enhance her already anxiety-widened eyes, which are nearly Malek-level mesmerizing to begin with \u2014 indicates she\u2019s firmly in nightmare territory already.If this is indeed a nightmare, there are monsters aplenty to populate it. One is Philip Price, the megarich E Corp chief executive, who calls himself \u201ca mercenary\u201d more than willing to destroy the entire system in order to cash in and come out on top. Another is his ersatz partner, the Chinese government official and terrorist mastermind Whiterose, who we learn has been playing such a long game that she had an E Corp C.E.O. murdered for opposing her as long ago as 1995. In a mesmerizing scene between her and Price, where they stand facing each other against a rainy sky under black umbrellas like something out of a murky \u201970s political thriller, her master plan is revealed, at least in part: She has direct control over the very plant that poisoned Angela, Elliot and Darlene\u2019s parents and will do whatever it takes to retain that control.What\u2019s going on in that place? Why is it so important? Does it have anything to do with the rolling brownouts that add even more murky atmosphere to this already unsettling show? Is it connected to the mysterious \u201cStage 2,\u201d the Dark Army\u2019s next move \u2014 and Elliot\u2019s brainchild, even if he doesn\u2019t remember coming up with it? Is it connected to the strange sights and sounds that stop Cisco in his tracks when he returns to fsociety\u2019s old base to retrieve evidence? Is it the reason for the knock on Darlene\u2019s door and her anxious glance at the person or persons on the other side? Will Elliot survive his episode-ending run-in with Joanna Wellick, whose husband he believes he murdered, long enough to find out?The malevolent beauty of \u201cMr. Robot\u201d Season 2 is such that knowing and not knowing are equally unpleasant options. The show\u2019s twists earn it constant comparisons to films like \u201cFight Club\u201d and \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d but its ability to create and sustain the look and feel of a bad dream has much more in common with David Lynch\u2019s roughly contemporaneous, twist-based mind-benders \u201cLost Highway\u201d and \u201cMulholland Drive.\u201d You\u2019re not better off on one side of the reveal than you are on the other.Advertisement"}
