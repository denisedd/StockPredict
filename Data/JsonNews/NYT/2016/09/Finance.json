{"Headline": "For Tenants Facing Eviction, New York May Guarantee a Lawyer", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOutside Housing Court in the Bronx, the line invariably winds down the block, snaking past the vendors at tables hawking cellphone plans and by a man selling moving boxes.Inside, tenants clutching folders of documents, or lugging toddlers on their hips, stagger through the hallways.On a recent Tuesday morning, the fear and confusion was palpable. Some tenants owed back rent, money they did not have. Two had already received eviction papers but said they had paid their rent, proffering copies of money orders and tattered receipts as proof to anyone who would stop to look.In halting English, another man, a Rite Aid name tag pinned to his shirt, wandered around asking where he could find a lawyer.Most likely, he was out of luck.With landlords almost always represented by lawyers, tenants are overmatched from the start, tenant advocates and city officials say. Across the city last year, there were nearly 22,000 evictions, with the greatest number in the Bronx.On Monday, the City Council held a hearing on a bill that would make New York City the first jurisdiction in the country to guarantee lawyers for any low-income residents facing eviction. Under the measure, tenants who make below 200 percent of the federal poverty line would qualify. (For a single person, the cutoff would be $23,540; for a family of four, it would be $48,500.)The bill, which has already garnered the support of an overwhelming majority of council members, is part of a broader effort gaining momentum across the country to create a right to counsel for people in high-stake legal cases like evictions and foreclosures.\u201cHousing Court is a weapon that unscrupulous landlords use to displace tenants,\u201d Councilman Mark D. Levine, who along with Councilwoman Vanessa L. Gibson, a fellow Democrat, sponsored the legislation, said in an interview on Monday. He added the bill is \u201cabout leveling the playing field.\u201dWithin legal circles, the effort is known as Civil Gideon, a reference to the 1963 Supreme Court case that established a right to counsel in criminal cases.It is gaining traction in New York as the city grapples with an affordable housing crisis. The total stock of affordable housing is dwindling, according to many measures, while costs are rising. From 2000 to 2012, the number of apartments renting for $1,000 or less dropped by 400,000, according to an analysis by the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer.\u201cPeople are literally falling off a cliff fighting for necessities without a lawyer,\u201d said Jonathan Lippman, the former chief judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, who has long argued that the poor should have a right to counsel in civil cases. \u201cThe playing field is uneven, lopsided because the tenant has no idea how to navigate the system.\u201dThe bill has brought together a broad coalition that includes labor unions and the New York City Bar Association, as well as traditional tenant rights advocates. On the steps of City Hall on Monday, elected officials, including borough presidents from the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan, the city comptroller and the public advocate, gathered to register their support for the bill. A large crowd of tenants who turned out waved signs and chanted \u201clegal aid.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s office has not taken a position on the pending legislation, but Steven Banks, the commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, whose agency now coordinates the city\u2019s legal initiatives to prevent eviction, noted the city had already \u201cmade an unprecedented commitment\u201d to providing tenant legal services, referring to the money the city had set aside for tenant legal services. Mr. Banks said his office was \u201creviewing the impact of the proposed legislation.\u201dProviding legal representation to all low-income tenants would cost the city about $200 million a year, according to a March report by Stout Risius Ross, an independent advisory firm, for the bar association. But the report contended that the effort would save the city even more than that \u2014 over $300 million, annually \u2014 by keeping 5,237 families a year out of shelters, at a cost of $43,000 per family, along with other savings, such as through the preservation of rent-regulated affordable housing.\u201cThe city can\u2019t afford to not do this,\u201d Mr. Lippman said.In the last two years, the de Blasio administration has vastly increased financing for tenant legal services. Funding soared to nearly $62 million for this fiscal year, up from $6.4 million in 2013.It seems to have made a difference, although not enough, some tenant advocates and city officials said.Last year, evictions in New York City fell to their lowest level in a decade, court estimates show. Evictions dropped to 21,988 in 2015, an 18 percent decline from a year earlier.While the numbers are heartening, lawmakers say, much more needs to be done.In Housing Court, having a lawyer can mean the difference between losing a home and keeping it.Leyla Martinez, a single mother who lives in the Bronx, knows that all too well. In August, after spending more than a year fighting on her own in court, she returned home to face her nightmare: She had been evicted from her apartment and locked out.\u201cI was terrified,\u201d Ms. Martinez said.Desperate, she asked anyone she could find for help and found her way to Kamilla Sjodin, a lawyer with the Urban Justice Center. Within days, Ms. Sjodin was able to get her and her children back into the apartment.Her experience is borne out by the numbers. Once tenants have lawyers, their chances of getting evicted fall more than 75 percent, according to a study by the Legal Aid Society and the bar association.Many tenants, daunted by navigating Housing Court, agree prematurely to deals in the hallways to give up their apartments, said Jessica Hurd, the assistant director at Housing Court Answers, a research and advocacy group that operates the information tables.A couple of months ago, Ms. Hurd said, she met a tenant who was so petrified because he was months behind on his rent that he voluntarily left his $800-a-month apartment rather than fight the case.Providing tenants with lawyers can make a difference in other ways. Legal services lawyers say that landlords often drop eviction cases entirely once they learn that a tenant is represented.City officials and lawyers say few tenants understand their rights under the city\u2019s rent stabilization law. They often do not know, for example, that they are typically entitled to a new lease when their current one expires, or that there are strict caps on how much their rent can increase.Even when tenants are struggling with overdue rent, lawyers can help them stave off eviction. If the landlords have not made repairs, for example, some tenants might be entitled to a reduced rent bill.Alvin Browne, who fought off an eviction from his home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with the help of a lawyer a few years ago, said in an interview at the rally on Monday that going to Housing Court was like traveling to a country where everyone spoke a different language. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know the questions to ask,\u201d Mr. Browne said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "World Bank Picks Jim Yong Kim for Second Term as President", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite recent upheaval at the bank, and criticism of how it has been managed, only one nomination was submitted for the job of president: that of the American currently serving in that role.In his first term, Mr. Kim led reforms that included reorganizing and cutting the staff, which created a demoralized work force of thousands. Employees at the World Bank banded together to write an unusual letter to the board, saying that the institution was \u201cexperiencing a crisis of leadership.\u201dOn Tuesday, the bank said that a review of its spending found that it had reduced administrative costs by $400 million, with some of the savings redirected to its programs.The bank\u2019s board praised Mr. Kim\u2019s leadership, highlighting his goals to end extreme poverty by 2030 and accelerate income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population in every developing country. Members of the 189-nation organization agreed to give $52 billion for the bank\u2019s fund for the poorest countries.In a meeting with the board, Mr. Kim emphasized that he intended to focus on \u201cinstitutional stability and deeper staff engagement,\u201d the bank said in the statement. He would also like to facilitate private sector investment in infrastructure and invest in education, health and skills to help developing countries, according to the bank.The United States is the largest contributor to the World Bank, which was founded alongside the International Monetary Fund after World War II as a resource to bolster the economies of developing nations. In February, the I.M.F. appointed Christine Lagarde, the former finance minister of France, to a second five-year term as its president. Again, no other candidate had been nominated.Mr. Kim was born in South Korea but moved to the United States when he was young and became a citizen.

{"Headline": "Buy Movie Tickets on Facebook? Fandango Makes It Possible", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 By making it easy for people to buy movie tickets online or through a smartphone app, Fandango has experienced breakneck growth over the last two years. A couple of taps and presto! The seats are yours.But that, Fandango has decided, is no longer good enough.To keep growing \u2014 and, with any luck, help theaters and studios entice Americans, particularly young ones, to go to the movies at all \u2014 Fandango will alter course. Instead of relying on customers to come to it, Fandango will also go to them: Over the weekend, for instance, Fandango will begin selling tickets to Hollywood movies directly on Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about purchasing ease, it\u2019s also about bringing along groups of people,\u201d Mr. Yanover said. \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to see this movie. Why don\u2019t you come along? Great. Boom. Done.\u201dJulie Ask, an analyst with Forrester who was privately briefed by Fandango on its plans, offered an enthusiastic appraisal.\u201cConsumers, particularly young ones, find it inconvenient to hop into different silos to get something done,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want it all in one place. That sounds obnoxious, I know \u2014 the definition of a \u2018first-world problem\u2019 \u2014 but it\u2019s true, and Fandango is solving it for them.\u201dFacebook represents only one area of expansion for Fandango, which NBCUniversal owns. On Tuesday, Fandango began allowing users of Apple\u2019s enhanced iPhone messaging app to buy tickets without leaving a texting conversation. Anyone using Apple\u2019s new iOS 10 operating system can tap on a Fandango applet while on the Messages page. Posters for films playing in theaters pop up. Tapping a poster brings up a display of nearby theaters and showtimes, along with purchasing options.A Fandango interface designed for Snapchat (again, allowing users to buy tickets without toggling between apps or leaving the platform) is on the way. \u201cThis is about Fandango appearing in these environments in an organic, natural way \u2014 the way people communicate with each other now, the way they actually discover, plan and buy,\u201d Mr. Yanover said.Although Mr. Yanover is not ready to show his full hand, he said in an interview at Fandango headquarters that additional offerings were in the works. Might Fandango, for instance, introduce ticket-buying on YouTube, where it operates a popular channel, Movieclips, stocked with trailers and snippets of old films? Mr. Yanover smiled, but declined to comment.Social networks are crucial marketing tools for Hollywood, but actually acquiring customers has remained an elusive goal, in part because companies like Facebook have been more focused on other priorities. But that is changing. \u201cThere is now an arms race to offer more and more services and keep people in their environments longer,\u201d Ms. Ask said.Anything that increases ticket sales is likely to be warmly embraced by studio executives and theater buyers, who have been fighting to keep moviegoing relevant as in-home entertainment options proliferate. About 513 million people went to the movies over the summer, a 3.5 percent decline compared with a year earlier, according to studio data. For the year so far, attendance is up about 1.2 percent.\u201cThe social aspect of what Fandango is doing is really important for Hollywood,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at comScore. \u201cMost people do not go to the movies alone, and there is the potential here to turn a two-ticket purchase into a four-ticket purchase.\u201dFandango is facing competition from a start-up called Atom Tickets. Incubated by Lionsgate, with additional financing from Disney and 21st Century Fox, Atom has promoted itself as a way for theaters and studios to increase group sales by making it easier for friends to plan outings. The Atom app, introduced this year, has also made discounts, particularly for less popular showtimes, part of its mission, along with concession stand preorders.But Fandango is the giant in this segment of the industry, servicing about 27,700 movie screens in the United States and growing quickly. So far this year, ticketing revenue is up 51 percent compared with the same period last year, according to a Fandango spokesman. In 2015, Fandango grew by 81 percent. About 70 percent of Fandango tickets are sold on mobile devices.\u201cWe\u2019re really proud of our growth, and people will still come to us, but we\u2019ve spent a lot of time watching how movie discovery and planning is changing,\u201d Mr. Yanover said. \u201cAnd I think these offerings we are unveiling are an important shift, not just for Fandango, but for Hollywood as a whole.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Art Dealers, the Place to Be Is Still London", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are early days, but the Hieronymus Bosch vision of a socioeconomic apocalypse that many feared would follow Britain\u2019s June 23 vote to leave the European Union has yet to materialize.Dealers in high-end art, at least, remain confident that London will retain its mojo. At least four international galleries are investing in showpiece spaces in the capital.\u201cBrexit is a technicality,\u201d said Thaddaeus Ropac, a contemporary art dealer with galleries in Paris and Salzburg, who in June signed a 15-year lease on Ely House, a grand 18th-century mansion in Mayfair that had once housed the antique dealers Mallett.\u201cIt will be expensive and complicated,\u201d Mr. Ropac said, referring to the likelihood of additional paperwork and tariffs on art sales. \u201cBut London is London,\u201d he added. \u201cThe museums are here. The auction houses are here. The best galleries in the world are here. I do not see another city taking London\u2019s place. Madrid? Los Angeles? I just don\u2019t see it.\u201dGalerie Thaddaeus Ropac London, set to open next spring, will join the most comprehensive array of contemporary art galleries in any city in Europe. International names such as Gagosian, Pace, David Zwirner, Hauser & Wirth, Michael Werner, Dominique Levy, Skarstedt and Marian Goodman have all opened spaces in the West End since 2010, joining established British dealers such as White Cube, Sadie Coles and Timothy Taylor.With five floors spread over some 16,000 square feet, Mr. Ropac\u2019s gallery in the Palladian-style residence, once home to the Bishop of Ely, is one of the boldest interventions yet. The building, remodeled by the New York architect Annabelle Selldorf, will feature four contrasting gallery spaces \u2014 a sort of contemporary art \u201cmultiplex.\u201dMr. Ropac\u2019s Paris and Salzburg dealerships represent major international artists including Antony Gormley, Adrian Ghenie, Anselm Kiefer and Gilbert & George. He expects his Ely House branch to concentrate on historical shows by his gallery stable, artists\u2019 estates, \u201csecondary\u201d sales of works that have already appeared on the market and shows by artists who are not yet represented in the city. His inaugural show in the spring, for example, will feature new work by the young British sound sculptor Oliver Beer.\u201cWe have wanted to have a stronger secondary market for a while,\u201d Mr. Ropac said, adding that it was easier to sell such works in London than in Paris. \u201cThe art market is more strongly developed in London.\u201dIn 2015, Britain\u2019s auction houses and dealers generated 21 percent of the world\u2019s art and antiques sales, compared with 6 percent in France and 2 percent in Germany, according the 2016 Tefaf Art Market Report, published in March.\u201cI was surprised there was such a quick and good response to our Savile Row space,\u201d said Ms. Rech, who added that her London gallery had attracted at least 10 collectors whom she had never met before. \u201cBut I needed to present larger shows.\u201dHer inaugural exhibition at Grosvenor Hill, which opens on Oct. 4 during the week of the Frieze art fairs in London, is devoted to Jeff Koons, who is also represented by Gagosian. The show will include at least four new \u201cGazing Ball\u201d paintings and sculptures (the former inspired by old masters, the latter by Duchamp ready-mades) and at least one stainless steel \u201cBallerina\u201d sculpture. Prices range from about $1 million to about $8 million.Ms. Rech is optimistic about the prospects for London after Britain leaves the European Union. \u201cLondon has been the capital of European business and finance,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to give that up. I\u2019m sure they will find a solution.\u201dOthers, like Bona Montagu, the director of the London branch of the New York dealership Skarstedt, see an exit from the union as an opportunity for the art trade.Skarstedt, like Rech, is opening a plush new street-level gallery in London. Its 1,765-square-foot space, around the corner from the Ritz hotel, will open on Sept. 30 with a joint exhibition of Cindy Sherman \u201cHistory Portraits\u201d from 1988-90, and David Salle \u201cTapestry Paintings\u201d from 1989-91, priced at $500,000 to $1.2 million.The show will complement the gallery\u2019s booth at the Frieze Masters fair, opening the following week.Colnaghi merged last year with the 10-year-old Madrid dealership Coll & Cort\u00e8s, and the company\u2019s new partners, Jorge Coll and Nicolas Cort\u00e8s, who specialize in 17th-century Spanish painting and sculpture, have been the driving force behind a contemporary makeover of the space. Colnaghi\u2019s 10,000-volume library is sunk, like a conceptual art installation, in the center of the 4,000-square-foot gallery space. The new-look Colnaghi is expected to open next month, when the dealership will be exhibiting at Frieze Masters.\u201cWe need to acknowledge the time we live in and reach a new audience,\u201d said the gallery\u2019s director, Tim Warner-Johnson.\u201cPerfect timing,\u201d said Mr. Ropac, the Salzburg, Paris and now London gallerist. \u201cWe can now see the limits of the art market.

{"Headline": "Where Has Hillary Clinton Been? Ask the Ultrarich", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI stand between you and the apocalypse,\u201d a confident Mrs. Clinton declared to laughs, exhibiting a flash of self-awareness and humor to a crowd that included Calvin Klein and Harvey Weinstein and for whom the prospect of a Donald J. Trump presidency is dire.Mr. Trump has pointed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s noticeably scant schedule of campaign events this summer to suggest she has been hiding from the public. But Mrs. Clinton has been more than accessible to those who reside in some of the country\u2019s most moneyed enclaves and are willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to see her. In the last two weeks of August, Mrs. Clinton raked in roughly $50 million at 22 fund-raising events, averaging around $150,000 an hour, according to a New York Times tally.And while Mrs. Clinton has faced criticism for her failure to hold a news conference for months, she has fielded hundreds of questions from the ultrarich in places like the Hamptons, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Beverly Hills and Silicon Valley.\u201cIt\u2019s the old adage, you go to where the money is,\u201d said Jay S. Jacobs, a prominent New York Democrat.If Mr. Trump appears to be waging his campaign in rallies and network interviews, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s second presidential bid seems to amount to a series of high-dollar fund-raisers with public appearances added to the schedule when they can be fit in. Last week, for example, she diverged just once from her packed fund-raising schedule to deliver a speech.The public has gotten used to seeing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s carefully choreographed appearances and her somewhat halting speeches and TV interviews over the course of the long \u2014 and sometimes seemingly joyless \u2014 campaign, but donors this summer have glimpsed an entirely different person.It is clear from interviews with more than a dozen attendees of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s finance events this summer and a handful of pictures and videos of her at the closed-press gatherings that Mrs. Clinton, often described as warm and personable in small settings, whoever the audience, can be especially relaxed, candid and even joyous in this company.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides have gone to great lengths to project an image of her as down-to-earth and attuned to the challenges of what she likes to call \u201cthe struggling and the striving.\u201d She began her campaign last year riding in a van to Iowa from New York and spent much of last summer hosting round-table discussions with a handful of what her campaign called \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d in Iowa and New Hampshire.Yet some of the closest relationships Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have are with their longstanding contributors. If she feels most at ease around millionaires, within the gilded bubble, it is in part because they are some of her most intimate friends.\u201cIt\u2019s like going to a wedding or a bar mitzvah \u2014 you catch up,\u201d explained Mitchell Berger, a Democratic donor in Florida, about the familial nature of the events. Mr. Berger would know: He has been raising money for the Clintons since he held a fund-raiser in his Fort Lauderdale office for Mr. Clinton the day after he announced his candidacy in 1991.Mr. Berger, who joined Mrs. Clinton last month at a donor event in Miami Beach, said many of the individual conversations before and after she speaks at the gatherings are centered more on grandchildren than weighty policy matters. But when she has had a give-and-take this summer about issues, Mrs. Clinton, who has promised to \u201creshuffle the deck\u201d in favor of the middle class and portrayed Mr. Trump as an out-of-touch billionaire, has almost exclusively been fielding the concerns of the wealthiest Americans.To businessmen who complain to Mrs. Clinton that President Obama has been unfriendly to their interests, she says she would approach business leaders more like Mr. Clinton did during his administration, which was widely considered amicable to the private sector.And, as she noted at an event last month on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Mrs. Clinton points out that she worked cooperatively with Republicans when she served in the Senate and would do so as president.\u201cI\u2019d say the major themes are small business, regulation and getting people back to work,\u201d said Alan Patricof, a financier and longtime donor to Mrs. Clinton.People who donated to establishment Republican candidates in the primary season are more likely to give money to Hillary Clinton than to Donald J. Trump.The campaign\u2019s finance team is led by Dennis Cheng, previously the chief fund-raiser for the Clinton Foundation, and it employs a couple dozen staff members. Mr. Cheng, who attends the events with Mrs. Clinton, offers donors a number of contribution options that provide them and their families varying levels of access to Mrs. Clinton. John Morgan, a Florida lawyer and donor, described Mr. Cheng as \u201cthe master concierge.\u201dFor a donation of $2,700, the children (under 16) of donors at an event last month at the Sag Harbor, N.Y., estate of the hedge fund magnate Adam Sender could ask Mrs. Clinton a question. A family photo with Mrs. Clinton cost $10,000, according to attendees.And when Mrs. Clinton attended a dinner at the Beverly Hills home of the entertainment executive Haim Saban last month, the invitation was very clear. If attendees wanted to dine and receive a photo with Mrs. Clinton they had to pay their own way: \u201cWrite not raise\u201d $100,000.Another advantage to choosing private fund-raisers over town halls or other public events is that Mrs. Clinton can bask in an affectionate embrace as hosts try to limit confrontational engagements.Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, a backer of Democrats and a friend of the Clintons\u2019, made sure attendees did not grill Mrs. Clinton at the $100,000-per-couple lamb dinner Mrs. Forester de Rothschild hosted under a tent on the lawn of her oceanfront Martha\u2019s Vineyard mansion.\u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s make it a nice night for her and show her our love,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Forester de Rothschild said.12 PhotosAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Moment of Truth for Presidential Debate Moderators", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorIf this hasn\u2019t been the worst year ever for truth in politics, I can\u2019t think of what was. Nor can anyone tell me.The Republican presidential nominee has produced more falsehoods than the major fact-checking sites have identified from a major presidential candidate since they came into existence. The Democratic nominee hasn\u2019t come anywhere close to that. But she\u2019s not exactly dwelling in Honest Abe territory, either.Traditional journalism has struggled to keep up with it all. It has been overwhelmed by the legion of assertions that scream out for fact-checking; undercut, at times, by journalists\u2019 human failings and the economic imperatives of ratings and page views; and under siege from partisan attacks intended to bully it out of doing its job.And, yes, that is going to require the debate moderators to interject with the truth when either candidate makes an obviously false statement.Inexplicably, the pre-debate debate has been dominated by the question of whether it is within the debate moderators\u2019 purview to do that.That treats falsehood like a hockey puck being moved up and down the ice, and forces each candidate into goalie pads. What this political season really needs is a confident and credible referee, or a few thousand.For many viewers, a well-honed lie will stick to the candidate on the receiving end of it \u2014 who, if past is prologue, is more likely to be Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Trump.And the Commission on Presidential Debates will be failing in its own mission \u201cto ensure that debates, as a permanent part of every general election, provide the best possible information to viewers and listeners.\u201dThe commission has put its thumb on the noninterventionist side of the scale. When I spoke recently with the co-chairman, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., he said that the moderator\u2019s job was \u201cto be a facilitator \u2014 to raise the issues and draw out the candidates and hopefully get them to interact themselves.\u201dThat, he said, is different from a news program on which \u201cyou\u2019ve got your notes of what so-and-so said: \u2018Governor, you said this three weeks ago and now you\u2019re changing the story.\u2019 That\u2019s an interview, not what\u2019s supposed to happen in a debate.\u201dIn 1987, Mr. Fahrenkopf, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, co-founded the debate commission with Paul G. Kirk, who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee. And it is no small thing that they chose to put journalists at the center of the action.It was before interparty civility skipped town, and before internet-enabled, ideology-infused news sites and partisan press critics undermined the prominence and credibility of the mainstream news media. It was a time when a news outlet\u2019s success was dependent upon its track record of getting stories right, not on how far it was willing to go to make its coverage hew to the worldview of its readers.The gatekeeper role the news media used to play has been rightly criticized for stanching those views that fell outside its decidedly mainstream perspective. But it also meant that campaigns generally sparred within the confines of the same set of established and true facts.Mr. Trump has unleashed a blizzard of falsehoods, exaggerations and outright lies in the general election. Here's our analysis of 31 untruths from Sept. 15-21.Such findings should bring a new appreciation for fair-minded journalists to those who care about having government policies that are based on the truth. As the historian Michael Beschloss put it during a phone conversation last week, \u201cWe are now in an age where there are so many fewer gatekeepers that you need what few are possible.\u201dCan the moderators this fall turn their debate stages into falsehood-free zones? What does that look like in this election? Debate organizers say they want to avoid a situation in which the debate becomes one big fact-checking or hectoring exercise and never gets to important policy differences. They also don\u2019t want the stage to be a hill for the moderator \u2014 and thus the whole debate process \u2014 to die on, amid charges of partisanship and a \u201crigged\u201d system.Mr. Obama had more or less done so the next day, though, as Ms. Crowley sought to point out, his administration spent several days thereafter connecting it to protests against an incendiary, anti-Islam video. PolitiFact called Mr. Romney\u2019s statement \u201chalf-true,\u201d which gave more ammunition to Republicans who accused Ms. Crowley of singling out their candidate unfairly.But one clumsy attempt at fact-checking, and the partisan attacks it drew, should not be used to muzzle this year\u2019s moderators.Actually, scratch that. One person does \u2014 Mr. Trump, who portrayed critics of Mr. Lauer as liberals seeking to push debate moderators to be tougher on him than on Mrs. Clinton. There\u2019s one way both he and Mrs. Clinton can avoid lopsided treatment: Tell the truth.Research was contributed by Megan Thee-Brenan and Zachary Wichter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venture Communism: How China Is Building a Start-Up Boom", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANGZHOU, China \u2014 In Dream Town, a collection of boxy office buildings on the gritty edge of this historic city, one tiny company is developing a portable 3-D printer. Another takes orders for traditional Chinese massages by smartphone. They are just two of the 710 start-ups being nurtured here.Anywhere else, an incubator like Dream Town would be a vision of venture capitalists, angel investors or technology stalwarts. But this is China. The Chinese Communist Party doesn\u2019t trust the invisible hand of capitalism alone to encourage entrepreneurship, especially since it is a big part of the leadership\u2019s strategy to reshape the sagging economy.Which is why the government of Hangzhou \u2014 a former royal capital that has been a major commercial hub for more than a millennium \u2014 built Dream Town and lavishes resources on start-ups. The businesses here get a slate of benefits like subsidized rent, cash handouts and special training, all courtesy of the city.Chemayi, which offers car repair services through a smartphone app, is staying rent-free at Dream Town for three years and is applying for as much as $450,000 in subsidies from city authorities to help pay salaries and buy equipment.\u201cFrom the central government all the way down to local governments, we have seen a lot of warm support,\u201d said Li Liheng, co-founder and chief executive of Chemayi.For much of China\u2019s long economic boom, young people flocked to manufacturing zones for jobs making bluejeans or iPhones. But today China is trying to move beyond just being the world\u2019s factory floor. Policy makers want the next generation to find better-paying work in modern offices, creating the ideas, technologies and jobs to feed the country\u2019s future growth.Premier Li Keqiang frequently calls for \u201cmass entrepreneurship.\u201d In March at the National People\u2019s Congress, he bragged that 12,000 new companies were founded each day in 2015.The entrepreneurial embrace comes with lots of financial support. Across the country, officials are creating investment funds, providing cash subsidies and building incubators.\u201cWithout these kinds of subsidies, you only rely on private money, and you wouldn\u2019t see so many technology start-ups happening today,\u201d said Ning Tao, a partner at Innovation Works, a venture capital fund in Beijing. \u201cWithout quantity, you cannot have quality.\u201dBut the heavy spending is adding to worries about an inflating bubble in the world of China\u2019s tiniest companies. Along with the government funds, venture capital money is flooding the country. About $49 billion in deals were made last year, making China second only to the United States, according to the accounting firm Ernst & Young.Some economists and entrepreneurs are concerned that the government is helping fuel a frenzy that might ultimately result in failed businesses, wasted resources and financial losses. Just one city, Suzhou, near Shanghai, has announced it will open 300 incubators by 2020 to house 30,000 start-ups.Beijing\u2019s policy makers have a long history of giving favored companies easy access to loans and subsidies to propel certain industries, with both good and bad consequences. Though that tactic lubricated the nation\u2019s industrialization, it also contributed to the excess that has buried the country in empty apartment blocks, mothballed cement plants and sputtering steel mills \u2014 all of which threaten the economy\u2019s stability.\u201cI think the subsidies shouldn\u2019t be a long-term policy,\u201d Jin Xiangrong, an economist at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, said of the start-up support programs. \u201cThey can lead to overcapacity like the kind we see now in China\u2019s manufacturing sector, which is largely a result of government support.\u201dHangzhou city officials turned down requests for interviews.At Dream Town, Mr. Li, 39, frets more about his own business. He got the initial idea for Chemayi in 2009 after a car accident. To find a trustworthy mechanic, he searched online, asked friends for advice and visited repair shops.But Mr. Li found it difficult to judge who was reliable. A car culture \u2014 and all the services that come with it \u2014 is relatively new in China.Aiming to fill the information void, he and three friends set up Chemayi in 2013 with 5 million renminbi (currently $750,000) of their own money. For an annual fee, Chemayi sends out staff members to help fix flat tires, paint scratches or repair broken-down engines.\u201cHenry Ford is gone for so many years, but we are still driving his cars,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cI felt that I also must pursue a cause that will persist after I\u2019m gone.\u201dChemayi beat out more than two dozen other start-ups for a coveted space in Dream Town in a 2014 competition. Another co-founder, Ouyang Feng, delivered a 40-minute presentation to a panel of judges who peppered him with questions about Chemayi\u2019s business model and future prospects. The provincial governor watched over the grilling.In the end, the committee awarded Chemayi a three-foot golden key that symbolically opened the doors to Dream Town.Chemayi now has 284 employees in four cities, with plans to reach 1,000 by the end of the year. Mr. Li said his company had raised $22 million in private money and turned a profit of about 10 million renminbi last year.\u201cA lot of Chinese people want to be successful. They want to initiate change through innovation,\u201d Mr. Li said in his spacious corner office, while fussing with a traditional Chinese wooden tea-making set. \u201cThat is a formidable power.\u201dHangzhou is a natural center for China\u2019s start-up fever. After China embraced capitalist reform in the 1980s, Zhejiang province, of which Hangzhou is the capital, emerged as a leading base for the export industries that fueled the country\u2019s rapid growth. Factories pumped out products like socks and plastic Christmas trees.Now that zeal for commerce is being channeled into technology start-ups. Hangzhou is home to China\u2019s most famous internet company, the e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has become a training ground for would-be entrepreneurs.The neighborhoods near Alibaba\u2019s sprawling campus, once a poorly developed area on the city\u2019s outskirts, now make up a budding tech center with newly built office parks like Dream Town, dominated by ambitious college graduates, angel investors and venture capitalists. The local restaurants have become hangouts to exchange ideas and gossip over fried squid and stewed pork and eggs.Feng Xiao is typical of this new breed. Mr. Feng, 39 and a Hangzhou native, spent 11 years at Alibaba, mainly in sales and marketing.\u201cThere is a Chinese proverb, \u2018The soil is too rich,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feng said. Alibaba \u201coffered you a lot of opportunities. It was easy to have a sense of success. But I wanted to be able to start from scratch.\u201dHis start-up was born in Alibaba\u2019s cafeteria, where he ate meal after meal. \u201cI really missed Mom\u2019s cooking,\u201d he said. He figured that many other people, trapped working for long hours far from home, felt the same.Mr. Feng and two other Alibaba employees left their jobs in 2014 and opened a food delivery service, Mishi. Their plan was to connect people willing to prepare homemade meals with on-the-go professionals who were too busy to cook. They set up shop in a friend\u2019s empty house, decorated with secondhand furniture and photos from home.Along with raising $19 million from private investors, Mishi caught the eye of the Hangzhou city government. In 2014, district officials awarded Mishi 5 million renminbi to help pay the bills. Its rent in a Hangzhou office park is also subsidized.\u201cThe most important thing on the part of the government is whether they are open\u201d to new types of businesses, Mr. Feng said. \u201cWe are glad to see they are aggressively supporting us.\u201dHangzhou represents what Chinese leaders see as the nation\u2019s economic future. The country used to generate astronomical growth rates by depending heavily on low-cost exports and extremely high investment in apartment towers, factories and highways. China built so many steel mills that it can produce 10 times as much steel as the United States.But today, costs are rising, eating away at the competitiveness of many export industries. The long investment boom has saddled the economy with too many factories and a mountain of debt.Instead, policy makers are encouraging a shift to new growth engines, like services and high tech. The entrepreneurial focus is providing an economic boost for Hangzhou.The city\u2019s gross domestic product rose 10.2 percent in 2015, compared with the 6.9 percent national growth rate. Hangzhou\u2019s service sector, which includes many start-ups, was the main engine of that strong performance, surging 14.6 percent.\u201cThe Chinese know that state-owned enterprises are not going to employ everybody,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at GGV Capital, a venture capital firm that operates in both Silicon Valley and China. \u201cThey need young people to create jobs for themselves, so they are encouraging them to try something new.\u201dMishi, the food delivery start-up, has created 100 full-time jobs, and has bolstered the incomes of more than 10,000 home chefs.Cai Liangen, a retired businessman turned Mishi cook, learned about the start-up when a marketing team visited his apartment complex seeking to enlist new chefs.Last November, he and his wife began making local specialties in their kitchen, including a sliced pork dish prepared with \u201cmy mother\u2019s secret recipe,\u201d Mr. Cai said. They now receive 40 orders a day and earn 5,000 renminbi a month, increasing their total income 70 percent.\u201cWe do it because we love to cook,\u201d Mr. Cai said, \u201cbut the money is good to have, too.\u201dAfter submitting a 10-page proposal in 2014 to join a Hangzhou incubator, Ai Binke sat nervously before a committee of tech industry executives who questioned his future prospects. His software company, Yun Ran Internet of Things, had only four employees, and its business deals had been small. But his start-up, Mr. Ai explained to the committee, had great potential.That was sufficient for the judges to award him 100,000 renminbi in subsidies. The bulk, roughly 70 percent, was instantly transferred into his corporate bank account. \u201cAs long as you run projects that are encouraged by the Hangzhou government, you can get the subsidies,\u201d said Mr. Ai, 29. \u201cIt\u2019s not very difficult.\u201dLocal governments around China are spending heavily on start-ups. In Shenzhen, authorities are offering to subsidize up to 70 percent of rent for \u201ccreative\u201d start-ups. Local officials in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu are setting up a 200 million renminbi \u201centrepreneurship and innovation development fund\u201d and promising subsidies of up to 5 million renminbi.Officials in Guangdong province in China\u2019s south will cover part of a start-up\u2019s losses. Even the lesser-known city of Yingtan, in an area of Jiangxi province mainly known for its ancient Taoist temples, is planning to build an incubator.Hangzhou\u2019s government has been one of the more active. Officials are forming a venture capital fund of 4.7 billion renminbi , with contributions from companies, according to the city\u2019s website. This year, Hangzhou announced that it would give 100 million renminbi annually to help start-ups pay expenses.But governments historically have a spotty record of using state-directed money to generate business success stories.In China, government efforts to assist new businesses have often led to waste and excess. Too much investment pours into favored industries, spawning poorly conceived projects in areas like hotels and solar panels. By trying to spur start-ups, the state is also engaging in a high-risk business that even for the most experienced venture capitalist is prone to produce more failures than successes.Hangzhou officials are trying to avoid such pitfalls. At Dream Town, the financial aid is often linked to a start-up\u2019s performance. The amount of free rent depends on how much private capital a company can raise. Cash handouts are tied to revenue targets or top-selling apps.Government officials also enlist professionals to help allocate the city\u2019s money. The committee that judges applicants to Dream Town is usually made up of tech executives, financiers and academics.Ye Feng, a manager at another incubator who has sat as a judge on three occasions, said she quizzed the contenders on their technology, business plan and even product pricing.Usually about 30 start-ups appear at each competition. No more than four make the cut to enter Dream Town. \u201cThe competition is quite fierce,\u201d Ms. Ye said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to make a decision.\u201dBut some in Hangzhou fear that the government is doling out too much money, and it is flowing to start-ups with weak business plans and feeble prospects. Mr. Ai of Yun Ran said that two neighbors also received city subsidies. One, a robotics start-up, failed to attract private capital and closed, while the other, a mobile game company, is struggling to stay afloat as its business withers.The government money, Mr. Ai said, often cannot replace the private capital necessary for start-ups. \u201cWithout financing, it would be very hard for them to survive,\u201d he said.Owen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Courts Foreign Money in Effort to Become Gas Exporter", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Israel\u2019s energy minister laid on the charm as he spoke to a few dozen oil executives, contractors and analysts in a crowded hotel conference room about the country\u2019s natural gas prospects.He crowed that the country could one day be a top supplier to Europe, while explaining how multinationals in other industries were already enamored of Israel.\u201cIt is not enough to have a lot of potential,\u201d said the minister, Yuval Steinitz, who was kicking off a road show for energy investors on Thursday at the Copthorne Tara Hotel in London. \u201cFrom now on it is my job to make Israel very attractive for new exploration, for new investments, for newcomers.\u201dIsrael is courting international money as it tries to nurture a fledgling gas industry and evolve into an energy exporter. For the first time, the country is offering drilling leases in the Mediterranean waters off its coast, testing investors\u2019 appetite and its own energy ambitions.It is a major shift for a country that closed its territorial waters for the last four years while the government wrestled with how to regulate the new industry. Although the regulatory issues are largely resolved, Israel may get a chilly investment reception, given the weakness in the energy markets, the country\u2019s political risk and the general uncertainty in the region.Israel \u201cis not a straightforward place to be going in and doing stuff,\u201d said Trevor Sikorski, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm based in London.An up-and-comer in the energy landscape, Israel is trying to get to the next level.Mr. Steinitz, the energy minister, estimates that Israeli waters could hold 75 trillion cubic feet of gas. If that much extractable gas were found, Israel\u2019s reserves would be in the same ballpark as those of energy powerhouses like Norway and Canada.Two major finds by Noble Energy and its Israeli partners have proved the existence of substantial resources. One field, Tamar, now supplies the fuel for a sizable portion of Israeli electricity production.\u201cWe are not selling garbage here,\u201d said Nati Birenboim of the Tamuz Group, based in Tel Aviv, which advises investors on Israeli energy projects. \u201cWe totally believe, following the last Israeli big discoveries, that the potential is huge.\u201dNow, Israel is hoping to replicate the recent successes of its neighbor Egypt.A longstanding oil and gas producer, Egypt is attracting major new investment at a time when many oil and gas companies are throttling back globally because of weak energy prices. Both BP and the Italian company ENI have multibillion-dollar gas projects underway in Egypt.\u201cAll around the region you are seeing activity,\u201d said Brenda Shaffer, a visiting researcher at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies, who has advised the Israeli government on energy. \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t want to miss the boat.\u201dIsrael\u2019s energy ambitions, in part, are commercial. The natural gas industry has already helped reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported fuels that cause more pollution, like coal and oil. The government also wants to expand the field of players in the industry, which is now dominated by Noble Energy, a midsize American company.There is also a geopolitical dimension. The country has the potential to become an exporter to Europe, as well as Turkey and Arab countries like Egypt and Jordan, providing at least a modest alternative to Russia. The United States government has helped facilitate this regional commerce as a way to encourage coordination and cooperation between former enemies.\u201cThe United States believes that the discoveries of offshore gas in the Eastern Mediterranean present an opportunity for economic prosperity and regional security,\u201d said Amos J. Hochstein, the State Department\u2019s special envoy and coordinator for international energy affairs. \u201cThat is why we have been actively engaged to help overcome obstacles to achieve this goal.\u201dBut Israel may find it challenging to attract investors.The environment has broadly cooled, as gas prices in Europe have dropped more than 50 percent in the last four years. Major oil companies, with revenue slashed, are being pickier about the projects they finance. And players with projects in the Arab countries may be politically wary of investing in Israel.\u201cI think there will be interest, but it won\u2019t likely come from the majors due to political considerations,\u201d said Martijn Murphy, an analyst at the Edinburgh energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, referring to the largest oil companies.Although midsize companies may be a more likely bet, the costs \u2014 $100 million or more for drilling wells in deep areas \u2014 may prove daunting. Adding to the hurdles, operators may need to find new destinations for the gas, assuming they find some. Demand in Israel, while growing, is still relatively modest.The going \u201chasn\u2019t been that smooth in Israel,\u201d said Mr. Sikorski, the gas analyst. That may weigh against the country for investors that \u201chave lots of stuff to do and limited capital.\u201dIsabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island Hold Congressional Primaries", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe congressional primary season essentially draws to a close on Tuesday with contests in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, ending a long slog of state races that produced few upsets despite the volatile electorate.In Delaware, Democrats will choose their candidate to replace the state\u2019s sole House member, Representative John Carney, who is running for governor. It is a six-way race, with polling scant in the state, but the Democratic contender will be a heavy favorite to win in November.Among the perceived front-runners are Lisa Blunt Rochester, the former state labor secretary who has the chance to be both the first woman and African-American sent to Congress by Delaware voters. Also on the ballot are Bryan Townsend, a state senator, and Sean Barney, an Iraq war veteran who has drawn support from veterans groups.In New Hampshire, Senator Kelly Ayotte is expected to easily win the Republican Senate primary and officially become the candidate for her competitive race against Maggie Hassan, the Democratic governor. In the state\u2019s First Congressional District, Representative Frank Guinta, who has faced scrutiny for campaign finance violations, is in a tough race against fellow Republican Rich Ashooh.In Rhode Island, two Democratic House incumbents are expected to prevail easily.There are still a few loose ends. A federal judge has ordered a special Republican congressional primary in New York\u2019s Third District for Oct. 6. And Louisiana will conduct its first round of congressional elections on Election Day, Nov. 8, with runoffs held on Dec. 10 in cases where no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rice Energy Acquisition Shows Limits of Natural Gas Deals", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsRice Energy, a gas producer focused on Appalachia, is testing the limits of the thaw in energy mergers and acquisitions in the United States.The company\u2019s $2.7 billion offer to acquire Vantage Energy, which had planned to go public, follows a spate of transactions in oil shale regions. Rice Energy\u2019s plan to pay partly in shares will limit debt. Yet unlike its rival EOG Resources, whose shares jumped on news of its recent $2.5 billion acquisition, Rice\u2019s shares fell.Vantage owns around 85,000 acres adjoining Rice\u2019s properties in the gas-rich Marcellus shale region, along with some other assets. The buyer says that should help it increase production by 70 percent next year. Paying more than a third of the total consideration in newly issued shares will limit the strain on the balance sheet.After factoring in the planned disposal of some gas infrastructure to an affiliate, analysts at Jefferies estimate that Rice is paying around $10,600 an acre, a figure that is cheap compared with the roughly $12,400 an acre that Vantage recently paid for some Marcellus property.Despite these benefits, the 7 percent drop in the value of Rice\u2019s shares on Tuesday morning suggests that investors have reservations. It is true that most oil and gas producers were trading lower on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia and Iran scotched hopes of an OPEC production cut. The dip in Rice\u2019s share price may also reflect the roughly 6 percent discount it is offering on the new shares it will use to finance the purchase.It is nevertheless a contrast to EOG, whose shares rose nearly 7 percent when it announced a cash-and-stock deal this month to buy the privately listed Yates Petroleum \u2013 one of a string of recent transactions in Texas\u2019s oil-rich Permian Basin. Coupled with the fact that Vantage\u2019s private equity owners have decided to sell rather than follow through with their plans for an initial public offering of stock, it suggests that, despite a recent price rally, American natural gas is not yet inspiring the same animal spirits as oil.Advertisement"}

If they were to move, or return to their homeland of Austria, they could easily rent it out.In East Hampton, \u201cyou see many \u2018for sale\u2019 signs,\u201d Ms. Rodiek said. \u201cIt seems that every other house is on the market.\u201d She met Hara Kang, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, when she inquired about a listing.Houses in the couple\u2019s price range, however, were either in need of a complete renovation, with problems like puddles in the basement, or endlessly quirky, Ms. Rodiek said. The budget rose.\u201cDuring that time, there were a lot more reno projects than there were turnkey projects,\u201d Mr. Kang said.Ms. Rodiek liked a 1974 four-bedroom house on Jasons Lane, nicely redone inside. The asking price was $1.245 million. The couple\u2019s offer of $1.08 million was accepted.But after the inspection, the couple returned in the evening and noticed that traffic noise from a major road was audible. \u201cI wanted to not hear any cars unless they are driving to the house,\u201d Ms. Rodiek said.They also preferred less shade. \u201cWe needed more sun, more brightness on the property,\u201d Mr. Pilloni said. But the place is in a groundwater-protection district with restrictions on cutting down trees. The couple withdrew their offer.

Its location on a small bluff on Semaphore Road gave it a water view in winter. The kitchen/dining area was enormous. \u201cYou could fit 50 people into this kitchen, just standing and having crackers,\u201d Ms. Rodiek said.She thought the place was too big, but Mr. Pilloni liked big houses. They bid $1.29 million, but the price was firm and their offer was declined. The house is still on the market.Then Mr. Kang mentioned another house for $1.29 million, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms, on almost 1.8 acres with a swimming pool. It had been built in 1986, and needed some renovations, \u201cbut you could live in it and do nothing to it,\u201d Mr. Kang said.The house was bright and airy inside, with high ceilings. \u201cIt had a giant \u201980s black leather sofa in the middle of the living room, and I could imagine what it would look like with our furniture,\u201d Ms. Rodiek said. \u201cEven though it was completely dated, it was nice and clean.\u201d The location was within biking distance of both beach and village.She immediately knew this was the one.

(Ms. Boxer is 75, her fellow-senator, Dianne Feinstein, is 83, and Gov. Jerry Brown just turned 78.)Instead, the race has turned into something of a snooze. For one thing, it has been almost completely overshadowed by the presidential contest. For another, the electoral system in place \u2014 where the top two winners of a primary face each other in a general, regardless of party \u2014 means that both candidates are Democrats.As a result, in a year when Democrats are hoping to take over the Senate, California is not going to make a difference. And the fact that both candidates are of the same party means that Ms. Sanchez and Ms. Harris don\u2019t have a lot to argue about \u2014 and that Democratic donors don\u2019t have much reason to write them checks.Polls shows Ms. Harris with a significant lead over Ms. Sanchez.

Statewide, the earnings ratio was about 86 percent, the study said.It turns out, however, that this rare distinction may have had little to do with the shattering of glass ceilings.The 37th district, which includes Culver City and neighborhoods in the south and west of Los Angeles, is made up of a combined majority of African-Americans and Hispanics with only roughly a quarter of residents who are white.Researchers say that because black and Hispanic men earn much less on average than white men, the gender pay gap within those groups is much narrower.The relatively small white population in the 37th district, along with other contributing factors like minimum pay rules and a slightly younger work force, combined to level out wages across genders, said Catherine Hill, a vice president for research at the American Association of University Women.\u201cSo, unfortunately, that\u2019s not the good news, right?\u201d she said. \u201cThe good news would be we see higher women\u2019s wages, not that this is an area we see lower male wages.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Sarah Jessica Parker, Leaving Carrie Behind With HBO\u2019s \u2018Divorce\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "Ms. Parker makes clear that \u201cDivorce,\u201d her first HBO series since \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u201cis not Carrie in the suburbs.\u201dSupported bySarah Jessica Parker was waiting for a menu at a restaurant in Hastings-on-Hudson, a Westchester County suburb of New York, when a 50-something man in a polo shirt and shorts showed up at her table. \u201cI\u2019m out of your face right after this little note I made for you \u2014 check it out,\u201d he said. He handed her a small folded piece of paper and waited as Ms. Parker read it. \u201cAw,\u201d she said, and smiled. \u201cThank you! Thank you, Michael!\u201dIn spite of Ms. Parker\u2019s age (51), her 19 years of marriage to Matthew Broderick, and her three children, her public image remains closely bound up with that of Carrie, a symbol of youthful possibility, forever available, forever adorable.\u201cI\u2019m still getting to know her,\u201d Ms. Parker said. She was quick to clarify that she is no more Frances than she ever was Carrie (she and Mr. Broderick married about a week before she shot the pilot). But \u201cDivorce,\u201d at turns moody and comic, does cover material that is meaningful to Ms. Parker, who is an executive producer of the series. For some years, she has wanted to do a show about long-term relationships, a natural outgrowth, she said, of countless conversations she has had with friends who, like her, are in early middle age, a time when it\u2019s common for people to grapple with the choices they have made, in relationships as much as anything else. The show reflects, she said, a \u201ccertain introspection and reckoning\u201d that is inevitable after some 15 or 20 years of marriage.\u201cIt\u2019s a really specific point in a person\u2019s life, right now, for my generation,\u201d said Ms. Parker. \u201cIt\u2019s when you start to think about relationships, the time spent, what came of it \u2014 and what do you do with where you find yourself now?\u201dMs. Parker spent much of her energy in recent years leveraging her brand in the service of high culture (she is vice chair of the New York City Ballet) and her own businesses \u2014 a fragrance line and the SJP shoe collection, which she introduced in 2014 and is carried by high-end department stores. All along, she developed television and film ideas as a producer, including, for some time, a show called \u201cInto the Fire,\u201d which HBO passed on. It featured a talk-show host who quits her job, blows up her career and has an affair with the father of one of her children\u2019s classmates.In some of its details, \u201cInto the Fire\u201d sounds like \u201cGirlfriends\u2019 Guide to Divorce,\u201d which has been renewed for a third season on Bravo, one of a number of television shows in recent years that have featured women in their late 40s or early 50s reinventing their love lives: On \u201cNashville,\u201d Rayna, played by Connie Britton, ends her marriage and enjoys a succession of suitors; on \u201cThe Affair,\u201d Helen (Maura Tierney) is betrayed by her cheating husband but goes on to have flings of her own. \u201cI want to save my life while I still care about it,\u201d Frances tells Robert, trying to explain why she wants a divorce; it\u2019s as if some sense of imminently fading possibility propels Frances into new romance.The bar was \u201cquite high\u201d for Ms. Parker\u2019s return, said Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s chief executive, who felt this show reached that standard. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Hollywoodization of divorce,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a very authentic one, something she could sink her teeth into creatively and artistically.\u201d Both Mr. Plepler and Ms. Parker mentioned the influence of \u201cAn Unmarried Woman,\u201d the 1978 Jill Clayburgh film that offered an unflinching look at how a flawed but charming wife handles being unexpectedly single after her husband walks out.Ms. Parker was comfortable with embracing her own character\u2019s flaws, said Paul Simms, the showrunner of \u201cDivorce.\u201d \u201cI was a little surprised and pleased that she was willing to not worry about being necessarily likable,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though she ultimately is quite likable.\u201dThough Ms. Parker spoke of the characters in \u201cDivorce\u201d as middle class, it might be more accurate to say they are upper middle class in appearance, middle class in disposable income; they look like a couple with fancy educations, now tenuously maintaining a gimcrack normalcy post-crash, with the help of revolving credit lines and some just-in-time turns of luck. If Mr. Big, Carrie\u2019s beloved, represented one \u201990s male icon, the finance type, Robert, with his debt and pickup truck, represents a very current countertype, a disempowered white guy baffled to find things are no longer going his way.One morning, she arrived at the clock, perfectly prompt, dressed in Swedish-chic chunky sandals and an oatmeal-colored, 1970s-style sundress (\u201cVintage,\u201d she said, \u201cI probably paid $29 for it.\u201d) As she walked through the terminal, she moved quickly, accustomed to people stopping in their tracks, stupefied, as they recognized her. When someone tried to approach her to talk, she had a warm but effective response at the ready: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I wish I could, thank you so much, I have to catch my train!\u201d She offered a big smile, a girlish wave, direct eye contact, somehow meeting the energy of the fan with enthusiasm of her own. From a distance, to a tourist, she might have seemed a holographic conjuring, an icon of turn-of-millennium New York there to enhance the iconic New York setting.She could not have known then how much cultural currency television would come to have \u2014 or how big a role she herself would play in establishing its ascendancy. With that influence came celebrity and the kind of public scrutiny that stings, especially for a parent; paparazzi and tabloid reporters are often camped outside her family\u2019s Lower Manhattan home. There have also long been tabloid rumors about the demise of her marriage, which might make the choice of a show called \u201cDivorce\u201d seem revealing, as if it were some subconscious confirmation of her preoccupations.That the public might think that, Ms. Parker said, suggests a misunderstanding of what really motivates her as an actor. \u201cWhen people ask about the ways in which I relate to Frances, I usually say, \u2018I look like her, but that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing to ask, because all you want to do as an actor is be someone else.\u201d Why, she added, \u201cwould you ever want to play someone like you?\u201dMs. Parker sounded genuinely bewildered by the persistence of tabloid interest in her marriage. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because we just \u2026 keep staying married,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that annoys them?\u201d Mr. Broderick, she said, is \u201cstill the person I want to experience things with, I want to do new things with.\u201d It may be a sign of the health of their current relationship that neither party feels the need to portray it as any more perfect than most that have weathered three children, two big careers and nearly two decades.Ms. Parker described marriage as a series of choices \u2014 choosing to stay, choosing to find patience in it. \u201cIt\u2019s saying, I\u2019m going to try not to roll my eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s thinking about the delight in something that\u2019s delightful to him, but that may or may not be to you.\u201dAsked what Ms. Parker might enjoy about playing Frances, Mr. Broderick thought for a moment. \u201cShe gets to be pissed off at her husband, which I think would be fun for her,\u201d he deadpanned. But his protectiveness of Ms. Parker, as she prepared for her show\u2019s debut, was evident. \u201cI\u2019m always nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching your child walk onto the playground. You want them to be treated well. And when they\u2019re not, it\u2019s horrible to watch.\u201dMs. Parker seems to relish the gap between the show\u2019s plot and her own reality, the way she can experience the aftershocks of a dissolution from a safe creative distance. \u201cFrances was never single with children, never single with a mortgage \u2014 so I think all that\u2019s going to be really interesting,\u201d she said, already musing about a second season. \u201cHow much does she want to date? How much does she really want to take her clothes off with someone?\u201dMs. Parker slapped her hand against her chest. \u201cCan you imagine? I\u2019d be like \u2014 no, we are just going to be companions. I\u2019d be horrified!\u201dOver lunch, Ms. Parker confessed that she was somewhat terrified about the show\u2019s premiere, partly for fear that her fans might be expecting something the show was not \u2014 that they would judge it not by its own merits, but by how closely it inspired the same giddy pleasures that her previous work has.\u201cThis is not Carrie in the suburbs, Carrie the commuter,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I kind of want to get ahead of that, so that there is not this giant heave of disappointment when people find the show is not \u2026 that same buoyant kind of thing.\u201d\u201cBut it was definitely acting,\u201d she said. \u201cI never lived any of those experiences in my own life. I\u2019m not Carrie. Sometimes I feel that if I\u2019d done my job well with \u2018Divorce,\u2019 it will be a reminder that, yes, she\u2019s an actor. But maybe people will start to think I\u2019m like Frances. And then I\u2019ll have to explain how different Sarah and Frances are.\u201d She brightened at the thought.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the date that the HBO series \u201cDivorce\u201d begins. It is Oct. 9, not Oct. 29.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Not a College Degree in Sports?", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn CampusBoulder, Colo. \u2014 A new influx of money into big-time college sports is likely to reinvigorate debate over whether student athletes should be paid as if they were professionals, with colleges running semipro teams as side projects to their research and teaching missions.But one question that gets little attention is how schools can keep big-time athletics connected to their academic objectives. Perhaps one way is for universities to award degrees in athletics.This isn\u2019t a new idea. In 1990, in the wake of a series of college athletic scandals, the economist William F. Shughart II asked a simple question in an op-ed essay in The Wall Street Journal: \u201cWhy should academic credit be given for practicing the violin, but not for practicing a three-point shot?\u201dIt was a good question then and remains so today, though it is one that colleges and universities have yet to answer.But we ought to revisit it. College sports have never been bigger. Last weekend, nearly 157,000 people packed Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee to see the University of Tennessee battle Virginia Tech, the largest crowd ever to turn out for a football game, college or professional.With popularity comes money, and lots of it. In April, the N.C.A.A. signed a deal with CBS and Turner Broadcasting for an eight-year, $8.8 billion extension of their March Madness basketball TV contract to 2032, while the college football bowl series brings in more than $500 million annually.Athletic budgets have swelled as a result. Texas A&M is on the verge of becoming the first campus to bring in more than $200 million a year from athletics. The University of Iowa just announced a 10-year, $45 million contract extension for its football coach. In 40 states the highest paid public employee is a college coach.This monetary infusion is likely only to reinforce a divide between athletics and academics on college campuses. Creating degree programs in athletics might bring them closer together. And this wouldn\u2019t rule out providing greater compensation for student athletes; this is not an either/or proposition.Some colleges used to offer academic credit for participating in intercollegiate athletics, but these courses have fallen out of favor.Widespread prejudice and legitimate resentment against athletics remains in academia, and no wonder. The $6.9 million annual salary of Nick Saban, the head football coach at the University of Alabama, is equal to the combined average salary for nearly 100 assistant professors at the school, according to the most recent data available. And beyond such economic disparities, class distinctions of 19th-century England still shape thinking about sport: Classical music is valued by high society, while sport is for the masses.Still, the arguments are compelling for creating athletics majors on campus.Universities routinely give degrees in the performing arts, such as music, dance and theater, as Professor Shughart pointed out. In these programs performances are often given to audiences paying for the privilege of seeing exceptional talent on display.Beyond our cultural biases, what really is the difference between a Shakespeare play, an orchestra concert and a basketball game? Each performance requires some high-level combination of physical ability and mental acuity, developed through years of training and study, and for which only a select few reach elite levels.His case for athletics degrees is based on a \u201cstructured curriculum\u201d off the field, in areas such as \u201csports history, sports law, sports finance.\u201d Students would also have to meet general education requirements. Here at the University of Colorado, Boulder, for instance, we have begun an academic program in sports governance housed within the athletic department, serving the entire student body.More academic attention to sports issues is sorely needed. One only has to look to FIFA, the scandal-plagued body that oversees global soccer, and the Olympics, which were marked by allegations of systematic doping among Russian athletes, to see an emerging demand for better thinking and practice in sport.Academic programs in sport can train the next generation of sports leaders, and at the same time help universities bring athletics closer to their academic mission. Universities might look beyond the debate over college athletes as professionals, to seeing athletics as a worthwhile profession.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dropout by Dartmouth Raises Questions on Health Law Cost-Savings Effort", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In its quest to remake the nation\u2019s health care system, the Obama administration has urged doctors and hospitals to band together to improve care and cut costs, using a model devised by researchers at Dartmouth College.But Dartmouth itself, facing mounting financial losses in the federal program, has dropped out, raising questions about the future of the new entities known as accountable care organizations, created under the Affordable Care Act.The entities are in the vanguard of efforts under the health law to move Medicare away from a disjointed fee-for-service system to a new model that rewards doctors who collaborate and coordinate care.Medicare now has more than 400 accountable care organizations, serving eight million of the 57 million Medicare beneficiaries. Obama administration officials say the new entities are saving money while improving care, but some independent experts have questioned those claims.\u201cThere\u2019s little in the way of analysis or data about how A.C.O.s did in 2015,\u201d said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. \u201cThe results have not been a home run.\u201dIn addition, he said, \u201cthere is little reason to think that A.C.O.s will bend the cost curve in a meaningful way\u201d unless they bear more financial risk, sharing losses as well as savings with the government.An evaluation for the federal government found that Dartmouth\u2019s accountable care organization had reduced Medicare spending on hospital stays, medical procedures, imaging and tests. And it achieved goals for the quality of care. But it was still subject to financial penalties because it did not meet money-saving benchmarks set by federal officials.\u201cWe were cutting costs and saving money and then paying a penalty on top of that,\u201d said Dr. Robert A. Greene, an executive vice president of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock health system. \u201cWe would have loved to stay in the federal program, but it was just not sustainable.\u201dDr. Elliott S. Fisher, the director of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to achieve savings if, like Dartmouth, you are a low-cost provider to begin with. I helped design the model of accountable care organizations. So it\u2019s sad that we could not make it work here.\u201dDr. Greene offered this analogy: It is easier for a person who runs a mile in 12 minutes to reduce the time to 10 minutes than for a five-minute miler to break the four-minute barrier.Dartmouth-Hitchcock is the main teaching hospital for Dartmouth\u2019s medical school, of which the Dartmouth Institute is part.Since accountable care organizations began operation in 2012, a number like Dartmouth have dropped out of the program, citing financial uncertainties and unrealistic benchmarks for spending. Organizations with higher levels of prior spending had a greater ability to achieve cost savings in the first years of the program, by reducing unnecessary services, so they were more likely to qualify for financial rewards, according to the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress.The idea of accountable care organizations and the name are generally traced back to a paper in 2006 by Dr. Fisher and colleagues at Dartmouth and its medical school. Writing in the journal Health Affairs, they reported that Medicare beneficiaries received most of their care from doctors who were directly or indirectly affiliated with a local hospital.Rather than trying to measure the performance of individual doctors, they said, Medicare should assess the hospital and the doctors together and hold them jointly accountable for the cost and quality of care provided to a defined group of Medicare patients.In effect, this was an effort to overcome the fragmented nature of most American health care and to replicate some of the benefits of managed care while still allowing Medicare patients to visit any doctors they wanted.The new entities, unlike health maintenance organizations, \u201ccan\u2019t tell you which health care providers to see\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t limit your Medicare benefits,\u201d the Obama administration tells beneficiaries. But, it says, doctors and hospitals working together in an accountable care organization can share information, including test results and prescription drug data, so it is easier for them to coordinate care for patients.Under the law, doctors and hospitals can share in savings if they meet certain goals established by Medicare officials, who set separate benchmarks for each group of health care providers.Andrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that accountable care organizations were beginning to deliver tangible benefits. The current version is an early iteration \u201clike the iPhone 2,\u201d he said on Twitter.Dr. Fisher said he was cautiously optimistic about the future of accountable care organizations. \u201cEvidence on spending suggests modest savings over all,\u201d he said, though he acknowledged that in Medicare \u201cthe model has yet to achieve the benefits many advocates hoped for.\u201dAccountable care organizations are one of many demonstration projects being conducted by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, an office created by the Affordable Care Act to test new ways of financing and delivering care. Under the law, the secretary of health and human services has sweeping power to expand such projects nationwide if she finds that they would reduce Medicare spending without harming the quality of care.The center is testing new ways to pay for prescription drugs, medical devices, cancer care, hip replacement surgery and many other services.The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the center\u2019s activities will save $34 billion over the next 10 years, although it does not know which projects will save money.Republicans in Congress are taking aim at the center, saying its experiments jeopardize patients\u2019 access to care and usurp the authority of Congress. In some cases, doctors and patients are required to participate.\u201cThe agency has, in effect, enacted changes to the Medicare and Medicaid programs while circumventing Congress,\u201d said Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia and chairman of the House Budget Committee.The House Appropriations Committee has approved legislation that would eliminate $7 billion that remains available to the center.Democrats defend the innovation center, saying the nation desperately needs to find ways of delivering better care at lower cost. To shut down the center or block its work would amount to \u201ckilling the baby in the nursery before it ever grows up,\u201d said Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Government Moves to Close a Watchdog of For-Profit Colleges", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe council has said it plans to appeal the decision. \u201cWe believe that A.C.I.C.S. has demonstrated that the organization can come into compliance with the Department of Education\u2019s regulations within one year as required under the department\u2019s recognition criteria,\u201d Roger J. Williams, the council\u2019s chief executive, said in an email before the decision was issued.A.C.I.C.S. was responsible for approving roughly 240 institutions that received $4.7 billion in taxpayer money last year.An estimated 600,000 students currently attending schools the council has accredited are in no immediate danger of losing their federal financial aid. Regardless of any appeal, those schools have 18 months to secure the approval of another accreditor \u2014 although they might have to meet more stringent standards.Although several agencies have been under pressure for slipshod oversight, A.C.I.C.S. has frequently been singled out for the scale of its deficiencies and its low standards. A Senate committee, several state attorneys general, federal agencies and others are scrutinizing its record.Since the spring, the council has scrambled to regroup.Mr. Williams, who took over the top job in August after two predecessors resigned, said in an emailed response to questions that A.C.I.C.S. had taken several steps to strengthen its standards and practices. He listed new procedures to verify placement data, train its evaluators, identify institutions at risk and monitor recruiting by employing a \u201csecret shopper.\u201dFor-profit career colleges and accreditors have repeatedly emphasized that their students are more disadvantaged, giving that as the reason for their low graduation and high default rates. They tend to be poorer and older; many attend school while working and caring for families.\u201cWe have taken the criticisms seriously,\u201d Mr. Williams said, \u201cand regardless of whether some amongst us deemed particular points fair and others not, we have collectively supported and aggressively pursued a self-improvement plan.\u201dBen Miller, who wrote the Center for American Progress report and was formerly a senior policy adviser at the Education Department, remained skeptical. \u201cHow legitimate are last-minute, half-baked improvements that only came about once they were afraid enough about their future?\u201d he asked.Colleges and universities created accrediting panels as voluntary membership associations in the late 19th century as a way to standardize admissions, curriculum and degree requirements. After World War II, when the federal government started financing education through the G.I. Bill, it began to link accreditation to a school\u2019s eligibility for federal aid.A series of scandals led to the passage of stronger federal oversight in 1992. Those reforms were soon unwound by aggressive lobbying on the part of colleges and a wave of deregulation Congress pursued in the mid-90s.Three Democratic senators introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at strengthening the process. Their bill would require the Education Department to establish standards related to loans, graduation, retention, earnings and job placements, and require accreditors to respond more quickly to investigations and lawsuits.Advertisement"}

Richard Pryor had even tried to take it to Hollywood.But since a negative resurfaced two years ago, it has attained a certain mythic quality, connecting a disparate group of people across the country: New York preservationists dedicated to restoring it; a cultural historian in Louisiana devoting an academic paper to it; an archivist in Los Angeles fascinated with it. And the director\u2019s son, the music journalist and filmmaker Sacha Jenkins, who knew about the film but has never seen it, and who has been left with a question no small number of sons have asked about their fathers.\u201cWho was this guy?\u201dRecently, \u201cCane River\u201d was run through IndieCollect\u2019s digital scanner, which copies a film negative frame by frame, rendering positive images, but not a film copy. Mr. Jenkins was present for the run-through.\u201cBottom line,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, \u201cNo sound heard during this phase of the process. But I got to see the opening credits and a few scenes. Which was nice. A small taste of what is to come. What I did see looks fantastic. The way the lead character is dressed reminds me of my dad. Nice memories.\u201dVery few people have seen \u201cCane River\u201d since 1982. Ed Carter, an archivist who has been processing hundreds of those DuArt films for the academy, has yet to screen the movie. The music producer Gary J. Edwards, who found a 35-millimeter print in a New Orleans junk shop several years ago, hasn\u2019t watched it either. And neither has the son of the man who made it.Inside the bustling SoHo offices of Mass Appeal magazine, where he is the creative director, he appeared to be a man refereeing his mixed emotions.\u201cAs a kid, a big part of my identity was: \u2018My dad\u2019s a filmmaker. He\u2019s won Emmy Awards. He\u2019s completed all these things,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, who was 11 when his father died. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have anything tangible. It was real to me inside, because I knew it to be true, but no one else knew. So in the back of my mind it\u2019s been a big part of what\u2019s driven me to do what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\u201cThese are things my father would have been interested in,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a common issue, because there was a lot of intermarriage and, of course, slavery,\u201d said Carol Balthazar, who was Horace Jenkins\u2019s partner, and whose family history provided the movie\u2019s historical backdrop.The younger Mr. Jenkins said it\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d how many people have suddenly been drawn to his father\u2019s work.Mr. Carter, for instance, can\u2019t quite put his finger on why he has done so much research into the film. \u201cIt\u2019s like the first time you saw someone across a crowded room, or something,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cSo far I have personally processed 650 boxes of negatives from DuArt, and they just sent us another 290 boxes. I can\u2019t really tell you why it grabbed my interest.\u201dMs. Schulberg\u2019s motivation is partly curatorial, partly political. \u201cTo the IndieCollect team, black films matter,\u201d she said.Keilah Spann, who recently left her post as the director of programming at the Cane River National Heritage Area, was a transplant from Philadelphia who became fascinated with the area.\u201cWhen you come here, it\u2019s like stepping back in time,\u201d she said. \u201cDepending on your background, Cane River might have you waxing nostalgic about the good old antebellum days, or seeing the ghost of Jim Crow.\u201dMs. Spann watched a bootleg DVD of \u201cCane River.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think of any film that dealt with colorism in such a serious way,\u201d she said.

Moore, who edited the film in 1980, said there\u2019s a good reason for that.\u201cEverybody was a \u2018first,\u2019\u201d she said from her home in Los Angeles, where she enjoyed a long career as a television editor. \u201cIt was my first film editing, it was Horace\u2019s first feature. There were a lot of baby mistakes.\u201dMr. Jenkins and Mr. Pryor met with the film\u2019s executive producer, Mr. Rhodes, who, Ms. Moore said, was afraid that he would lose control of the film \u2014 in which he had invested upward of $350,000 \u2014 and rejected Mr. Pryor\u2019s offer.\u201cI remember that this meeting was very private \u2014 just Mr. Rhodes, Horace and Mr. Pryor,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cAnd it was a terrible blow to Horace. So bad that he had me join him and Richard for breakfast the next morning, to strategize on how to convince Mr. Rhodes to consider the offer. It is very possible that Daddy Rhodes did not tell his daughter or wife about the meeting.\u201dNeither Joan Rhodes, a daughter of Duplain and Doris, nor Ms. Balthazar said they remembered anything about Pryor\u2019s involvement. But they expressed interest in getting \u201cCane River\u201d in front of audiences and working with Sacha Jenkins to do so.For Mr. Jenkins, the story of \u201cCane River\u201d is a torrent of what-ifs.\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t died, and had made a deal,\u201d he asked, \u201cwould my father have gotten recognition for what he had done? Would the film have inspired people? Would a company have been built up around what he created? How would my life have been different? He wasn\u2019t the only one to ever to make independent black cinema, but to do it when he did it, and have rich black people finance your film?\u201cThese,\u201d he said, \u201care powerful things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "JetBlue Makes Biofuels Deal to Curtail Greenhouse Gases", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJetBlue, seeking to get ahead of looming restrictions on airliners\u2019 greenhouse gas pollution, has agreed to buy more than 330 million gallons of renewable fuel over 10 years, the company said on Monday.It is one of the largest such purchase agreements yet.Under the agreement with the bioenergy company SG Preston, JetBlue would cover about 20 percent of its annual fuel use at Kennedy International Airport, its home base, with a biofuel blend. That is equivalent to 4 percent of the fuel used throughout its network, the airline said.\u201cIt\u2019s thinking long term about our biggest cost, but its primary motivation is to reduce our greenhouse gases,\u201d said Sophia Mendelsohn, JetBlue\u2019s head of sustainability. \u201cWhat we really want to do is jump-start the industry and quite frankly enable all airlines, very much ourselves included, to diversify our fuel supply.\u201dBiofuels, made from various sorts of organic matter \u2014 whether from agriculture, wood scraps or even municipal waste \u2014 have long been considered important to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transportation. United States rules for gasoline, for example, require at least 10 percent ethanol, which typically comes from corn.Airlines represent potentially easy-to-serve customers for biofuels, given the carriers\u2019 concentration around airports and their voracious energy needs. But with heavy pressure on the companies\u2019 bottom lines, the advent of more efficient planes and a period of low oil prices, the airlines \u2014 with a few exceptions \u2014 have been slow to adopt the novel and more expensive fuels.\u201cAt the end of the day, the vibe that we\u2019ve heard from the industry is, \u2018We\u2019ll use it once it\u2019s cost-competitive, we\u2019ll use it once there\u2019s enough volume,\u2019\u201d said Yuan-Sheng Yu, who leads alternative fuels research at Lux Research. \u201cThis is not an industry with the amounts of cash on hand to invest in these emerging, nonproven technologies.\u201dBut there are signs that may be changing. Last year, United began using a biofuel blend on some of its flights from Los Angeles. In recent weeks, Lufthansa tentatively agreed to buy as many as eight million gallons of fuel a year over five years from Gevo, a Colorado-based biofuel developer, Gevo announced. And Virgin Atlantic announced a successful test of a jet fuel from LanzaTech derived from waste gases from steel mills.Given the industry\u2019s global reach, devising rules to control greenhouse gas emissions has proved contentious and given rise to a regulatory patchwork that companies say could be costly, lead to safety risks and create disadvantages for airlines from different jurisdictions. An effort by the European Union to require United States planes landing in European airports to reduce emissions or pay a fee, for example, encountered so much resistance that regulators approved a partial exemption that expires next year.In recent months, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the aviation agency of the United Nations, approved one set of standards while the Obama administration began the process of writing its own last year. Environmentalists say the international restrictions, written with strong industry input, are too weak, and are pushing for more stringent standards from the Environmental Protection Agency.At the same time, the aviation industry has been looking to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions though a number of approaches, including building more efficient aircraft and supporting the development and approval of new fuels.That has been challenging, said Sean Newsum, director of environmental strategy at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, which is active around the world in helping to develop and certify biofuels for commercial use. In one of the projects this summer, with South African Airways and its Mango affiliate, 300 passengers flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town on fuel derived from tobacco grown for the purpose.\u201cThere\u2019s many different moving pieces to get this into real commercial use, all the way from the growing of the feedstock to the processing of the fuel to delivering that fuel to the airplane,\u201d Mr. Newsum said. \u201cIt takes a while for all of those processes to become stitched together in a standard way,\u201d he added, and to bring down their costs.A long-term customer agreement like JetBlue\u2019s, energy experts say, is an important step for a developer to attract financing to build a new facility \u2014 much as energy-purchase agreements by companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have allowed for the construction of solar or wind farms to help meet their electricity needs.Mr. LeTang said interest in buying biofuel was growing within the industry. Still, that is no guarantee that a project will pan out.A five-year agreement by British Airways to purchase all of the output from a facility that Solena Fuels planned to build outside London, to convert municipal solid waste to jet fuel, collapsed after Solena failed to raise enough money. It could not compete with cheap oil.At JetBlue, Ms. Mendelsohn said she worked for the better part of a year to bring the deal to fruition. She would not say how much the fuel would cost, but that, with subsidies available for biofuels, it would be competitive with conventional jet fuel.Under the agreement, JetBlue will purchase more than 33 million gallons a year of a fuel made from plant oils for at least 10 years; that fuel will be blended with 70 percent traditional jet fuel. SG Preston plans to build a refinery in Ohio to produce mainly renewable diesel and jet fuel, the first of many it hopes to develop.An article on Tuesday about JetBlue\u2019s deal to buy 330 million gallons of biofuel over 10 years from the bioenergy firm SG Preston referred incorrectly to the company\u2019s chief executive. As the article correctly noted, he is Randy Delbert LeTang, and therefore is not \u201cMr. Preston.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article described incorrectly the activity shown. An airport worker was servicing the water tank of the JetBlue aircraft; he was not refueling it.An article on Sept. 20 about JetBlue\u2019s agreement to buy 300 million gallons of renewable fuel over 10 years misidentified the company that announced a similar deal for the purchase of renewable fuels by Lufthansa, and misstated the status of the deal. It was announced by Gevo, a Colorado-based biofuel developer, not by Lufthansa. And the deal is tentative, not confirmed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here\u2019s Hollywood\u2019s Newest Foreign Legion", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom Fritz Lang to Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Hollywood has a long tradition of nabbing talent from abroad. This summer, the custom has found new life in a crop of genre pictures by foreign-born filmmakers directing in English.The phenomenon is nothing new, but the current batch of foreign filmmakers making genre movies is regarded as distinctive from, for example, the wave of European \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the 1930s and 1940s that included Billy Wilder. \u201cThen they were fleeing war and oppression,\u201d Kristin Thompson, a film historian who has written about globalization, said in an email. \u201cNow filmmakers move about the world freely for financial or artistic motives.\u201dThere isn\u2019t one reason for the new cohort of foreign-born auteurs to be making genre pictures here. They can provide a stylistic shot in the arm for Hollywood, which in turn can offer advancement and bigger markets. The filmmakers\u2019 infusion of creative energy often comes with a budget-consciousness born of necessity and ambition. And they make international co-productions a possibility, which can mean lower costs and fewer risks through state financing from back home.\u201cI always joke about the fact that when I go in and pitch something with some accent,\u201d Mr. Alvarez said by phone, \u201cit just makes the whole thing sound more interesting.\u201d\u201cI was working so long in such an isolated place,\u201d Mr. Alvarez said. \u201cThat way, by the time Hollywood finds you, you\u2019re so prepared. When they find other filmmakers at an earlier moment in their careers, they\u2019re not so prepared \u2014 and then that becomes their chance, and then it never happens again.\u201dHe signed on with an agency, Creative Artists, that he ended up sharing with his future star, Mr. De Niro. But the key for Mr. Jakubowicz was a personal identification with the material. \u201cHands of Stone\u201d focuses on Mr. Dur\u00e1n, a Panamanian boxer played by Mr. Ram\u00edrez, and his relationship with his New York coach, Ray Arcel (Mr. De Niro, revisiting \u201cRaging Bull\u201d terrain).\u201cI am Latino, and I\u2019m Jewish, and I\u2019m making a movie about a Latino and his Jewish trainer,\u201d Mr. Jakubowicz said by phone from Los Angeles. \u201cSo I felt like I could really understand both worlds. I always feel that you have a better chance of making a good movie when there are elements in who you are that make you qualified to tell that story better than most filmmakers.\u201dHe also benefited from Mr. De Niro\u2019s support, including tips on directing scenes and the recommendation of a search for financing in Panama. That advice saved the film from a shortfall after there was trouble in securing money in the United States.Mr. Jakubowicz evoked Don Corleone to describe Mr. De Niro\u2019s words of wisdom, and as the reference to \u201cThe Godfather\u201d saga attests, the American pantheon still looms for these directors. Mr. Alvarez fondly remembered renting videos of Hollywood genre films in the \u201980s and, later, how Uruguayan independent filmmakers like Pablo Stoll (\u201cWhisky\u201d) took inspiration from Jim Jarmusch\u2019s deadpan style.For \u201cBlood Father,\u201d which was released in August and stars Mel Gibson as a biker who must save his daughter from a gang, Mr. Richet had a star with experience in action films (and directing) as well as a fierce devotion to character. Mr. Richet made his first foray into American film with a genre remake in 2005, \u201cAssault on Precinct 13.\u201d For \u201cBlood Father,\u201d partly because of language differences, he collaborated closely on set with his screenwriter-producer, Peter Craig, a novelist who worked on two of \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d screenplays. But Mr. Richet said simple communication was important in directing, no matter the language.\u201cAnthony Hopkins said about Ridley Scott that he directed with just two words \u2014 faster and slower,\u201d Mr. Richet said through a translator.Mr. Alvarez and Mr. Jakubowicz both said they were helped by hiring colleagues and friends from back home; Mr. Alvarez has known his writing partner, Rodo Sayagues, since childhood. Mr. Jakubowicz called his crew a \u201cLatin dream team.\u201dThe importing of international directorial talent looks as if it will continue. As Mr. Craig put it: \u201cWhen people make great movies overseas, everybody\u2019s curious what they\u2019ll do here. Talent just travels.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was responding to rumors, circulating in Tehran for weeks, that he had barred Mr. Ahmadinejad from participating in the coming election.\u201cSomeone, a man, came to me,\u201d he said, presumably of Mr. Ahmadinejad, in the typically elliptical style of Shiite clerics. \u201cI told him not to take part in that certain issue, both for his own and the country\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cI did not tell him not to participate,\u201d the supreme leader continued. \u201cI said, \u2018I do not find it advisable that you participate.\u2019 \u201dTechnically, under the Constitution, Ayatollah Khamenei can only advise possible candidates, he cannot legally bar them or judge their suitability. The vetting process is officially done by the 12-member Guardian Council. In practice, though, Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s statement amounts to an edict, and it is almost certainly hopeless for Mr. Ahmadinejad to try to mount a campaign against the supreme leader\u2019s wishes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Don\u2019t Know What Arte Povera Is? They Can Change That", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 If you don\u2019t know much about Arte Povera, the 1960s Italian avant-garde movement whose proponents created minimalist works using humble or organic materials, two New York collectors are hoping to change that.That mission is about to materialize, in a stark, outsized industrial building in Cold Spring, N.Y. \u2014 about 60 miles north of New York City \u2014 where they plan to exhibit about 400 works from their substantial collection when it opens next year.They call the space Magazzino, which means warehouse in Italian, an unassuming designation that intentionally avoids any association with museums, institutions, art galleries or commercial enterprises. \u201cThe name was not chosen by chance,\u201d said Mr. Spanu of the self-financed project.\u201cWe take pride in saying that we are independent and we want to remain independent,\u201d said Mr. Spanu, who was born in Sardinia but has lived in the United States for almost 30 years. \u201cWe want the possibility to share in our own way,\u201d making the collection \u201cavailable to students and scholars and the public.\u201dWork has been underway on the imposing 20,000-square-foot structure in the Hudson Valley, where the couple also has a home. The space, which includes a vast library, will have year-round programming, and will be free and open to the public by appointment.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for people to come in and just look at art that is so conceptual, you have to give it some kind of background to put it in context,\u201d said Ms. Olnick. \u201cThese aren\u2019t just pretty pictures.\u201dIndeed, many of their pieces are very large, proposing curatorial challenges that Magazzino is meant to assuage.The idea of creating an exposition space for their collection was hatched about seven years ago, but \u201cit took a few years to find the right location,\u201d said Ms. Olnick.Initially, they had thought to build Magazzino on their estate in Garrison, N.Y., where they live in a modern, glass-walled house designed by the Spanish architect Alberto Campo Baeza, \u201cbut not everyone in the neighborhood saw the interest of having an art space in a residential area,\u201d said Mr. Spanu. Frank debates with local residents convinced them to look for another site.\u201cWe\u2019ve been in Garrison for 25 years and we love it there, so we appreciated the input,\u201d said Ms. Olnick.The perfect space turned out to be a factory off Route 9, just four miles north of their house, which was repurposed and redesigned by the Spanish architect Miguel Quismondo, who also built an addition.\u201cThey were so enthusiastic about glass,\u201d said Marino Barovier, an Italian curator and Murano glass expert who helped the couple create the collection, adding, \u201cand they became so competent and expert, too.\u201d When Mr. Barovier was unable to attend openings for the show in the United States, \u201cthey went instead, holding lectures and speaking to the public,\u201d he said.\u201cWe believe that Arte Povera is the last avant-garde movement of 20th century, and we think it has legs, and a future, if people know about it,\u201d said Ms. Olnick.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zimbabwe Follows Robert Mugabe\u2019s Health by Following His Plane", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 It is an indirect clue at best, but it is often all they can get: Many Zimbabweans have taken to divining the state of their increasingly frail 92-year-old leader\u2019s health from the movements of his presidential plane.On Saturday morning, anyone with a smartphone could see that Air Zimbabwe Flight 1, as the plane is known, was hugging Africa\u2019s eastern coast on its way home to Harare, the capital, after four days in Dubai. The flight designation, UM1, meant that President Robert Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state, was on board.Mr. Mugabe\u2019s trip to the Middle East had been made suddenly, with no explanation from the secretive Zimbabwean government, fueling rumors that the president was deathly ill and desperately seeking medical treatment overseas.The main political opposition helped feed those rumors, with one of its leaders posting online, in a tone of great authority, that Mr. Mugabe had suffered a stroke and that it was unlikely \u201che can come back from this.\u201dBut ordinary Zimbabweans and journalists were left with hardly any verifiable facts, other than what flight tracking apps could tell them. And it was not the first time.In March, when Mr. Mugabe was traveling in Asia, he canceled a visit to India at the last minute, and the government refused to reveal his whereabouts. The apps showed that his plane was in Singapore, one of the places where he has received medical treatment in recent years. (The government said he had cataract surgery there and was otherwise healthy, but a 2008 American diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks said he had been treated in Singapore for prostate cancer.)The uncertainty of a post-Mugabe political order compounds the anxieties. The political class is engulfed in a ferocious fight over succession, and it is far from clear where the security forces, the traditional guarantors of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s power, will stand.In the capital, politicians and diplomats report that Mr. Mugabe has slowed down considerably in the past year. He works only a few hours a day and says little in meetings. Several times, he has been caught on video stumbling or falling asleep at public events.Like most wealthy Zimbabweans, Mr. Mugabe goes abroad for better medical care than he can get at home. That narrows the circle of Zimbabweans who are truly informed about his health \u2014 and it means that every time he flies, especially on extended or unannounced trips outside Africa, the rumors fly as well, often claiming that he has died or is at death\u2019s door.\u201cThere will never be a thing called a vacuum, so if the officials are not giving information, rumors will fill the vacuum,\u201d said Tendai Biti, the president of an opposition party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cThe feelings of uncertainty are a byproduct of a very unstable environment created by the president himself.\u201d\u201cBut this is not unique to Zimbabwe,\u201d added Mr. Biti, who served as finance minister in a coalition government from 2009 to 2013. \u201cMobutu used to die so many times. In Uganda, Idi Amin used to die so many times. In China, Chairman Mao used to die so many times. In Russia, how many times did Brezhnev used to die?\u201dMr. Mugabe appeared to bounce back, flying to Kenya on Aug. 26 for a conference, followed by a meeting in Swaziland. After that, however, UM1\u2019s movements began raising alarms in some circles. The plane left Swaziland a day before the conference ended, spent three hours in Harare and then took off again for Dubai, arriving on the morning of Aug. 31.Days of silence ensued. The government said only that Mr. Mugabe was in the Middle East on official business. The Sept. 1 headline on the independent newspaper NewsDay read, \u201cMystery Over Mugabe Trip.\u201dUM1 took off again after midnight on Saturday, and by 6 a.m. the tracking apps had it over the waters between Mozambique and Madagascar, headed southwest. Journalists and officials began to gather at Harare\u2019s airport, where the sun shone in a clear sky on a fine spring morning.When the plane landed at 7:58, reporters for the state news media were ushered onto the tarmac.He said he had gone to Dubai to check up on his elder son, Robert Jr., an architecture student.Speculation immediately turned to whether Mr. Mugabe\u2019s allies had churned up false rumors of his death to discredit the independent news media and the political opposition. Zimbabwe\u2019s central intelligence organization has a history of spreading disinformation.Mr. Cross, the opposition lawmaker, said by phone that he had based his blog post on information from intelligence officials, members of the governing ZANU-PF party, South African intelligence officials and a minister.Conjuring a scene from the macabre comedy \u201cWeekend at Bernie\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Cross argued that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s allies were propping up a dying president to maintain their hold on power.At the airport, a reporter asked Mr. Mugabe whether he was a ghost. \u201cOnce I get back to my country,\u201d he replied, \u201cI am real.\u201dHopewell Chin\u2019ono reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "England\u2019s Forgotten Muslim History", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionLondon \u2014 Britain is divided as never before. The country has turned its back on Europe, and its female ruler has her sights set on trade with the East. As much as this sounds like Britain today, it also describes the country in the 16th century, during the golden age of its most famous monarch, Queen Elizabeth I.One of the more surprising aspects of Elizabethan England is that its foreign and economic policy was driven by a close alliance with the Islamic world, a fact conveniently ignored today by those pushing the populist rhetoric of national sovereignty.From the moment of her accession to the throne in 1558, Elizabeth began seeking diplomatic, commercial and military ties with Muslim rulers in Iran, Turkey and Morocco \u2014 and with good reasons. In 1570, when it became clear that Protestant England would not return to the Catholic faith, the pope excommunicated Elizabeth and called for her to be stripped of her crown. Soon, the might of Catholic Spain was against her, an invasion imminent. English merchants were prohibited from trading with the rich markets of the Spanish Netherlands. Economic and political isolation threatened to destroy the newly Protestant country.Elizabeth responded by reaching out to the Islamic world. Spain\u2019s only rival was the Ottoman Empire, ruled by Sultan Murad III, which stretched from North Africa through Eastern Europe to the Indian Ocean. The Ottomans had been fighting the Hapsburgs for decades, conquering parts of Hungary. Elizabeth hoped that an alliance with the sultan would provide much needed relief from Spanish military aggression, and enable her merchants to tap into the lucrative markets of the East. For good measure she also reached out to the Ottomans\u2019 rivals, the shah of Persia and the ruler of Morocco.The trouble was that the Muslim empires were far more powerful than Elizabeth\u2019s little island nation floating in the soggy mists off Europe. Elizabeth wanted to explore new trade alliances, but couldn\u2019t afford to finance them. Her response was to exploit an obscure commercial innovation \u2014 joint stock companies \u2014 introduced by her sister, Mary Tudor.The companies were commercial associations jointly owned by shareholders. The capital was used to fund the costs of commercial voyages, and the profits \u2014 or losses \u2014 would also be shared. Elizabeth enthusiastically backed the Muscovy Company, which traded with Persia, and went on to inspire the formation of the Turkey Company, which traded with the Ottomans, and the East India Company, which would eventually conquer India.In the 1580s she signed commercial agreements with the Ottomans that would last over 300 years, granting her merchants free commercial access to Ottoman lands. She made a similar alliance with Morocco, with the tacit promise of military support against Spain.As money poured in, Elizabeth began writing letters to her Muslim counterparts, extolling the benefits of reciprocal trade. She wrote as a supplicant, calling Murad \u201cthe most mighty ruler of the kingdom of Turkey, sole and above all, and most sovereign monarch of the East Empire.\u201d She also played on their mutual hostility to Catholicism, describing herself as \u201cthe most invincible and most mighty defender of the Christian faith against all kind of idolatries.\u201d Like Muslims, Protestants rejected the worship of icons, and celebrated the unmediated word of God, while Catholics favored priestly intercession. She deftly exploited the Catholic conflation of Protestants and Muslims as two sides of the same heretical coin.The ploy worked. Thousands of English traders crossed many of today\u2019s no-go regions, like Aleppo in Syria, and Mosul in Iraq. They were far safer than they would have been on an equivalent journey through Catholic Europe, where they risked falling into the hands of the Inquisition.The Ottoman authorities saw their ability to absorb people of all faiths as a sign of power, not weakness, and observed the Protestant-Catholic conflicts of the time with detached bemusement. Some Englishmen even converted to Islam. A few, like Samson Rowlie, a Norfolk merchant who became Hassan Aga, chief treasurer to Algiers, were forced. Others did so of their own volition, perhaps seeing Islam as a better bet than the precarious new Protestant faith.English aristocrats delighted in the silks and spices of the east, but the Turks and Moroccans were decidedly less interested in English wool. What they needed were weapons. In a poignant act of religious retribution, Elizabeth stripped the metal from deconsecrated Catholic churches and melted their bells to make munitions that were then shipped out to Turkey, proving that shady Western arms sales go back much further than the Iran-contra affair. The queen encouraged similar deals with Morocco, selling weapons and buying saltpeter, the essential ingredient in gunpowder, and sugar, heralding a lasting craving and turning Elizabeth\u2019s own teeth an infamous black.The sugar, silks, carpets and spices transformed what the English ate, how they decorated their homes and how they dressed. Words such as \u201ccandy\u201d and \u201cturquoise\u201d (from \u201cTurkish stone\u201d) became commonplace. Even Shakespeare got in on the act, writing \u201cOthello\u201d shortly after the first Moroccan ambassador\u2019s six-month visit.Despite the commercial success of the joint stock companies, the British economy was unable to sustain its reliance on far-flung trade. Immediately following Elizabeth\u2019s death in 1603, the new king, James I, signed a peace treaty with Spain, ending England\u2019s exile.Elizabeth\u2019s Islamic policy held off a Catholic invasion, transformed English taste and established a new model for joint stock investment that would eventually finance the Virginia Company, which founded the first permanent North American colony.It turns out that Islam, in all its manifestations \u2014 imperial, military and commercial \u2014 played an important part in the story of England. Today, when anti-Muslim rhetoric inflames political discourse, it is useful to remember that our pasts are more entangled than is often appreciated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s \u2018Better Than Goldman\u2019 Bank Slowly Rebounds From Scandal", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 BTG Pactual, a once highflying Brazilian investment bank that stumbled badly during a brush with scandal last year, is reinventing itself with more modest aspirations.Gone is the brash desire to outdo the American investment bank Goldman Sachs \u2014 some here once joked that BTG stood for \u201cBetter Than Goldman,\u201d and the bank expanded to Hong Kong, the United States and Europe, even Switzerland.Since then, the bank has showed signs of stability. Although profit in the most recent quarter, reported in August, came in below market estimates, the company no longer faces net withdrawals by clients or pressure to prove liquidity.BTG Pactual\u2019s flagship hedge fund, called GEMM, shrank to $150 million from $5 billion after Mr. Esteves\u2019s arrest but has since bounced back to about $500 million, Roberto Sallouti, one of the bank\u2019s co-chief executives, said in a recent interview at the bank\u2019s headquarters in S\u00e3o Paulo. The bank also now has excess capital after selling assets.BTG Pactual, said Mr. Sallouti, a Wharton graduate who joined the bank in 1994 and became a partner in 1998, is now in the final steps of what he called a strategic repositioning that it was forced to undertake. \u201cClearly the worst is over, and we\u2019re back to the normal course of business,\u201d he said.The firm is even considering expansion in Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Argentina, and is seeking to acquire nonperforming loan portfolios, he said.Analysts say BTG will need more time to recover its credibility. Still, executives see its future success tied to being a more pared-down company.\u201cThe new BTG Pactual of 2016, 2017 and 2018 is probably much closer to the BTG Pactual of 2012,\u201d Mr. Sallouti said. \u201cOur motto in 2012 was \u2018Latin America\u2019s business and investment hub,\u2019\u201d he said. To the company, that meant combining its full-service investment bank for Latin America with a focus on asset management, wealth management, investment banking, sales and trading, credit, and its global hedge fund business.Those types of direct investments will be eliminated, Mr. Sallouti said. BTG has abandoned plans to expand operations in wealthier markets abroad. The bank\u2019s income, he said, is going to be mostly Latin America-related, \u201cwith the exception of asset management, where you will have fees coming from our hedge fund business.\u201d Specifically, he added, \u201cI would expect that Mexico and Argentina become more relevant every month and every year as a percentage of our revenues,\u201d and he estimated that only about 25 percent of the bank\u2019s revenue would come from outside Brazil.There are other indicators that the bank has entered a new phase. Over all of the funds that it runs, BTG had a net gain of 2.6 billion reais in June, and in July a net rise of 1.1 billion reais, according to the Economatica report \u2014 the best two months since Mr. Esteves\u2019s arrest. That the bank even reached this point surprised some observers.The Nov. 25 arrest of Mr. Esteves shook up Brazil\u2019s business establishment. He was then the most prominent nonpolitician to be snared in the Petrobras investigation, which has affected a wide array of industries in Brazil. Over the last two years, investigators have uncovered an elaborate bribery and money-laundering ring centered on the state-controlled oil giant Petrobras. An influential senator from the Workers\u2019 Party, then governing, who was arrested on the same day accused Mr. Esteves of helping an important witness try to flee the country.A line of credit of 6 billion reais from the Fundo Garantidor de Cr\u00e9ditos, a Brazilian deposit guarantor, gave it an important lifeline while it sold assets, Mr. Sallouti said. The bank still has 30 percent of that credit line left to pay back but expects to do so once the sale of BSI concludes, by the end of this year, if not sooner, he said.In April, Mr. Esteves was freed from house arrest in S\u00e3o Paulo.He did not waste a minute, showing up unshaven and in jeans at the bank\u2019s headquarters the same day to address employees at an afternoon town hall meeting.He has since been a regular presence at the bank.\u201cI talk to him almost every day,\u201d Mr. Sallouti said.He does not have a management role, because he is still under investigation in Brazil, but his lawyer said in a recent interview that he continues to claim his innocence and hopes to be cleared soon.Still, the bank is likely to face numerous challenges.\u201cThey still have the problem of recovering their image,\u201d said Luis Miguel Santacreu, a financial sector analyst for the credit ratings agency Austin Rating. \u201cI think their growth will be slower and more modest,\u201d he added.Second-quarter revenue was 2.6 billion reais, significantly less than the 3.6 billion reais in the previous quarter but higher than the 2 billion reais in the second quarter of 2015.The results reflected the bank\u2019s downsizing for the first time, Goldman Sachs said in a research note. \u201cThe smaller footprint will make it difficult to generate profitability at a much higher level, though an economic recovery could help,\u201d Goldman said.It continues to lead in merger advising, ranking first through June in the volume of announced deals in Latin America, according to Dealogic. And it spun off its commodities unit, which will reduce its exposure to volatile markets.The Petrobras investigation is out of BTG\u2019s control, and it shows no signs of slowing. Moreover, it appears likely to focus increasingly on the financial industry.The lead federal prosecutor, Deltan Dallagnol, said in a recent interview that many banks facilitated the movement of illicit money in overseas accounts, so investigators were closely scrutinizing that. He declined to provide details and did not mention BTG Pactual or any other banks by name.Nevertheless, he said that the information the authorities had uncovered so far \u201cdemands a deeper analysis that will be done at the opportune moment.\u201dA separate investigation into Brazil\u2019s pension funds also presents risks for the bank and finance sector. Federal police said on Monday that they carried out 106 search and seizure judicial orders, looking into fraud at the country\u2019s four largest pension funds. While BTG Pactual is not being targeted at the moment, in the past its private equity operations obtained capital from some of those funds.Still, for now, many here give BTG Pactual credit for surviving.\u201cThey were trying to get back into the game very rapidly and vigorously,\u201d said Luiz Cezar Fernandes, the founder of Pactual, who first brought on Mr. Esteves in 1989. \u201cThey made the right decisions,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amid New Airstrikes in Syria, an Aid Convoy Arrives", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat announcement was made after two days of intensive bombing of eastern Aleppo by the Russian-backed Syrian forces.A 25-truck aid convoy left Damascus on Thursday with supplies for 40,000 people in Moadamiya, a suburb of the capital, according to Jan Egeland, a United Nations special adviser for humanitarian affairs. Officials said later that the convoy had arrived in the afternoon, after delays but without incident.\u201cWe seem to be getting the permits and support we need,\u201d Mr. Egeland said, while cautioning that the attack on the convoy on Monday, the deadliest in Syria\u2019s five-year civil war, had cast doubt on the safety and reliability of procedures that have provided the basis for aid deliveries to millions of Syrians.The Syrian government prohibited United Nations staff members from accompanying the convoy earlier in the week, Mr. Egeland said.\u201cWe were not there,\u201d he told reporters Thursday in Geneva. \u201cAs U.N., we were not allowed in.\u201dThe presence of United Nations officials can shield local relief workers in dangerous areas. Monday\u2019s mission by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent had no such cover.\u201cWe need a reboot, a restart for security assurances and guarantees for the humanitarian lifeline,\u201d Mr. Egeland said, adding that the United Nations had trucks loaded and ready to leave for other besieged towns, including Madaya, Kfarya, Fouaa and Zabadani, before the end of the week.Hours later, Secretary of State John Kerry said that he had exchanged ideas to restore the cease-fire with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov. He suggested that the onus was now on Russia to uphold the previous agreement and to respond to Mr. Kerry\u2019s proposals with credible ideas of its own.\u201cIf the Russians come back to us with constructive proposals, we will listen,\u201d Mr. Kerry said in a statement he read to reporters. \u201cThe key is to restore credibility where there is none.\u201dMr. Kerry declined to take questions and did not provide more details. It was not immediately clear what ideas were being discussed or why the Obama administration believes its diplomatic efforts with the Russians might yet succeed after days of frustrating exchanges.A senior Foreign Ministry official in Moscow rejected that idea. \u201cThis plan is unworkable,\u201d said Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, according to the RIA news agency. The United States and other supporters of rebel groups trying to topple Mr. Assad must ensure that they lay down their arms, he added.At this stage, Mr. Kerry said in his statement, only \u201cmajor gestures,\u201d like banning warplanes over areas, would be sufficient to revive the rapidly vanishing hopes that a cease-fire agreement can be reinstated and endure.A senior Obama administration official told reporters on Thursday evening that the meeting of the International Syria Support Group had been \u201cpretty contentious\u201d and that he was unsure whether an agreement was still possible.While the administration is not closing the door to new ideas from Moscow, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in accordance with diplomatic protocol, any Russian proposals need to include major steps to stop the violence.\u201cThose convoys were in the area of the militants, the area under the control of the terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any idea about what happened.\u201dRebel-held areas of Aleppo endured heavy airstrikes overnight, including with incendiary weapons, leaving a breakthrough in peace talks looking like a distant prospect. Strikes on Thursday destroyed one of the city\u2019s two water treatment stations, serving both rebel- and government-controlled areas, according to activists and medical workers in Aleppo.The Syrian military\u2019s declaration of its new offensive was reported by pro-government websites and by RT, the satellite network financed by the Russian government.As violence reignited, trucks carrying food and medicine for Aleppo remained on the border with Turkey, unable to move from the customs zone where they have been stuck for a week until government forces and armed groups pull back from the road leading into the city, Mr. Egeland said.Mr. Assad, in his interview with The A.P., denied that Aleppo was under siege, but Mr. Egeland told reporters that it was encircled by military forces and that \u201cit\u2019s impossible to get in.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Sept. 23 about the resumption of aid convoys to besieged communities in Syria three days after a deadly attack on trucks loaded with supplies paraphrased incorrectly from a statement by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei A. Ryabkov of Russia, which is fighting the opposition in Syria on behalf of the government. According to the RIA news agency, Mr. Ryabkov said the United States and other supporters of rebel groups trying to topple Syria\u2019s president must ensure that they lay down their arms; he did not say the United States and the rebels must lay down their arms.Neil MacFarquhar and Anne Barnard contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "African Elephant Population Dropped 30 Percent in 7 Years", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe African elephant population is in drastic decline, having shrunk about 30 percent from 2007 to 2014, according to a survey published this week.The deterioration is accelerating: Largely because of poaching, the population is dropping 8 percent a year, according to the Great Elephant Census, which was released on Wednesday.Patricia Awori, an official with the African Elephant Coalition, said, \u201cThese numbers are shocking for elephants across the continent.\u201d She added, \u201cIt proves that an urgent, cohesive, Africa-wide approach is required to save them.\u201dStarting in early 2014, teams of researchers fanned out across Africa in several dozen airplanes covering nearly 290,000 miles in a quest to sample the continent\u2019s elephant population. They counted about 352,000 savanna elephants along the way, accounting for 93 percent of all those remaining in the 18 countries surveyed. More than half live in Botswana and Zimbabwe.The researchers also counted elephant carcasses, finding an estimated 12 for every 100 living elephants \u2014 an unsustainable level \u2014 suggesting that the continent\u2019s population is in decline. The count was compared with historical data to estimate the change since 2007, a turning point for the elephant population, which had grown over the previous dozen years.David Banks, the Nature Conservancy\u2019s Africa program director, said: \u201cWe knew that the situation was bad on the ground, but the results are worse than expected.\u201d He added, \u201cEven if poaching is stopped cold right now, it\u2019ll take decades for populations to recover.\u201dIn some cases, human encroachment appears to have forced elephants to adapt their behavior. This year, an elephant named Morgan and fitted with a GPS tracking collar surprised the researchers when he entered war-torn Somalia from Kenya and managed to live. They credited his survival to the fact that he moved mostly by night, resting in thick bush during the day.But Morgan\u2019s story is just one hopeful tale. The researchers maintain that elephants can\u2019t survive without stronger conservation efforts.\u201cWorrying won\u2019t save elephants,\u201d said Cristi\u00e1n Samper, the president and chief executive of the Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cEnactment of solutions will, and we know the solutions: strong governance, funding for rangers and closing down ivory markets among them.\u201dTo raise awareness, Mr. Allen\u2019s Vulcan Productions is releasing two movies this year, a feature documentary on the ivory trade and the true story of a baby elephant born into a rehabilitation program in Botswana.\u201cWe have been making desperate cries to the world that all is not well for the African elephant across the continent and feel sad that the results vindicate our position,\u201d Paul Udoto, a spokesman for Kenya Wildlife Service, said of the census.\u201cIt\u2019s another golden chance for the world to unite and give elephants a new lease on life and save them from the inexorable descent into extinction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An F-Minus for America\u2019s Schools From a Fed-Up Judge", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWhen a Connecticut judge threw out the state\u2019s school financing system as unconstitutional this week, his unsparing 90-page ruling read and resonated like a cry from the heart on the failings of American public education.Judge Thomas G. Moukawsher of State Superior Court in Hartford was scathing: He criticized \u201cuselessly perfect teacher evaluations\u201d that found \u201cvirtually every teacher in the state\u201d proficient or exemplary, while a third of students in many of the poorest communities cannot read even at basic levels. He attacked a task force charged with setting meaningful high school graduation requirements for how its \u201cbiggest thought on how to fix the problem turned out to be another task force,\u201d and called it \u201ca kind of a spoof.\u201dToo many American high school graduates are \u201clet down by patronizing and illusory degrees,\u201d Judge Moukawsher wrote. And too many decisions and too much debate about schools seem, as he wrote, \u201ccompletely disconnected to the teaching of children.\u201dJudge Moukawsher\u2019s decision in the case, Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding v. Rell, which has been making its way through the courts for more than a decade, did not say money does not matter. But it was a strikingly blunt way of saying what many people feel: The system is broken.In his ruling, Judge Thomas Moukawsher of State Superior Court in Hartford said that \u201cConnecticut is defaulting on its constitutional duty\u201d to give all children an adequate education.\u201cThe frustration of the court matches the policy movements across the states and across the federal government over the same time,\u201d said Eric A. Hanushek, a fellow in education at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University, who testified for the State of Connecticut in defending what it spends on schools. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the states or the federal government has said \u2018We\u2019re not going to do anything about schools.\u2019 In fact, there\u2019s been a concerted effort to try to improve things, but it is rather faddish and we do what people currently think is in vogue, and it just hasn\u2019t worked.\u201dHe added, \u201cJust doing more of the same is unlikely to lead to a different result.\u201dRather than tell the General Assembly to figure out a way to even out the gap in resources \u2014 which is what most courts in similar cases have done \u2014 the judge called for a radical reimagining that starts with the question of what schools should do: What are the goals for elementary students, or high school graduates? Then, he said, the state should decide how much money schools require so that all students, rich and poor, reach those goals. In the kind of rational system the judge proposes, you determine what you are trying to do before you decide what you are going to spend.Over the past half-century, nearly every state has had a similar case about how to finance its schools, some more tortured than others. In New Jersey, for example, the state\u2019s highest court has issued more than 20 rulings in a case that has stretched over four decades. David G. Sciarra, the executive director of the Education Law Center in Newark, which has helped litigate many school funding cases across the country, said he was watching pending litigation in Kansas, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Washington.In the earliest cases, experts would debate whether money mattered. Now, said James E. Ryan, the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a former law professor who has written extensively on school financing litigation, there is more consensus.\u201cMoney spent well is a good way to boost outcomes; money spent poorly is not,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need an awful lot of social science research to prove that common-sense proposition: If you waste money you\u2019re not going to see results.\u201dOn the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress, 46 percent of white fourth graders across the country read at or above \u201cproficient,\u201d compared with just 18 percent of their black peers. And 51 percent of white fourth graders were at or above proficient in math, compared with 19 percent of black fourth graders.In Connecticut, the judge noted, nearly all high school students in affluent communities like Darien and Westport scored on state tests as \u201cadvanced\u201d in math and approached the same level in reading. But one out of three students in nearby Bridgeport and other poor cities did not reach the most basic level in math, and did only slightly better in reading.The policies and practices Judge Moukawsher singled out for criticism in his opinion are ones that make many parents and taxpayers cringe. The monthly school board meeting so consumed with squabbling that no real business is conducted until nearly midnight. A task force on graduation requirements that speaks in generalities, about things like \u201cmastery\u201d being more important than \u201cseat time,\u201d and then ends up weakening the state tests.A New England judge with a Southerner\u2019s flair for metaphor, he criticized \u201cuselessly perfect teacher evaluations\u201d as part of a rating system \u201cthat is little more than cotton candy in a rainstorm.\u201d He described the state\u2019s efforts to define high school proficiency as \u201clike a sugar cube boat,\u201d adding, \u201cIt dissolves before it\u2019s half-launched.\u201dHe told Connecticut to find a better way to evaluate teachers and tie their performance to whether students actually learn. He urged the state to rethink the almost universal practice of paying teachers based on their education level and how many years they have taught.And he argued that Connecticut should intervene more aggressively in school districts, saying local control, grounded in American tradition but not the law, has given the state an excuse to bow out rather than meaningfully try to improve schools.But while these ideas may resonate, they still need to face the push and pull of politics, racial bias and the power of teachers\u2019 unions, to name just a few hurdles.Sixth graders in the richest school districts are four grade levels ahead of children in the poorest districts.Mr. Ryan said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to be the court. You can criticize all these people and come close to making fun of them for all these failed efforts and then say, \u2018You fix it.\u2019 Fixing it may not be as easy as the court imagines.\u201d\u201cSchool funding cases don\u2019t usually change the politics of funding,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, the politics of funding are stronger than court orders.\u201dLocal control, long a tenet of the political right, is now also a rallying cry on the left, and used to argue against state interventions in cities like Newark and New Orleans.Judge Moukawsher gave the General Assembly some ideas, but no strict prescriptions. In particular, he applauded Massachusetts\u2019s approach to reform. There, facing a school funding lawsuit, the legislature passed a sweeping act in 1993 that evened out school funding between rich and poor districts, but also set high standards for achievement and created a high-school graduation test requirement. Massachusetts schools have improved on national tests since then and are widely considered the best in the United States.But Massachusetts, too, has faced controversy over its tests, and more recently, its embrace of the Common Core, the set of national standards rolled out in the past few years that has created political chaos in many states.Moving beyond those debates might require reassessing the tradition of using property taxes to pay for schools, said Rebecca Sibilia, the founder of EdBuild, a nonprofit that works with states to redesign school financing systems. \u201cWe haven\u2019t kicked that notion that property taxes are the primary way to pay for education,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Put Globalization to Work for Democracies", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionA Chinese student once described his country\u2019s globalization strategy to me. China, he said, opened a window to the world economy, but placed a screen on it. The country got the fresh air it needed \u2014 nearly 700 million people have been lifted from extreme poverty since the early 1980s \u2014 but kept mosquitoes out.China benefited from the flourishing of trade and investment across national borders. For many, this was the magic of globalization.But it\u2019s not the whole story. Look closely at the economies that converged with richer counterparts \u2014 Japan, South Korea, China \u2014 and you see that each engaged globally in a selective, strategic manner. China pushed exports, but it also placed barriers on imports to protect employment in state enterprises and required foreign investors to transfer know-how to domestic companies.Other countries that relied on globalization as their growth engine but failed to put in place a domestic strategy became disillusioned. For example, few countries tried as hard as Mexico to integrate with the world economy, through Nafta and liberal trade and financial policies. Yet the country\u2019s economic growth in recent decades has been sluggish, even by the modest standards of Latin America.The bigger worry today is that unmanaged globalization is undermining democracy. Democratic politics remain tethered to nation-states, while institutions that make the rules for global markets are either weak or seem too distant, especially to middle- and lower-class voters.Globalization has deepened the economic and cultural divisions between those who can take advantage of the global economy and those who don\u2019t have the resources and skills to do so. Nativist politicians like Donald J. Trump have channeled the resulting discontent as hostility to outsiders: Mexican or Polish immigrants, Chinese exporters, minorities.We need to rescue globalization not just from populists, but also from its cheerleaders. Globalization evangelists have done great damage to their cause not just by underplaying the real fears and concerns on which the Trumps of this world thrive, but by overlooking the benefits of a more moderate form of globalization.We must reassess the balance between national autonomy and economic globalization. Simply put, we have pushed economic globalization too far \u2014 toward an impractical version that we might call \u201chyperglobalization.\u201dThe new model of globalization stood priorities on their head, effectively putting democracy to work for the global economy, instead of the other way around. The elimination of barriers to trade and finance became an end in itself, rather than a means toward more fundamental economic and social goals. Societies were asked to subject domestic economies to the whims of global financial markets; sign investment treaties that created special rights for foreign companies; and reduce corporate and top income taxes to attract footloose corporations.Some simple principles would reorient us in the right direction. First, there is no single way to prosperity. Countries make their own choices about the institutions that suit them best. Some, like Britain, may tolerate, say, greater inequality and financial instability in return for higher growth and more financial innovation. They will opt for lower taxes on capital and more freewheeling financial systems. Others, like Continental European nations, will go for greater equity and financial conservatism. International firms will complain that differences in rules and regulations raise the costs of doing business across borders, but their claims must be traded off against the benefits of diversity.Second, countries have the right to protect their institutional arrangements and safeguard the integrity of their regulations. Financial regulations or labor protections can be circumvented and undermined by moving operations to foreign countries with considerably lower standards. Countries should be able to prevent such \u201cregulatory arbitrage\u201d by placing restrictions on cross-border transactions \u2014 just as they can keep out toys or agricultural products that do not meet domestic health standards.Third, the purpose of international economic negotiations should be to increase domestic policy autonomy, while being mindful of the possible harm to trade partners. The world\u2019s trade regime is driven by a mercantilist logic: You lower your barriers in return for my lowering mine. But lack of openness is no longer the binding constraint on the world economy; lack of democratic legitimacy is.It is time to embrace a different logic, emphasizing the value of policy autonomy. Poor and rich countries alike need greater space for pursuing their objectives. The former need to restructure their economies and promote new industries, and the latter must address domestic concerns over inequality and distributive justice. Both objectives require placing some sand in the cogs of globalization. For example, developing nations may be allowed to subsidize some industries in return for rich nations being allowed to use tariffs against countries \u201cdumping\u201d goods produced under substandard labor or environmental standards.Fourth, global governance should focus on enhancing democracy, not globalization. Global governance cannot overcome major problems like inequality, social exclusion or low growth, but it can help by devising norms that improve domestic policy making, like requirements on transparency, public deliberation, broad representation, accountability and use of scientific or economic evidence in domestic proceedings. To some extent, the World Trade Organization already advocates these disciplines. They deserve greater priority over trade liberalization and regulatory harmonization.And finally, nondemocratic countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia \u2014 where the rule of law is routinely flouted and civil liberties are not protected \u2014 should not be able to count on the same rights and privileges in the international system as democracies can. When a nation is not democratic, we can no longer presume that its institutional arrangements reflect the preferences of its citizens. Therefore it lacks a prima facie argument for shielding its market rules from international scrutiny. It would be appropriate for democracies to consider less permissive rules for them \u2014 for example, by requiring a higher burden of proof from non-democracies when they file a trade complaint against democracies.When I present these ideas to globalization advocates, they say the consequence would be a dangerous slide toward protectionism. But today the risks on the other side are greater, namely that the social strains of hyperglobalization will drive a populist backlash that undermines both globalization and democracy. Basing globalization on defensible democratic principles is its best defense.Globalization, within limits, has been good economics.

{"Headline": "Questions to Consider if Your Trump-Clinton Vote Doesn\u2019t Really Count", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceIf you live in California, the value of your vote this November will be much smaller than a neighbor\u2019s a few miles away in Nevada. The same contrast exists along many other state borders, like those of Vermont and New Hampshire.That\u2019s because the Electoral College system leaves people in deeply red or deeply blue states relative bystanders in presidential elections \u2014 even when a race is desperately close.If you live in safe blue states like California or Vermont or a safe red one like Alabama, is it possible to make your vote count more?First, some perspective: Even in a battleground state like Nevada, where the Electoral College votes could help tip the election, one person\u2019s vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference. When millions vote, a single ballot can be like a teaspoon of water in a swimming pool.That means that roughly the same swing states have continued to wield influence. And two of those already have outsize sway for a reason other than the Electoral College: Iowa and New Hampshire traditionally shape the race with early primary contests.Another separate reason that New Hampshire might be a power broker this year is that a close down-ballot race \u2014 Kelly Ayotte vs. Maggie Hassan \u2014 could determine which party controls the Senate.At the other extreme are states like California, Texas and New York. Their combined population is more than a fourth of the United States total, and their residents are essentially sitting out another presidential election.1) Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a Californian and you\u2019re feeling left out of the election. You have a nephew in Florida who is apolitical and a big sports fan. You tell him that if he votes for Donald J. Trump, you\u2019ll take him to a Lakers game and a nice dinner the next time he visits Los Angeles. (It\u2019s understood that you\u2019ll pay for the tickets and dinner because that\u2019s what you normally do on such occasions.) Would that be considered against the law? If so, and if it somehow ever came to light, what might the penalty be?2) Or another example. You have an 18-year-old niece in Ohio; she\u2019s undecided and unsure if she\u2019ll vote. For her birthday, you give her $100 instead of the usual $50, give her a wink in front of her family and say, \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s a bribe, but if you vote for Hillary Clinton, I certainly won\u2019t mind.\u201d (Everyone chuckles.)The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.1) Certainly if I say to a stranger, if you vote for Trump I will give you Laker tickets and take you to dinner \u2014 that would be a bribe. The fact that it is an uncle and nephew with a pre-existing relationship may make proving the deal harder, especially if there is a history of the uncle giving gifts to the nephew. Under a federal statute (52 U.S.C. s 10307(c)), \u201cWhoever knowingly or willfully \u2026 pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years.\u201d2) Like the first example, it turns on intent, and the familial relationship may make it harder to prove it is illegal vote buying. But if the aunt says to the niece, \u201cI will give you $50 to vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d that could well be found to cross the line.What would be considered crossing the line, and what type of dynamic could we see this fall?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Trust Your Gut\u2019 Might Actually Be Profitable Advice on Wall Street, Study Says", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat attributes make for a successful trader? Is it comprehensive knowledge of an industry? The ability to read the markets? Luck?Or might it be something subtler and seemingly unrelated \u2014 namely, an awareness of one\u2019s own heartbeat?The team, which included professors from universities in Britain and Australia, was investigating a theory developed by John Coates, a former trader who until recently was a researcher at Cambridge University.Mr. Coates set out to try to identify whether \u201cgut feelings\u201d were merely the stuff of myth, or something real and measurable.\u201cI always knew when I was trading on Wall Street that there was something extra to making it,\u201d said Mr. Coates, who traded fixed-income derivatives at Goldman Sachs and then Deutsche Bank in the late 1990s. \u201cThere were times when something just felt right.\u201dMr. Coates moved on from Wall Street to become a researcher and author. In a previous study, he demonstrated that traders demonstrated physiological signs of stress during market volatility, even when they did not rationally believe they were at risk of losing much money.And in his 2013 book, \u201cThe Hour Between Dog and Wolf: How Risk Taking Transforms Us, Body and Mind,\u201d Mr. Coates relates how George Soros, the hedge fund billionaire, relied on so-called animal instincts. When Mr. Soros was actively managing his fund, he would suffer from backaches, and said that he \u201cused the onset of acute pain as a signal that there was something wrong in my portfolio.\u201dBuilding off that work, Mr. Coates wondered whether traders who were more sensitive to their own bodies might perform better at their jobs.To investigate his hypothesis, Mr. Coates and his colleagues worked with 18 traders at a hedge fund in London in 2012. The subjects, all men, were high-frequency traders, buying and selling bond futures and other products.Using heart rate monitoring equipment, Mr. Coates and his colleagues assessed the traders\u2019 ability to silently count their own heartbeats without touching their chest or any pulse point. A control group of 48 men who were not traders was also tested for their ability to monitor their heart rates.Over all, the hedge fund employees were substantially more accurate than the control group, suggesting that on balance, the high-frequency traders were more attuned to their own bodies than the general public.The hedge fund, which was not identified, gave Mr. Coates and his colleagues access to the traders\u2019 employment history, including their profits and losses, and tenure in the industry.And among the traders, more accurate heartbeat awareness was correlated with profitability. That is, the better a trader was at sensing his own heart rate, the more successful he was at high-frequency trading.What is more, the longer an employee of the hedge fund had been working as a trader, the more accurate he was at counting his heart rate.\u201cWhat we\u2019re realizing more and more is that these things are doggone complicated,\u201d said Bruce S. McEwen, a Rockefeller University professor studying how stress affects the brain, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThere is no simple explanation of them, but we have to be aware of the phenomenology. Coates and colleagues are making people aware of possible factors that are ones other than those we normally think about.\u201dIn the paper, Mr. Coates and his colleagues suggest that acute awareness of heart rate might somehow contribute to traders\u2019 profitability.\u201cTraders in the financial world often speak of the importance of gut feelings for choosing profitable trades,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cBy this they mean that subtle physiological changes in their bodies provide cues helping them rapidly select from a range of possible trades the one that just \u2018feels right.\u2019 Our findings suggest that the gut feelings informing this decision are more than the mythical entities of financial lore \u2014 they are real physiological signals, valuable ones at that.\u201dYet the researchers stop short of establishing any direct causal link between heart rate awareness and trader profitability. \u201cOur study, being field work, could not establish causation,\u201d they wrote.For example, it might be the case that working in a high-stress job like trading somehow makes people more sensitive to their heart rates. Mr. Coates and his colleagues also found that people with lower body mass index and lower heart rate variability had better heart rate awareness.\u201cThey are trying to suggest a link, but then they acknowledge that we don\u2019t really understand cause and effect,\u201d Professor McEwen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Coates acknowledged that the results did not prove any direct correlation. \u201cIt\u2019s a starting point for more controlled science,\u201d he said.Yet he remained intrigued by the possibility that when traders and other employees in high-stress professions were able to listen to their bodies, they made better decisions. He said that in addition to the pulse, other signals from the body such as muscle tension, colon distention, stomach distention and immune reactions might be picking up on things that the rational mind was missing.\u201cThere\u2019s a part of our brain that sends the signals to our body, and it\u2019s really smart,\u201d Mr. Coates said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t succumb to the mistakes of behavioral finance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Phyllis Schlafly, \u2018First Lady\u2019 of a Political March to the Right, Dies at 92", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHer death was confirmed by the Eagle Forum, the conservative organization she founded in 1975.In her time, Mrs. Schlafly was one of the most polarizing figures in American public life, a self-described housewife who displayed a moral ferocity reminiscent of the ax-wielding prohibitionist Carry Nation. Richard Viguerie, who masterminded the use of direct mail to finance right-wing causes, called her \u201cthe first lady of the conservative movement.\u201dAnd in the 1970s, Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment played a large part in its undoing. The amendment would have expanded women\u2019s rights by barring any gender-based distinctions in federal and state laws, and it was within hailing distance of becoming the law of the land: Both houses of Congress had passed it by a vote of more than 90 percent, and 35 state legislatures \u2014 only three shy of the number required for adoption \u2014 had approved it.But the amendment lost steam in the late 1970s under pressure from Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s volunteer brigades \u2014 mainly women, most of them churchgoing Christians (Mrs. Schlafly was Roman Catholic) and not a few of them lugging apple pies to cajole legislators. Despite an extension of the deadline, the amendment died, on June 30, 1982.Many saw her ability to mobilize that citizens\u2019 army as her greatest accomplishment. Angered by the cultural transformations of the 1960s, beginning with the 1962 Supreme Court ruling prohibiting state-sponsored prayer in public schools, her \u201clittle old ladies in tennis shoes,\u201d as some called them, went from ringing doorbells for Goldwater to serving as foot soldiers for the \u201cReagan revolution.\u201d\u201cSchlafly had discovered a genuine populist sentiment in a large female population that opposed the E.R.A., feminism and modern liberalism with the same intensity of emotion that feminists brought to their cause,\u201d Donald T. Critchlow wrote in \u201cPhyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism: A Woman\u2019s Crusade\u201d (2005).Without her and her followers, Mr. Critchlow said, the conservative intellectuals, research organizations and foundations that are often credited with reshaping the contours of American politics might have failed.The conservative theorist and organizer Paul Weyrich said that Mrs. Schlafly \u201cdressed up the conservative movement for success at a time when absolutely no one thought we could win.\u201dFor all her political heft, it was Phyllis Schlafly the person who often animated discussion. With her pearls, perfect posture and Daughters of the American Revolution pedigree, she basked in depictions of herself as the perfect wife and mother. She let it drop that she breast-fed all six of her babies and that she had taught all her children to read before they started school.Feminists said it was her husband\u2019s wealth \u2014 he was a lawyer from a rich Illinois family \u2014 that had liberated her to politick.Her energy was formidable. She wrote or edited more than 20 books, published an influential monthly newsletter beginning in 1967, appeared daily on nearly 500 radio stations and delivered regular commentaries on CBS television in the 1970s and CNN in the \u201980s. In 1972, she formed a volunteer organization called Stop ERA, which three years later became the Eagle Forum, to coordinate her campaigns.In 1975, when she was living in Alton, Ill., Mrs. Schlafly announced to her family at dinner that she was going to enter law school at Washington University in nearby St. Louis. Her husband, by her account, disapproved of the idea at first, and she abandoned it, only to resurrect it when he changed his mind.She received her law degree in 1978, ranked 27th in a class of 186, and passed the Illinois bar a few months later.Some opponents called Mrs. Schlafly a hypocrite for pursuing so energetic a career while championing traditional female roles. She replied by calling her political career \u201ca hobby\u201d and saying she would never offer an opinion on whether women should or should not work outside the home.\u201cShe\u2019s an extremely liberated woman,\u201d Ms. DeCrow said in an interview with Carol Felsenthal for her book \u201cThe Sweetheart of the Silent Majority: The Biography of Phyllis Schlafly\u201d (1981). \u201cShe sets out to do something and she does it. To me, that\u2019s liberation.\u201dStill, Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s pronouncements drove her antagonists to distraction, though they suspected that her biting language was calculated precisely to provoke their outrage. She said that \u201csexual harassment on the job is not a problem for virtuous women\u201d and that \u201csex-education classes are like in-home sales parties for abortions.\u201d She called the atom bomb \u201ca marvelous gift that was given to our country by a wise God.\u201dIn 1980, a protester threw an apple pie in her face at a Women\u2019s National Republican Club reception in New York, painfully scratching an eye.But Mrs. Schlafly was never outwardly ruffled. When Ms. Friedan, during a debate at Indiana University in 1973, recommended that she burn at the stake, Mrs. Schlafly replied in an even voice that she was pleased Ms. Friedan had said that because, she said, the comment had made it plain to the audience just how intolerant \u201cintemperate, agitating proponents of the E.R.A.\u201d were.She was born Phyllis McAlpin Stewart on Aug. 15, 1924, in St. Louis, the oldest of two daughters of the former Odile Dodge, a teacher with two college degrees, and John Bruce Stewart, a machinist and industrial equipment salesman who was 17 years his wife\u2019s senior.Fired by Westinghouse at the onset of the Depression, Mr. Stewart was never quite able to put the family\u2019s finances back together. In 1944, he won a patent for a rotary car engine, of the type the Japanese automaker Mazda later sold, but it went nowhere.Despite his hardships, Mr. Stewart remained a staunch Republican, fiercely opposed to the New Deal.Mrs. Stewart, who was ambitious for her daughters, supported the family with a series of jobs: department store saleswoman, elementary school teacher and librarian at the St. Louis Art Museum. In her spare time, she wrote a book on the history of St. Louis.Ms. Felsenthal suggested in her book that Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s impatience with women who denigrated homemaking stemmed in part from her mother\u2019s wish that she could have kept house and worked for good causes rather than report for work six days a week.Phyllis Stewart attended Maryville College of the Sacred Heart in St. Louis (now Maryville University) and transferred to Washington University. She had no time for friends, dates or sororities, she wrote; instead, as a student, she worked nights at a munitions factory test-firing guns.Even so, she managed to graduate Phi Beta Kappa in only three years, at 19. She won a scholarship to study political science at Radcliffe, and earned a master\u2019s degree there in nine months.Her politics were middle of the road at first. In 1940, she supported the moderate Republican Wendell Willkie in his bid to deny President Franklin D. Roosevelt a third term, and in graduate school she wrote papers supporting an active United Nations. Her ambition was to work for the federal government in Washington.In 1946, she returned to St. Louis to work on the successful congressional campaign of Claude I. Bakewell, a Republican. After that, she worked as a librarian and researcher at a bank and, at 24, met John Fred Schlafly Jr., a 39-year-old lawyer and politically engaged conservative from an Alton family that had made its money in banking and industry. They were married on Oct. 20, 1949.At the ceremony, Mrs. Schlafly said, she did not promise to obey, only to cherish. But she delighted in portraying herself as a traditional wife, even as she kept to a hectic pace of travel, writing, speaking and campaigning after her oldest child turned 18 months.\u201cI want to thank my husband, Fred, for letting me come here\u201d was a favorite opening for speeches. (\u201cI like to say that,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I know it irritates women\u2019s libbers more than anything else.\u201d)But the writer Gail Sheehy suggested that Mrs. Schlafly had used marriage to liberate herself from paying jobs. \u201cPhyllis Schlafly\u2019s formula for the better life, then, is based on marrying a rich professional, climbing the pedestal to lady of leisure and pulling up the rope ladder behind her,\u201d Ms. Sheehy wrote in The New York Times in 1980.Mrs. Schlafly was introduced to electoral politics in 1952, after Republicans had asked her husband to run for Congress. When he turned them down, Mrs. Schlafly, who was 27, volunteered in his stead. She won the Republican primary but lost the general election.That experience, she said, helped her overcome her natural shyness, and she went on to make dozens of speeches in Illinois as an officer of the Daughters of the American Revolution and to start building a national network of conservative friends. She was the president of the Illinois Federation of Republican Women from 1956 to 1964.In 1958, she and her husband started the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation \u2014 named for the Roman Catholic leader who was tortured and imprisoned by Hungarian Communists \u2014 to educate Catholics on the dangers of Communism. Beginning in 1962, she hosted a 15-minute radio show on national security called \u201cAmerica Wake Up.\u201d It was carried by 25 Illinois stations.The Schlaflys\u2019 politics were concentrated on the external threat posed by Communism, not the crusade against domestic Communist infiltration led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin. They opposed summit meetings and limits on nuclear testing and favored a constitutional amendment to prevent the president from negotiating international treaties.Many members of the Mindszenty Foundation were also members of the ultraright John Birch Society, and its founder, Robert Welch, once called Mrs. Schlafly \u201cone of our most loyal members.\u201d The Schlaflys denied they were members.In 1964, Mrs. Schlafly was an active supporter of Goldwater\u2019s presidential campaign. In her self-published pocket-size book promoting his candidacy, \u201cA Choice Not an Echo,\u201d she contended that Republican presidential nominations were rigged by \u201csecret kingmakers.\u201d By some estimates, the book sold as many as 3.5 million copies.Mrs. Schlafly became closely identified with Goldwater\u2019s landslide defeat in 1964, and in 1967 she lost a bitter campaign for the presidency of the National Federation of Republican Women. Another run for Congress, from another Illinois district, in 1970, also ended in defeat.During much of the 1960s and \u201970s, Mrs. Schlafly wrote books about national defense issues, often working with Chester Ward, a retired Navy admiral. Their \u201cKissinger on the Couch\u201d (1975) begins with a proposition: \u201cSuppose that Henry Kissinger is, in the common parlance, \u2018some kind of nut or something.\u2019\u201d In more than 800 pages, they argued that he was.Mrs. Schlafly hardly noticed the Equal Rights Amendment when it was first debated in Congress. Her initial inclination was to support it, as \u201csomething between innocuous and mildly helpful,\u201d she told Ms. Felsenthal. But when, in December 1971, a friend asked her to debate a feminist on the amendment, she read up on the issue and decided that the E.R.A. was dangerous and needed to be stopped. It had already passed the House.The next October, Mrs. Schlafly founded and appointed herself chairwoman of Stop ERA, the volunteer organization that became the Eagle Forum. The \u201cstop\u201d was an acronym for \u201cstop taking our privileges,\u201d effectively summarizing the position of the amendment\u2019s opponents. They worried that earlier laws written to protect women \u2014 guaranteeing alimony and exempting women from combat, for instance \u2014 would be jettisoned.Proponents of the amendment have said that even though courts and legislatures have set aside statutes that discriminate based on sex, the amendment would still retain symbolic importance.Mrs. Schlafly\u2019s followers only grew in number after the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973, an issue that social conservatives saw as a further erosion of the country\u2019s moral values.After her husband died in 1993, Mrs. Schlafly moved from their limestone house on the bluffs of the Mississippi River in Alton to a brick colonial-style house in the suburbs of St. Louis, where the Eagle Forum has its headquarters.Mrs. Schlafly is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.Her son John gained attention in 1992 when a gay activist revealed that he was homosexual. Mrs. Schlafly said she considered the disclosure a deliberate attempt to embarrass her. The revelation did not alter her disapproval of gay marriage. In 2010, she said of gay couples: \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping them from shacking up. The problem is that they are trying to make us respect them, and that\u2019s an interference with what we believe.\u201d(John Schlafly defended his mother and refused to repudiate Republican politicians, like Pat Robertson, who had condemned homosexuality. \u201cFamily values people\u201d are \u201cnot out to bash gays,\u201d he said.)Mrs. Schlafly maintained an energetic pace into advanced age. In 2011, she spoke out for \u201cshotgun marriages\u201d as the solution to unwanted pregnancies. Even as supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment tried to revive it, Mrs. Schlafly strove to make sure it stayed dead.In March of this year, she endorsed Donald J. Trump for president, saying he had \u201cthe courage and the energy\u201d to do \u201cwhat the grass-roots want him to do.\u201dIn her 2006 interview with The Times, she attributed the improvement in women\u2019s lives in the 20th century not to feminism but to labor-saving devices like the indoor clothes dryer and paper diapers.\u201cFeminism has changed the way women think, and it has changed the way men think,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the trouble is, it hasn\u2019t changed the attitudes of babies at all.\u201dLiam Stack contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will \u2018Brexit\u2019 Upset the Melting Pot That Has Been British Fashion?", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Thursday night, on the eve of London Fashion Week, the British fashion world came to an opulent suite of rooms with gilded mirrors and chandeliers, Champagne and canap\u00e9s. Christopher Bailey was there, chatting with fellow designers Mary Katrantzou and Roksanda Ilincic. Natalie Massenet and Anya Hindmarch, Joan Burstein, Vivienne Westwood and Carmen Busquets all hovered close by.So far, so fashion week.But this was no ordinary room, and it was no ordinary function. The party was at 10 Downing Street. And the host \u2014 sporting a crisp, oversize white shirt from a collaboration by the London-based duo Palmer Harding and the department store John Lewis, and some Russell & Bromley lip-motif kitten heels \u2014 was Theresa May, the country\u2019s new prime minister.\u201cBritish fashion is of huge importance to our country,\u201d Mrs. May said, especially the \u201cfashion apprentices, scholarship winners and graduate trainees who are the future of British fashion,\u201d who were also invited to the event. She also noted that the British fashion industry\u2019s contribution to the national economy had increased 8 percent in the 12 months ending in June, to 28 billion pounds, or $37 billion, according to the research firm Oxford Economics. And the sector generates almost 900,000 jobs.\u201cThe government I lead will do everything we can,\u201d she continued, \u201cincluding providing the right investment in training and skills, to help everyone, whatever people\u2019s backgrounds, to go as far as their talents can take them.\u201dFor decades the country, and London in particular, have been perceived as a melting pot of talent, both from home and abroad. Can the city maintain that reputation?\u201cFrom our homegrown start-ups to international fashion houses \u2014 every business in the creative industry will play a major role in ensuring we make a success of Brexit,\u201d Mrs. May said in a statement released later. (She did not mention the vote at the cocktail party.) \u201cBy taking advantage of the opportunities that leaving the E.U. gives us and playing to our strengths as a great trading nation \u2014 we can build a fairer economy that works for all, not just the privileged few.\u201d\u201cIt is fair to say that the majority of London\u2019s fashion industry were not in favor of Brexit,\u201d Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, said in an interview. \u201cSo the priority for us since has been to meet with as many people here as possible to hear concerns and give them access to advice around potential challenges like intellectual property regulations, trading tariffs and visas.\u201dThe council, Ms. Rush added, has joined forces with other arts-based industry bodies to communicate with the government in a unified voice.Lulu Kennedy, the founder of the fashion incubator Fashion East, suggested that while her organization\u2019s criteria traditionally required a candidate to have a business based in Britain, she now would be willing to consider nonresidents.And Ms. Katrantzou, a Greek who started her business in London after graduating from the Central Saint Martins master\u2019s program in 2009, and who was scheduled to show her latest collection on Sunday, noted that \u201cOnly 15 percent of the employees in my company are British \u2014 that says a lot about the type of people we can attract by being in London.\u2019\u2019\u201cThey all have diverse upbringings and perspectives, and came to the city to be part of and inspired by its vibrant arts scene,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI chose to live and work in London precisely because it is such a cultural magnet for creatives, and in proximity to the schools and established brands. Will future designers get that now?\u201dLeaders of the city\u2019s art and design schools emphasize that the answer to Ms. Katrantzou\u2019s question is yes \u2014 and say that they are working closely with the office of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to secure the best possible outcome from a Brexit. Nigel Carrington, the vice chancellor of University of the Arts London, which includes Central Saint Martins, said that the schools had told current students they would be able to stay in the country, and that they have been evaluating the potential impact on foreign students\u2019 fees and the flow of graduate talent. (Historically, students from European Union members have paid the same fees as British students.)Paul Thompson, the rector of the Royal College of Art, said that London\u2019s position as a hub of creativity was not just based on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union.\u201cThere are plenty of global cities that aren\u2019t part of the E.U. which are also great capitals of culture and finance,\u201d Mr. Thompson pointed out. \u201cThe top design talent won\u2019t want to leave London because it still has the best education prospects and broadest spectrum of specialist sectors in once place.\u201dBesides, he said, there were other factors threatening the city\u2019s artistic fabric, such as the eye-watering costs of living. \u201cBrexit isn\u2019t the biggest risk to London\u2019s position in the hearts and minds of creatives,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt is the expense of living here. Many artists and designers are now leaving, and rundown seaside towns like Margate and Hastings are experiencing a real renaissance. That is bad for London perhaps, but good for Britain over all.\u201dSotheby\u2019s, for its part, will hold its annual celebratory \u201cMade in Britain\u201d sale on Sept. 28, with items ranging from Swinging Sixties photographs and colorful postwar canvases to Young British Artist works by Damien Hirst. Alex Branczik, Sotheby\u2019s head of contemporary art for Europe, said the auction house was expecting its best results yet.\u201cThere is a great deal of change and uncertainty at the moment \u2014 for every sector,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the city occupies a unique and powerful place in the creative mind, and in the minds of the world\u2019s collectors. I feel bullish that for now, that position is here to stay.\u201dAnd back at 10 Downing Street, Ms. Massenet was (unsurprisingly) equally upbeat, pointing out that she started her online fashion site Net-a-Porter in 2000, in the depths of the fallout from the first dot-com bubble.\u201cThere have been many booms and busts over the decades,\u201d she said. \u201cBut London fashion and the creative industries have endured \u2014 indeed, prospered even \u2014 in difficult times.\u201dAnd so the long catwalk to the future begins.Advertisement"}

He said that he was looking forward to hosting a summit meeting of Portuguese-speaking countries, six of which are African.\u201cBrazil looks to Africa with friendship and respect, with the aim of advancing projects that bring us even closer together,\u201d Mr. Temer said.Government officials explained that Mr. Temer had included in his figures tens of thousands of Haitians who have made their way to Brazil on humanitarian visas.Brazilian analysts noted that Mr. Temer\u2019s positions on various international issues, including his support for a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict, his condemnation of xenophobic policies and his call to end the United States\u2019 trade embargo against Cuba, stand in contrast to views held by conservative politicians like Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee in the United States.Mr. Temer notably did not make anticorruption measures a priority in his speech, despite the huge graft scandals upending Brazil over the last two years. While Mr. Temer is in New York this week, his allies in Congress tried to hold a vote on a bill that would grant amnesty to politicians engulfed in scandals over illegal campaign financing.Mr. Temer\u2019s administration, which took power in May, has come under fire over testimony and secret recordings that have revealed ambitions to stifle corruption inquiries. Mr. Temer himself has been found guilty of violating campaign finance limits, a conviction that could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Penn Station Reborn", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "The governor\u2019s initiative prompted editors of The Times\u2019s Op-Ed page to approach Vishaan Chakrabarti, who founded Practice for Architecture and Urbanism, a New York architecture firm. Mr. Chakrabarti, who explains his plan in detail below, ran the Manhattan office of the Department of City Planning under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and he is a veteran of earlier Penn Station refurbishment proposals. The challenge: Can we go further than what the governor is doing? What would it take to truly transform Penn Station?In fact, Gateway makes major changes at Penn Station all the more necessary. It requires improvements to the station, which it will need to handle added capacity, as well as the creation of a linked facility where Gateway\u2019s tracks would arrive to the south of the existing station.Skeptics may roll their eyes at Mr. Chakrabarti\u2019s proposal, since even cosmetic improvements have been hard to come by, and the governor already has his own plan. But in recent years, momentum for change has been building. In 2013, after significant public protest, the City Council attempted to spur the Dolan family, which owns Madison Square Garden, to consider moving the arena from its site above the station.Then Gateway started gaining steam.OnePennPlazaTwoPennPlazaW. 34TH7THAVE.8TH  AVE.AnnexPotential siteand air rights forGateway projectW. 30TH9TH  AVE.Farley Building(proposed Amtrak,L.I.R.R. station)MadisonSquareGardenOnePennPlazaTwoPennPlazaW. 34THSTREET7THAVE.MadisonSquare GardenW. 33RD8THFarley Building(proposed Amtrak,L.I.R.R.-- station)AVE.9THFarley annexW. 30TH STREETPotential site and air rightsfor Gateway projectAVE.Skidmore, Owings & Merrill are the architects. As with other big infrastructure proposals by the governor, design doesn\u2019t seem to be his top priority. Vornado Realty, Related Companies and Skanska AB, the construction management giant, are the developers. They will contribute $600 million to the project, according to the governor. The rest comes from Empire State Development ($570 million) and a mix of the railroads, the Port Authority and the federal government ($425 million).So Mr. Cuomo assured everyone. That said, Amtrak accounts for just 30,000 passengers a day, the Long Island Rail Road, 230,000, but only a fraction of them will use Farley. The governor did not predict how many. With the neighborhood to the west of the station booming, Farley is conceived to serve more and more riders, while providing quicker access to and from trains, opening space and relieving strains on the existing station, which will be upgraded. That\u2019s the argument, anyway.But the Garden remains an obvious obstacle to a hub serving all riders, one worthy of the city. Mr. Chakrabarti participated in negotiations during the mid-2000s when the Dolans, Vornado and Related spent years and many millions of dollars exploring the possibility of demolishing the aging Garden and building a new arena inside Farley. The goal was abandoned after Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a supporter, was forced to resign, and the Dolans concluded they couldn\u2019t lose more time before fixing up the existing arena.Mr. Chakrabarti\u2019s plan reconsiders that mothballed idea. Unlike earlier proposals, PAU\u2019s doesn\u2019t envision demolishing the Garden but repurposing it, using its stripped skeleton to make a glass pavilion, which becomes a neighborhood gathering spot, not just a station. As opposed to a wholly new building, this one wouldn\u2019t require any huge cash outlay for a new superstructure or even a new roof. It gets rid of many columns and other obstructions that today make the station a menace to public health. Its passive heat and cooling system would lower operating costs and let smoke escape through the top in an emergency. Independent cost consultants estimated the price tag to be around $1.5 billion.So let\u2019s round it up to $2 billion. Even at that amount, the project\u2019s emphasis on reuse and resilience for a heavily trafficked station make it the opposite of Santiago Calatrava\u2019s shopping mall/transit facility downtown, the $4 billion Path Station at the World Trade Center, which serves relatively few.Original Pennsylvania Station (1910)168 ft.STREET LEVELPLATFORMSProposed Pennsylvania Station153 ft.STREETPLATFORMSL.I.R.R./SUBWAY MEZZANINEGrand Central Terminal (1903)115 ft.Buildings drawn at same scale.STREETPLATFORMSOriginal Pennsylvania Station (1910)168 ft.STREETMEZZANINEPLATFORMS153 ft.Proposed Pennsylvania StationSTREETBuildings drawn at same scale.L.I.R.R./SUBWAY MEZZANINEPLATFORMSGrand Central Terminal (1903)115 ft.STREETPLATFORMSMr. Chakrabarti argues that PAU\u2019s idea doesn\u2019t step on but complements Gateway, and that a new Garden could find a home, among other places, as the anchor tenant in Farley, alongside Amtrak, a concept officials in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office considered when shown the PAU plan. \u201cThey chose not to pursue it at this time not because the Garden wouldn\u2019t move,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti reported back, \u201cbut because they have advanced the Farley station annex and want to see it through. I respect this, of course, but hope they view this proposal as the logical next step.\u201dMr. Cuomo may not agree or want to think that far ahead. But the plan is presented nonetheless as a provocation, to keep up the drumbeat for a better station. Because even with the announcement this week, there\u2019s still a long way to go.But while the governor\u2019s recently announced plan is a step toward this goal, more must be done. What we propose in addition is a completely new commuter station on the site of Madison Square Garden, one that makes use of the Garden\u2019s structure and foundations, in much the same way that the current station makes use of the tracks and underground mezzanine levels of the original Penn Station.East River tunnels toLong Island (4 tracks)19067TH  AVE.W. 34TH STREETW. 33RDW. 30TH8TH  AVE.9TH  AVE.Tunnels toNew Jersey(2 tracks)Open-airpassengerplatformsEast River tunnels toLong Island (4 tracks)W. 34TH STREET19067THW. 33RDAVE.Open-airpassenger platforms8THAVE.9THW. 30TH STREETAVE.Tunnels to New Jersey(2 tracks)Pennsylvania Station1912W. 34TH STREET7THAVE.Post officeW. 30TH8TH  AVE.Western endof platforms9TH  AVE.19127THW. 34TH STREETW. 33RDAVE.Pennsylvania Station8THPost officeAVE.9THW. 30TH STREETWestern endof platformsAVE.Greyhound bus terminal1960STREET7TH  AVE.W. 34THPennsylvania StationPost officeW. 30TH8TH  AVE.9TH  AVE.Post office annexGreyhound bus terminal19607THW. 34TH STREETAVE.W. 33RDPennsylvania Station8THPost officeAVE.9THW. 30TH STREETPost office annexAVE.Facade of original Penn Station19677TH  AVE.W. 34TH STREETPost officeAnnexW. 30TH8TH  AVE.MadisonSquare Gardensteel rising9TH  AVE.W. 34TH STREET19677THFacade of original Penn StationMadisonSquare Gardensteel risingW. 33RDConstruction siteAVE.8THPost officeAVE.9THW. 30TH STREETPost office annexAVE.But equally important, \u201crecycling\u201d what\u2019s there allows for the building of an ambitious new station at minimal cost and disruption. We could restore a gateway to New York with a scale consistent with other great public spaces in the city.Critics of this plan will focus on the difficulty of moving Madison Square Garden. But it would be much more difficult to move the center of the platforms serving the station from beneath the Garden to under Farley. This is why under the governor\u2019s plan, approximately 80 percent of Penn Station commuters will continue to use the tracks and platforms under the Garden \u2014 which means that any effort to improve their experience significantly has to start with a radical rethinking of that site.And it\u2019s not just about current users, who now number 650,000 a day. Amtrak\u2019s Gateway project would add two sorely needed tunnels under the Hudson as well as four new platforms under the block south of Madison Square Garden. All of this means more trains and thousands more Amtrak travelers entering and leaving the station each day.Without a reconfigured Penn Station, these travelers will pour into the maze of the commuter concourse under the Garden, especially if they are transferring into the subway system.The Garden, which is getting old and has problems of its own, has compelling reasons to move. Given fair incentives, its owners, who have shown themselves to be reasonable and civic-minded, could be willing to move the arena 800 feet to the west end of the Farley Building, where there is over one million square feet of underutilized space.Once the Garden is in its new home, its structure and foundations would be \u201crecycled\u201d: We would take off its unsightly concrete cladding, demolish the interior, rebuild the mezzanines and vertical circulation to the platforms below, and remove many of the support columns on the train platforms that passengers have to dodge today.Imagine an open, light-filled station, with no need even for doors, much like King\u2019s Cross station in London (special shutters would deploy during inclement weather), instead of one reached only through dark passages. Commuters now languishing in a fluorescent-lit cave would see natural light and city views.The familiar cylindrical form of the Garden could be transformed into a monumental yet transparent pavilion. We propose that the ceiling, which is the roof of the existing arena, feature a map of New York to orient travelers, a contemporary update of the stars on the ceiling of Grand Central.This is a realistic, economical plan to create a grand civic space, lifting today\u2019s 11-foot ceilings to over 150 feet high, with a small number of shops lining the side streets, a small park to the southwest, and much-needed taxi access to the east.It would cost substantially less than the train stations at the World Trade Center and Hudson Yards, but with similarly effective results. According to an outside estimate by Dharam Consulting, our proposal would cost about $1.5 billion. Building a new arena would cost a similar sum, so the entire project would cost approximately $3 billion. A variety of public and private funding sources, from air-rights sales to tax-increment financing and bonds, are available to pay for the proposal. Given the potential to radically improve central Manhattan while creating a safe and dignified new station for all of Penn Station\u2019s users, this is a small price to pay.By making Penn Station an attractive focal point for the neighborhood, we would increase the value of the area\u2019s office, residential and retail properties.For the health, safety and vibrancy of our city, Penn Station should be transformed into a world-class transit hub with enhanced rail capacity and enduring public architecture, a place that rejuvenates its surroundings, just as has been done in other parts of the city, like Grand Central, Bryant Park and Columbus Circle.It won\u2019t be easy. But the alternative, decades more of gloom in an increasingly congested, unsafe subterranean maze, is not worthy of our city.Corrections: An earlier version of a photo caption misstated the year that the photograph, of Madison Square Garden under construction, was taken.

{"Headline": "For Independent League Team, a New Stadium, Indictments and a Title Run", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis weekend, that stadium, Palisades Credit Union Park, was the site of a championship celebration. The Boulders, of the independent Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, lost a decisive Game 5, 3-1, to the Ottawa Champions.The Boulders have endeavored to capitalize on Cardullo\u2019s success. A spot in left field has been renamed Cardullo\u2019s Corner, and the team sponsored a contest that would send a fan to Colorado to see Cardullo play.\u201cHis meteoric rise from Rockland to the Rockies proves that the Can-Am League plays the game at a higher level than the lower Hudson Valley and northern New Jersey might have realized,\u201d the Boulders\u2019 president, Ken Lehner, said in an email.But on Thursday, a perfect 65-degree night for playoff baseball, only 2,015 fans filled a small portion of the 5,800 fixed seats at Palisades Credit Union Park, which is about 35 miles northwest of Midtown Manhattan.The stadium is tucked away from Rockland County\u2019s primary population centers, with little commercial activity nearby. The Boulders averaged 2,807 fans in 2011, the team\u2019s debut season, and attendance swelled to 3,293 in 2012. The Boulders have led the Can-Am League in attendance in five of their six seasons, but that 2012 average remains their high-water mark.Beyond the confines of the stadium, it is hard to tell that the team has broken through. The Journal News, the largest newspaper in the area, has stopped sending reporters to games, even during the playoffs.Lehner responded to The Journal News\u2019s coverage decision by saying: \u201cThe newspaper business has fallen on hard times. They have had to make some tough decisions as a result. We look at this as our responsibility to communicate our game results and other pertinent information via social media as a result.\u201dThen again, Vanderwaal\u2019s rise did not include \u201clies and accounting manipulations\u201d that led the Town of Ramapo to fund more than half of the $58 million cost of the stadium, as Bharara alleged in the indictments.Ramapo voters overwhelmingly rejected the stadium project for the Boulders in a 2010 public referendum. The town endeavored to build it anyway, with the supervisor Christopher St. Lawrence guaranteeing $25 million in bonds despite a promise not to use public funding.St. Lawrence and Aaron Troodler, formerly the executive director of the Ramapo Local Development Corporation, are each charged with eight counts of securities fraud, 13 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy. The fraud charges each carry 20 years in prison.\u201cThey did an end-run around the voters and ensured no public funds would be used,\u201d Bharara said at an April news conference announcing the indictments. \u201cThey lied. There were other, more pressing needs than a shiny, new sports stadium.\u201dAsked about the indictments\u2019 effect on ticket sales, Lehner said, \u201cWe don\u2019t hear about it and we don\u2019t comment on it.\u201dAll the attendant pleasures of minor league baseball are present at the park: a playground and a train for children; dizzy bat races on the field; and an engaging mascot, Boulder Bird. The team holds frequent ticket giveaways in the community.The stadium has instant replays in high definition on the scoreboard, a rare amenity for independent baseball. Luxury suites around the upper level frequently receive foul balls \u2014 though most were empty Thursday night.The fans who do show up seem satisfied; Lehner said the team\u2019s fan surveys found that 98 percent planned to return for another game. And Bottom 9 Baseball L.L.C., the company that runs the Boulders, is profitable, he added.Allen Fetterman of West Nyack, about eight miles from the stadium, has attended several games this season.\u201cI don\u2019t think about the case,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all sorts of stories about how it\u2019s been financed. Maybe that\u2019s a fault of mine, but it doesn\u2019t affect whether I go and support the Boulders. I enjoy the experience. It\u2019s professional baseball. And you get such a great view of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guatemala\u2019s Fragile Progress", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHAVERFORD, Pa. \u2014 At first glance, Guatemala\u2019s recent steps to root out organized crime look impressive: Working with the United Nations, the country\u2019s attorney general has dismantled a major criminal network tied to the political party led by the former president Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, who now sits in jail \u2014 along with his vice president and some 200 other disgraced cabinet ministers, congressmen, civil servants, businessmen, bankers, lawyers and judges.But looks can be deceiving. Guatemala still faces formidable resistance to change from organized crime, powerful business executives, and corrupt judges and politicians. Ordinary citizens, meanwhile, are reluctant to participate in transforming a political system that they don\u2019t yet trust.The cost of failure in Guatemala would be enormous. Not only would democracy in that country be imperiled, but the prospects for reform across the region would suffer a dire setback.In the last 18 months, Guatemala has done more than just arrest a few high-profile figures. Congress has approved reforms enhancing transparency in political and campaign financing and the allocation of government contracts; other measures aim to professionalize the civil service and the judicial system. A decade of work building a professional and powerful attorney general\u2019s office is paying off. Former prosecutors now run the Ministry of the Interior and administer the tax collection office.These victories, however, are only the opening battle in a war against a formidable adversary: organized crime. These criminal syndicates\u2019 origins stretch back half a century to Guatemala\u2019s decades-long, genocidal civil war, in which military officers and their elite allies plundered the country to maximize the economic gains of war and establish a framework that would perpetually feed their greed.Getting at the root of organized crime means going deeper than a few corrupt officials, something Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina emphasized to me in an interview from jail last year. He knew what he was talking about. The heads have been removed, but as with the mythological Hydra, another generation of criminals is already emerging to claim leadership, and several equally large criminal rings continue to operate unimpeded.Meanwhile, the United Nations International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala and its partners in government and civil society are at a tactical disadvantage. Much of their initial success was built on the element of surprise. No one expected such a forceful assault on corruption. But organized crime won\u2019t make the same mistake twice. Its leaders have publicly threatened the lives and reputations of the attorney general, the presiding judge in the corruption trials, the United Nations commissioner in charge and his chief political officer, aiming to strip them of the will and credibility to do their jobs.The United Nations commission and its partners must do more than stand their ground. So far, they have concentrated on a political purge in the capital, Guatemala City. To consolidate their gains, they must expand into Guatemala\u2019s countryside, where the same criminal networks hold local politics hostage. But at present, the underfinanced attorney general has offices in only 10 percent of the country\u2019s 338 mostly rural municipalities.And there\u2019s an even more fundamental challenge: It\u2019s one thing to root out corruption; it\u2019s another to create the functioning democratic and civil society that can inoculate a country against the disease. Guatemala is moving in the right direction, with growing numbers of citizens coming to understand that a democratic, equitable and just society is finally within reach. But to many, the government still seems incapable of decisive action; honest, enterprising Guatemalans don\u2019t dare sign a government contract, and democracy activists hesitate to enter formal politics.Failure could occur in any number of places. Political pressure and fear could force crusaders in government to resign. The United Nations may decide its job is finished and move resources elsewhere. American support could likewise dry up. Any stumble could lead to disaster, giving the momentum back to organized crime and crushing the public\u2019s faith in peaceful change.What happens in Guatemala matters far beyond its borders. The country is a test case in a region-wide battle against corruption. Reformers elsewhere are watching closely; if organized crime wins out, the illicit forces that govern much of Latin America will be buoyed. But if democracy succeeds, the region\u2019s citizens will gain confidence, inspiration and know-how that can fuel their struggles to build the rule of law.The United States government understands the stakes, and has vigorously supported the United Nations commission and the attorney general\u2019s office. Their opponents, who accuse the United States of neocolonialism when it suits them, are hoping for a victory by Donald J. Trump in the fall, which may well lead to a cutoff in funds for the reformers.But this support has also earned the United States crucial new allies. Liberal Guatemalans, even longtime die-hard opponents of American interventionism, have praised recent American efforts. After nearly a century of backing regimes notorious for oppression and violence, the United States is seen, finally, as being on the right side in Central America.Like the reformers in Guatemala City, the United States can\u2019t back down. Guatemalan organized crime is a major driver in the illicit flow of drugs, weapons and people northward. A partnership based on trust and good will among democratic neighbors stands a far better chance of keeping all of us much safer.An earlier version of this article misstated the manner in which the former president of Guatemala, Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, left office. He resigned, he was not deposed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s a Businessman. Where\u2019s His Business Backing?", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookShould it come as a surprise that not one chief executive among the Fortune 100 has donated money to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign?Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters trumpeted, excuse the pun, the lack of donations from the nation\u2019s largest companies as a badge of honor. Big business, they say, has failed the country, so why would their guy want its support?But the logic of this argument is backward. Mr. Trump has campaigned as a successful businessman, a brilliant negotiator and someone, as he said in his own words, who can \u201cget along with people.\u201d He has contended that his economic policies will unleash unheard-of levels of growth \u2014 as much as 6 percent. He plans to lower corporate taxes, remove regulations and allow companies to repatriate cash held overseas. Together, these policies sound like a C.E.O.\u2019s dream.And yet here we are: Many of the most successful business people in the country refuse to support him \u2014 or do business with him, either.This is not an opinion. In case there is any doubt, here is a list of companies that in the last two years have publicly severed or reduced business relationships with Mr. Trump, mostly over his inflammatory rhetoric: Macy\u2019s, Univision, Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal, Serta, Disney\u2019s ESPN, the PGA Tour, Nascar and Perfumania.Those companies, which have customer bases that include broad swaths of the nation that ostensibly look like the electorate, all said some variation of what Macy\u2019s said: \u201cIn light of statements made by Donald Trump, which are inconsistent with Macy\u2019s values, we have decided to discontinue our business relationship with Mr. Trump.\u201dStill, based on Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, you would think that companies like Apple or Nike, which have railed for lower taxes and are pining to bring tens of billions dollars stashed abroad back to the United States, would be kneeling at the altar of Mr. Trump. (Apple\u2019s and Nike\u2019s chief executives have contributed to Mrs. Clinton.)Granted, there are his views on immigration and trade, which aren\u2019t in sync with United States multinational companies that manufacture products abroad. But then again, Mrs. Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership too, so that doesn\u2019t provide much of a choice.Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric\u2019s chief executive, who employed Mr. Trump on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d when G.E. owned NBC, was asked by Vanity Fair about him over the summer. \u201cThe Donald Trump that I had a chance to work with, I found to be fun to work with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe words? I can\u2019t reconcile with anything I believe in, or that I think the country stands for or that the company stands for.\u201dBy the way, this was Mr. Trump\u2019s reply last year to businesses that stopped doing business with him: \u201cMacy\u2019s, NBC, Serta and Nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country.\u201d (I should note here that I co-anchor \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on CNBC, which is a unit of NBCUniversal.)In fairness, it is worth pointing out that only 11 C.E.O.s of the Fortune 100 donated to Hillary Clinton, according to The Journal. Mr. Trump does have support from some businessmen like Jack Welch, Carl C. Icahn and Wilbur Ross, among others.But for a group that has historically leaned Republican, the absence of contributions is eye-opening, particularly since at least 19 of them gave to the other Republican candidates in the primaries.There is a good reason, wholly unrelated to political correctness, that the business community has not rallied around Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans. On its merits, that plan is expected to hurt the economy, according to nonpartisan economists. It is hard to find many serious economists, except a handful mostly advising his campaign, who say otherwise.According to the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a nonpartisan think tank that includes a list of luminaries from both sides of the aisle, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plan would add $5.3 trillion to our national debt. That compares with $200 billion as a result of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan.\u201cBoth Clinton and Trump would increase the debt relative to current law\u2014 though Trump would increase it by an order of magnitude more, and Clinton\u2019s plan would slightly reduce deficits if we incorporated unspecified revenue from business tax reform,\u201d the committee wrote.None of this column is meant to suggest that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s economic plan will usher in a new age of stupendous growth. It won\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t fully address the need for corporate tax reform, and it won\u2019t bring many companies out from under the regulatory morass that they suffer. It won\u2019t bring trillions of dollars back from abroad. Her plan is unlikely to pump up the economy much compared with the path that we are currently on. It is very possible some of her policy measures could even slow the economy.And finally \u2014 again \u2014 there is the issue of trade. A centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda is renegotiating many of the country\u2019s trade agreements. In a new report published by his campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers suggest he would threaten, for example, to leave the World Trade Organization to get a better deal. \u201cWithout the U.S. as a member, there would not be much purpose to the W.T.O.,\u201d the advisers wrote.There is no question that the country would be improved by better trade pacts, but Mr. Trump\u2019s risky approach could start a trade war that could be disastrous for the country\u2019s largest companies. And the uncertainty of the negotiations themselves could slow the economy and rattle our foreign neighbors; just look at the resignation of Mexico\u2019s minister of finance for helping bring Mr. Trump there to meet-and-greet with the Mexican president. Other countries will want to avoid similar situations in which they could look like they are caving in to Mr. Trump. (By the way, for those who say, \u201cWho cares about what happens to big businesses that outsource anyway?\u201d think about all the money in all those 401(k) plans that is invested in them.)The Trump economic report cites the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group representing big business, and its complaints about regulatory burdens. The suggestion is that big business will back Mr. Trump, since he plans to reduce regulation. Yet it is hardly clear the Business Roundtable supports him. The organization has not endorsed either candidate, and its chief executive, John Engler, told The New York Times over the summer: \u201cWe\u2019re just on the opposite side of Trump on trade and immigration.\u201dMr. Trump, the self-described great negotiator, may brush aside the views of the country\u2019s leading business executives \u2014 but perhaps that is because he hasn\u2019t been able to strike a deal with them.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about a relative lack of support for Donald J. Trump from other businessmen, misstated, in some copies, the period of time for which The Wall Street Journal tabulated donation disclosures.

This month, a group of Taiwanese activists swept through the United States, holding protests that sought to highlight China\u2019s efforts to sideline Taiwan.The group is also lobbying members of Congress to press for the easing of State Department restrictions that bar Taiwan\u2019s top leaders, including the president, vice president and minister of foreign affairs, from setting foot in Washington.\u201cI find it frustrating that the international community has not been able to find creative ways to incorporate Taiwan onto the world stage,\u201d said Mr. Wang, noting past compromises that allowed both North and South Korea to participate in the United Nations, and the 2012 vote that gave Palestinians a nonvoting seat at the table. \u201cTaiwan\u2019s dignity and survival deserve more international support.\u201dOn most nights, the lobby of their building in Midtown is a beehive of public events that showcase Taiwanese films, the island\u2019s high-tech prowess and Taiwan\u2019s growing role as a beacon of tolerance in Asia for gays and ethnic minorities.But Beijing\u2019s good will appears to have dried up. Taiwan has yet to receive an invitation to the aviation group\u2019s forum in Montreal on Tuesday, and the Chinese government has signaled its displeasure with President Tsai in recent months by reducing the number of mainland tour groups allowed to visit Taiwan, worrying the island\u2019s tourist industry.\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking for us,\u201d said Ms. Ou, 42, the Taiwanese diplomat, who is in her second stint as chief of Taiwan\u2019s quest for greater international recognition. Before the General Assembly, Ms. Ou helped coordinate efforts to encourage heads of state to mention Taiwan\u2019s aspirations during their public speeches. Last year, she said, the tally came to 16.Throughout the week, she and her colleagues have been glued to their computer screens, anxiously watching the online speeches for words of encouragement.By Wednesday evening, the reviews were mixed. The presidents of Panama and the Dominican Republic, two of Taiwan\u2019s longtime allies, had failed to mention its plight, but the president of Nauru, the tiny Micronesian island nation, delivered a semantic home run, with three paragraphs condemning Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the international community.The remarks, which described Taiwan as \u201cNauru\u2019s close friend,\u201d left Ms. Ou feeling elated, prompting her to recite a traditional Chinese expression that extols perseverance in the face of a more powerful foe.\u201cWhen you are small and fighting a much bigger adversary,\u201d she said, \u201cyou had better use your wisdom.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to China\u2019s regulation of tourism in Taiwan. China reduced the number of mainland tour groups allowed to visit Taiwan, not the number of Taiwan tour groups allowed to visit the mainland.The United Nations Memo article on Sept. 26, about Taiwan\u2019s renewed quest for its own seat in the United Nations General Assembly, referred imprecisely to the state known as the Republic of China. It retreated to Taiwan after the Communists took over the mainland in 1949; it was not \u201cset up\u201d then.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Email Hack Details Movements of Joe Biden, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hackers on Thursday posted hundreds of emails from a young Democratic operative that contained documents detailing the minute-by-minute schedules and precise movements of the vice president, the first lady and Hillary Clinton during recent campaign fund-raisers and official political events.The emails included names and cellphone numbers of numerous Secret Service agents, spreadsheets with the names and Social Security numbers of campaign donors, and PowerPoint presentations showing step-by-step directions for where officials like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should walk when they arrived at events.The hackers who posted the emails also distributed what they claimed was a scanned image of the information page from Michelle Obama\u2019s passport, though the authenticity of the image could not be verified.The emails were stolen from the personal Gmail account of the Democratic operative, Ian Mellul. They reveal how widely White House officials, Clinton campaign operatives and Secret Service agents have exchanged detailed and sensitive information with people using personal email accounts.There is no indication that Mr. Mellul, 22, who was in effect working as a freelancer when the White House or the Clinton campaign needed help, did anything wrong, and government officials declined to talk about the use of the private account.The newly released emails do not provide specific security details, but they do reveal the types of movements that top political officials make at such events. If emails were hacked before an event, that could present a more serious security issue.One document instructed Mr. Biden to walk up four steps at a loading dock in Cleveland before climbing 26 steps to a holding room. Another used blue arrows to show the route Mrs. Clinton should walk through a donor\u2019s house in Houston. Both documents included close-up pictures of the event locations.Mr. Mellul, who volunteered to work as an advance staff member for the White House and the Clinton campaign as he finished his undergraduate education at George Washington University in Washington, declined to comment. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hang up,\u201d he said Thursday when reached on his cellphone.Cathy L. Milhoan, the director of communications for the Secret Service, said the agency was \u201caware of the alleged email hacking of a White House staffer.\u201cObviously the Secret Service is concerned any time unauthorized information that might pertain to one of the individuals we protect, or our operations, is allegedly disclosed,\u201d she added.An F.B.I. spokesman said the bureau was looking into the hacking. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that officials took \u201cany reports about a cyberbreach seriously\u201d and that the episode was \u201csomething we are taking a close look at.\u201dDCLeaks.com is a relatively new website that has posted documents taken from the accounts of prominent figures like Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the former commander of NATO forces in Europe, and George Soros, a wealthy backer of liberal causes. On the site, its creators describe themselves as American \u201chacktivists\u201d who aim to \u201cpublish a large amount of emails from top-ranking officials and their influence agents all over the world.\u201dMr. Mellul hardly fits either description. His low-level job ranks just above that of an intern.The emails from his account document the often mundane process that White House or campaign staff members go through to prepare for an event, including setting up stages, organizing photo lines, arranging for lecterns and coordinating with the Secret Service about getting clearances for all of the people the politician will encounter along the way.One email contained a spreadsheet with the names and Social Security numbers of almost 100 people scheduled to attend a Houston fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton. In another exchange, a Secret Service agent discussed how many official \u201cpins\u201d would be provided for hotel staff members to have access to an event. After Mr. Mellul said the hotel had requested 50 Secret Service pins, the agent wrote, \u201cYikes.\u201dSeveral of the emails contain what is referred to as a \u201cmovement document\u201d or a \u201csite diagram\u201d involving the vice president, the first lady or Mrs. Clinton. Those emails were often sent to a large number of people, including Mr. Mellul. In other cases, Mr. Mellul emailed copies of the documents to other campaign or government officials, including Secret Service officials.\u201cGood morning all,\u201d Mr. Mellul wrote on May 20, the day of a Hillary for America fund-raiser. \u201cPlease find the attached site diagram for Houston\u2019s H.F.A. finance event this evening. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Ian.\u201dThe emails begin in February 2015, when Mr. Mellul was in the honors program and studying political science. In the messages, Mr. Mellul comes across as a conscientious and courteous young man whose friends would email him for help with their school essays and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.After high school, he jumped into the intern circuit that feeds into entry-level jobs in Washington. In 2014, he received a coveted internship at the White House and later parlayed the connections he had made as an intern into low-level freelance work for the White House.His tryout, it appears, was helping Mrs. Obama\u2019s team at a lunch for congressional spouses on April 15, 2015.In an email two days before the event, Lindsay Drewel, a Washington public relations executive, wrote to Anthony R. Bernal, the deputy chief of staff for Jill Biden, the vice president\u2019s wife, that if Mr. Mellul \u201ccan survive that crazy event (which we know he will) he\u2019ll be ready to go! Haha.\u201dAfter the event, Mr. Mellul even included a Secret Service agent in his round of emails thanking those with whom he had worked. And the day after the lunch, the first lady\u2019s office reached out again to see if he could help with an event in Virginia.Mr. Mellul was excited, and in an email to a friend later that day, he noted that he had been told \u201cit takes a few good trips/events before they really trust you.\u201dOn April 20, 2015, five days after his first job with Mrs. Obama\u2019s team at the congressional lunch, Mr. Mellul described himself as \u201con the advance team\u201d for the first lady in an email to his professor saying he might miss class because of an event.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tourbillon Watches, Made in Hong Kong", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFounded in 2010, Memorigin now offers about 100 watch models priced from $3,800 to $38,000 \u2014 and all designed to reflect Hong Kong\u2019s love of Chinese symbolism, pop-culture kitsch and flash. They feature swirling dragons, jade panels, cartoon pandas, Marvel superheroes and even Bruce Lee rendered in gold.During a recent interview, William Shum, the company\u2019s 31-year-old founder, had on his own wrist a Wall Street-friendly bull design, with a diamond-encrusted arrow signaling a rising stock index. (It can be yours, with forest-green alligator strap, for about $12,000). \u201cBulls are hard-working, plus they represent the bull market,\u201d he said.Like many Hong Kongers of his generation, Mr. Shum was sent to the United States to study career-friendly topics like finance and economics. \u201cThey wanted me to do banking, not factory or manufacturing work,\u201d he said of his family\u2019s expectations.So after studying at the University of Southern California and Cornell, he returned to Hong Kong and a job in investment banking. But in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, he found himself working until 1 a.m. every night and figured there had to be a better way.He was drawn to the same interests as his father, an avid collector of beautiful miscellany and the co-owner of a factory in Hangzhou, China, that began making tourbillon movements in 2000.The company, like many Chinese manufacturers, had the technical know-how to make the gravity-counteracting devices still considered intrinsic to elegant watches but no experience in designing, branding or retailing their own creations. \u201cThere were only about 30 factories in the entire world making tourbillon, and only a few in China,\u201d Mr. Shum said. \u201cThe Swiss models were so expensive. I thought, \u2018Could I make one more affordably?\u201d\u2019The inspiration for Memorigin came when he visited his father\u2019s warehouse, where he had stored intricate Chinese carvings and 19th-century European pocket watches. \u201cI wanted Swiss precision with Chinese characteristics,\u201d Mr. Shum said.Since its first release, the 2011 Antique series that now sells at about $3,800, the company has moved into higher-end collectibles like the 2013 Emperor Jade, which required artisans to painstakingly grind pieces of the precious stone into translucent sheets. Mr. Shum said about 10 of those watches have sold, each for about $38,000.Its most popular watches, he added, feature Hong Kong celebrities like the actress Michele Reis and the Marvel series, some of which has sold out.Mr. Shum\u2019s personal favorite is Window of Time, by Edwin Chuang, a local designer and hotelier. \u201cEach layer is like a transition in life,\u201d Mr. Chuang said of the watch\u2019s tiered concentric circles. \u201cIt\u2019s important to William that he captures Hong Kong\u2019s spirit.\u201dThese are tough times for luxury businesses anywhere. Memorigin, as a privately owned company, does not disclose sales or revenue figures. But in Hong Kong, the world\u2019s largest watch importer, Mr. Shum said the sharp decline in sales of high-end Swiss watches had been affected by global stock market fluctuations, weak European currencies, Beijing\u2019s corruption crackdown and a decline in the number of mainland Chinese tourists.Just before his interview, Mr. Shum had returned from a promotional event in Macau and was preparing for the Hong Kong Watch & Clock Fair, scheduled to begin Sept. 6. He ran around his office in a trim navy suit, having quick meetings with staff members and answering numerous phone calls.His father, Shum Mak-ling, who is now Memorigin\u2019s director, took a more leisurely approach. He showed off his collection of 19th-century Swiss cylinder music boxes, decorated in gilt and mother of pearl with bells, drums and dolls. Cranking one of the handles, he sent the sound of a Strauss waltz into the air.He then walked along the halls to the company\u2019s new research and development center. He sealed his shoes in plastic, entered an air-shower chamber and then donned a white lab coat before sitting at his own workspace.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just copy the Swiss,\u201d he said, looking up from peering at a watch through a loupe. \u201cWe want to learn from their culture. Even 100 years ago, they could make something of such precision.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S.-Backed Effort to Fight Afghan Corruption Is a Near-Total Failure, Audit Finds", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 An effort to fight corruption by monitoring the financial assets of top Afghan officials, underwritten by the United States, has been a near-total failure, according to American auditors.The United States and its allies have long seen fighting corruption as crucial to long-term success in Afghanistan. Public anger over rampant graft in the country is a major reason many Afghans are dissatisfied with the Western-supported government and have turned toward the Taliban insurgents.The United States Agency for International Development earmarked $26.6 million in aid specifically for the asset-tracking effort, on top of $87 million in financing for other anti-corruption efforts over seven years, the inspector general said.The report found widespread noncompliance under the previous government of President Hamid Karzai. Of the 56 top officials who were required to declare their assets as they took office, seven never did so at all and an additional 11 never had their declarations verified, as required by the law. On their way out, compliance was even worse: only 8 of the 47 Karzai officials who left office made a declaration, and none of those were checked by the anti-corruption office.Among the non-compliers, the report said, was Mr. Karzai himself, who appointed the head of the anti-corruption office. Despite his reputation for probity, Mr. Karzai had cash in two German bank accounts and never revealed the account numbers to enable auditors to verify his holdings, the report said. That appeared to be the first public evidence of irregularities in Mr. Karzai\u2019s financial arrangements.An aide to Mr. Karzai called the report inaccurate and said the American inspector general had no right to police the integrity of Afghan institutions. The aide refused to be identified by name. He said the High Office of Oversight was in a better position than the American inspector general to discuss asset declarations by officials like Mr. Karzai.The American report was based on data supplied by the oversight office, according to Jennifer George-Nichol, a spokeswoman for the inspector general.The report said an unnamed official at the Afghan oversight agency told investigators that the asset declaration process for top officials was \u201cwindow dressing designed to keep the international community happy.\u201dMr. Qanuni was traveling and could not be reached on Tuesday. Mr. Patang insisted that he had filed the required declarations, listing one bank account with $2,000 when he took office and $500 when he left. \u201cI have never taken one afghani from the public purse,\u201d he said.The report said that Mr. Ghani\u2019s form was filled out inadequately. It listed cash in accounts at two banks, but did not name one of the banks or give the account number at the other. \u201cWhile President Ghani\u2019s declaration was much more complete than that of President Karzai, our review of the declaration did find several omissions that would likely hinder the HOO\u2019s verification efforts,\u201d the report said, referring to the Afghan oversight office by its initials.Haroon Chakhansuri, the spokesman for Mr. Ghani, said the gaps in Mr. Ghani\u2019s declaration were caused by a technical issue that has since been resolved. \u201cThere was limitation in form space,\u201d Mr. Chakhansuri said, \u201cand a separate letter containing additional details was sent subsequently to the HOO.\u201dThe inspector general\u2019s report said the Afghan anti-corruption office lacked the means, the political will or the independence needed to fulfill its duties. It cited a Transparency International rating of the office\u2019s independence: 0 on a scale of 0 to 100. The office accomplished so little, the report said, that in 2012, the American aid agency cut its budgeted contribution for the asset-checking effort down to $9.4 million from the original $26.6 million.When anti-corruption officials did refer cases for prosecution, the Afghan attorney general\u2019s office failed to investigate or prosecute those cases, the report said. \u201cSome of those cases referred involved embezzlement, bribery, and forgery, ranging from bribes of $1,000 to cases involving more than $100 million, and implicated ministers,\u201d the report said.\u201cThis is of the past,\u201d Mr. Chakhansuri said. \u201cThe report is not covering the measures carried out by the reformist attorney general.\u201d He said that since March, when Mr. Hamidi was appointed, 400 corruption cases had been opened, resulting in 317 investigations and prosecutions.This article was updated to include comment from the United States Agency for International Development.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Islam Karimov Dies at 78, Ending a Long, Ruthless Rule of Uzbekistan", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Islam Karimov, a ruthless autocrat who ruled Uzbekistan for almost three decades, died on Friday in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent. He was 78.A joint statement by the cabinet of ministers and Parliament announced the death, saying he had a stroke that led to multiple organ failure.The announcement followed a long, strange interlude during which Uzbek officials refrained from confirming the death even while the leaders of Turkey and Georgia expressed condolences, mosque leaders were barred from offering prayers for the president\u2019s health, and funeral arrangements were being made very publicly. A respected opposition website posted pictures of cemetery workers in Samarkand, the president\u2019s hometown, digging a fresh grave in a prominent location.The likeliest reason for the official silence was that top government officials had been unable to decide on the succession and did not want to announce that Mr. Karimov was dead until they could also say who would replace him, at least temporarily.The official statement said that the prime minister, Shavkat Mirziyoev, who is widely deemed to be the president\u2019s likeliest successor, would lead the funeral on Saturday and that Mr. Karimov would be buried in Samarkand in accordance with Muslim rites.It is by no means certain that Prime Minister Mirziyoev, who is considered a Kremlin ally, will succeed Mr. Karimov. Rustam Azimov, a deputy prime minister and finance minister, is a possible technocratic alternative.Mr. Karimov\u2019s glamorous older daughter, Gulnara Karimova, had once been seen as having a promising political future, but those prospects disintegrated in a public soap opera involving charges of bribery, money laundering, physical violence and even sorcery.Mr. Karimov rose through the ranks of the local Communist Party until the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev named him first secretary and effectively Uzbekistan\u2019s chief in 1989. He won a presidential election after independence in 1991 and used Soviet methods to govern the country.\u201cHe is the state and the state is him, and it has been that way for at least 25 years,\u201d said Steve Swerdlow, the director of Central Asia research at Human Rights Watch.\u201cIt is a police state where the power belongs completely to the security services,\u201d said Daniil Kislov, the Moscow-based editor in chief of a website, Ferghana.ru. \u201cThe special services will not allow for any alternative on the succession.\u201dThe immediate succession is expected to follow the Constitution, which mandates that the head of the Senate run the country for three months until new presidential elections can be organized. Mr. Karimov repeatedly manipulated elections or referendums to extend his rule well beyond the two terms mandated by the Constitution.Mr. Karimov jailed or exiled his political opponents and muzzled the news media. Political prisoners were estimated to number in the thousands. Torture was rife. He brushed aside any criticism that managed to bubble up despite the oppression.\u201cI am one of those who is criticized for staying too long,\u201d he said in 2014. \u201cBut I want to keep working. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201dWith him gone, there was some question about whether the Islamic State or other groups might try to exploit the transition. \u201cWhether or not the Islamic State sees a succession as an opportunity to create risks for the much-hated Russians remains an open question,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, an expert on Russia and chairman of the Eurasia Group, a risk advisory firm based in Washington.In 1999, Mr. Karimov made his position toward radical Islam abundantly clear.\u201cI am prepared to rip off the heads of 200 people, to sacrifice their lives, in order to save peace and calm in the republic,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf my child chose such a path, I myself would rip off his head.\u201dMr. Karimov responded by expelling American forces from Karshi-Khanabad Military Base, an important link in the supply chain for the forces propping up the government in Afghanistan against the Taliban.Eventually, supply needs trumped human rights issues, and the United States restored relations, even giving the Uzbekistan forces hundreds of surplus armored vehicles as American forces in Afghanistan were being drawn down.Opposition websites alleged that Mr. Karimov beat his daughter in a fit of rage before jailing some of her associates and confining her to her home, where she remains incommunicado.\u201cKarimov first slapped her on the face and then really started to beat Gulnara,\u201d according to an account, attributed to an unidentified security service insider and published in 2013 on the website of the opposition People\u2019s Movement of Uzbekistan.Ms. Karimova took to social media at the time to accuse her mother and her younger sister of dabbling in witchcraft. \u201cThe other part of the family destroys and is friends with sorcerers,\u201d Ms. Karimova wrote in a post on Instagram.Mr. Karimov\u2019s wife and daughters survive him, as do four grandchildren.Some analysts attributed Mr. Karimov\u2019s reclusiveness and violent tendencies toward opponents as well as relatives and associates \u2014 he was known to pitch heavy marble ashtrays at senior aides \u2014 to his early years in a Soviet orphanage.Islam Karimov was born on Jan. 30, 1938, in Samarkand. His official biography said his father had been an office worker. Other accounts suggested that his parents, overwhelmed by a large family and meager resources, put him in an orphanage, at first temporarily, but eventually left him there.He studied to become an engineer, worked at an airplane factory and joined the Communist Party in the early 1960s. He married in 1964, and he and his wife had a son, Petr, but soon divorced. The son is believed to have moved to Moscow decades ago and never returned.Mr. Karimov joined Gosplan, the central Soviet economic planning agency, in 1966 and married for the second time in 1967. He rose to become the finance minister for the Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan in 1983.By all accounts Mr. Karimov hated the political jockeying by different groups in the initial burst of freedom after independence in 1991 and worked to destroy all autonomous political, media and human rights organizations.His antipathy toward Islamic groups is sometimes linked to an episode that same year. With Soviet authority crumbling, Islamic vigilante groups had established security and social services that were lacking in the Fergana Valley, and after one extremist group seized a building, Mr. Karimov went to negotiate with its representatives. He soon found himself humiliated when a young religious leader forced him to pray publicly. Later, he banned mosques from broadcasting the call to prayer.Over the years, Mr. Karimov also closed off the country to outside observers and put the news media under government control \u2014 one reason the circumstances of his death remain unclear.Mr. Karimov never lost his love of Soviet methods, be it for strengthening the domestic intelligence services or fostering a centrally planned economy, even if it kept much of the population mired in poverty. He once infamously criticized the millions of Uzbeks who had gone to take menial jobs in Russia just to survive, calling them \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to work at home.Every year, the government forced about one million students and others to join Uzbekistan\u2019s annual cotton harvest to meet government-established quotas.\u201cHe was a Soviet man to the end,\u201d Mr. Kislov, the web journalist, said.Oleg Matsnev and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s about earning enough for your lifestyle, which can depend on the city you live in, your cost of living, the size of your family and much more. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018What do you want to obtain that\u2019s important to you?\u2019\u201d says Park. \u201cFrom there, you have to target the occupations that satisfy your intrinsic motivators and leverage your strengths. Use your natural aptitude, but at the same time, find something that has earnings potential.\u201dIan Shakil, co-founder of Augmedix, a startup that helps doctors take better notes by streaming appointments to a third-party, also tapped into the financial company's vast network of experts. Like Stojcic, he was mired in student loan debt from an MBA at Stanford and went to the company to refinance his loans before discovering its career counseling offerings.SoFi\u2019s peer and mentorship networks allowed him to meet other technology entrepreneurs, seasoned and early-stage, as well as investors. \u201cIt was cool to be with a similar cohort of recent graduates and early-stage entrepreneurs,\u201d he says. \u201cI made valuable connections, and the mentors helped me make difficult business decisions and gave me guidance.\u201dWhile a lot goes into developing a successful career, there are some things you can do to help you get a head start.Having someone to talk to about where you want to go and what you want to do can go a long way in putting your on the right career path.Having someone to talk to about where you want to go and what you want to do can go a long way in putting your on the right career path.While you don't have to develop a 20-year plan, having a five-year outlook can help you decide what jobs will get you to where you want to be.While you don't have to develop a 20-year plan, having a five-year outlook can help you decide what jobs will get you to where you want to be.Money isn't everything, but thinking about what you'd like to earn for your lifestyle will help you narrow down your career options.Money isn't everything, but thinking about what you'd like to earn for your lifestyle will help you narrow down your career options.The happiest workers are the ones who are doing something that's meaningful to them.The happiest workers are the ones who are doing something that's meaningful to them.While it\u2019s never fun to be in debt, Shakil and Stojcic know that they will pay it off, and perhaps more importantly, that it will pay off. They also know that every career milestone, be it a new job, a raise or, in Shakil\u2019s case, more company growth, comes with a lifestyle improvement. Whether that\u2019s a better place or the ability to live in a more costly city \u2014 earning more has helped them achieve their goals.It\u2019s been an especially rewarding ride for Stojcic, who went from fearing for her life to building a successful career at one of the world\u2019s most well known companies. \u201cI\u2019m doing something I love,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I look back the last 15 years and the grit and grind it took, I can't help but be proud and feel accomplished.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "Pay to Play, Mr. Trump?", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn light of the suspicions hanging over Donald Trump and Pam Bondi, the Florida attorney general, this opening quote from her Republican National Convention speech is particularly rich. \u201cNov. 8 is a day of reckoning for all those who have abused their power,\u201d she said. \u201cWinning this election means reclaiming something to which I\u2019ve dedicated my entire career: the rule of law.\u201dWhile it hasn\u2019t been proved that Mr. Trump or Ms. Bondi violated bribery law, there\u2019s little doubt that they abused the public trust in 2013, when Ms. Bondi received a $25,000 campaign contribution from Mr. Trump four days after her office announced that Florida was \u201creviewing the allegations\u201d in a lawsuit filed in New York against his Trump University. Attorneys general in New York and California are pursuing separate class-action suits alleging that Trump University bilked consumers of tens of thousands of dollars they each paid for a worthless real-estate investment course. In the end, Ms. Bondi\u2019s office did not take any action against Trump University.Ms. Bondi\u2019s office did not respond when asked for an explanation of why she would accept a $25,000 donation from Mr. Trump just days after her office announced that it was reviewing New York\u2019s allegations against him.The Florida allegations are not the first of their kind. In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Trump gave a total of $35,000 to the campaign of Greg Abbott, Texas\u2019 attorney general, now the state\u2019s governor. In 2010, Mr. Abbott\u2019s office had dropped its investigation of Trump University. A 2014 series in The Times recounted in detail how many attorneys general, including Ms. Bondi, accepted travel, luxury accommodations and other perks from corporations targeted by their offices. This behavior is practically built into a campaign finance system in which nearly limitless cash engulfs both parties.If Ms. Bondi promised to back off the Trump University suit in exchange for campaign money during that 2013 phone conversation, it could be a crime. As for Mr. Trump, the $2,500 I.R.S. fine is a tiny penalty, unless voters impose consequences of their own.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Unions and New York City Hall, an Open-Door Relationship Turns Complex", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs what would become one of the most controversial deals of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration \u2014 the removal of deed restrictions on a Lower East Side nursing home \u2014 hung in the balance, the health care workers union, 1199 S.E.I.U., sought to exert its influence through a series of emails and text messages to the mayor\u2019s top officials.The direct pipeline to City Hall was the kind of access that most unions could have only dreamed about; for two decades, successive mayors, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg, kept the city\u2019s unions at more of an arm\u2019s length.But in 2014, with the election of Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who counts those with union ties among his closest advisers, the door opened wide. Phone calls were returned. Concerns addressed. Contract disputes that languished under Mr. Bloomberg were resolved within months of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s taking office. It was a new day for labor at City Hall.The good will went both ways.Early in Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure, unions were among the biggest supporters of his political causes, including a nonprofit advocacy group for his issues and a failed bid in 2014 to push the State Senate to Democratic control. Three of the biggest unions \u2014 1199, the American Federation of Teachers and Unite Here, which represents hospitality workers \u2014 gave a total of $1.25 million to the nonprofit, Campaign for One New York, before it closed early this year; labor unions gave nearly that much to the Senate bid in a fund-raising effort organized by de Blasio aides.But those efforts have brought unwanted scrutiny and potential problems for the unions and Mr. de Blasio: Both are now enmeshed in overlapping state and federal fund-raising investigations, a fact that could drive a wedge between City Hall and its union allies, but thus far has appeared to draw them closer together as they defend their collective efforts as normal and legal.Part of the reason for initially supporting Mr. de Blasio\u2019s efforts came from a sense among some union officials, particularly at 1199, that the lack of an organized effort to support Mayor David N. Dinkins during his administration allowed powerful opponents to attack him and ultimately led to his defeat after one term.\u201cFor us, it was \u2018we can\u2019t let that happen here,\u2019\u201d said Helen Schaub, the vice president for policy and legislation at 1199. \u201cWe supported his agenda, and that\u2019s why we gave the money to the Campaign for One New York.\u201dThe city\u2019s municipal labor unions have largely found common cause with Mr. de Blasio on issues of income inequality and affordable housing that extend beyond the confines of contract negotiations. Union members packed his rally in March after the passage of his affordable housing plan in the City Council.Hector Figueroa, the president of local 32BJ, which represents private-sector janitors, security guards and others, praised Mr. de Blasio for championing issues like higher wages and paid sick leave.\u201cThe mayor deserves an important amount of credit for putting those issues back in the public arena,\u201d Mr. Figueroa said, \u201cand in that way the unions are more influential because we have someone in City Hall who echoes many of the demands that really drive the unions.\u201dMichael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said that not since the Dinkins administration had his union had as much of a friend in City Hall. \u201cIf there\u2019s real hot issues, we\u2019ll talk every day,\u201d Mr. Mulgrew said.But the de Blasio administration has also clashed with some important labor groups, in particular the transit workers union, which he alienated when his push to protect pedestrians led to the arrest of several bus drivers involved in traffic accidents, and the construction unions, which opposed the mayor\u2019s plan to allow affordable housing to be built by workers earning wages well below union rates.\u201cThere is a self-righteous hypocrisy about de Blasio,\u201d said John Samuelsen, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, which represents city subway and bus workers. Mr. Samuelsen criticized the mayor for, among other things, his support for bringing a Wegman\u2019s grocery store to Brooklyn Navy Yard, even though the chain does not use union workers. (He also clashed with the mayor over the plan to restrict horse carriages to Central Park and ban pedicabs in the process.)Mr. Samuelsen, who said the mayor sought to curry favor with certain unions that could help his re-election effort, lamented that such closeness meant several unions were roped into the investigations into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising.\u201cThese trade unions stepped up and did things that are perfectly legitimate to pursue their political goals,\u201d Mr. Samuelsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that he dragged them into this comedy-scene mayoralty of his.\u201dIn the case of the nursing home transactions, which caused controversy because they opened the way for the center to be converted to luxury housing, Mr. de Blasio has repeatedly said his administration was duped by unscrupulous businessmen who gamed the bureaucratic process. But newly released text messages and emails tell a more complicated story: The city\u2019s top officials gave deep consideration to the matter, and the union\u2019s influence was heard loud and clear.Local 1199 was interested in preserving its members\u2019 jobs and satisfying pension costs \u2014 issues that were central enough to be included in a memo about Rivington House, prepared by aides to the first deputy mayor, Anthony E. Shorris, who once consulted for the union.The memo, drafted in 2014, listed potential options (affordable housing, market housing, a for-profit nursing home) and key stakeholders (\u201ccommunity,\u201d \u201ccity,\u201d \u201c1199\u201d). The memo also noted concerns over the $18 million pension liability if the property were sold to anyone other than a health care provider.A top operative for the union, Kevin Finnegan, got in touch with Emma Wolfe, the mayor\u2019s top aide for intergovernmental affairs. The two had worked together before: Ms. Wolfe was once employed by the union, and Mr. Finnegan was her boss.\u201cFinally talked to Emma,\u201d Mr. Finnegan wrote to the nursing home operator interested in buying Rivington House, referring to Ms. Wolfe. \u201cSays she is taking care of it.\u201dThat same evening, on Dec. 17, 2014, Ms. Wolfe sent an email to seven top City Hall officials, including two deputy mayors and Dominic Williams, Mr. Shorris\u2019s chief of staff and a former 1199 organizer. The message relayed the union\u2019s concerns over the slow pace of the sale of Rivington House, which was still protected by the deed restriction.The nursing home owner, Joel Landau, bought the property two months later, and, after the city lifted the restriction, resold it this year for a $72 million profit.Mr. Landau understood the influence Mr. Finnegan and 1199 held in City Hall, cultivating a relationship with him over months by promising to keep a health care facility at Rivington House and, therefore, preserving the union jobs. Mr. Landau declined a request for comment.But by December 2014, all but 21 of the 200 union workers at the nursing home had been already been laid off with severance, according to an email from Mr. Landau that was obtained, along with the text messages and other correspondence, via a Freedom of Information Law request from the city\u2019s comptroller, which investigated the deal. The union believed those jobs would return when Mr. Landau\u2019s company, the Allure Group, took over the property and began operating a for-profit nursing home.That did not come to pass. And because Allure Group owned other health care facilities with 1199 workers, it did not have to pay the stiff pension withdrawal liability, according to a statement from the 1199 S.E.I.U. pension fund.Ms. Wolfe, while declining to comment on the investigations into City Hall or the union, said in an interview that there was constant communication between City Hall staff members and union officials over many topics, including contract issues and city policies that affect union members, such as affordable housing and paid family leave.\u201cThere\u2019s a collective belief that everyone is working on behalf of the same core interests, and so I think that\u2019s an important bond,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said.That bond is unlikely to come apart without a serious challenge to Mr. de Blasio in the 2017 election.\u201cFor the unions, winability is a big factor,\u201d said Ed Ott, a former head of the New York City Central Labor Council, an umbrella group for the city\u2019s labor unions. \u201cHow he looks after Thanksgiving of this year, rolling into next year, is going to be very important.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Williams, deputy director for the association, said.Housing activists said the information was meant to help tenant organizers identify buildings where tenants may be most vulnerable to landlord harassment and to help prevent illegal evictions. The data may also help city officials identify patterns and guide public policy to preserve the existing affordable housing stock, the activists said.\u201cThis sort of tool helps us get beyond the rhetoric,\u201d said Xavier de Souza Briggs, the vice president for economic opportunity and markets at the Ford Foundation, which helped finance the map project. \u201cBecause the picture is constantly changing, tools like this one help to focus precious time and resources.\u201dBut Jack Freund, executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord group, said that the majority of the city\u2019s rental housing stock was now more than 80 years old and \u201cin desperate need of improvement,\u201d so work permits were hardly a reliable barometer of buildings where tenants might be more vulnerable to displacement.The costs for improving buildings are usually paid by new tenants who pay higher rents, Mr. Freund said.\u201cThe effort to link apartment renovations with harassment and illegal evictions is simply wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cExisting tenants, their neighborhoods and the city\u2019s economy all benefit when landlords improve their buildings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Cranes\u2019 Shadow, Los Angeles Strains to See a Future With Less Sprawl", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The powerful economic resurgence that has swept Southern California is on display almost everywhere here, visible in the construction cranes towering on the skyline and the gush of applications to build luxury hotels, shopping centers, high-rise condominiums and acres of apartment complexes from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles.But it can also be seen in a battle that has broken out about the fundamental nature of this distinctively low-lying and spread-out city. The conflict has pitted developers and some government officials against neighborhood organizations and preservationists. It is a debate about height and neighborhood character; the influence of big-money developers on City Hall; and, most of all, what Los Angeles should look like a generation from now.This is a city that has long defied easy definition \u2014 at once urban, suburban and even rural \u2014 filled with people who live in homes with year-round gardens and open skies dotted by swaying palm trees, often blocks away from gritty boulevards, highways and clusters of office buildings. And it is no stranger to battles between entrenched neighborhood groups and well-financed developers seeing opportunity in a wealthy market; the slow-growth movement thrived here during the 1990s.But the debate this time has reached a particularly pitched level, fueled by a severe shortage of affordable housing, an influx of people moving back into the city center and the perception that a Southern California city that once seemed to have unlimited space for growth has run out of track. \u201cWhat\u2019s that old clich\u00e9?\u201d Mayor Eric M. Garcetti said in an interview. \u201cThe sprawl has hit the wall in L.A.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not whether or not density is going to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s whether we plan for it or not. People are like, \u2018Oh my God, this is L.A., and they are going tall?\u2019 Height makes you think it\u2019s more dense. And it doesn\u2019t always compute that way. You have to convince people.\u201dThe resistance has been sharp, reflecting a widespread notion that much of the development has been disruptive and haphazard, as well as strong sentimental attachment to a city filled with handsome tree-lined neighborhoods and classic old homes.\u201cStop Manhattanwood\u201d billboards have popped up in Hollywood, close to where two 28-story towers were approved by city officials \u2014 after a long battle by neighborhood groups \u2014 next to the Hollywood Palladium concert hall. In Beverly Hills, which is a separate city from Los Angeles, a proposal by the Beverly Hilton to build what would be that city\u2019s tallest building, a 26-story hotel, has drawn opposition from the mayor in a high-profile battle that will be decided in a ballot measure this fall.In Los Angeles, neighborhood groups, including opponents of the Palladium project, are collecting signatures for a voter initiative that would impose a two-year moratorium on out-of-scale projects that require special city zoning variations.\u201cYou have huge buildings going on tiny little streets,\u201d said Jill Stewart, who is directing the ballot initiative campaign. \u201cAreas that cannot absorb the development. And communities that haven\u2019t had the discussion about whether they want these buildings.\u201dThe initiative needs 67,000 signatures to be placed on the ballot. It already has 104,000 signatures; among its more prominent supporters is Richard J. Riordan, a Republican and a former mayor of Los Angeles.\u201cOur city is rapidly being gentrified,\u201d Mr. Riordan said. \u201cThe working poor \u2014 the lower middle class \u2014 are being pushed out of L.A. They are giving building permits to the developers, the ones that give money to the politicians, to build high-rise buildings.\u201dMitch O\u2019Farrell, a member of the Los Angeles City Council, called the ballot initiative an overreaction, saying the city needed to encourage growth and development.\u201cPeople have real concerns about how projects will affect their neighborhoods, which are legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are a lot of additional factors in the equation: the opportunities to bring economic growth, to create projects that improve the look of a community, that enhance the safety and security of a community and that also help provide needed tax dollars.\u201d\u201cLos Angeles was built as a suburban city \u2014 it was always put forth as a suburban city,\u201d said Jonathan M. Zasloff, a law professor at U.C.L.A. who teaches land use and opposes the ballot initiative. \u201cYou could be in the city and still be in the country at the same time. So when you got a situation where it\u2019s now a city that looks very different, the people who like the old way are trying to stop it from changing.\u201cChange is scary \u2014 urbanization is scary,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t trust the city. This is a way to stop it. But Los Angeles is not an example of a city where development has run riot. It just isn\u2019t.\u201dThere is a long history here of historically distinctive buildings\u2019 being torn down to make way for new construction, setting off battles with preservationists. Many of the 88 cities in Los Angeles County have historical preservation ordinances, but their effectiveness varies, and much of the construction is proposed for open lots and strip malls.\u201cThe history of Los Angeles is in large part a history of ambivalence about dense development and especially about tall buildings,\u201d Christopher Hawthorne, the architecture critic for The Los Angeles Times, wrote in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to rank as a cosmopolitan, world-class city. At the same time, for more than a century we\u2019ve had blue-ribbon committees, ballot measures and civic debates about height limits for new buildings.\u201cWhat\u2019s driving the newest wave of construction and its backlash, more than anything, is geography: We\u2019ve run out of open space to build and at the same time hit the limits of sprawl,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLos Angeles is doubling back on itself, building in its midsection as opposed to gobbling up new territory along its periphery. We have finally realized that there are real benefits \u2014 in terms of water use, for example \u2014 to be gained by living more densely and more vertically.\u201dLos Angeles has also not rewritten its master plan, which regulates what should be built where, in nearly 30 years. That has led city officials to approve many projects case by case, fueling long-held suspicions that council members are bending to the will of powerful developers.Richard Platkin, a planner who used to work for the Los Angeles Department of City Planning, said the so-called spot zoning decisions meant that \u201cyou have very politically powerful institutions, and occasionally someone with deep pockets, who spends a lot of money to change the zone for one individual parcel.\u201d\u201cThe skyline gets ragged instead of harmonious,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s out of character and out of scale.\u201dMr. Zasloff said growth was critical for the future of Los Angeles. \u201cWhen you have the average renter paying nearly half of his income in rent, that is just unsustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unsustainable for a city that wants to be a healthy city. You can\u2019t have a healthy city without a healthy middle class. And they have to have a place where you can afford to live.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And how about Mr. Schultz?That two well-known American cable news hosts would so blithely sign up with a network Russia has financed with the explicit purpose of forwarding its view of the world says something about the extreme \u2014 and extremely cynical \u2014 media relativism that has fallen upon the land.With the increase in partisan media and partisan media criticism, suspicions run high that every news organization is working some sort of political angle. These days, the accepted truth of a journalistic statement of fact can depend on the politics of the audience it\u2019s presented to.

{"Headline": "Public Companies See Gold in California", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorCalifornia is the capital of American business. One out of five companies on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market hail from that state, according to my recent assessment of relevant data.The figures show that when it comes to formation of public companies, the rich states are getting richer while the rest are in slow decline.Compiling data from public filings and adding in missing data from SDC Platinum and CRSP/Compustat, databases that track headquarters information, I examined where public companies had their headquarters from 1965 through 2013. From 1965 through 1979, 10.07 percent of public companies were based in California. The number has continued to grow, so that from 2000-13, 19.46 percent of public companies had their headquarters in California.That\u2019s an astounding number. A state with 12 percent of our population now accounts for a fifth of all public companies. (In the 1970s, California was about 10 percent of the United States population.)Other states, meanwhile, are in decline. Ohio had 5.58 percent and Pennsylvania had 5.9 percent of public listings in the 1965-79 period. But from 2000 through 2013, Ohio had 2.58 percent and Pennsylvania 3.78 percent of public company headquarters.Illinois\u2019s decline was even starker, as it slid to 3.62 percent from 6.42 percent of public company headquarters. The reason for the decline may be obvious as the old manufacturing base went into decline. The appellation Rust Belt rings true to a large degree for these states as old companies disappear and are not replaced with new ones.Yet the decline is not just in the industrial Midwest. New York and New Jersey also fell. New York fell to 8.31 percent of public company listings from 11.32 percent, while New Jersey slipped to 4.53 percent from 5.62 percent.Other states have had growth. Texas rose to 10.26 percent of public companies from 8.38 percent. Massachusetts climbed to 5.12 percent from 3.95 percent. The state is home to technology and pharmaceuticals, two of the biggest growth industries in the United States.Still, the concentration of American corporate might is stark. Nearly 40 percent of all public companies are in just four states: California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas. Three of them \u2014 California, New York and Texas \u2014 account for a third of the Fortune 500.And the trend is accelerating. In the last 12 months, California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas accounted for 50 percent of all initial public offerings by operating companies, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The geographical shift reflects a changing world. The five biggest companies in the United States by market value are all technology companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 three of them with headquarters in California. Not one existed in 1965. The tech phenomenon has benefited California more than all other states, a rise that seems to be unabated.The continued emergence of biotechnology as the other main growth engine of new public company formation appears to be helping California, Massachusetts and Texas, the three states that have long held the lead in this industry.These three stand out as the winners. Why would three very different states perform so well?One might have expected that high-regulation, high-cost, high-tax states like California would decline over time as companies migrated. Texas, of course, offers a different situation. Yet it is not alone among states offering lower taxes and lower regulatory costs.And then what is one to make of Massachusetts, a relatively small state that is punching above its weight? It has regulation and taxes, and yet also business competitiveness.There is no special formula for states to be homes to companies. Instead, what appears to be going on is a winner-take-all system.California is a good example. It is a state burdened with a high tax rate, significant regulation and extreme housing costs. It is the type of place that you would think would lose business. But instead, California is winning at creating public companies. This may be because it already has a significant base of growth companies attracting yet more people to feed off the infrastructure and then create yet more new, big companies. Similar arguments can be made about Massachusetts and the natural network that its biotechnology companies and universities create.Compare this with Texas, which is known for having good hospitals and generates companies in more divergent fields. This may indeed be helped by a more business-friendly environment, but it is more likely a result of the centers that have developed in these fields.New York is increasingly the home of finance companies with a sprinkling of health care companies. But its people\u2019s skills are more associated with media, fashion, finance and consumer companies. Gone are the days when any big corporation would make New York its home because that was the place to be.This is not to say that other states are not successful in business. South Carolina and Alabama, for example, have successfully created manufacturing hubs by creating nonunion, business-friendly environments.There needs to be more study of why certain states nurture and attract public companies.For these states, the economic benefits are not just from those companies alone. There are also secondary effects. The advisers to these companies \u2014 the lawyers, the bankers \u2014 will increasingly be pulled from their New York homes, particularly to the West Coast. As the new crop of unicorns \u2014 start-ups valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 goes public, even at reduced valuations, this pull will continue and the big services that are the specialization of New York are likely to spread out even more to these other states.The country is still going West, it seems.Advertisement"}

Money for missile defense is included in the package, and the two sides agreed not to seek additional funds from Congress over the next decade unless both agree, such as in case of a war.\u201cThe most important thing about this is the strategic message,\u201d said Ilan Goldenberg, the director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cThe fact that Obama and Netanyahu are able to get this done even when they don\u2019t agree on a lot of things and they don\u2019t have a very good personal relationship is a very strong signal that this is a vital alliance and each side recognizes it transcends politics and personalities.\u201dMr. Netanyahu strongly opposes such an American move, especially if it were made at the United Nations. His camp has expressed concern that once the aid agreement was finalized, Mr. Obama might feel emboldened to go ahead over Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s objections because the president could argue he had already addressed Israel\u2019s security needs.As a result, the finalization of the aid package may not leave either side feeling especially satisfied. \u201cMy take is, given the context, nobody feels like throwing a big party,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East peace negotiator now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Critics of Israel\u2019s policy toward the Palestinians said the United States was effectively subsidizing operations it regularly criticized.\u201cWe are helping the Israelis sustain the costs of the occupation we claim is unsustainable,\u201d said Yousef Munayyer, the executive director of the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, a group advocating Palestinian rights.\u201cThe whole policy is outdated,\u201d he added. \u201cIt goes back to an era when there were major Arab-Israeli wars and when Israel was in a very different place economically.

He publicly declared the funds on a disclosure register for politicians, and his acceptance of them was not illegal.At a news conference on Tuesday, he apologized for accepting the payment, saying that he had only ever \u201cacted in the national interest and the public interest.\u201dBut Mr. Dastyari\u2019s opaque declaration in Parliament on Aug. 31 \u2014 it was just 66 words and came only after pressure from his political opponents \u2014 added fuel to concerns that he might have deviated from Australia\u2019s bipartisan, hard-line policy against China\u2019s activities in the South China Sea. That led to a fiery debate over the influence of foreigners in Australia\u2019s politics.\u201cMinisters have been sacked for less,\u201d the leader of the Greens party, Richard Di Natale, said Tuesday on ABC radio. \u201cLet\u2019s recognize that big-money politics is corrupting the decisions that are made in the Australian Parliament.\u201dPolitical opponents of Mr. Dastyari pointed out that as he was campaigning for the national elections that took place on July 2, the Chinese news media in Australia reported that he was supportive of Beijing\u2019s activities in the South China Sea, a claim he denied.\u201cBill Shorten is standing up for Sam Dastyari\u2019s right to take cash from a company associated with a foreign government,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said, \u201cand then express a view on foreign policy that undermines the Australian government\u2019s foreign policy.\u201dAustralia\u2019s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, urged China to abide by the ruling, and Mr. Turnbull told President Xi Jinping of China after the Group of 20 meeting that Australia expected all parties to comply with the law and not act in a way that exacerbated tensions in the region.During questioning of Mr. Dastyari in the Senate, Stephen Conroy of the Labor Party demanded to know why Ms. Bishop\u2019s party, the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party, had received about $457,000 from a Chinese company that does not do business in Western Australia, Ms. Bishop\u2019s home state. He added that the payment had \u201chopelessly compromised\u201d her.A list published by the Australian Electoral Commission shows that for the year ending on June 30, 2015, the most recent period for which data was available, Hong Kong Kingson Investments, of East Kowloon, donated $152,000 to the Liberal Party\u2019s Western Australian branch.These donations were not illegal, although donations to any political party greater than $10,000 must be declared on the commission\u2019s public register. But the declarations can be made months after the funds change hands, sometimes well after national elections.Mr. Dastyari told Parliament that \u201con reflection, I should have paid that amount myself.\u201dHe added, \u201cI take full responsibility, and I have donated that amount to charity.\u201dAt the news conference on Tuesday, he said he supported the policy on China and the South China Sea shared by the government and the Labor Party.Mr. Shorten, the Labor leader, and Mr. Di Natale of the Greens have said they want an end to foreign political donations.

Dressed in elegant gray-on-gray, she speaks softly of her black-on-black abstraction by Ad Reinhardt, most meditative of Abstract Expressionists. She waxes quietly enthusiastic about a grid of copper floor tiles by the Minimalist Carl Andr\u00e9. She shows off a series of clear plastic boxes by Charles Ross, a pioneer of Land Art whose work with prisms, she says, never got him the attention he deserves.Ms. Dwan settles down in a plush armchair; Mitsou the cat climbs aboard; a voice recorder is turned on \u2014 and the reticence disappears. Ms. Dwan has issues she wants on the table: what she calls the new \u201ccommodities market for art\u201d where great objects \u201caren\u2019t appreciated individually as works,\u201d and the roster of great female dealers \u2014 she doesn\u2019t mention herself \u2014 whose contributions have been overshadowed by their male counterparts. \u201cThey should all get more attention than they do,\u201d she says.\u201cThere\u2019s a rightness to having that show in that building,\u201d the exhibition\u2019s organizer, James Meyer, said by phone. He called the structure \u201cthe iconic building of the 1970s\u201d \u2014 precisely when many Dwan artists were becoming most widely recognized.Mr. Meyer compared Ms. Dwan to fabled art dealers such as Paul Durand-Ruel, who helped promote Impressionism, and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who did the same for Cubism. But even those greats may not have had quite the prophetic skills of Ms. Dwan, or her range. In the space of just a dozen years, she was present at the creation of a series of influential movements, from Minimalism to Conceptualism to Land Art. Those are all now held in depth at the National Gallery, thanks to the 250 works that Ms. Dwan has donated or promised.Ms. Dwan speaks of being born in Minneapolis in 1931, into a middle-class family. (\u201cI\u2019ve never told my age before, but by now I\u2019ve gotten old enough to think, \u2018May as well.\u2019\u201d) She moved to Los Angeles when she was 17 and enrolled in fine art at U.C.L.A. After a decade spent dipping into the art scene, she opened a gallery near the university campus, miles from the city\u2019s most notable dealers, on La Cienega Boulevard.Irving Blum, one of them, remembers the splash the Dwan Gallery made with exhibitions of Reinhardt\u2019s radical black-on-blacks; of Yves Klein\u2019s blue-on-blues; and of the Combines of Robert Rauschenberg, which married painting and assemblage art. While Mr. Blum was promoting the Los Angeles art scene, Ms. Dwan leapfrogged over his efforts, introducing Angelenos to the most challenging work she could bring back from New York and Paris.The Washington exhibition dwells on the voyages of Ms. Dwan and the new Jet Age culture she was part of \u2014 on \u201cthe technologies of travel, and how this was affecting aesthetic practice,\u201d as Mr. Meyer put it. The advent of passenger jets and the new Interstate System let Ms. Dwan, her artists and their work cross the continent, and the Atlantic, as never before.There was one other aspect to the Jet Age that Mr. Blum can\u2019t help pointing out: The new travel cost money, and Ms. Dwan had lots of that, inherited from a grandfather who had a role in founding the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company \u2014 better known as 3M. It made for an unusually strong safety net.Ms. Dwan was free to show the absolutely unsalable: Her first collectors resisted the appeal even of Rauschenberg\u2019s Combines.If an artist had ambitions to work on a grand scale, Ms. Dwan could help. Mark di Suvero once shipped in a sculpture that was too big to fit her two-story space, but rather than ask him to scale back, she cut a hole in her ceiling.If an artist\u2019s work wasn\u2019t attracting buyers, she\u2019d offer a stipend to keep food on the table.Carl Andr\u00e9 was one of those struggling artists. Reached on the phone at his New York studio, he recalled trying to pay her back once his career took off: \u201cVirginia said, \u2018Oh, forget about that.\u2019\u201dMs. Dwan\u2019s home in Malibu included a guesthouse where artists could stay for as long as it took to make new work in the gallery: \u201cThere was a feeling of connection, other than just paying them \u2014 I was interested in their ideas,\u201d Ms. Dwan recalled.\u201cShe liked the company of artists,\u201d said Mr. Andr\u00e9, who especially valued the \u201cFriday-night socials\u201d hosted by Ms. Dwan and the range of thoughts they put in play. \u201cHer tastes were small-c catholic.\u201dContemporaries say that Ms. Dwan came closer to functioning as an Old World patron than a New World dealer. But in capitalist, democratic America, the \u201cdealer\u201d label may have helped make her more effective. Artists felt better taking a stipend against future sales than accepting aristocratic largess; an offer of yearly shows before a gallery\u2019s public was more appealing than an offer to deck out a patron\u2019s walls.Ms. Dwan\u2019s greatest moment as a Jet Age Medici came after 1965, when she opened her New York gallery. She backed the new medium of Land Art. When Robert Smithson wanted to work on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, her encouragement and funds led to his landmark \u201cSpiral Jetty.\u201d On a plot in Arizona, she commissioned Walter de Maria\u2019s first version of his great \u201cLightning Field.\u201d She began to finance Charles Ross\u2019s \u201cStar Axis,\u201d a stellar observatory, of sorts, still in progress today on a mesa in New Mexico.That list of names \u2014 all male \u2014 reveals Ms. Dwan\u2019s one notable blind spot as a dealer and art lover: She didn\u2019t recognize the importance of all the female artists, and the feminist works, that now seem crucial to that era. \u201cVirginia Dwan was the head of a very exclusive boys\u2019 club,\u201d the feminist artist Judith Bernstein wrote in a recent email, adding, \u201cMinimal and Land Art was a very exclusionary club, which few women were allowed to enter.\u201dAgnes Denes, one of several women who did do notable work on the land, was included in a group show at the Dwan but felt there wasn\u2019t much chance of being added to its roster of artists which did include some women \u2014 Niki de Saint Phalle was the most famous among them \u2014 but was clearly heavy on men. Given the pervasive sexism in New York\u2019s the gallery scene, \u201cYou just didn\u2019t try,\u201d she said in a recent phone call.Ms. Denes believes there was a larger, artistic gap between the work of Ms. Dwan\u2019s \u201cboys\u201d and what women like her were up to. Male artists worked on the land \u201cas an extension of their studios \u2014 they needed more space,\u201d she said, and what they came up with served the traditional goals of achieving transcendence and the sublime, or at least splashy, impressive effects. Whereas their female peers tended to have a new, more political edge to their art \u2014 in Ms. Denes\u2019s case, drawing attention to ecological issues that were just hitting the news.As Ms. Dwan put it, \u201cNegative space, emptiness, monochrome \u2014 those are all things that are meaningful to me, and very important in art.\u201d She admits that politics comes further down that list. Reached at his Dwan-funded mesa, Mr. Ross dwelled on the \u201cspiritual interests\u201d that inspired his patron\u2019s concern for space and light and the land. Ms. Dwan herself mentioned time spent at ashrams and Buddhist retreats but insisted that, for her, \u201cart answers that need, that search, better than any other form.\u201dAfter shuttering her gallery in 1971 \u2014 \u201cI couldn\u2019t continue forever to lose money\u201d \u2014 she spent the cash once swallowed by gallery overhead directly on artists\u2019 ventures.But there\u2019s no doubt that Ms. Dwan\u2019s own skills as a promoter of art that was pure idea, or art so massive it could only live a jet flight away, had already made her outgrow the role of gallery owner. As Mr. Meyer has written, \u201cThe most adventuresome of her artists had brought the white cube \u2014 the pristine, \u2018neutral\u2019 aesthetic container \u2014 to the brink of irrelevance.\u201dShe helped it get there.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "EpiPen Maker Lobbies to Shift High Costs to Others", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Against a growing outcry over the surging price of EpiPens, a chorus of prominent voices has emerged with a smart-sounding solution: Add the EpiPen, the lifesaving allergy treatment, to a federal list of preventive medical services, a move that would eliminate the out-of-pocket costs of the product for millions of families \u2014 and mute the protests.A point not mentioned by these advocates is that a big potential beneficiary of the campaign is Mylan, the pharmaceutical giant behind EpiPens. The company would be able to continue charging high prices for the product without patients complaining about the cost.An examination of the campaign by The New York Times, including a review of documents and interviews with more than a dozen people, shows that Mylan is well aware of that benefit and, in fact, has been helping orchestrate and pay for the effort.Instead, the federal government, health insurers and employers would pay the bill. Those costs, in turn, could be passed on to consumers in other ways, as in higher premiums or higher co-pays on other drugs.Mylan, in a statement, acknowledged financing \u201cresearch, resource development and travel\u201d by the nonprofit coalition Ms. Winders formed in collaboration with the company to help push for the change. But, the company said, \u201cwe were clear in our corporate sponsorship agreements that the coalition would maintain control.\u201dThe company also pointed to steps it had taken to lower the price of the EpiPen. Mylan has announced more rebates for some patients and it is preparing to release a less expensive generic version.The EpiPen is an epinephrine auto-injector, meaning it contains a portable supply of epinephrine that can be quickly administered to a person suffering from an allergic reaction. Proponents of adding EpiPen to the federal list argue that it can prevent a fatal allergic reaction, by stopping anaphylactic shock from progressing, if taken immediately.Getting the designation could be difficult, since there are no prescription medications for diagnosed illnesses on the preventive list. The task force has recommended at least one over-the-counter medication: aspirin. But generally it lists treatments for a patient only if there are \u201cno signs or symptoms of the specific disease or condition,\u201d the agency said \u2014 like a cancer screening. The task force chairwoman, in a statement, appeared to all but rule out adding EpiPens to its list of recommendations.But a review of Mylan\u2019s lobbying history makes clear that the company has an exceptional track record at influencing government policies, both in Washington and in state capitals. Heather Bresch, Mylan\u2019s chief executive, called the effort \u201cour unconventional approach to growing this franchise\u201d in remarks to Wall Street analysts last year.Effectively pushing such arguments through various public awareness campaigns has helped expand the epinephrine auto-injector market. The product now accounts for 99 percent of the market\u2019s $1 billion in sales in the first six months of this year, the research firm IMS Health estimates.EpiPen\u2019s market dominance is partly the result of the recall last year of a main competitor, Auvi-Q, after its manufacturer discovered problems with the dosage.The drive to get EpiPens added to the preventive services list appears to have started in earnest late last year, just as the public and politicians started to focus on drug pricing.Mylan gives money to Ms. Winders\u2019s organization to help expand treatment for severe allergies. She would not say how much the company has given, or the exact terms, citing a confidentiality agreement. But part of that money is related to this push, Ms. Winders acknowledged.\u201cI am being compensated to ensure access to epinephrine,\u201d Ms. Winders said in an interview last week.Nina Devlin, a Mylan executive, rejected a request by The Times to release these nonprofit groups from their confidentiality agreements. But she did say that the company donated a total of $1.8 million this year to nine nonprofits \u201cin support of anaphylaxis awareness and education initiatives,\u201d of which about $227,500 was to push for the federal listing.Financial relationships between pharmaceutical companies and patient advocacy groups are extremely common \u2014 and often benefit the drug company\u2019s lobbying agendas.Eleanor Garrow-Holding, the president of the Ohio-based Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Connection Team, said the effort was \u201cinitiated by Mylan\u201d and acknowledged that her group also receives annual grants from the company.After The Times raised questions about the arrangement, she added in an email this week that Mylan was \u201cnot part of this task force moving forward. Only the patient advocacy groups are actively participating.\u201dIn addition, Ms. Winders and Ms. Garrow-Holding both took offense to the idea that Mylan\u2019s money had affected their organizations\u2019 work.\u201cMylan nor any other industry partner dictates our position,\u201d Ms. Winders said. \u201cThey have no direct influence over our messaging.\u201dBut at least two groups declined to participate in the effort, citing the appearance of a conflict of interest, their representatives said in interviews.\u201cAs we looked at it, we thought, \u2018No way that we could do that,\u2019\u201d Dr. Lanier said.\u201cWe just didn\u2019t feel, given the structuring, that it fully aligned with our role as a patient advocate,\u201d Dr. Baker said. (He would not name the organization that he said had offered him the money, citing a confidentiality agreement.)With the nonprofit groups that still take donations from Mylan, the effort to get epinephrine auto-injectors on the preventive list is moving ahead.The article Dr. Fromer published in The American Journal of Medicine will almost certainly help the cause. It makes the exact argument that Mylan wants to push: \u201cThe recognition and classification of epinephrine as a preventive medicine by both the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and insurers could increase patient access, improve outcomes and save lives.\u201dThe article, published online in late August, says in an acknowledgments section that Mylan paid for medical writing consultants who \u201cdrafted and revised\u201d the paper based on input from Dr. Fromer. But in interviews, Dr. Fromer and a Mylan spokesman said the article had not been ghostwritten and that Dr. Fromer was heavily involved in the paper. He said he intended to ask the journal to revise the language in the article to make clear that he helped write it.\u201cMy sole purpose in writing this article was to improve access to a lifesaving medication for millions of patients,\u201d he said. He added that while he has served as a consultant to Mylan \u2014 with payments as recently as December \u2014 he was not paid by the company to write the article.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, whose office was among those contacted recently by the nonprofit groups working with Mylan, said he was disappointed with the company\u2019s tactics: turning to patient groups and a doctor it has retained as a consultant to try to get its drug on the preventive list.\u201cThis is the dark side of pharmaceutical practices in enlisting and paying professionals to pitch their profit-making drug,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Trump Win on Native Soil?", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore setting off on Wednesday to visit Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the president of Mexico, Donald Trump appeared to be making a feint toward equivocation on immigration and trade. But with less than 10 weeks to go before Election Day, a blustering Trump told an expectant audience in Arizona that he wasn\u2019t reneging on his signature promise. After failing to address the issue with Pe\u00f1a Nieto in a serious way \u2014 bringing back nothing concrete and providing no further details \u2014 he blithely told a rally in Phoenix:We will build a great wall along the southern border. And Mexico will pay for the wall. One hundred percent. They don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for it.The election still must be won on native ground, though, and all flimflam aside, Trump still faces a narrow Electoral College pathway to 270 votes.The most striking thing about the less than impressive Trump rally in Manchester, N.H., I attended last week was the near complete absence of any of the state\u2019s prominent Republicans.In normal times, you could not keep ambitions politicians away from an opportunity to meet and greet 800-plus voters two weeks ahead of the state primary on Sept. 13, and with Election Day in sight.Other Republicans in tough races in New Hampshire have decided that sticking with Trump is a losing bet in a state that has moved from red to purple. They are keeping him at arm\u2019s length.Facing a tough challenge from Maggie Hassan, the Democratic Governor, Ayotte, who campaigned long and hard for Mitt Romney in 2012, has tried to describe what she calls a \u201cbig distinction.\u201dOn one hand, she said \u201cEveryone gets a vote, I do too.\u201d On the other, \u201can endorsement is when you are campaigning with someone.\u201dWhile this is just the kind of distinction without a difference voters are suspicious of, Ayotte is very clearly not campaigning with Trump.I am going to be doing what\u2019s best for my campaign and the voters who are putting their trust in me. Whatever happens on the campaign trail will be built around that.In contrast \u2014 at least before the latest Clinton foundation revelations \u2014 New Hampshire Democrats were solidly in Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp. The WBUR survey found that 86 percent of Democrats said they would vote for Clinton, while 4 percent would vote for Trump; 8 percent said they would vote for a third-party candidate and one percent said they were undecided.Even more troubling for local Republican candidates is the finding that independent voters favor Clinton over Trump by better than two to one, 49-23.A higher than average share of New Hampshire voters do not align with either party \u2014 pollsters estimate that 15 to 17 percent fall into this category \u2014 and they play a crucial role in determining the outcome of general elections.Democrats, for their part, are doing everything they can to turn Trump into a Republican albatross.New Hampshire, once one of the most reliably Republican states in the nation, began to shift in a Democratic direction in 1992. From 1992 to 2012, Democratic presidential candidates carried the state in every election except 2000. Democratic candidates have also won nine of the last 10 gubernatorial elections, which take place every two years.New Hampshire reflects many of the difficulties facing the Trump campaign.And if you look at New York, you look at Indiana, you look at Pennsylvania, you look at all of them \u2026 they all have one thing in common. No matter where you go, it\u2019s like 40 percent, it\u2019s like 50 percent, 60 percent, jobs are gone.Second, Trump\u2019s Manchester rally itself raises a basic question: Why was the Republican presidential nominee spending valuable time in New Hampshire, a state with a paltry four Electoral College votes? His trip here last Thursday was his second this summer and his fourth since he won big in the state primary in February.Joel Benenson, pollster and strategist for the Clinton campaign, said in a phone interview that New Hampshire reflects the national campaign:The dynamic here is that there is no state where Trump is forcing us to play defense in a state we wouldn\u2019t play in anyway. He is not pushing into our map. States like New Hampshire, he can\u2019t afford to lose, while we have opportunity states, like Virginia, Arizona and North Carolina. Real opportunities to expand the map.Another factor in Trump\u2019s decision to invest a chunk of time in New Hampshire last week is that he has no strong surrogates here to build momentum. With prominent Republicans shunning him, he has to do his own heavy lifting.Voters I talked to in downtown Concord expressed a strong distaste for both candidates, but generally tilted toward Clinton when pressed.A policewoman ticketing cars on North Main Street initially said she did not like either candidate \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m thankful I\u2019m wearing this uniform so I don\u2019t have to answer you.\u201d But as the conversation progressed, she acknowledged that she was almost certain to vote for Clinton. \u201cShe wants to help families, jobs, the middle class. There really is no other choice.\u201d As for Trump, \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word that comes out of his mouth.\u201dJeffery Wells, 51, who told me that he receives annual disability payments of roughly $22,000 for COPD and back trouble, captured the conflicted feelings of some Clinton supporters:Like her, no. But vote for her, yes. She\u2019s much more experienced, she\u2019s been everywhere, she has done a lot for families and children.Bill and Christine White are independent voters who moved to New Hampshire from Massachusetts 15 years ago after they retired. Ms. White, who recalled her support for George McGovern in 1972, said \u201cTrump is the worst candidate I can remember in my life.\u201d Her husband believes that \u201cHillary is just saying everything people want to hear.\u201d Both Whites plan to vote for a third-party candidate so that, as Bill White said, they can \u201cfeel morally right.\u201dThere are orthodox Republicans who do plan to support Trump.They argued that Trump would be more reasonable in the White House than he has been on the campaign trail, and that his experience in business would make him a good chief executive.\u201cHe\u2019s not crazy. You don\u2019t get where he is by being crazy,\u201d said David P. Currier, a former state senator who now is running the Henniker Brewing Company. \u201cHe says a lot of things for effect \u2014 he\u2019s a New Yorker.\u201dBob Nash, a state lobbyist for an insurance agents association, said that he is confident that Trump, once in the White House, would be constrained by the American system of government.\u201cI am a firm believer in the check and balances in our system,\u201d Nash said, adding \u201cTrump is an intelligent man, he\u2019s been a successful man all his life.\u201dNash said he voted for Clinton in the 2008 New Hampshire primary, but that as a veteran he is now firmly opposed to her bid because he believes she mismanaged the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi. \u201cI am absolutely convinced without a shadow of a doubt that she lied to those parents,\u201d he said.Leigh Bosse, 69, who publishes a weekly paper in Hillsborough, N.H., said he was voting for Trump, but with mixed feelings.\u201cI\u2019ve put my foot in my mouth many times, but he does it daily,\u201d Bosse said. \u201cTrump says some good things, but by God\u201d \u2014 Bosse paused to show his exasperation. He said he would vote for Gary Johnson if the Libertarian Party nominee had a chance of winning. But as a practical matter, Bosse said he will vote for Trump in large part because he finds Clinton anathema: \u201cI can\u2019t believe Hillary hasn\u2019t been indicted.\u201dTrump\u2019s uphill fight to win New Hampshire is likely to be made steeper by the Union Leader, the dominant paper in the state.Trump has shown himself to be a crude blowhard with no clear political philosophy and no deeper understanding of the important and serious role of President of the United States than one of the goons he lets rough up protesters in his crowds.The Trump-McQuaid dust-up illuminates some of the most important dilemmas facing the Trump campaign.Rothwell analyzed geographic and demographic characteristics of 87,428 adults asked in Gallup Daily Tracking surveys in July if they had favorable or unfavorable views of Trump.Rothwell found thatTrump\u2019s supporters are older, with higher household incomes, are more likely to be male, white non-Hispanic, less likely to identify as LGBTQ, less likely to hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher education, more likely to be a veteran or family member of a veteran, more likely to work in a blue-collar occupation, and are more likely to be Christian and report that religion is important to them.In addition, racial isolation increases the likelihood of Trump support:People living in ZIP codes with disproportionately high shares of white residents are significantly and robustly more likely to view Trump favorably.Trump\u2019s problem, in New Hampshire and elsewhere, is that his pockets of strength are not substantial enough to produce majorities. In the huge Gallup sample, 65 percent reported unfavorable views of Trump.The funny thing is that what would make a Trump victory most plausible is just the kind of un-American activity he has been campaigning against \u2014 in this case, a multiparty parliamentary system. For good or ill, many European electoral systems foster, rather than suffocate, candidates who can\u2019t win majorities but who have a shot at winning a plurality.It\u2019s not the kind of country Trump would want to live in, but it\u2019s the kind of country that might elect him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018Hitler,\u2019 an Ascent From \u2018Dunderhead\u2019 to Demagogue", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesHow did Adolf Hitler \u2014 described by one eminent magazine editor in 1930 as a \u201chalf-insane rascal,\u201d a \u201cpathetic dunderhead,\u201d a \u201cnowhere fool,\u201d a \u201cbig mouth\u201d \u2014 rise to power in the land of Goethe and Beethoven? What persuaded millions of ordinary Germans to embrace him and his doctrine of hatred? How did this \u201cmost unlikely pretender to high state office\u201d achieve absolute power in a once democratic country and set it on a course of monstrous horror?A host of earlier biographers (most notably Alan Bullock, Joachim Fest and Ian Kershaw) have advanced theories about Hitler\u2019s rise, and the dynamic between the man and his times. Some have focused on the social and political conditions in post-World War I Germany, which Hitler expertly exploited \u2014 bitterness over the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles and a yearning for a return to German greatness; unemployment and economic distress amid the worldwide Depression of the early 1930s; and longstanding ethnic prejudices and fears of \u201cforeignization.\u201dOther writers \u2014 including the dictator\u2019s latest biographer, the historian Volker Ullrich \u2014 have focused on Hitler as a politician who rose to power through demagoguery, showmanship and nativist appeals to the masses. In \u201cHitler: Ascent, 1889-1939,\u201d Mr. Ullrich sets out to strip away the mythology that Hitler created around himself in \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and he also tries to look at this \u201cmysterious, calamitous figure\u201d not as a monster or madman, but as a human being with \u201cundeniable talents and obviously deep-seated psychological complexes.\u201d\u201cIn a sense,\u201d he says in an introduction, \u201cHitler will be \u2018normalized\u2019 \u2014 although this will not make him seem more \u2018normal.\u2019 If anything, he will emerge as even more horrific.\u201dThis is the first of two volumes (it ends in 1939 with the dictator\u2019s 50th birthday) and there is little here that is substantially new. However, Mr. Ullrich offers a fascinating Shakespearean parable about how the confluence of circumstance, chance, a ruthless individual and the willful blindness of others can transform a country \u2014 and, in Hitler\u2019s case, lead to an unimaginable nightmare for the world.Mr. Ullrich, like other biographers, provides vivid insight into some factors that helped turn a \u201cMunich rabble-rouser\u201d \u2014 regarded by many as a self-obsessed \u201cclown\u201d with a strangely \u201cscattershot, impulsive style\u201d \u2014 into \u201cthe lord and master of the German Reich.\u201d\u2022 Hitler was often described as an egomaniac who \u201conly loved himself\u201d \u2014 a narcissist with a taste for self-dramatization and what Mr. Ullrich calls a \u201ccharacteristic fondness for superlatives.\u201d His manic speeches and penchant for taking all-or-nothing risks raised questions about his capacity for self-control, even his sanity. But Mr. Ullrich underscores Hitler\u2019s shrewdness as a politician \u2014 with a \u201ckeen eye for the strengths and weaknesses of other people\u201d and an ability to \u201cinstantaneously analyze and exploit situations.\u201d\u2022 Hitler was known, among colleagues, for a \u201cbottomless mendacity\u201d that would later be magnified by a slick propaganda machine that used the latest technology (radio, gramophone records, film) to spread his message. A former finance minister wrote that Hitler \u201cwas so thoroughly untruthful that he could no longer recognize the difference between lies and truth\u201d and editors of one edition of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d described it as a \u201cswamp of lies, distortions, innuendoes, half-truths and real facts.\u201d\u2022 Hitler was an effective orator and actor, Mr. Ullrich reminds readers, adept at assuming various masks and feeding off the energy of his audiences. Although he concealed his anti-Semitism beneath a \u201cmask of moderation\u201d when trying to win the support of the socially liberal middle classes, he specialized in big, theatrical rallies staged with spectacular elements borrowed from the circus. Here, \u201cHitler adapted the content of his speeches to suit the tastes of his lower-middle-class, nationalist-conservative, ethnic-chauvinist and anti-Semitic listeners,\u201d Mr. Ullrich writes. He peppered his speeches with coarse phrases and put-downs of hecklers. Even as he fomented chaos by playing to crowds\u2019 fears and resentments, he offered himself as the visionary leader who could restore law and order.\u2022 Hitler increasingly presented himself in messianic terms, promising \u201cto lead Germany to a new era of national greatness,\u201d though he was typically vague about his actual plans. He often harked back to a golden age for the country, Mr. Ullrich says, the better \u201cto paint the present day in hues that were all the darker. Everywhere you looked now, there was only decline and decay.\u201d\u2022 Hitler\u2019s repertoire of topics, Mr. Ullrich notes, was limited, and reading his speeches in retrospect, \u201cit seems amazing that he attracted larger and larger audiences\u201d with \u201crepeated mantralike phrases\u201d consisting largely of \u201caccusations, vows of revenge and promises for the future.\u201d But Hitler virtually wrote the modern playbook on demagoguery, arguing in \u201cMein Kampf\u201d that propaganda must appeal to the emotions \u2014 not the reasoning powers \u2014 of the crowd. Its \u201cpurely intellectual level,\u201d Hitler said, \u201cwill have to be that of the lowest mental common denominator among the public it is desired to reach.\u201d Because the understanding of the masses \u201cis feeble,\u201d he went on, effective propaganda needed to be boiled down to a few slogans that should be \u201cpersistently repeated until the very last individual has come to grasp the idea that has been put forward.\u201d\u2022 Hitler\u2019s rise was not inevitable, in Mr. Ullrich\u2019s opinion. There were numerous points at which his ascent might have been derailed, he contends; even as late as January 1933, \u201cit would have been eminently possible to prevent his nomination as Reich chancellor.\u201d He benefited from a \u201cconstellation of crises that he was able to exploit cleverly and unscrupulously\u201d \u2014 in addition to economic woes and unemployment, there was an \u201cerosion of the political center\u201d and a growing resentment of the elites. The unwillingness of Germany\u2019s political parties to compromise had contributed to a perception of government dysfunction, Mr. Ullrich suggests, and the belief of Hitler supporters that the country needed \u201ca man of iron\u201d who could shake things up. \u201cWhy not give the National Socialists a chance?\u201d a prominent banker said of the Nazis. \u201cThey seem pretty gutsy to me.\u201d\u2022 Hitler\u2019s ascension was aided and abetted by the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of domestic adversaries who failed to appreciate his ruthlessness and tenacity, and by foreign statesmen who believed they could control his aggression. Early on, revulsion at Hitler\u2019s style and appearance, Mr. Ullrich writes, led some critics to underestimate the man and his popularity, while others dismissed him as a celebrity, a repellent but fascinating \u201cevening\u2019s entertainment.\u201d Politicians, for their part, suffered from the delusion that the dominance of traditional conservatives in the cabinet would neutralize the threat of Nazi abuse of power and \u201cfence Hitler in.\u201d \u201cAs far as Hitler\u2019s long-term wishes were concerned,\u201d Mr. Ullrich observes, \u201chis conservative coalition partners believed either that he was not serious or that they could exert a moderating influence on him.

{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Opposition, While Repressed, May Be Its Own Worst Enemy", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 With parliamentary elections in Russia just days away, a hot competition is unfolding in the race for the seat from the central district of Moscow.A candidate from the People\u2019s Freedom Party and one from the Open Russia movement are running neck and neck, a rarity in this country\u2019s usually all-too-predictable elections.The problem in this district, and throughout Russia, from the perspective of the political opposition at least, is that both candidates are staunch opponents not only of one another, but also of President Vladimir V. Putin. And both are badly trailing the leaders.The chances that Russia\u2019s opposition parties would make any gains in Sunday\u2019s voting were always vanishingly small. Much of that has to do with Mr. Putin, who, after a rule of more than 16 years, has wiped the slate of Russian politics clean, with opponents killed, imprisoned, driven into exile or sidelined with fabricated criminal charges. Opposition candidates are also barred from appearing on television.But some of the blame, political observers and the opposition leaders themselves say, has to be borne by the opposition, which is divided and largely ineffective.In the race in central Moscow, Maria Baronova of Open Russia had offered to quit \u2014 clearing the field for a single opposition candidate \u2014 if polls showed her trailing Andrei Zubov of the People\u2019s Freedom Party.A poll commissioned by Open Russia resulted in a tie, with each candidate shown to have a microscopic 2 percent support from the voters. Both soldiered on. By comparison, the pro-Kremlin candidate in the district, Nikolai Gonchar, led with 21 percent.\u201cMy electorate and the electorate of Andrei Borisovich Zubov are distinct,\u201d Ms. Baronova wrote in Novaya Gazeta, an opposition newspaper, about her decision to stay in the race. \u201cAndrei Borisovich is a Christian conservative, while I am a liberal centrist with some socialist leanings.\u201dShe went on to note that \u201ca big problem with our opposition is its ideological and political sectarianism.\u201dTo be sure, repression is a reason Russia\u2019s 450-seat Parliament has only one member who is openly critical of Mr. Putin, and why that number is not expected to expand much, if at all, in Sunday\u2019s elections. And yet, with really nothing to fight over, Russia\u2019s opposition has been plagued by infighting, further harming its prospects.In Russia, parties are defined as \u201csystemic opposition\u201d and \u201cnon-systemic opposition,\u201d according to current political parlance, with the former being opposition in name, but in fact backing Mr. Putin on most matters.Examples of systemic opposition are the Communist Party and the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, both of which have large representations in Parliament, or Duma, and reliably vote for Kremlin-floated measures.Polls have shown the \u201csystemic opposition\u201d parties\u2019 making gains against the governing United Russia party, capturing some of the populist anger stirring here, as it is elsewhere. But that is not likely to change the country\u2019s politics, policies or leadership.The non-systemic opposition is splintered into three main political parties and one unregistered faction. All these groups are subjected to prosecutorial assaults, state media campaigns to tar their images and competition from far better financed pro-government opponents. And yet, beaten down as they are, they still cannot find it in themselves to unite.Across Russia, more than 120 races are cluttered with multiple opposition candidates, said Mr. Zubov, a former history professor who was fired from his state university job for criticizing Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.\u201cThe disagreements in the opposition are incredibly useful for the Kremlin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feed them and support them in every way. The schism means our chances are tiny.\u201dMs. Baronova and Open Russia have also been subjected to official pressure. LifeNews, a pro-Kremlin tabloid, and other state-linked news portals, have repeatedly published nude pictures of the candidate and her chief of staff, Polina Nemirovskaya.Open Russia is financed by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the exiled oil tycoon, and led by Vladimir Kara-Murza, a politician who last year survived a poisoning for which he blamed the Kremlin.\u201cI more than once appealed to Maria,\u201d Mr. Zubov said. \u201cI hear only one response: \u2018Withdraw.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe democrats, of course, will never unite,\u201d he wrote on his website, noting schisms going back to the early post-Soviet period. \u201cPeople who in 2016 call for the democrats to unite should just jump off a cliff, so they stop wasting our time.\u201dBut even lacking a formal merging of parties, Mr. Navalny said, the leaders could agree to pull candidates. \u201cThat democrats cannot unite doesn\u2019t mean they have to be idiotic,\u201d he wrote.In the central district race, Mr. Navalny has suggested that Ms. Baronova withdraw in favor of Mr. Zubov.Ms. Nemirovskaya, the head of the Ms. Baronova\u2019s electoral committee, said in an interview that Ms. Baronova had better name recognition than Mr. Zubov, even though both had hopelessly minuscule levels of support.The People\u2019s Freedom Party, Ms. Nemirovskaya said, backed out of a deal reached last winter to leave the central district to Open Russia, so Ms. Baronova was under no obligation to withdraw now.Denied television exposure, opposition candidates have turned instead to what are called cubes \u2014 small tents festooned with the candidates\u2019 images and slogans, erected in crowded places like the entryways to subway stations. To counter this approach, pro-Kremlin candidates have been pitching cubes of their own.In Moscow this week, the cube campaign is in full swing despite a gusty cold front\u2019s moving through the capital and blowing many of the tents over.And it was in this cube contest that Dmitry G. Gudkov, the only \u201cnon-systemic\u201d opposition member left in Parliament, has been fighting to hold his seat. (The other, Ilya V. Ponomarev, was stripped of his seat earlier this year and lives in exile in Ukraine.)Because of the fragility of his seat, the People\u2019s Freedom Party and Open Russia have cleared the field for Mr. Gudkov, who is with the Yabloko party. It may not help.Pro-Kremlin hecklers have been plaguing Mr. Gudkov\u2019s speeches. And worse, a variety of unsavory characters like unwashed drunks have been showing up to loudly yell out their endorsements of his candidacy.\u201cDima, you are boring, everybody is tired of you!\u201d one of the hecklers yelled during a speech on Tuesday. When asked to quiet down, the man started to chant, \u201cFreedom of speech! Freedom of speech!\u201dMr. Gudkov continued his own speech, undaunted. \u201cOne vote is not enough,\u201d Mr. Gudkov told the small crowd. \u201cWe need 226 votes to pass a law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret History of Colombia\u2019s Paramilitaries and the U.S. War on Drugs", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "Justice InterruptedAfter decades of atrocities, the warlords were finally being held to account. Then the Americans stepped in.Supported byCALABAZO, Colombia \u2014 Skinny but imposing with aviator glasses, a bushy mustache and a toothy smile, Julio Henr\u00edquez Santamar\u00eda was leading a community meeting in this sylvan hamlet when he was abducted by paramilitary thugs, thrown into the back of a Toyota pickup and disappeared forever on Feb. 4, 2001.Ahead of his time, Mr. Henr\u00edquez had been organizing farmers to substitute legal crops like cacao for coca, which the current Colombian government, on the verge of ending a civil war fueled by the narcotics trade, is promoting as an antidrug strategy.But Hern\u00e1n Giraldo Serna, or his men, didn\u2019t like it, or him.It happened in a dead-of-night extradition that stunned Colombia, where the men stood accused of atrocities in a transitional justice process that was abruptly interrupted. In the whoosh of a jet, and at the behest of the Colombian president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe, the United States-led war on drugs seized priority over Colombia\u2019s efforts to confront crimes against humanity that had scarred a generation.Victims\u2019 advocates howled that it was like exporting \u201c14 Pinochets.\u201d Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s family, meanwhile, quietly vowed to hold at least one of them accountable for the Colombian blood that stained the cocaine shipped to American shores.\u201cWe hope that the effort we have made over all these years means that things won\u2019t end with impunity,\u201d said his daughter Bela Henr\u00edquez Chac\u00edn, 32, who was 16 when her father was murdered and hopes to speak at Mr. Giraldo\u2019s sentencing in Washington next month. The Henr\u00edquezes will be the first foreign victims ever given a voice in an international drug smuggling case in the United States, experts believe.Whether this recognition is more than symbolic remains to be seen. Mr. Giraldo\u2019s fellow extraditees have received relatively lenient treatment for major drug traffickers who were also designated terrorists responsible for massacres, forced disappearances and the displacement of entire villages, an investigation by The New York Times found.Once the paramilitary Colombians \u2014 several dozen, all told \u2014 have completed their American prison terms, they will have served on average seven and a half years, The Times found. The leaders extradited en masse will have served an average of 10 years, at most, for drug conspiracies that involved tons of cocaine.By comparison, federal inmates convicted of crack cocaine trafficking \u2014 mostly street-level dealers who sold less than an ounce \u2014 serve on average just over 12 years in prison.What\u2019s more, for some, there is a special dividend at the end of their incarceration. Though wanted by the Colombian authorities, two have won permission to stay in the United States, and their families have joined them. Three more are seeking the same haven, and still others are expected to follow suit.\u201cIn the days of Pablo Escobar, they used to say they preferred a tomb in Colombia to a prison in the United States,\u201d said Alirio Uribe Mu\u00f1oz, a member of the Colombian Congress. \u201cBut maybe now extradition is a good deal.\u201dFor 52 years, with abundant American support, the Colombian government has been locked in a ferocious armed conflict with leftist insurgents. Though it initially empowered paramilitary forces as military proxies, the government withdrew official sanction decades later, long after landowners and cartels had co-opted them. Before their demobilization in the mid-2000s, the militiamen came to rival the guerrillas as drug traffickers and outdo them as human rights abusers.Now, eight years after the paramilitaries were extradited, Colombia has reached a peace deal with their mortal enemies, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (the FARC). Facing an Oct. 2 vote on the accord, the country is in the midst of a polarizing debate about crime and punishment for the FARC, informed by what went wrong during the paramilitary peace process. Nobody is advocating that justice be abdicated to the United States this time.But the paramilitary chapter of the country\u2019s history is not closed, and remains \u201ctotally full of blanks,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Teresa Ronderos, the author of \u201cRecycled Wars,\u201d a Spanish-language history of Colombian paramilitarism. \u201cNobody knows what happened to those guys.\u201dFor years, the Justice Department shrouded the militiamen\u2019s cases in secrecy, not only sealing sensitive documents but also hiding basic information and sometimes even erasing defendants like Mr. Giraldo from the public docket.Using interviews, recently unsealed legal briefs, transcripts of hearings, internal government documents, and information obtained from Colombia and the United States, The Times examined the cases of 40 extradited paramilitary members and associates.Most were handsomely rewarded for pleading guilty and cooperating with the American authorities; they were treated as first-time offenders despite extensive criminal histories in Colombia; and they received credit for time served there, even though the official rationale for their extradition was that they were committing crimes in Colombian jails.Take Salvatore Mancuso, who the government said \u201cmay well be one of the most prolific cocaine traffickers ever prosecuted in a United States District Court\u201d and whom Colombian courts found responsible for the death or disappearance of more than 1,000 people.Under the terms of his plea agreement, he faced 30 years to life in prison. Because of his extensive cooperation, however, prosecutors \u2014 one of whom characterized Mr. Mancuso in an interview as \u201calways a gentleman to me\u201d \u2014 asked for just under 22 years. A federal judge sentenced him to 15 years and 10 months. In the end, he will spend little more than 12 years behind bars in the United States.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Roxanna Altholz, the associate director of the International Human Rights Law Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley, who represents the Henr\u00edquezes. \u201cThese individuals are the worst of the worst. They are drug lords and war criminals. Why should they be getting any benefits?\u201dEarly on, federal prosecutors addressed Ms. Altholz\u2019s qualms by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to put them away; it doesn\u2019t matter what for.\u201d But as she and other human rights advocates saw it, it did matter: Crimes against humanity outrank drug crimes, and the United States could have indicted the men for crimes of torture, too \u2014 or simply given the Colombian transitional justice system a chance.The American authorities think the extraditions served a critical purpose at a historic juncture, \u201cdemonstrating to the Colombian people that there are no such things as untouchables,\u201d as one put it. Eventually, said a Department of Justice spokesman, Peter Carr, the Americans provided the Colombians with \u201cunique and unprecedented\u201d access to imprisoned foreign defendants so that the transitional justice process, called Justice and Peace, could continue.Mr. Giraldo will be the last of the extradited paramilitaries sentenced.Though the United States Marshals Service said it was improbable that The Times would be able to meet with him \u2014 demanding that permission be obtained from the prisoner, his lawyer, his warden, an assistant United States attorney general and a federal judge \u2014 a reporter and a photographer did succeed in visiting Mr. Giraldo at a Virginia jail last month.In a baggy blue coverall, El Patr\u00f3n, 68 now, appeared a markedly deflated version of his formerly fearsome self. His hair has grayed, his weight has dropped, his step has slowed. He passes his days weaving purses from potato-chip bags and selling them to other inmates for \u201csiete pollos,\u201d seven portions of chicken from the commissary.\u201cLook,\u201d he said proudly, tugging at the shoulder strap of a silver-foil bag. \u201cThey are double-stitched.\u201dShortly before midnight on May 12, 2008, Mr. Giraldo was jostled awake in a jail in Barranquilla, instructed to pack a small suitcase and then hustled onto a flight to Bogot\u00e1, the capital. No explanation was offered.Once in Bogot\u00e1, he was handcuffed to waist chains, shackled at the ankles and loaded onto an American government plane with a veritable who\u2019s who of paramilitary heavyweights. They flew in stony silence, furious that Colombia\u2019s iron-fisted president, with whom they had a \u201cshared ideology,\u201d as Mr. Giraldo put it, had broken his promise not to extradite them.After years of declining to turn over the men, President Uribe had suddenly made an urgent appeal to the Americans: Those wanted paramilitary leaders? Take them. Immediately.He wanted them picked up after the Colombian Supreme Court closed for the day and flown out before the court resumed the next morning, said a United States official who agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Uribe said he feared that the court might block the extraditions if they did not act hurriedly.The Americans snapped into action, though it was a logistical challenge. They needed to \u201cmove the men from four corners of Colombia to one location, then the aircraft needed to go wheels up with all prisoners onboard prior to the court opening for business the next day,\u201d the official said.At one point, the official said, the Drug Enforcement Administration had six aircraft \u201cin play\u201d to ferry the men through Bogot\u00e1 and Guant\u00e1namo, Cuba, to courthouses in Florida, New York, Texas and Washington, D.C.Why did the American government go to such lengths to accommodate a Colombian president who, as it turned out, may have had political motivations of his own?\u201cThe driving policy during the Bush administration was cooperation on anti-narcotics efforts,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, the director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Americas division. \u201cNot human rights, not atrocities, not to make victims of crimes against humanity committed by these bastards have a day in court in Colombia.\u201cSo what do you do if overnight you get as a gift from the president of Colombia 14 guys wanted for narcotics? You just welcome them.\u201dThis is a crime story tangled up in geopolitics. Colombia is the United States\u2019 closest ally and largest aid recipient in the region, and the partnership has focused on combating narcotics, guerrillas and terrorism.Both the guerrillas and the paramilitary groups funded their activities with drug money, collecting \u201cwar taxes\u201d and providing security for traffickers in their areas. But the drug enforcement authorities focused primarily on the narco-guerillas at first; the paramilitaries, while opponents in the war on drugs, were technically on the same side as the Colombian and American governments in the civil war.Drug indictments of key paramilitary leaders followed, and Mr. Uribe, elected in 2002 with a vow to crack down on leftist rebels, used the threat of extradition to motivate the paramilitary leaders to lay down their arms.Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Uribe, whose law-and-order toughness made him a popular two-term president, wholly embraced extradition as a drug crime-fighting tool. \u201cThe biggest commodities traded between Colombia and the U.S. were coffee, cocaine and co-defendants,\u201d said Robert Feitel, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s lawyer.But for years, Mr. Uribe carved out an exception for the paramilitary men, saying he wanted to give Justice and Peace a chance.Mr. Uribe fought back, accusing the justices of leftist bias and conspiracies against him. His intelligence agency illegally wiretapped the Supreme Court and individual judges; he denied involvement.\u201cThe whole country was shocked,\u201d said Miguel Samper Strouss, a former vice minister of justice in charge of transitional justice policy. \u201cIt was like they had extradited our chances for knowing the truth and for getting justice and reparation for our victims.\u201dBy 2008, the Justice and Peace process, while slow and flawed, had become a real process. Some 200,000 victims had registered to participate; thousands of crimes had been confessed and thousands of hidden graves revealed.Publicly, Mr. Uribe \u2014 whose representatives did not respond to The Times \u2014 justified his interruption of this process by claiming that the men had been continuing to run their illegal operations from jail.The commanders themselves, however, firmly believed that Mr. Uribe shipped them out to silence them. And many of their victims\u2019 leading advocates agreed.\u201cThey were, collectively, going to deliver testimony that directly implicated Uribe,\u201d said Senator Iv\u00e1n Cepeda, who founded the influential Movement for Victims of State Crimes. \u201cAfterward, the authorities entered the cells where they had their computers, their USBs, and they took it all. All the work they had been doing, all the proof they were going to present to Justice, disappeared.\u201cThose extraditions marked a before and an after,\u201d Mr. Cepeda continued. \u201cIf the intention really was to achieve silence and impunity, it was obtained to a high degree. Only now, after so many years, are we starting to see results.\u201dAt the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Va., the other Colombians used to rise when Mr. Giraldo entered an English language classroom. They would sharpen his pencils and fetch his papers, said Ted Hull, the superintendent.Were it not for that, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s jailers would have had no hint that he was ever a force to be reckoned with. That the senior prisoner who limps from sciatica and speaks with his hands because he never conquered English once ran a paramilitary bloc found responsible for 1,800 serious human rights violations with over 4,000 victims \u2014 mind-boggling, they said. Mr. Giraldo is now the type of docile inmate who reflexively crosses his wrists behind his back even when they are not cuffed.Yet here in the territory that Mr. Giraldo controlled, from the bustling market in the port city of Santa Marta up through the Sierra Nevada foothills and back down to the Caribbean coast, he remains the larger-than-life godfather in the brimmed hat and jaunty scarf whose commanding presence is still palpable.\u201cThis man, from the time he demobilized, left behind armed groups guarding his territory,\u201d said Priscila Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, the security adviser to Santa Marta\u2019s mayor. \u201cWe have not stopped, from 2006 to 2016, having an illegal armed presence in the area.\u201dNow it\u2019s called the Giraldo Clan.Ms. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga spoke in the modular office that she has stationed beside the pastel-colored marketplace, along with a new police post inside, to signal that the government is wresting control from Mr. Giraldo\u2019s men, who still try to extort an \u201cinoculation\u201d fee for \u201cprotection\u201d in his name.The heavy police presence jumps out at visitors, but in general the region hides its blood-drenched history, and lurking menace, well. It is nearly impossible to imagine hacked-up bodies buried in secret graves beneath this picture-postcard landscape, where snow-capped peaks rise above palm-fringed beaches dotted with weathered fishing boats as boughs of arborescent ferns dip into rivers with women scrubbing laundry.From the start, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s personal history, pieced together from interviews, court records, government documents and his public confessions, intersected with Colombia\u2019s intense civil conflict. He was born in 1948, the year that kicked off the decade of politically motivated bloodletting known as La Violencia.He did not seem destined for leadership. He had a second-grade education when he left home to become an itinerant farmhand. His lawyer, who likes to turn a phrase, says that even now, Mr. Giraldo remains \u201ca quintessential campesino at heart\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe kind of guy who wants to get up at the crack of dawn, and draw lines in the hardened earth under a blazing sun.\u201dBy the 1970s, Mr. Giraldo was rising early to get in on \u201cla bonanza marimbera\u201d \u2014 the marijuana boom that preceded the cocaine boom. He organized a mule transport service to gather the marijuana from isolated farms and deliver it to the coast.He was first drawn into violence after his younger brother was killed during a robbery at the Santa Marta market. To avenge the death, Mr. Giraldo contracted a private security group led by a thug called Dracula; six men were murdered at the start of a long \u201csocial cleansing\u201d campaign to eliminate \u201cundesirables\u201d \u2014 thieves, prostitutes, homosexuals, unfaithful women, witches and leftists.After Dracula himself was killed, Mr. Giraldo took over his business, inheriting its subsidiary interest in the nascent cocaine industry controlled by the Medell\u00edn cartel. He transformed the so-called security group into a ragtag militia when the FARC sought a foothold in his territory and tried three times to assassinate him.His troops trained under an Israeli mercenary, and to practice what they had learned, they slaughtered union workers at banana farms that were supposedly guerrilla strongholds.Mr. Giraldo was arrested as a mastermind of the massacres. That was when he came onto the Americans\u2019 radar, identified in a diplomatic cable as a \u201ctop-rank assassin of the Medell\u00edn cartel\u201d whose detention \u201cdemonstrates that Colombian officials are not turning a blind eye to murders committed by the rightists.\u201dEventually he was convicted and sentenced to 20 years. But by that point, eluding justice, he had exiled himself in the remote Sierra Nevada. From there he ruled his dominion for almost two more decades, protected by a personal security detail of 200 men but also by the elite families that backed him and the rural people dependent on him, the local authorities say.\u201cHe didn\u2019t use a camp per se, like the guerrillas,\u201d Ms. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said. \u201cHis camp was the community because he was part of the community. So the houses were his houses, the farms were his farms.\u201cDespite being, for us, a criminal, he was always seen with much respect \u2014 and not just respect out of fear, but respect for the order he gave to the area, because there was a great absence of the state there.\u201dWhen Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s older daughter, Nadiezhda, first met Mr. Giraldo, she encountered an almost benign side of him as a local authority. A young teacher then, she appreciated it when Mr. Giraldo resolved a dispute between her tiny school and the local fishermen storing their gear in the classrooms.She also got a glimpse at his more sinister side, however. She lost her three female students when their mother sent them away to protect them from El Patr\u00f3n. \u201cHe was starting to rape girls,\u201d she said.Like a feudal overlord, Mr. Giraldo exercised \u201ca kind of droit du seigneur\u201d over girls in the region, said a Colombian law enforcement official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media.\u201cPeople brought him their daughters or facilitated his sexual relations with them because it was a way to safeguard their lives \u2014 if you have ties to the chief, you feel protected,\u201d he said.After Mr. Giraldo laid down his arms, a prosecutor asked him at a public hearing why he was called the Drill. He blushed, but seemed proud of the nickname, observers said. The prosecutor then asked pointedly if it had anything to do with rumors that he liked virgin girls.\u201cThat could be,\u201d he said.In the Justice and Peace process, he accepted responsibility for 35 acts of gender-based violence \u2014 some committed by his subordinates \u2014 including the rape of 11 girls under age 14.The prosecutors\u2019 summary of the cases reads like a litany of uninformed consent wrapped inside a pathological dynamic.Victim No. 6: \u201cIt is documented that in the month of October of 2004,\u201d the girl, referred to as Yajanis, visited an aunt who worked at Mr. Giraldo\u2019s ranch. A few months later, \u201che proposed that she be his girlfriend, a proposition that she accepted, and on Dec. 25, 2004, they had their first sexual relations, when Yajanis was barely 13.\u201d He was 56.Based on an analysis of birth certificates, Humanas Colombia, a feminist organization, estimated that at least 13 underage girls bore children who were the \u201cproduct of violent carnal intercourse committed\u201d by Mr. Giraldo. Nine were under 14 when they gave birth.From the moment police inspectors arrived here to investigate the disappearance of Julio Henr\u00edquez, they were stonewalled.\u201cThe law of silence prevailed,\u201d a police report said.Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s wife and older daughter had faced the same fears when they rushed to this village after getting the phone call that he had been abducted. \u201cLeave it alone,\u201d they were told, which infuriated Nadiezhda Henr\u00edquez Chac\u00edn, 42, now a human rights lawyer and a fierce one.\u201cThey will kill me one day, but it won\u2019t be because I was afraid,\u201d she said in an interview in Bogot\u00e1.An ardent environmentalist, her father himself had been fearless, determined to work alongside farmers and fishermen to reclaim the rugged region from the drug trade, she said. On his large property, he was creating a nature preserve, planting indigenous trees and uprooting marijuana and coca planted without his consent.He was not antidrug in a moralistic way, but alarmed by the deforestation caused by coca cultivation, his daughter said.Mr. Giraldo maintained at a hearing in Colombia that he had no direct involvement in Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s disappearance, but that he had instructed his men, \u201cEverything that smells of subversion has to be removed from the area.\u201dAnd Mr. Henr\u00edquez had belonged to the M-19 guerrilla movement, though he had been granted amnesty 17 years before his abduction. But his new activism \u2014 he had just formed a nongovernmental organization called Mother Earth \u2014 was a real-time threat, an ex-paramilitary soldier, Carmelo Sierra, told prosecutors.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious Mr. Hern\u00e1n did not agree with what this man was proposing to the peasants, because he grows coca \u2014 and because encroaching on his turf was sufficient motive to kill somebody,\u201d Mr. Sierra testified. \u201cThe Mafia does not forgive.\u201dMr. Sierra said Mr. Giraldo had sent a son, El Grillo (the Cricket), to deliver a warning: Leave town or deal with the consequences. But Mr. Henr\u00edquez did not budge. So seven of Mr. Giraldo\u2019s men were plucked from a morning lineup, instructed to change into civilian clothing, loaded onto a flatbed and sent down the mountain \u201cto disappear the gentleman from the NGO.\u201d\u201cI sincerely do not know what happened to him,\u201d Mr. Sierra testified. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they slit his throat, or chopped him into pieces. I don\u2019t know how he died nor where they buried him.\u201dIn 2004, Mr. Giraldo and Mr. Tovar-Pupo were indicted in Washington in a conspiracy to manufacture and distribute cocaine bound for the United States. In a superseding indictment the next year, prosecutors said the two men controlled or were involved in the shipment of thousands of kilograms of cocaine that left northern Colombia on \u201cgo-fast boats,\u201d rigged with extra motors and fuel.In 2006, Mr. Giraldo and over a thousand of his fighters laid down their arms \u2014 597 of them along with 73,400 rounds of ammunition \u2014 in the paramilitary peace process.The next year, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s lawyer provided coordinates that ultimately led the authorities to Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s decomposed body in a clandestine grave. Nadiezhda Henr\u00edquez attended the exhumation with her mother. It was a chilling coda to years of hoping against hope.\u201cI never thought we would find him as we found him: in a mountain tomb, so very green, beneath a tree, near streams that turn into rivers, with moss and stone of the Sierra Nevada,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Henr\u00edquez said in a statement filed with the court on Thursday. \u201cWith his two hands tied behind his back and two coups de gr\u00e2ce shots to the head, in clothing that was not his, missing a shoe, missing a foot, missing part of his mouth. Only bones.\u201dMr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s family distrusted the Justice and Peace process, and pushed for Mr. Giraldo to be tried in an ordinary criminal court for the forced disappearance. In 2009, after his extradition, he was convicted in absentia, and sentenced to 38\u00bd years in prison and reparations of 1,000 grams of gold, about $43,000.By that point, though, he was beyond the reach of Colombian justice. So the Henr\u00edquezes took their fight to America.A few months after Mr. Giraldo arrived in the United States, he was transferred to Northern Neck, whose inmate population was a combustible mix of Mexican drug traffickers, Central American gang leaders, \u201cjihadi terrorists,\u201d and Colombian combatants from both sides who got along fine, Mr. Hull, the superintendent, said.\u201cTo be honest with you \u2014 I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m pandering or excusing terrorism \u2014 but both the FARC and the AUC, they were model inmates,\u201d he said. \u201cI got the vibe: \u2018I\u2019m busted, and I\u2019m out.\u2019 Every one of them was cooperating\u201d with prosecutors.None of the paramilitary defendants went to trial.Almost all had private lawyers. Mr. Giraldo said that his family was poor, and that \u201ca friend\u201d was underwriting his American legal costs. Fees could be substantial: A document in Mr. Tovar-Pupo\u2019s case reveals that he paid his lawyer $390,000.\u201cThe only people who ever win in the great extradition game are the lawyers,\u201d said Mr. Feitel, Mr. Giraldo\u2019s lawyer.In the men\u2019s defense, their American lawyers highlighted the political backdrop of their crimes, presenting them as freedom fighters whose movement became corrupted by drugs. One defense lawyer, referring to American support for the Colombian military, went so far as to tell a judge that a notorious paramilitary leader named Carlos Jim\u00e9nez Naranjo \u201cwas initially, and we can put it right on the record, financed by our own government.\u201dThe authorities, in some instances, did seem to view the men as \u201csubstantively different\u201d from purely profit-driven drug lords, as Judge Reggie B. Walton of the United States District Court in Washington put it when he sentenced Mr. Tovar-Pupo to 16\u00bd years.\u201cHe was engaged in trying to fight an enemy that I think, probably, had that enemy won, it would not have enhanced the quality of life for people in Colombia,\u201d the judge said. \u201cSo, I mean, he was engaged in some activity that had some positive perspectives.\u201dRobert Spelke, a retired federal narcotics prosecutor and the one who called Mr. Mancuso a gentleman, said, \u201cSome of these guys were real thugs, but not that many.\u201dHe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes to believe they did what they did. Clearly, they did some nasty things. But, you know, it was a civil war down there. I always wanted to believe that if I was put in the same situation, I would have done things differently. But I don\u2019t know.\u201dMs. Altholz, who represents the Henr\u00edquezes, said she saw an irony: \u201cBecause these individuals took some kind of role in fighting \u2018the evils of Communism\u2019 embodied in the FARC,\u201d their identity as warlords had become a mitigating rather than aggravating factor in their cases.A Colombian law enforcement official said he had hoped for far stiffer penalties as a trade-off for losing the men to the American justice system.\u201cWe all made many sacrifices to pursue them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey threatened me. They displaced some of my colleagues. They killed several of my friends. We believed that they were going to get punishment more in line with the damage they did \u2014 at the least sentences greater than 20 years.\u201dIn those cases examined by The Times, the sentences that could be determined \u2014 some remain sealed \u2014 ranged from probation to just over 30 years. Because \u201ctime served\u201d was easier to ascertain, and because many sentences were reduced to \u201ctime served,\u201d The Times used that as a metric.In exchange for their cooperation, most of the men got sentence reductions \u2014 sometimes before, sometimes after and sometimes both before and after sentencing.There was one notable exception, as far as The Times could determine.Federal prosecutors in New York declined to allow Diego Murillo Bejarano \u2014 alias Don Berna \u2014 to exchange information for benefits. He got 31 years. The one other paramilitary leader who received a sentence over 30 years expects it to be cut by 35 percent to 50 percent because of his cooperation, his lawyers said.In one instance, a senior federal judge in Ocala, Fla., balked at the idea of a second sentence reduction for a paramilitary chief. There reaches a point, said Judge William Terrell Hodges, when any further reduction \u201ctends to denigrate the seriousness of the subject defendant\u2019s criminal behavior and threatens to invite public disrespect for the administration of criminal justice.\u201dWhen Hebert Veloza Garcia, known as H.H., was sentenced this spring in Manhattan federal court, a prosecutor pronounced him an \u201cextraordinary defendant\u201d \u2014 \u201cin terms of his very serious criminal conduct, but also in terms of his extraordinary cooperation.\u201dIn his case, as in most, it is not possible to ascertain precisely how his cooperation helped the American government because specific information is redacted. But Mr. Veloza, according to Ruben Oliva, his lawyer, gave \u201ca full-throated confession\u201d that laid the groundwork for his own indictment, and \u201chis assistance served to deal severe blows to major drug trafficking organizations as well as the violent and corrupt organizations that exist to both serve and prey upon them.\u201dThe American government found Mr. Veloza responsible for trafficking more than 450 kilograms of cocaine. Sentenced to 11\u00bd years, he will be released this fall after seven and a half years behind bars in the United States. Then, despite \u201call of the horrendous things you\u2019ve done in the course of your life,\u201d Judge William H. Pauley III told him, he will \u201cget the chance to hit the restart button.\u201dHe hopes to stay in the United States, Mr. Oliva said \u2014 though he has a Justice and Peace sentence awaiting him in Colombia for 85 crimes including torture and homicide.So far, two paramilitary associates have won haven in the United States on their release from prison: Juan Carlos Sierra, known as El Tuso, who spent five years in American prisons, and Carlos Mario Aguilar, alias Rogelio, who spent about seven.Both men have pending arrest warrants in Colombia, Mr. Sierra\u2019s in connection with a murder, according to the Colombian attorney general\u2019s office.Their families have received political asylum, as has the family of a third paramilitary associate, Mauricio L\u00f3pez Cardona, known as Yiyo, who has also applied to stay. So, too, has Guillermo P\u00e9rez Alzate, a paramilitary leader extradited with Mr. Giraldo and released in June, having served less than half his original sentence.As convicted drug traffickers, these men do not qualify for asylum. Instead, they request a rare form of protection against expulsion under the Convention Against Torture, arguing that they would probably be tortured by their government, now led by President Juan Manuel Santos, a centrist.\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting President Santos would be personally lying in wait,\u201d Mr. Oliva said. \u201cBut these guys wouldn\u2019t make it out of the airport. Literally, they\u2019d whack them in the airport.\u201dMr. Samper, the former justice official, whose father was president of Colombia in the 1990s, called this argument \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\u201cWe have the world\u2019s finest individual protection program, as recognized by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission,\u201d he said.Then he was extradited, and after almost a year went by, he felt compelled to take action \u201cto prevent the stagnation and virtual death\u201d of Justice and Peace. Or so he said in a florid letter to an unlikely pen pal \u2014 Piedad C\u00f3rdoba, then a Liberal Party senator and a victim of a paramilitary kidnapping.\u201cRespected Senator,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe situation that arose from our extradition has generated a state of helplessness, both for the victims and for us.\u201dIn a kind of private truth and reconciliation effort, Ms. C\u00f3rdoba, along with victims\u2019 advocates including Mr. Cepeda, traveled to the United States for jailhouse meetings with Mr. Mancuso \u2014 prison officials declined to let him be interviewed by The Times \u2014 and other warlords.Mr. Cepeda said he asked one of them point blank if he knew who had killed his father, a leftist senator murdered in 1994. The paramilitary leader, Don Berna, not only threw out some names but agreed to reveal them to Colombian prosecutors, he said. It took six months to arrange a meeting.\u201cFinally, the stars aligned and we went with a Colombian prosecutor, and somebody from the Department of Justice, and succeeded in obtaining his testimony,\u201d Mr. Cepeda said. \u201cBut that was me. A campesino from C\u00f3rdoba or Antioquia, where there are thousands of victims, would never have been able to go through this exercise.\u201dColombia\u2019s attorney general and justices joined advocates in complaining to the Obama administration, which had inherited the cases, that their pursuit of justice was being thwarted. As a result, in 2010, the Justice Department created an \u201caccess plan,\u201d promising to make about a dozen key paramilitaries available for in-person or video interviews \u2014 if the men were willing.Mr. Carr, spokesman for the Justice Department, said that more than 2,000 video depositions and interviews with paramilitary leaders had taken place, and that some had been televised to centers in Colombia from which victims could ask questions.Still, even in the cases of those leaders like Mr. Mancuso who participated most actively, these sessions were insufficient, according to a Colombian prosecutor who testified last year in his case.\u201cIn total, we progressed maybe 8 percent of what we have to progress,\u201d said the prosecutor, Giovanni \u00c1lvarez Santoyo. He noted that Mr. Mancuso had been charged in 4,800 \u201cmatters,\u201d from \u201cmurder to forced disappearances, through forced removals, recruiting of minors, sexual violence, sexual slavery, and related crimes such as kidnapping, terrorism, theft and destruction of protected property.\u201dIt is impossible to know how things would have been different if the leaders had not been extradited \u2014 whether more truth would have been divulged, whether greater or quicker justice would have been done, and whether the paramilitary groups would have been more successfully, or less successfully, dismantled.Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, who led the Supreme Court\u2019s paramilitary corruption investigation, said at a forum in Bogot\u00e1 a few years ago that the truth-telling by paramilitary leaders was not impressive before or after the extraditions.\u201cMany of them reduced a good part of their \u2018collaboration,\u2019 as we call their obligation to tell the truth, to relating in a decontextualized manner the murders committed \u2014 justifying them by portraying their victims as guerrillas dressed in civilian clothing \u2014 and revealing the locations of graves,\u201d he said.Guaranteeing \u201cnonrepetition\u201d of their atrocities would have required far more \u2014 \u201crevelations about the sponsors, financiers, promoters, beneficiaries or owners of those criminal structures, which in many cases remain intact,\u201d he said.Over the past decade, 128 ex-paramilitary members have been sentenced in the Justice and Peace process, out of more than 1,000 detained, according to the Colombian government. But even as the country prepares to set up another transitional justice system for the FARC, Justice and Peace keeps inching forward.As do the para-political inquiries: In February, Mr. Uribe\u2019s younger brother, Santiago, was arrested for supposed ties to a death squad, the Twelve Apostles.The former president himself was investigated last year for alleged paramilitary ties, but not charged. Now a senator, he considers investigations of him and his family to be politically motivated. Mr. Uribe is the most virulent critic of his successor\u2019s peace deal with the guerrillas; he accuses Mr. Santos of what he himself was accused of in relation to the militias: offering impunity to war criminals.President Santos has said he hopes that one dividend of the peace accord will be a reduction in the drug trafficking that financed the internal armed conflict. Coca cultivation has been soaring in Colombia, with a significant increase over the last couple of years in acreage dedicated to drug crops.Extradition as a panacea has fallen out of favor. Colombia extraditions to the United States were half as frequent in 2015 \u2014 109 \u2014 as the year the paramilitary leaders were sent away. And the new accord, if approved by voters, would guarantee the guerrilla leaders protection against extradition for their drug smuggling \u2014 with the blessing of the Americans.\u201cIf you want to see that as the U.S.\u2019s contribution to the peace process, you\u2019re welcome to do so,\u201d Kevin Whitaker, the American ambassador to Colombia, told Radio Caracol.This year, two young women cautiously approached the authorities in Santa Marta. They had decided to reveal that they had been victims of Mr. Giraldo\u2019s sexual violence even after he surrendered and pledged to stop committing crimes.When they were under 14, they said, they were taken to Mr. Giraldo for conjugal visits, both in a special detention zone for paramilitary members and later in a jail.So potentially damaging are their allegations that the young women are now in protective custody. \u201cThis year, it fell to me, initially, to protect the two girls who made the denunciations, and we got them out of the area because Giraldo\u2019s sons were going to kill them,\u201d said Ms. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, the Santa Marta security chief.Mr. Giraldo called the allegations \u201clies.\u201d\u201cLots of victims are popping up in Colombia because they give them money,\u201d he said, referring to reparations, which relatively few victims have obtained.If proved, the allegations would be grounds to deny Mr. Giraldo the eight-year alternative sentence he would get under Justice and Peace. He would face spending the rest of his life in a Colombian prison \u2014 if the United States sent him back.This is an eventuality that the Henr\u00edquezes do not think they can bank on.It took almost eight years for the United States to recognize them as victims of standing in Mr. Giraldo\u2019s American case. Their lawyers took a novel approach in arguing that the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act of 2004 applied to them. They argued that even though Mr. Henr\u00edquez was a foreign victim of a foreign crime, his murder was a consequence of the drug conspiracy to which Mr. Giraldo pleaded guilty.The Justice Department did not agree, and for years did not confer with the Henriquezes about major case decisions or keep them apprised of proceedings.Although Judge Walton initially denied the Henr\u00edquezes status as victims, he changed his mind after the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia urged him to reconsider. \u201cI think the movants have established their burden of showing that but for the defendant\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy the decedent would not have been killed,\u201d he said at a hearing in March.Mr. Feitel, who considers the Henr\u00edquezes \u201cpesky, phony victims barking at my client\u2019s heels,\u201d was disappointed.From a broader perspective, Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge and an expert on victims\u2019 rights, said international drug smuggling cases were generally treated like victimless crimes. \u201cThis is truly precedent-setting,\u201d he said.It could have implications for violent drug lords like Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 El Chapo \u2014 whose extradition has been approved by Mexico.After the March hearing, Ms. Altholz called Mr. Henr\u00edquez\u2019s daughters from outside the federal courthouse. \u201cGanamos!\u201d she said. \u201cWe won!\u201dThe Henr\u00edquez sisters do not like to talk to each other about developments in the case because it dredges up their grief. \u201cWe\u2019re like those little rubber dolls where you push a button and they fall apart,\u201d Bela Henr\u00edquez said. \u201cBut I was happy.\u201dNadiezhda Henr\u00edquez was more guarded.\u201cThese rights are merely procedural,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has meaning, but it\u2019s pretty limited in terms of what is internationally recognized as victims\u2019 rights: truth, justice and reparation.\u201dIn its prosecutions of the Colombian warlords, she said, the American government engaged in \u201cnegotiations over justice, and that is not justice.\u201d It focused on the harm done to the United States, and not on \u201cwhat they did to us.\u201dThe Henr\u00edquezes are asking for the maximum penalty for Mr. Giraldo \u2014 just short of life in prison. At the least, Ms. Henr\u00edquez said, \u201cwe want sufficient time so that this can be dismantled, so that in my land there can be peace.\u201dWhether the paramilitary forces were ever truly dismantled, and what role the extraditions played, have been matters of debate in Colombia. But the illegal armed groups \u2014 called bacrims, short for criminal bands in Spanish \u2014 that surged after the militias disbanded are formally considered their successors in the peace accord.In the Santa Marta region, the most recent flare-up of neo-paramilitary violence occurred in late 2013. Hundreds of civilians were forced to flee their mountain villages during a bloody confrontation between the Giraldo Clan and a rival group that lasted four months and left hundreds dead. Since then, his relatives have mainly fought one another.\u201cIf Giraldo were here in jail rather than in Virginia, we wouldn\u2019t see the territorial disputes,\u201d Ms. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga said. Still, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think Santa Marta is ready for him to return.\u201dBela Henr\u00edquez, though her American visa is pending, said she looked forward to confronting in a Washington courtroom the man convicted in absentia for her father\u2019s disappearance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what Hern\u00e1n Giraldo will be thinking, but at least he will have to see that the crimes he committed in Colombia have not been forgotten,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will have to recognize that his \u2018business\u2019 cost lives, and not just the lives of one leader or one community. It will affect the families who had to bear the brunt of the violence, yes. But it will also influence the history of our whole country for generations to come.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the extradition of Colombian paramilitary men to the United States referred incorrectly to the \u201cdividend\u201d earned by some on their release from American prisons. They won relief against removal to Colombia, which has translated into residency; they did not receive green cards.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Records Shed Light on Donald Trump\u2019s $25,000 Gift to Florida Official", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 It was Aug. 29, 2013, an unremarkable day inside Florida\u2019s whitewashed Capitol, and a typically sweltering one outside among the moss-bearded oaks and sabal palms. Around 3:45 p.m., Jennifer Meale, the communications director for Attorney General Pam Bondi, fielded a seemingly routine call from a financial reporter for The Orlando Sentinel. The attorney general of New York had recently filed a lawsuit against Donald J. Trump alleging fraud in the marketing of Trump University\u2019s real estate and wealth-building seminars. Had Florida ever conducted its own investigation, the reporter asked.The call set off an exchange of emails between Ms. Meale and top lawyers in the office. She learned that 23 complaints about Trump-related education enterprises had been filed before Ms. Bondi became attorney general in 2011, and one since. They had never generated a formal investigation, she wrote the reporter, but added, \u201cWe are currently reviewing the allegations in the New York complaint.\u201dBut documents obtained this week by The New York Times, including a copy of Mr. Trump\u2019s check, at least partly undercut that timeline. Although the check was received by Ms. Bondi\u2019s committee four days after the Sentinel report, and was recorded as such in her financial disclosure filings, it was actually dated and signed by Mr. Trump four days before the article appeared.The check\u2019s date does not categorically demonstrate that Mr. Trump was not seeking to influence Ms. Bondi, a fellow Republican. Even as he has denied trying to do so in this instance, he has boasted brazenly and repeatedly during his presidential campaign that he has made copious campaign contributions over the past two decades, including to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, in order to buy access and consideration for his business dealings.Politicians in Florida, which Mr. Trump considers his second home, have been among his leading beneficiaries. An analysis of public records shows he has contributed at least $375,000 to state and federal candidates and political committees here since 1995, accounting for 19 percent of the roughly $2 million he has given to campaigns nationwide, other than his own.Although not unprecedented, his $25,000 gift to And Justice for All, the committee supporting Ms. Bondi, is among his largest.What is more, when Mr. Trump wrote that check, he still theoretically had reason to be concerned that Florida\u2019s attorney general could become a player in the legal assault on Trump University.Through 2010, when the company ceased operations, Florida had been one of the most lucrative markets for his unaccredited for-profit school. It ranked second among states in purchases, with 950 transactions, and third in sales, at $3.3 million, according to an analysis of sales data revealed in court filings.On Sept. 9, 2013, Donald J. Trump signed a check from his foundation to And Justice for All, a political committee supporting Pam Bondi, the Florida attorney general. The date of the check, which was included in documents released on Tuesday by the New York attorney general, highlights that the contribution appeared to be on its way before Ms. Bondi's office said publicly that it was reviewing complaints about Mr. Trump's for-profit education company, Trump University.Brian Ballard, Mr. Trump\u2019s lobbyist in Florida, said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to think his client sought to buy off Ms. Bondi. \u201cI\u2019m the Trump Organization lobbyist, and he has never, ever brought up Trump University with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something of concern to him. With Donald Trump, if a friend calls up and says, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m running for XYZ, could you help me?\u2019 his instinct is to say yes. That\u2019s all it was.\u201dYet, even those who doubt anything nefarious between Mr. Trump and Ms. Bondi acknowledge that they bear blame for the intensifying focus on the appearance of a conflict.Ms. Bondi, meanwhile, has failed to explain why she accepted Mr. Trump\u2019s check even after learning that her office was examining the New York case against Trump University. Six months later, she allowed him to host a $3,000-per-head fund-raiser for her at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach. Mr. Trump attended the event, which records indicate raised at least $50,000.Now, with the revelation of the date on Mr. Trump\u2019s check \u2014 which came in a release of correspondence by Mr. Schneiderman \u2014 it appears that Mr. Trump and Ms. Bondi had in their possession a piece of favorable evidence that they bewilderingly failed to disclose.\u201cAll these things come together in a way that if you don\u2019t unpack the whole thing, the unspoken implications coalesce to create this great suspicion,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Florida Republican strategist and lobbyist who disdains Mr. Trump and has never worked with Ms. Bondi. \u201cThe optics are terrible even though there is not a shred of evidence that Pam Bondi solicited a bribe or that Donald Trump provided one.\u201dMs. Bondi became a conservative darling in 2010 when, as an assistant state attorney, she won her post in her first campaign of any kind. Her political future is unclear as she faces a two-term limit and has said she will not run for governor in 2018.There is no evidence in more than 8,000 pages of documents released by Ms. Bondi\u2019s office in response to an open records request that she had any direct role in assessing a potential case against Trump University, or that she knew of the Florida complaints when she asked Mr. Trump for money.That would not be unusual. Although most of the complaints were received before Ms. Bondi\u2019s election, her predecessor, Bill McCollum, said he had never heard about them. His two top deputies and the chief lawyer and investigator in his consumer protection division each said in interviews that the complaints never reached their level.\u201cFor whatever reason, the synergy didn\u2019t exist before I left office,\u201d said Mr. McCollum, who received a $500 donation from Mr. Trump in 2006.Tens of thousands of consumer allegations are lodged with Florida\u2019s attorney general each year on everything from used-car sales to pharmaceutical marketing to price gouging. The consumer protection division currently has 38 lawyers and 37 investigators. Limits on manpower and resources mean that most complaints do not prompt a formal probe and therefore do not come to the attorney general\u2019s attention, former officials said.Mr. McCollum\u2019s deputy, Robert Hannah, and his consumer protection chief, Mary Leontakianakos, said the triage process took into account the quantity, veracity and seriousness of the complaints, as well as the number of Floridians affected and the potential to collect damages. Mr. Hannah said that \u201c20 would not be the number of complaints that would cause someone to get concerned.\u201dThe complaints against Trump University continued once Ms. Bondi took over, albeit at a slower pace because Trump University, as well as Trump Institute, based in Boca Raton, Fla., were no longer operating.In April 2011, Elizabeth J. Starr, then the chief of consumer protection in the Orlando office, wrote in an internal email that she had \u201clight discussion\u201d about devoting additional resources to assessing the Trump complaints. \u201cThe decision was made to hold off at that time,\u201d she wrote.Despite the pressure, Mark Hamilton, a lawyer in the consumer protection division who eventually had a discussion with an attorney prosecuting the New York case, pushed his view internally that already-announced litigation would cover any Floridians who had been harmed by Trump University. Within two days, The Miami Herald reported that Ms. Bondi\u2019s spokeswoman had said no action would be necessary because the affected Florida consumers would be compensated if Mr. Schneiderman won his lawsuit.Mr. Trump also weighed in for the same article.\u201cPam Bondi is a fabulous representative of the people \u2014 Florida is lucky to have her,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe case in New York is pure politics brought by an incompetent attorney general, a political hack.\u201dKevin Sack reported from Tallahassee, and Steve Eder from New York.

{"Headline": "California Today: Should We Ban Plastic Bags?", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).The plastic bag wars, after years in the trenches, are now coming to a head.Voters will get the final word in November on making California the first state to prohibit the bags at grocery checkout lines.But the law was delayed before it could be enacted in 2015, when a group of bag manufacturers gathered signatures to put Proposition 67, an up-or-down referendum, on the ballot. \u201cYes\u201d keeps the ban. \u201cNo\u201d kills it.Ban supporters say the billions of plastic bags used by Californians are a menace, clogging sewers and polluting habitats. They are the fourth most common item collected during the California Coastal Commission\u2019s annual cleanup events.Among their other arguments: the paper bag fee hurts the poor, and jobs would be killed by a sudden evaporation of bag sales.\u201cNot only is it affecting jobs, it\u2019s over junk science,\u201d said Phil Rozenski, policy chairman for the American Progressive Bag Alliance.Then there\u2019s Proposition 65, which would divert revenue from the 10-cent bag fees to an environmental fund.You might think many green groups would like that. They don\u2019t.Many shoppers, who may have bristled at first, have grown used to the idea of reusable bags, advocates say.This year, the mayor appointed Mr. Kositsky, 50, to lead a new homelessness department to help the nearly 7,000 people living on the city\u2019s streets.Some of the highlights:\u201cHomelessness is a failure of our real estate market to meet the needs of low-income individuals. Interesting that the biggest housing subsidy program is the mortgage interest tax deduction.\u201d\u201cAt least $50mm a year more than we currently have.\u201d\u201cDonating money \u2014 and lots of it. Volunteering. Serving on Boards of Director. Donating products and technical assistance. Lending office space.

{"Headline": "Opposition Figure\u2019s Rise Could Pave Way for Female Leaders in Japan", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Among democracies in the developed world, Japan has one of the worst records of putting women in positions of political power.Yet if, as widely predicted, Renho Murata, a member of the upper house of Parliament, prevails in a leadership contest on Thursday and becomes the first woman to lead the opposition Democratic Party, she will be the third woman to assume a high-profile political post in Japan in less than two months.In July, Tokyo elected its first female governor, Yuriko Koike, and last month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appointed Japan\u2019s second female defense minister, Tomomi Inada. (Ms. Koike was the first.) Both are members of Mr. Abe\u2019s conservative party, the Liberal Democrats.A victory by Ms. Murata, 48, a former model and television news announcer who has served in Parliament for more than a decade, would hardly usher in an era of female dominance. Women still represent less than 15 percent of all seats in Parliament, and Mr. Abe was forced to concede last year that his government would not achieve its goal of placing women in 30 percent of management roles by 2020.Still, with three women in positions that could be steppingstones to the prime minister\u2019s office, it would be a noteworthy moment for Japan, which is far behind nations like South Korea, Taiwan, Britain and Germany, which have elected female leaders, and the United States, which has its first female major party candidate for president.Some analysts in Japan say elevating more women to leadership positions is long overdue.Japan has experienced such watershed moments before. Nearly 30 years ago, the Socialist Party, then Japan\u2019s largest opposition party, elected Takako Doi as its first female leader. Ms. Doi helped bring more women into Parliament, leading pundits to proclaim a \u201cMadonna Boom.\u201d But the trend did not last.Given this track record, Ms. Taniguchi said she was wary about predicting more progress. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being happy about \u2018the first woman something\u2019 forever,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I still welcome it if it will bring momentum for a new women\u2019s era.\u201dPolitical experts say that it has been difficult for women to gain traction in Japan because they have often been at the mercy of men who make token gestures of support but fail to follow up in the long run.\u201cUnless the political will is there to mentor the women who are already there,\u201d measures to promote women tend to be \u201cone-off,\u201d said Emma Dalton, a lecturer in Japanese at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cThe key problem is, people at the top are still men. So Renho becoming leader of the party will be quite significant if it happens.\u201dMs. Murata, who goes simply by the name Renho, is a member of the reformist wing of the left-of-center Democratic Party that favors cutting wasteful public projects. In campaigning to take the helm of the party, a combination of the legacy Democratic Party that dates from the 1990s and Ishin no To, another opposition party, she has not been shy about emphasizing that her election would make history.As of Wednesday, Ms. Murata had the support of nearly half the Democratic Party members in the Diet, as Japan\u2019s Parliament is known. She is running against two men: Seiji Maehara, a former leader of the party who served in cabinet positions during the party\u2019s brief stint in power from 2009 to 2012, and Yuichiro Tamaki, a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat who was elected to the Diet in 2009.Ms. Murata has assumed the lead in the race despite a haze of controversy that has dogged her because she is partly of Taiwanese heritage. Though she was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and a Taiwanese father, and grew up there, she was classified a citizen of Taiwan because Japan only granted citizenship to children with Japanese fathers at the time.She received Japanese citizenship in 1985, at the age of 17, when the law was changed. But she did not formally renounce her Taiwan citizenship, and nationalist critics have accused her of duplicity and disloyalty because Japanese law prohibits dual citizenship.Ms. Murata at first said that she had relinquished her Taiwan citizenship as a teenager. But on Tuesday, she told reporters that she had recently learned she was still officially on Taiwan citizenship rolls and had asked to be taken off.\u201cAs a politician, I\u2019ve never acted as anything other than a Japanese person,\u201d she said at a news conference, apologizing for any misunderstanding. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for Japan and would like to do so from now on as well. My desire to change the party has not changed.\u201dShe will confront both the overt and subtle sexism of the political culture where, as in many places, male leaders favor other men, and women are still judged by their looks.\u201cShe looks very beautiful and very powerful and is very popular in Japan,\u201d said Katsuyuki Yakushiji, a professor of politics at Toyo University in Tokyo. \u201cBut from the viewpoint of politicians, she doesn\u2019t have enough experience as a politician. I listen to what she wants to do when she wins, but it is not enough to understand, because it is very abstract,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what she wants to do.\u201dJapanese feminists hope that Ms. Murata will champion causes important to women, like better child care, equal pay and protection from domestic violence.But some political experts said they feared that Ms. Murata, like other women in leadership positions, might be forced to prove her mettle by playing down so-called women\u2019s issues.\u201cWomen in Japanese politics are so minor, so they have had to adapt to men\u2019s norms and practices,\u201d said Mari Miura, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. \u201cIf you don\u2019t behave like men, you will be underappreciated or valued, so because of that, Renho and any woman leader has to behave like men to some extent.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.M. and Union Avoid Strike by Canadian Workers", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 General Motors and a union narrowly averted a strike by Canadian workers on Tuesday with a deal that could serve as a model for preserving the country\u2019s dwindling auto jobs.Under a tentative pact, G.M. will close one of two assembly lines at its Oshawa, Ontario, plant, its largest in Canada. But the automaker agreed to rebuild another assembly line there to produce cars and trucks.The move will bolster overall employment in Oshawa, which currently has about 5,700 total workers, including engineering and other nonunion employees. The automaker also agreed to move production of one engine from Mexico to another Ontario plant, a provision that bucks the trade trend.The tentative deal \u201creally turned the tide of what has happened in the auto industry in this country for over a decade,\u201d said Jerry Dias, the leader of Canada\u2019s Unifor, the country\u2019s largest private sector union.In a brief statement, G.M. said that the agreement would lead to \u201csignificant new product, technology and process investments\u201d at its two Canadian factories, as well as a parts warehouse elsewhere in Ontario. The company added that it would be looking for government financing to cover some of the investment.While the deal focuses on two production lines, it has proved a battleground for the country\u2019s manufacturing. The cars and trucks produced in Canada, most of which are shipped to the United States, are a vital component of the country\u2019s exports.But the industrial heartland has been hit by the same forces reshaping manufacturing worldwide.Last year, 2.2 million cars and trucks were made in Canada, compared with 2.6 million 10 years earlier. And since the 2008 recession, new factories have largely headed toward the United States and, increasingly, Mexico.At the outset of negotiations, the union was focused on keeping jobs in Canada, rather than on traditional issues like improving wages and benefits. The carmaker was similarly clear that it would not make a decision about any investments in Canada until after the negotiations concluded.In recent years, General Motors has pulled back production in Canada.The company is gone from Windsor, Ontario, the city across the river from Detroit. Most of what was once a transmission plant there is now a pile of demolition rubble. From the site, the cylindrical towers of G.M.\u2019s world headquarters are now clearly visible.Unifor feared a similar future awaited Oshawa, where the company and its predecessors have been making cars for 108 years.The Oshawa plant has two assembly lines. One, which produces the Chevrolet Equinox, is set to close under the new deal. The other builds the Cadillac XTS, the Buick Regal and the Chevrolet Impala.A much newer G.M. plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, seems to have a comparatively secure future. It is the company\u2019s main source of the Equinox, a top-selling small sport utility vehicle, as well as of the similar GMC Terrain. That factory is covered by a separate contract that expires next year.G.M. also operates a plant that produces engines and transmissions in St. Catharines, Ontario, which Mr. Dias said also required investment from the company.Under the new labor pact, G.M. is to move some engine production to St. Catharines from Mexico. The new pact also calls for wage increases. And temporary workers will switch to full time. But, in a concession from Unifor, new employees at G.M. Canada will receive defined contribution retirement plans, rather than full pensions.After settling with G.M., Unifor will now have to deal with the clouds hanging over some factories owned by Ford Motor of Canada and FCA Canada, part of Fiat Chrysler. The Canadian manufacturing operations of Honda and Toyota are not unionized.FCA recently renovated a plant in Windsor that makes minivans, but uncertainty surrounds its former American Motors factory in the Toronto suburb of Brampton, Ontario, which produces large rear-wheel-drive cars. And while there is little near-term concern about the Ford assembly plant in Oakville, Ontario, that is not the case with an aging factory in Windsor that builds large 10-cylinder engines.Despite the settlement with G.M., Canada remains a tough sell.During the contract talks, Unifor pitched the weakness of the Canadian dollar as a potential cost advantage for American carmakers, providing a discount on spending in Canada. But companies are generally reluctant to base long-term investment plans on fluctuating exchange rates.The union also highlighted its pay system, in which workers do not reach full-scale wages for 10 years, presenting an advantage over that of American unions. But Canada is trying to find its place at a politically sensitive time when the United States wants to bring more jobs home.\u201cPolicy makers used to be focused on expanding production\u201d in Canada, said Greig Mordue, an associate professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and the former general manager of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. \u201cNow they\u2019re focused on sustaining what they\u2019ve got.\u201dCanada also can\u2019t effectively compete with Mexico anymore.Most carmakers have developed standardized manufacturing systems. So quality control and productivity remain relatively consistent in different locations, according to Mr. Mordue.Car companies can also recruit factory workers with higher skill levels than in the past, since they offer better wages than other types of manufacturers in Mexico. \u201cWhen you pay a premium, you get the best,\u201d Mr. Mordue said.G.M. provided one of the few bits of good news for Canada when it said in June that it would hire up to 750 people, mostly engineers, to work on software development and research in the country. As with Google and other tech companies, a major attraction was the University of Waterloo\u2019s highly regarded mathematics and computer science departments.But Mr. Mordue said such gains provided little consolation to less skilled factory workers facing an uncertain future. \u201cYou can\u2019t replace 7,000 production jobs with 700 software engineering jobs,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former A.I.G Chief Spars With Prosecutor at His Fraud Trial", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of American International Group, clashed with a New York State prosecutor on Wednesday over the extent of his role in a transaction at the center of his civil accounting fraud trial.In sometimes-heated exchanges with the state trial attorney, David E. Nachman, during his second day on the stand in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Greenberg was shown what was said to be evidence that he had received a memo from and met with Joseph H. Umansky, a former A.I.G. executive who outlined the possible transaction in question.But Mr. Greenberg said he could not recall the memo, and could say only that he \u201cmay have\u201d reviewed it. \u201cRemember, this is 16 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Greenberg, 91, his voice rising. \u201cI don\u2019t remember everything 16 years ago.\u201d Although he mostly denied any recollection, at times he acknowledged he had been interested in pursuing Mr. Umansky\u2019s idea.The state has charged that the sham transaction, known as Capco, allowed A.I.G. to convert into investment losses $163 million in auto warranty insurance losses, which were incurred under a program begun by Mr. Greenberg\u2019s son Evan. Some investors see investment losses as less significant than insurance underwriting losses.Mr. Greenberg and the former A.I.G. chief financial officer Howard I. Smith are on trial, accused of playing a role in engineering bogus transactions that improved the appearance of A.I.G.\u2019s financial results more than a decade ago. The case was first filed by Eliot Spitzer in 2005, when he was New York State attorney general. The other transactions at issue, arranged with General Reinsurance Corporation, allowed A.I.G. to increase its reserves by $500 million in 2000 and 2001, at a time when investors were concerned about the insurer\u2019s reserve levels.On Wednesday, Mr. Nachman showed Mr. Greenberg dates on his own desk diary calendar that included a scheduled meeting with Mr. Umansky to discuss an April 2000 memo outlining the proposed transaction. Besides protesting that he could not recall that far back, Mr. Greenberg said that in any case he believed Capco would be vetted by lawyers and accountants.Mr. Nachman showed Mr. Greenberg a copy of a 2008 deposition he gave for the state\u2019s case in which he acknowledged that he had \u201cglanced at\u201d and \u201cskimmed\u201d parts of the Umansky memo. But at that point, Mr. Greenberg protested on the stand, the idea was only \u201chypothetical.\u201dThe Umansky memo to Mr. Greenberg, which was introduced into evidence, described the possible creation of an offshore reinsurer with outside investors that could absorb the losses. \u201cThe accounting is aggressive, and there will be a significant amount of structuring required in order to address the legal, regulatory and tax issues,\u201d the memo noted.The state has charged that Mr. Greenberg helped Mr. Umansky find investors for the supposedly independent reinsurer, which A.I.G. in fact controlled. Under the plan that was later carried out, A.I.G. financed the outside investors\u2019 stakes in the reinsurer, thus absorbing the related losses, the state has charged.After much pushback on the stand Wednesday, Mr. Greenberg acknowledged giving a green light to the plan and said he understood the outside investors would not actually lose money. Mr. Nachman asked Mr. Greenberg whether the \u201caccounting is aggressive\u201d language in the memo raised a red flag. \u201cNot particularly,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. In his 2008 deposition he said that he had not asked for a legal opinion on the issue.Because Mr. Nachman hasn\u2019t completed taking Mr. Greenberg through the chronology of the first of the two transactions in the case, Mr. Greenberg is likely to testify for at least two more trial days, pushing his time on the stand into next week.Near the end of the half-day of testimony, Justice Charles E. Ramos, who is hearing the case without a jury, urged Mr. Greenberg to speed the case along by skipping his hedging. \u201cIf we don\u2019t want this trial to last a year, you\u2019re going to have to give direct answers,\u201d he said, without repeating the defense that it was \u201cde minimis.\u201dThe day\u2019s testimony was punctuated by several heated exchanges. At one point, asked by Mr. Nachman whether he recognized the handwriting of Mr. Smith, his co-defendant, Mr. Greenberg retorted, \u201cHow would I know?\u201d Mr. Nachman replied, \u201cYou worked with him for 30 years.\u201d Said Mr. Greenberg: \u201cI\u2019m not a handwriting expert!\u201dAt another point, Mr. Greenberg told Mr. Nachman, \u201cYou\u2019re not listening.\u201dMr. Nachman asked: \u201cYou actually helped move this project along, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d Mr. Greenberg replied. Mr. Greenberg confirmed helping find outside investors for the project, but insisted that the issue was \u201ca nonevent\u201d in the context of A.I.G\u2019s overall finances.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rush of Chinese Investment in Europe\u2019s High-Tech Firms Is Raising Eyebrows", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 After a customer canceled a large order at the last minute, shares in Aixtron, a German high-tech company, sank fast. Months later, with the stock still reeling, a Chinese investor agreed to buy the company.If only it were as simple as smart deal-making.Financial filings and public statements indicate a web of relationships among the customer, the buyer and the Chinese state. The links highlight the blurred lines between increasingly acquisitive Chinese companies and Beijing\u2019s long-term industrial policy.Chinese leaders have made clear their intention of using state funds to acquire technological capabilities overseas and bring them home, and a series of purchases in recent years have highlighted that strategy.That has led to questions about how to treat bids that cross between private investment and state-orchestrated takeovers. It has also fed into broader suspicions about the fate of the takeover targets, and whether national champions will ultimately be absorbed into the supply chain in China.Aixtron \u2014 one of a growing number of European businesses with cutting-edge technologies that have recently been targeted by a surge in Chinese overseas investment \u2014 provides a case study.A university spinoff, it employs hundreds of highly skilled engineers and has a decades-long history of making the advanced tools needed to make semiconductors. Its systems can deposit layers of chemicals just atoms thick that grow the crystals needed to make chips and light-emitting diodes.It was facing a broad slowdown in demand in 2015 when San\u2019an Optoelectronics, based in the eastern Chinese city of Xiamen, canceled a large order at the last minute.The decision sent Aixtron\u2019s share price crashing. By May of this year, it had agreed to sell itself to a Chinese investment fund, Fujian Grand Chip.Yet in a twist that shows the conflicting interests that can lurk behind Chinese deals, San\u2019an has a number of connections to Fujian Grand Chip, including a common investor and an existing financial relationship.Fujian Grand Chip is 51 percent controlled by Liu Zhendong, a businessman the Mercator Institute said most likely had government connections but was otherwise hard to track. The rest is held by Xiamen Bohao, a local government investment fund that itself has links to San\u2019an.A financial filing showed that at the end of 2014, San\u2019an owed Bohao 300 million renminbi, now worth about $45 million. The following year, another filing showed Bohao owed San\u2019an 240 million renminbi. While there is no explanation given for the fund flows, they appear to be related to financing provided to San\u2019an by Bohao.There are other links as well. Another state-run investment firm based in Xiamen holds stakes in both companies. And a broader national investment fund is providing a loan facility, through a subsidiary, for the takeover of Aixtron while holding a stake in San\u2019an.Just three days after the Aixtron bid was announced, a new company was registered at an address in Quanzhou along the Taiwan Strait. San\u2019an was an investor in the company, and the address was the same as that listed by Fujian Grand Chip in its Aixtron offer.The connections do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. Still, they raise questions about the independence of Chinese companies that have been on a global high-tech spending binge.\u201cIt is the goal of Chinese outbound industrial policy programs to replace foreign technology leaders in the medium term \u2014 not just in China but also in global export markets,\u201d Mr. Heilmann said.He echoed the complaints of American and European officials, who say that while Chinese companies \u2014 including those backed by the state \u2014 are able to mount takeover bids for companies in the West, the opposite is not typically allowed within China.The German economics ministry declined to comment on the Aixtron takeover. Fujian Grand Chip, Bohao and Mr. Liu declined to comment. San\u2019an did not respond to a request for comment, but in a statement, Aixtron said San\u2019an canceled its order because its \u201cspecific qualification requirements were not achieved.\u201dBids for companies like Aixtron reflect a shift in Chinese investment patterns that goes back a number of years.By contrast, European laws give politicians few avenues to block acquisitions, though that has not stopped them from trying.In Germany, the takeover of Kuka \u2014 frequently cited by politicians as emblematic of the country\u2019s future economic development \u2014 has drawn particular attention. The economics ministry examined the takeover of the company by Midea Group in China, which already owns 95 percent of Kuka shares, but eventually decided the deal did not meet the strict criteria for a formal review.Beyond politics, concerns also surround the origin of the money supporting Chinese bids.The Aixtron case, in particular, shows how difficult that can be.Ultimately both San\u2019an, the customer, and Fujian Grand Chip, the buyer, are recipients of government funds earmarked to help China build out its semiconductor capabilities. While it\u2019s not clear whether the two coordinated in any way, they are a product of a new approach Beijing has taken to develop its semiconductor industry.Previously, China\u2019s government would dole out funds to several well-known state-owned companies. Now those funds are being distributed through national and local investment funds, which give them out to, and through, smaller companies like Bohao and San\u2019an.German companies have so far managed to stay ahead of China and other competitors in quality and technology, but there are growing concerns that Chinese companies are catching up.\u201cA lot of people in Germany have massive concerns about Chinese companies taking over leading tech companies,\u201d said Daniel Bauer, a spokesman for SdK, a German investor-protection group. \u201cPeople fear that foreign investors will just transfer the know-how and have no interest in keeping the facilities.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

{"Headline": "Fannie Mae Is Now Getting More Detailed Information on Borrowers", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserBORROWERS seeking home loans should know that as of this week, many mortgage lenders will be scrutinizing more detailed credit data.Mindy Armstrong, Desktop Underwriter product manager in Fannie Mae\u2019s single-family homes division, said the new information would give lenders a more nuanced understanding of how a borrower handles debt and whether they are likely to repay their mortgage. \u201cIt will help us better predict the risk of default on a loan,\u201d she said.Fannie Mae says its Desktop Underwriter software is used by about 2,000 lenders and more than 10,000 mortgage brokers. Fannie Mae currently backs more than a quarter of new home loans, said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.Historically, credit reports used in mortgage lending included a borrower\u2019s balance, how much of their available credit they use and whether monthly payments are made on time, Ms. Armstrong said.The new reports, however, include the actual amount paid each month, over a 24-month period. The lender can see if the borrower paid off a card balance in full each month, if they made just the minimum required payment and, if they paid more than the minimum, how much more.\u201cEssentially,\u201d she said, \u201cit will benefit those who make more than the minimum payment or pay in full.\u201d That\u2019s because those borrowers are deemed less risky.But, Ms. Armstrong said, the new data was just one piece of information used to evaluate borrowers, along with other criteria like the borrower\u2019s income and overall debt burden, and the size of the loan relative to the property\u2019s value. \u201cThis is not the only thing we\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.Susan Chana, a spokeswoman for the credit bureau Equifax, said the extra information \u2014 \u201ctrended credit data,\u201d in industry jargon \u2014 may help more borrowers who have middling credit scores but who have managed their credit card debt responsibly, qualify for home loans. Equifax, along with TransUnion, is providing the expanded credit data to Fannie Mae, which then combines it into a merged report.The use of expanded credit reports, along with other updates Fannie Mae has made to its software, may help bring some flexibility to mortgage underwriting criteria, which have remained quite rigid since the financial crisis, Mr. Cecala said. \u201cIt could open the market up a bit,\u201d he said.But the changes could potentially harm borrowers who have been less diligent about paying down their card balances, said John Ulzheimer, a consumer credit expert.Here are some questions and answers about the new mortgage credit reports:Fannie Mae made the changes on Sept. 24.Even if you can\u2019t always pay the balance in full, it\u2019s always a good idea to make more than the minimum payment, to pay down your balance and save on interest charges. The addition of the extra payment information in credit reports used in many mortgage applications means that paying more than the minimum, if borrowers are able, makes even more sense, Ms. Armstrong said.No, at least for now. The dominant consumer credit scores, like FICO, don\u2019t yet factor in these extra details, Ms. Armstrong said. So while the new data may affect whether a borrower qualifies for a loan, it won\u2019t have a big impact on the interest rate offered, she said, because loan pricing is determined mainly by your credit score. But, she said, it\u2019s likely that credit scores will eventually be calculated using the expanded data.That remains to be seen, Mr. Cecala said. Freddie Mac, the other big government-controlled mortgage financing company, currently has no plans to use the expanded reports, a spokeswoman said. (Freddie backs about 18 percent of new mortgage loans, Mr. Cecala said.)Advertisement"}

Republican operatives knew that losing the court\u2019s conservative majority would spell the end of Mr. Walker\u2019s right-wing, anti-union agenda.Versions of this sad story are playing out across the country, thanks in large part to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision, in which a 5-to-4 majority upheld the right of corporations and labor unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections, so long as they remained independent of the candidates.Yet what\u2019s happening in Wisconsin gives the lie to both of these claims.

{"Headline": "Can You Have a Good Life if You Don\u2019t Have a Good Job?", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionSHOULD the goal of public policy be to ensure that all Americans can have good jobs \u2014 or good lives? Politicians of both parties say one thing. Policy experts of both parties say another.Far from the campaign stops, in university and think tank offices, the emerging consensus is quite different: Americans should be able to enjoy good lives, even if they have \u201cbad\u201d jobs \u2014 jobs with low wages, irregular hours and no employer-provided benefits. Bipartisan experts tend to agree that the decline in employer-provided benefits and the rise of unconventional work arrangements are trends that should be accommodated, by reforms including new portable benefits and expanded income maintenance programs, like tax credits for low-income workers.For several decades, this consensus has been reflected in what legislators have actually been doing. Slowly, incrementally, Americans have been moving away from a system in which a good job with a generous employer was the key to having a good life to a new system in which even people with low-wage jobs can have access to the basic goods and services that define a decent life in a modern society.This huge government sector is made up of tax credits, federal grants-in-aid to the states and low-interest loan programs like student loans. Many of these indirect programs, like entitlements and tax breaks for health care, retirement and housing, are not counted as part of the conventional federal budget. This allows Congress to stealthily expand the size of government while pretending not to. The individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, for example, is a tax, though an unusual one, as the Supreme Court found when upholding its legitimacy in 2012.Preserving the fiction of a small federal government by relying on the hidden welfare state to deliver benefits sometimes comes at a cost. For example, unemployment insurance is not a simple, straightforward, uniform federal program, but a hodgepodge of separate state programs financed partly by the federal government and partly by the states. During economic downturns, this design often creates crises, because the federal government can more easily borrow money in recessions than state governments bound by balanced budget provisions in their state constitutions. And as Suzanne Mettler has pointed out, the importance of indirect benefits in America creates political problems, too. Middle-class American voters often underestimate how many government benefits they receive, while overestimating the cost of means-tested welfare for the poor. Unfortunately, the preference of American policy makers for what the political scientist Steven Teles calls \u201ckludgeocracy\u201d \u2014 indirect, complex, off-budget mechanisms rather than simple public programs financed through higher taxes \u2014 seems likely to persist.Looking back over the last half-century, we can discern a long-term trend in which the United States government at all levels has been gradually responding to the decline of high-wage, high-benefit jobs, by methods such as gradually socializing benefits (state-run retirement plans) and partly subsidizing wages (the earned-income tax credit). Is this a trend to be welcomed or feared?One criticism is that the growing socialization of wages and benefits, combined with the decline of employer-provided benefits, transfers responsibility for the well-being of workers from employers and their customers to taxpayers. But any welfare state of any design allows employers to pay somewhat lower wages, because workers do not have to pay for goods like retirement security or health care entirely from their after-tax earnings.But the political problem remains. Even if center-left and center-right policy wonks agree that the goal should be good lives for all workers, even those with bad jobs, many Americans do not agree, to judge from the rhetoric of politicians, who know their audiences well. The replacement of a world in which one or a few lifetime jobs in a paternalistic company that provided benefits during your working life and a pension after your retirement by a future in which individuals struggle to survive by piecing together \u201cgigs\u201d and \u201ctasks\u201d with a bewildering variety of federal, state and local social programs may strike many workers as a dystopian nightmare. The price of increased flexibility may be increased stress.The emerging policy agenda tends to shift administrative burdens from employers to the least-educated and worst-paid workers in America. Members of the professional class who are well-remunerated freelancers and can hire tax preparers have a quite different experience of the new economy than high school dropouts who, between part-time shifts, struggle with the paperwork for the earned-income tax credit, Section 8 housing vouchers, food stamps and other benefits.The unelected policy experts who envision a future of multiple job types and a greater, if hidden, role for government in maintaining minimum incomes and providing health and retirement benefits are essentially right. The elements of a \u201cgood job\u201d \u2014 adequate income, health insurance and retirement benefits \u2014 that were once combined in the package that a Detroit automobile manufacturer provided to a unionized male steelworker in 1950 are likely to be provided, for most American workers now, by some combination of employer and government.Until most American workers are persuaded that they will not be worse off in a system characterized by flexible work arrangements and partly socialized benefits, they may continue to make unrealistic demands that 21st century politicians restore something like the occupational structure of the 20th century. Politicians should tell working Americans what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. And what they need to hear is that it is possible for all Americans to have good lives, even if they can\u2019t all have good jobs.Michael Lind is a fellow at New America and the author, most recently, of \u201cLand of Promise: An Economic History of the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

CBOE has long been viewed as an acquisition target, and the deal for Bats, which generates revenue from more competitive products, may make CBOE less attractive to another suitor, said Andrew Bond, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.Bats is trading about 5 percent below CBOE\u2019s purchase price, indicating that the market sees the possibility of a competing bid for CBOE before the deal closes, he said. The transaction calls for a $110 million breakup fee payable by either side.The companies indicated in a conference call on Monday that Bats had not been for sale and was not running an auction to sell itself. CBOE, however, was looking for a partner that could expand its scope, and in signing a deal with Bats, it is aiming for more diversification into equities, exchange-traded products and foreign exchange.Within five years after closing the deal, CBOE also expects to generate cost savings of about $65 million by using just one trading platform and streamlining expenses, such as technology.The deal requires shareholder approval from both companies and regulatory clearance. Although it is expected to add to CBOE\u2019s adjusted earnings per share the first full year after closing, it also requires that the company take on quite a bit of debt. CBOE received a commitment letter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch to provide $1.65 billion to help finance the deal.After the deal closes \u2014 expected for the first half of next year \u2014 Edward T. Tilly, CBOE\u2019s chief executive, will retain that role for the combined company. Chris Concannon, Bats\u2019s chief executive, will become president and chief operating officer. The combined company will have 14 directors, including 11 of the 14 members from CBOE\u2019s board, and three from Bats\u2019s board.The headquarters will be located in Chicago, with business offices in Kansas City, Kan., where Bats is based, and other areas like New York, London, San Francisco, Singapore and Quito, Ecuador.Bank of America and Broadhaven Capital Partners served as financial advisers to CBOE, while Barclays was the lead adviser to Bats, along with UBS.

{"Headline": "Agnes Nixon, Who Infused Her Soap Operas With Social Relevance, Dies at 93", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAgnes Nixon, a celebrated creator and writer of television soap operas, who introduced uterine cancer, venereal diseases, child abuse, AIDS and other societal terrors into the weekday fantasy worlds of millions of daytime viewers, died on Wednesday in Rosemont, Pa. She was 93.The cause was pneumonia resulting from Parkinson\u2019s disease, her family said.In a career that paralleled the rise, enormous popularity and gradual decline of soap operas in the last half of the 20th century, Ms. Nixon fashioned many of television\u2019s most popular daytime shows, drawing on a rich imagination to find the great and small human dramas lurking just below the surface of American life.To a 1950s audience mostly composed of women who were at home doing housework and raising children, Ms. Nixon\u2019s early scripts for \u201cThe Guiding Light\u201d and \u201cSearch for Tomorrow\u201d provided an escape: a glimpse of dashing lives, handsome cads, passions run amok, dark secrets and terrible betrayals.But in the 1960s and \u201970s she virtually reinvented soaps, creating for the ABC network \u201cOne Life to Live,\u201d \u201cAll My Children\u201d and other shows infused with social relevance and politically charged topics like racism, abortion, obscenity, narcotics, the generation gap and protests against the Vietnam War.Like their predecessors, the new Nixon soaps were disturbing, fascinating and addictive. Because she presented various sides of a controversy, they were more complex. But she tried to avoid preachy dialogue, letting action and plot speak for themselves. The conundrum was no longer simply whether Tara was pregnant, but whether Phil, home from Vietnam and scarred by the horrors of war, could still love her.Many Nixon stories were based on reality. In 1964, after a friend died of cancer, she created a \u201cGuiding Light\u201d character who was found, after a Pap smear, to have cervical cancer. Despite misgivings by the sponsor, Procter & Gamble, the character appeared onscreen, though the words \u201ccancer,\u201d \u201cuterus\u201d and \u201chysterectomy\u201d were never uttered. Even so, thousands of women wrote in to express gratitude for the information that a simple test might save their lives.On \u201cOne Life to Live,\u201d which began in 1968 and ran for 43 years, Ms. Nixon created a tale that reflected the nation\u2019s changing social structures and attitudes. It had many ethnic characters, including Jews, Polish-Americans and African-Americans. A woman assumed to be white was revealed after months to be a light-skinned black, turning the story, and the audience, sharply to questions of racial prejudice.Ms. Nixon\u2019s revolutionary changes were widely copied by other soaps and other networks, and helped capture new audiences at a time when the traditional base of daytime viewers \u2014 20 million to 30 million daily, the vast majority of them homemakers \u2014 was being eroded by women entering the work force. Increasingly, men and college students drawn by their topicality were tuning in.Ms. Nixon was an unlikely source of tales of infidelity and divorce, let alone racial and antiwar conflicts. The mother of four children, she was married to the same man for 45 years. And she wrote not in the caldron of New York or glitzy Hollywood, but in her suburban home in Rosemont, on the Philadelphia Main Line. (She died in a nursing facility in Rosemont.)Rosemont and adjoining Bryn Mawr, Pa., were the prototype for Pine Valley, the setting for \u201cAll My Children,\u201d which had its premiere in 1970 and ran for 41 years. (For that entire time, its best-known cast member was Susan Lucci, one of daytime TV\u2019s best-known and highest-paid stars, as Erica Kane.) In 1973, a character on the show was the first on television to have a legal abortion after the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. The show also tackled drug addiction, depression, child abuse and AIDS. In 2000, it introduced a lesbian character, who shared the first lesbian kiss on a soap opera. In 2007, a transgender character appeared.\u201cLife is fascinating,\u201d Ms. Nixon told The Milwaukee Sentinel in 1983, \u201cand if you look at your family and your friends and you have a writer\u2019s viewpoint, you can see each person\u2019s life as a soap opera in itself. The really amazing thing is they are basically similar.\u201dShe was born Agnes Eckhardt in Chicago on Dec. 10, 1922, the only child of Harold and Agnes Dalton Eckhardt. Her parents were separated when she was an infant. She and her mother moved to Nashville, where she attended St. Cecilia Academy, a Roman Catholic prep school. She studied writing at St. Mary\u2019s College in South Bend, Ind., and attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.Her father, who manufactured burial garments and paid for her education, wanted her to join his firm. He tried to dissuade her from a writing career by arranging a talk with Irna Phillips, a well-known creator of radio soaps and serials. The tactic backfired. After reading a script she had written, Ms. Phillips offered her a job in New York. She began in 1948, writing radio scripts for a hospital drama, \u201cWoman in White.\u201dIn 1951, she married Robert Henry Nixon, an auto dealer who later gave up his business to join his wife in a television production company. He died in 1996.She is survived by their three daughters, Cathy Chicos, Mary Nixon and Emily Nixon; their son, Robert; 10 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.In the early 1950s, Ms. Nixon wrote for major dramatic programs, including \u201cThe Philco Television Playhouse,\u201d \u201cRobert Montgomery Presents\u201d and \u201cThe Hallmark Hall of Fame.\u201d She eventually succeeded Ms. Phillips as lead writer for \u201cThe Guiding Light.\u201d She was the head writer for the NBC soap opera \u201cAnother World\u201d from 1965 to 1967.For decades, the lucrative advertising revenues of Ms. Nixon\u2019s best-known creations, \u201cOne Life to Live\u201d and \u201cAll My Children,\u201d helped support ABC\u2019s evening programming. But in the 1990s, the popularity of all soaps fell steadily as cable networks and the internet provided new sources of entertainment, and after 2000 their audiences and revenues went into steep declines.Because of both her success and her longevity, Ms. Nixon was often called the queen of the modern soap opera. From the premiere of \u201cOne Life to Live\u201d in 1968 to its finale in January 2012 (four months after the last episode of \u201cAll My Children\u201d), shows she had created or had a hand in writing, producing or shaping as a consultant were on the air every weekday for 43 years \u2014 more than 11,000 days.The recipient of many awards, including a Daytime Emmy for lifetime achievement in 2010, Ms. Nixon often spoke of soap operas as ensembles and would share credit with actors, directors, producers, camera crews and other writers. Her own contributions, she said, had no unrealistic objectives.\u201cOn the social issues, whether the Vietnam War or abortion or racism, I never thought I could change the way most people felt,\u201d she told the Catholic magazine America in 2002. \u201cI just wanted to show the unfairness of it, the inequality, the injustice.\u201dAn obituary on Thursday about the soap opera creator and writer Agnes Nixon misidentified which of her shows broadcast its last episode in January 2012. It was \u201cOne Life to Live\u201d \u2014 not \u201cAll My Children,\u201d which ended its run in September 2011. And because of an editing error, the obituary referred incorrectly to the cancellation of later online versions of those two shows. They ended in November 2013, not last November.Advertisement"}

It has made it possible for tax-exempt \u201csocial welfare\u201d organizations to operate as partisan attack machines. And it has dismissed complaints and failed to police this rise of \u201cdark money\u201d from hidden donors that is pouring into elections.\u201cIt blinks reality,\u201d Judge Cooper ruled, questioning how the Republicans on the commission found a $1 million attack ad to be in compliance with the law. In the ads, three Democratic lawmakers were cited by name, charged with voting to provide \u201cViagra for convicted sex offenders\u201d and \u201cfree health care for illegal immigrants\u201d because they supported President Obama\u2019s health care reform program. The ads called for fixing this problem in the voting booth.The complaint to the F.E.C. \u2014 which was dismissed in a 3-to-3 vote that split the Republican and Democratic members \u2014 was brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a campaign watchdog group. The complaint pointed out that the ad sponsors were not engaged in \u201csocial welfare\u201d issue activities, and should therefore be required by the F.E.C. to disclose their donors under the election law. American Action Network, an outside group aligned with the House speaker, Paul Ryan, insisted it operated within the law in its \u201ccenter-right policy advocacy\u201d and that its message should not be considered a partisan attack on the Democrats.Judge Cooper\u2019s ruling is further evidence that the F.E.C. is paralyzed and should be replaced by a new agency. Reform legislation proposed by Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, and Representative David Price, Democrat of North Carolina, would create a commission with five, not six, members appointed by the president. The fifth would be a genuinely nonpartisan election law expert, chosen from a list selected by retired judges and other legal specialists. If members from the two major parties split 2-against-2, the fifth member could settle the issue.This proposal may have no immediate chance in a Congress obsessed with campaign fund-raising. But voters should be demanding it, if Big Money in politics is ever to be reined in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio, Focusing on Small Donors, Hires Team That Bolstered Sanders", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sanders, an independent who ran for president as a Democrat, became a political phenomenon in part because of his ability to raise millions of dollars on the internet, much of it in small contributions. He was fond of saying that the average contribution to his campaign was $27.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has collected far more small donations from contributors across the city this year than he did last year, when the donations he received tended to be larger and concentrated in Manhattan.\u201cWe\u2019ve already shown that you can power a campaign through these kinds of grass-roots donations, and we\u2019re trying to double down on that here,\u201d Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the mayor\u2019s campaign, said.The average donation received from individual contributors to the mayor\u2019s re-election fund during the first six months of this year was $685, compared with $2,228 in the last six months of 2015, according to the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board.Mr. Levitan said that more than two-thirds of the contributions received in the first half of 2016 were less than $250.While the mayoral election is still more than a year away, political insiders have increasingly been chattering about whether Mr. de Blasio will face a challenger from within his own party.As City Hall has become the focus of multiple federal and state investigations into the mayor\u2019s fund-raising, his donors and some of his administration\u2019s actions, speculation has grown that other Democrats might be emboldened to mount a challenge.Several Republicans have also declared their intent to run against the mayor, but there are no political heavyweights yet.\u201cHe has a hard time getting big donations because every time he does they\u2019re from someone connected to some city contract or with interests before the city and he gets in trouble,\u201d said Mr. Tusk, a former aide to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.He said he did not think that any potential rival would be scared off by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s digital push for money.The city\u2019s campaign finance law provides matching funds for the first $175 in contributions from individual city residents, at a rate of six to one. That means that a donation of $175 from a voter living in the city would generate an additional $1,050 in funds for the candidate. The money for the matching-funds program comes from the city budget.Michael Whitney, who also works with Revolution Messaging, said the database of donors and supporters that will be created as part of this effort can be used once the mayor is re-elected to help produce support for his agenda.Advertisement"}

It certainly does not reflect well on the company\u2019s board, which should have gotten bankruptcy professionals involved early to prepare the bankruptcy filing and account for the company\u2019s assets throughout the world.Indeed, the apparent lack of insolvency planning is one aspect of this case that does clearly resemble Lehman Brothers and its haphazard collapse into bankruptcy.For example, whenever an airline files for bankruptcy, which has happened with notable frequency, it is common to make sure that the filing does not happen with planes on the ground in \u201cunfavorable\u201d jurisdictions.This could have been a moment for the Korean insolvency system to shine. But that would have required advanced planning on both the insolvency and financing side. American Airlines \u2013 which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a few years back with little noticeable effect on its operations \u2013 provides an important counterexample here.Unfortunately, it seems more likely that Hanjin will simply increase the trend for international insolvency cases to cluster in financial centers like New York and London, which has important implications for legitimacy of transnational insolvency.Advertisement"}

Indian Official Proposes Hunt for Sanjivani of Lore", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat in the WorldSanjivani is the stuff of myth: an herb that glows in the dark and has the power to revive the dying, wrenching them back from the fog of unconsciousness. In the Ramayana, a sacred Hindu epic, the herb is used to resuscitate both the god-hero Rama and his younger brother Lakshmana.Could it really exist? A government minister in the Indian state of Uttarakhand wants to mount an expedition to find out.Medicinal herbs are central to the traditional practice of ayurvedic medicine in India. But little has been done to scientifically study and preserve the medicinal herbs of the Himalayas, Mr. Negi says. So he has proposed spending 250 million rupees ($3.75 million) of tax money to send a team of ayurvedic practitioners into the mountains.Mayaram Uniyal, the state\u2019s ayurvedic adviser, says an herb that could be the real-life version of the legendary sanjivani has been seen growing on the slopes of Dunagiri, a mountain in northern Uttarakhand.\u201cIt has a special fragrant smell, with unmatched sheen, and lights up in the night,\u201d Mr. Uniyal said. \u201cBoth its flowers and milk are yellow. The herb is used extensively by the local shepherds when someone is unconscious, in pain or even under stress.\u201d\u201cWe need to study its active ingredients with clinical trials, to come to know what exactly is in it that resuscitates an unconscious man,\u201d Mr. Uniyal said. He added that while hopes for the plant are high, no one expects it to have one ability that the Ramayana ascribes to sanjivani: resurrecting the dead.\u201cThese are imaginative stories, as you might say,\u201d said Robert P. Goldman, a professor of Sanskrit at the University of California, Berkeley, and the principal translator of a critical edition of the Ramayana. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how these things can come into modernity as traditions that people follow.\u201dA similar search for sanjivani was proposed in Uttarakhand in 2009, but it did not receive financing.

{"Headline": "Holocaust Survivors\u2019 Needs Grow, and Aid Is Slow to Catch Up", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUDAPEST \u2014 Agnes Galgoczi, 84, can no longer make it to the toilet on her own. It sits in the kitchen of her apartment in Budapest, just three feet from the bed, where she sings to herself to fight loneliness. Several blocks away, Vera Varga, 78, slides decades-old movies into her videocassette player. The images remind her of the outside world.They are two of the estimated half-million remaining Holocaust survivors around the world, a group whose needs are growing in complexity and cost as they age, while funding from a variety of sources that have provided for them over the past two decades is starting to dry up.Both women are widowed and rely on help to shop, cook and clean. Neither can leave her one-room apartment without assistance. Mrs. Galgoczi could use round-the-clock care, but even if Hungary had adequate nursing homes, neither she nor Mrs. Varga would make the move. The Nazis forced them out of their homes once before, marching them to the Budapest ghetto, ripping their families apart and sowing seeds of fear and mistrust that have resurfaced as the women enter their final years.The unique problems that are the legacy of the suffering of their youth, like an intense fear of institutionalization, as well as renewed anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe and a lack of family, often mean that sending nurses and social workers into their homes is the only way to care for them.But in-home care is costly, and in some places, survivors are left in lonely or unhealthy situations.\u201cNo matter how much you give, their needs are always greater,\u201d said Taly Shaul, the director of the JDC-HJSSF, the Hungarian Jewish Social Support Foundation, which provides for about half of the country\u2019s 10,000 remaining Holocaust survivors.Dozens of volunteers check on survivors and bring them boxes of food staples. Social workers and nurses clean their homes, administer their medications and, in some cases, become like family.The growing costs of providing health care and social services to the survivors in Europe, the United States and elsewhere have raised the pressure on Germany, in particular, to increase aid.\u201cThis is the final chapter,\u201d said Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, which distributes funding to 240 organizations that provide for survivors around the world. \u201cOver the next five years, an additional amount is needed if the remaining survivors are to live with dignity.\u201dIn recent decades, the Claims Conference relied on financial support from a variety of sources. Payments came from a $1.25 billion compensation fund from unclaimed Swiss bank accounts held by those murdered, a $5 billion fund to compensate slave laborers and other settlements negotiated in the early 1990s after the fall of Europe\u2019s Communist governments.But as those funds have been spent, the burden has fallen back on Germany. Over eight months, the Claims Conference pressed German Finance Ministry negotiators with numbers and details to demonstrate the dwindling survivors\u2019 increased level of need.An agreement between the German government and the Claims Conference, reached in July, resulted in an increase in funding for the care of Holocaust survivors in their homes over the next three years. The funding will increase to 350 million euros, or $390 million, in 2018 from \u20ac281.75 million, or $314 million, this year.\u201cThis is pumping a significant additional amount of money into the budget that will have a significant impact in the field,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.For Mrs. Galgoczi \u2014 who relies on caregivers to bring her breakfast and help her wash in the morning; change the oxygen tank so she can breathe; and, throughout the day, administer the bottles of prescriptions in the basket perched beside her bed \u2014 the increased funding could mean extra help at night.\u201cI completely depend on them for everything,\u201d said Mrs. Galgoczi, whose darkened apartment holds her bed, a chair and a few of the beloved books that she can no longer read. She refers to her regular nurse as her daughter.Under the new agreement, existing caps on the hours of care an individual survivor can receive will fall away for those who, like Mrs. Galgoczi, survived a ghetto, a concentration camp or life in hiding under the Nazis.Sometimes, the biggest challenge is persuading survivors to admit they need assistance. Gyorgy Rozsa, 77, another survivor of the Budapest ghetto, lies in a wrought-iron bed in a corner of the one-room apartment where his wife has lived since she was a toddler. The acidic stench of urine from the catheter hanging beside his bed fills the dingy room, littered with empty soda bottles, laundry and a wheelchair.Bedridden for the past decade, only recently did he begin to accept outside help, first in the form of packages of nonperishable foods and, more recently, in that of caregivers who swab around his bed with disinfectant and help lift him.In an expression of trauma shared by many survivors, \u201che can\u2019t stand any light, or anyone cleaning,\u201d said Ms. Shaul of the Jewish support foundation. The fear of change or loss of home means that institutionalizing the survivors is not an option. The former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe also lack nursing home facilities comparable to those in the United States, Australia or Israel, making home care all the more important.Even for survivors who are more financially secure, like Agnes Bartha, 94, who lives in an airy eighth-floor apartment with a balcony, caregivers are like family. After a stroke last year, she needs a walker to move around and a caregiver to cook, clean and help her make sense of the 30 pills she must take daily.Gone are the days when she could travel to Germany or visit Hungarian schools to tell children her story. Now, she relies on the internet to tell younger generations how in 1944 she was marched from Hungary to the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp, how she shocked an SS officer by insisting to him in fluent German that her friend join her as a slave laborer for Daimler-Benz, or how the \u201cbiggest present of my life\u201d was a cup of tea handed to her after she escaped in the final days of World War II.For a woman whose life depended on her perseverance and her ability to get by on her wit and fortitude, it is difficult to admit that she can no longer live independently.\u201cBecause of my past and my physical condition, I need more and more help,\u201d she said, leaning on her walker, decorated with a Mercedes-Benz star recovered from the archives of the Genshagen forced labor camp. \u201cIt is not easy when you lose your strength.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prime location, secured by the Russian state after years of lobbying by the Kremlin, is so close to so many snoop-worthy places that when Moscow first proposed a $100 million \u201cspiritual and cultural center\u201d there, France\u2019s security services fretted that Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, might have more than just religious outreach in mind.Anxiety over whether the spiritual center might serve as a listening post, however, has obscured its principal and perhaps more intrusive role: an outsize display in the heart of Paris, the capital of the insistently secular French Republic, of Russia\u2019s might as a religious power, not just a military one.But faith has also helped Mr. Putin amplify Russia\u2019s voice farther west, with the church leading a push into resolutely secular members of the European Union like France.The most visible sign of this is the new Kremlin-financed spiritual center here near the Eiffel Tower, now so closely associated with Mr. Putin that France\u2019s former culture minister, Frederic Mitterrand, suggested that it be called \u201cSt. Vladimir\u2019s.\u201dWhen Russian church staff and their lay French supporters broke into the Nice Orthodox cemetery in February and declared it Russian property, allies of Mr. Obolensky hoisted a banner on the iron gate: \u201cHands off, Mr. Putin. We are not in Crimea or Ukraine. Let our dead rest in peace.\u201dMoscow\u2019s quest to gain control of churches and graves dating from czarist times and squeeze out believers who look to the Constantinople patriarch is part of a broader push by the Kremlin to assert itself as both the legitimate heir to and master of \u201cHoly Russia,\u201d and as a champion of traditional values against the decadent heresies, notably liberal democracy, promoted by the United States and what they frequently call \u201cGayropa.\u201d\u201cThe church has become an instrument of the Russian state. It is used to extend and legitimize the interests of the Kremlin,\u201d said Sergei Chapnin, who is the former editor of the official journal of the Moscow Patriarchate, the seat of the Russian Orthodox Church and affiliated churches outside Russia.Unlike the Catholic Church, which has a single, undisputed leader, the pope in Rome, the Orthodox or Eastern branch of Christianity is divided into more than a dozen self-governing provinces, each with its own patriarch. The biggest of these, the Russian Orthodox Church, covers not only Russia, but also fragile new states like Moldova that formerly belonged to the Russian and later Soviet empires.\u201cWe have been independent for 25 years but our church is still dependent on Moscow,\u201d complained Iurie Leanca, a former prime minister of Moldova, who in 2014 signed a trade and political pact with the European Union that the church and the Kremlin worked hard to derail.In the vanguard of the anti-European cause in Moldova has been Marchel Mihaescu, the deeply conservative Orthodox bishop of Balti, who was appointed to his post by the Moscow patriarch.He has warned worshipers that new biometric passports, required by the European Union in return for visa-free access to Europe, were \u201csatanic\u201d because they contained a 13-digit number. He also tried to torpedo legislation extending protection against discrimination in the workplace to gay people, warning that this would draw God\u2019s wrath and sunder relations with \u201cMother Russia.\u201d\u201cThe voice of the church and the voice of Russian politicians \u2014 not all, but the overwhelming majority of Russian politicians \u2014 are the same. For me, Russia is the guardian of Christian values,\u201d the bishop said in an interview in a high-ceiling office decorated with a half-dozen portraits of past and current Russian patriarchs and a single picture of Moldova\u2019s own senior priest, Metropolitan Vladimir of Chisinau.Europe, said the bishop, has \u201cdefinitely given us lots of money, but wants too much in return. It demands that we pay with our souls, that we alienate ourselves from God. This is not acceptable.\u201dIn their determination to fend off the West, conservative Orthodox priests in Moldova have made common cause with politicians like Igor Dodon, leader of the pro-Moscow Socialist Party.When gay activists staged a parade this summer in the center of Moldova\u2019s capital, Chisinau, Mr. Dodon rallied his own supporters for a rival event dedicated to traditional values while a group of Orthodox priests gathered nearby to chant prayers and curse homosexuals.The gay parade, which was joined by a number of Western diplomats, got called off after just a few blocks when it ran into a crowd of protesters waving religious banners and throwing eggs.Opposition to gay rights has also been taken up with gusto by Russia and the Orthodox Church in Western Europe.Natalia Narochnitskaya, the institute\u2019s head, told an Orthodox Church website run by Bishop Tikhon Shevkunov, a Moscow monk close to Mr. Putin, that Europeans are fed up with what she called the \u201cvictory parade of sin\u201d and increasingly look to Russia for guidance and solace. \u201cWe have started to get letters at the institute: \u2018Thank you Russia and its leader,\u2019\u201d Ms. Narochnitskaya said.What role the new cathedral complex in Paris might play in this agenda will not be clear until it opens later this year, but those who have studied Mr. Putin\u2019s methods predict it will serve as a megaphone for his take on the world.\u201cThis cathedral is an outpost of the other Europe \u2014 ultraconservative and anti-modern \u2014 in the heart of the country of libertinism and secularism,\u201d said Michel Eltchaninoff, a French writer and author of \u201cDans la t\u00eate de Vladimir Poutine,\u201d a book about the Russian president\u2019s thinking.A huge complex of four separate buildings, the \u201cspiritual center\u201d will include not only a church but a school, conference halls and a cultural center run by the Russian Embassy.The complex is owned not by the church but by the Russian state, which beat out Saudi Arabia, Canada and other countries that had also sought to buy the coveted plot.Though fervently opposed to religion, the Soviet leaders Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev both pressed Charles de Gaulle to hand over control of the Nevsky Cathedral to Moscow.He refused, leaving Orthodox churchgoers loyal to the Moscow Patriarchate to set up their own far more modest place of worship in a Paris garage.Under Mr. Putin the quest to recover church property has resumed with vigor \u2014 in tandem with a drive to reach out to far right political forces in Europe seduced by the idea of Russia as a bastion of conservative social and cultural values.The merging of political, diplomatic and religious interests has been on vivid display in Nice, where the Orthodox cathedral, St. Nicholas, came under the control of the Moscow Partriarchate in 2013.To mark the completion of Moscow-funded renovation work in January, Russia\u2019s ambassador in Paris, Aleksandr Orlov, joined the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, for a ceremony at the cathedral and hailed the refurbishment as \u201ca message for the whole world: Russia is sacred and eternal!\u201dThen, in a festival of French-Russian amity at odds with France\u2019s official policy since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the ambassador, Orthodox priests, officials from Moscow and French dignitaries gathered in June for a gala dinner in a luxury Nice hotel to celebrate the cathedral\u2019s return to the fold of the Moscow Patriarchate.Speaking at the dinner, Vladimir Yakunin, a longtime ally of Mr. Putin who is subject to United States, but not European, sanctions imposed after Russia seized Crimea, declared the cathedral a \u201ccorner of the Russian world,\u201d a concept that Moscow used to justify its military intervention on behalf of Russian-speaking rebels in eastern Ukraine. Church property from the czarist era, Mr. Yakunin added, belongs to Russia \u201csimply because this is our history.\u201dThe outreach seems to be working. Unlike the national government in Paris, local leaders in Nice, who mostly represent right-wing forces, support Mr. Putin, even applauding the annexation of Crimea.Andrei Eliseev, the Nice cathedral\u2019s Moscow-educated and multilingual senior priest, denied accusations by his foes in the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community that he works for Russia\u2019s security agency and blamed hostility against him and Moscow on the feuds of old aristocratic families.But he said he nonetheless has a duty to serve the state, explaining that the Russian church has effectively been a government department since Peter the Great took control of religion in the early 18th century.So limited is his room for maneuver, he said, \u201cI need written permission from the state just to move an icon\u201d in the cathedral, which belongs to the Russian government, not the church.With its control of the Nice cathedral secure and work on the new Paris cathedral moving toward completion, Moscow in February turned its sights on a small patch of Orthodox territory still beyond its control \u2014 a cemetery containing the graves of long-dead anti-Communist generals, a former czarist foreign minister, a relative of Russia\u2019s last czar, Nicholas II, and scores of other Orthodox Christians, mostly Russians, who died on the French Riviera.Christian Frizet, a zealously pro-Moscow French engineer, recalled how he went to the cemetery on instructions from the Russian Embassy in Paris and quickly loosened the lock on the iron gate. \u201cIt took me only five minutes and I did not even need a screwdriver,\u201d he said.Helped by Father Eliseev\u2019s assistant at the cathedral, a former Russian military officer, Igor Sheleshko \u2013 who later died in the Nice terror attack \u2014 Mr. Frizet then put up a sign declaring the graveyard property of the Russian Federation and secured the gate with a padlocked chain.Mr. Obolensky and his supporters have since taken down the sign, removed Mr. Frizet\u2019s padlock and replaced it with their own. In a rare truce, it was agreed that each side should have a key.\u201cThey will not stop until they control everything,\u201d Mr. Obolensky said jokingly. \u201cOne day the Promenade des Anglais will be called the Promenade des Russes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cost of Keeping Companies in the United States", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWe need to put aside the politicized allegations that inversions are a way for corporations to cheat the rest of America. This sort of language confuses the issue and obscures a central fact: All of these corporations are owned by shareholders who should, in theory, reap the benefits of a lower corporate tax bill.Unfortunately, in our zeal to keep companies in the United States, we have created policies where inversions benefit some shareholders at the expense of others. Perversely, the inversion rules are more likely to punish American investors and long-term investors to the benefit of senior executives, recent investors and tax-exempt investors, including those overseas.Overall, taxable shareholders lost 1 percent to 3 percent on the value of their shares. This may sound small, but it amounts to around $6 billion in extra taxes for the shareholders. So while inversions reduce the corporate taxes collected by the Treasury, the extra taxes paid by shareholders offset that loss by about 40 percent.Fifteen percent to 20 percent of shareholders in the deals we studied were made worse off from inversion. The anti-inversions tax rules are especially bad for long-term investors who have higher capital gains because they have seen their shares appreciate significantly over the years. For example, investors who bought Pfizer five years ago have had their shares appreciate by 80 percent; investors who bought 25 years ago have seen their shares grow by six times (adjusted for splits).For older Americans who plan to bequeath shares to spouses or heirs, an inversion is especially costly. These individuals end up paying capital gains taxes upon inversion that they would otherwise avoid through a bequest.(The tax cost of an inversion also explains why companies with founders who hold large ownership stakes, like Facebook, would never consider inverting: such a maneuver would require Mark Zuckerberg to cut a $14 billion check to the government to cover the capital gains tax on his shares.)But tax-exempt investors enjoy a nice return from inversion of 4 percent to 7 percent. These include investors in millions of retirement accounts, pensions and endowments across the country, who do not pay taxes when an inversion occurs. Even tax-deferred investors, such as most 401(k) and traditional I.R.A. accounts, are exempt from capital gains taxes.Foreign shareholders also benefit, as the I.R.S.\u2019s special tax rules don\u2019t apply in other countries.There\u2019s a third group that benefits: corporate executives. We found that the chief executive\u2019s wealth increases 3 percent to 4 percent, despite the personal tax consequences of inversion. This is in part because stock options, unlike shares, are not subject to capital gains tax at inversion. In 2004 the government added a tax on pay for executives of inverting companies but the companies began reimbursing their executives for this expense, passing the cost along to shareholders.There are several steps the United States can take to discourage inversions. A lower corporate tax rate and the removal of taxes on foreign earnings would certainly reduce the incentives for companies to leave. If we coupled a lower corporate rate with a reduction in the deductions companies now have, we could maintain the current level of tax revenue while at the same time simplifying the tax code and remaining competitive.First, though, we should abandon the policies that have punished long-term and older taxable American shareholders, while other investors \u2014 foreign, tax-exempt and corporate insiders \u2014 benefit. And the rules have failed in their primary mission of discouraging corporate inversions: Companies worth over half a trillion dollars announced their intention to invert since 2014. In short, we have the worst of policy effects: unintended consequences and no intended ones.Brent Glover is an assistant professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University.

{"Headline": "Ireland to Appeal Tax Ruling in Apple Case", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move comes despite increasing division among Irish ministers over whether to appeal the ruling issued by Europe\u2019s competition authorities.Several lawmakers have questioned such a move, given that the tax penalty is equivalent to what the country pays annually to fund its national health care system. That debate has intensified since Ireland has faced almost a decade of austerity after the financial crisis.Despite the tension, the Irish government unanimously backed the appeal against the tax ruling, though the country\u2019s Parliament will be reconvened on Wednesday to debate the decision.\u201cI believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland\u2019s interests,\u201d Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, said in a statement on Friday.A review of the country\u2019s corporate tax system will also be held to evaluate the complicated structures that multinational companies in Ireland often use to reduce their overall tax obligations. The review, whose details will be outlined in the coming days, will not look at the country\u2019s 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, one of the lowest in the West.\u201cWe need to ensure that Ireland\u2019s corporation tax code meets these new standards while remaining competitive,\u201d Mr. Noonan added, in reference to a push by governments worldwide to crack down on complex practices used by companies to reduce their overall tax payments.Mr. Cook, in an interview with the Irish broadcaster RTE, said Europe\u2019s tax clawback was political motivated, \u201cmaddening\u201d and would be overturned on appeal.\u201cThe finding is wrongheaded,\u201d Mr. Cook told RTE. \u201cIt\u2019s not true: There wasn\u2019t a special deal between Ireland and Apple.\u201dA spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.This week\u2019s ruling over how Ireland treated Apple and its tax practices has led to an increasingly bitter debate between Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top competition official, and those who argue that her agency has overstepped its remit. Many have claimed that the commission does not have the right to review national tax rules, and that it should not retroactively decide on how certain tax practices should work.\u201cAll of us benefit when businesses pay their fair share of tax,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the interest of the individuals and businesses who do pay tax, if others aren\u2019t paying their share.\u201dThe appeals by the Irish government and Apple are expected to last years. Mr. Cook has said the tech giant will set aside money \u2014 based on the calculations of Apple\u2019s back taxes \u2014 in an escrow account if the court eventually sides with the commission.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Whom to Vote For? Employees Tend to Follow Their Leader", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhile Mr. Cook\u2019s role was as a private citizen \u2014 it was not an Apple event \u2014 the message to employees about whom he is supporting for president is clear.The influence of chief executives like Mr. Cook over employees\u2019 political leanings and donations, intentional or not, is substantial: It may not be an overstatement to suggest that a chief executive\u2019s politics may be one of the most significant factors in swaying how employees think about elections.Three business professors set out to examine \u201chow the political preferences of C.E.O.s affect their employees\u2019 campaign contributions and electoral choices.\u201d The results of the study, which looked at eight federal election cycles from 1999 to 2014 and over 2,000 companies, showed a statistically significant correlation among campaign contributions made by the chief and his or her employees as well as voter turnout. The study found that \u201cemployees direct approximately three times more of their campaign contributions to political candidates supported by their firm\u2019s C.E.O. than to otherwise similar candidates.\u201dIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, C.E.O.s and employees donate along similar party lines because they share common values and interest,\u201d think again.The study uncovered patterns that show a chief executive\u2019s influence is profound: \u201cWhen a new C.E.O. contributes to different political candidates from the ones supported by the prior C.E.O., employees tend to follow his/her lead and redirect their donations as well,\u201d wrote the professors, Ilona Babenko of Arizona State University, Viktar Fedaseyeu of Bocconi University in Italy and Song Zhang of the University of Lugano in Switzerland.There is nothing inherently wrong, in most cases, with a chief executive or employee raising money for a particular candidate or party. Mr. Cook, it is worth noting, gives to both sides of the aisle, having just hosted a separate fund-raiser for House Speaker Paul Ryan in June.But the influence of a boss\u2019s political leanings should not be underestimated. \u201cOur evidence indicates that C.E.O.s are a political force, with potentially important implications for firms they manage and for the nature of democracy,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe welfare implications depend both on whether C.E.O.s promote their own political agenda or act in the interests of their firms, and on whether the interests of the firm coincide with the interests of its employees.\u201dStill, the risks \u2013 and complex set of election laws \u2013 make political fund-raising a complicated endeavor for those in the corner office. \u201cThe potentially coercive effect of an employer\u2019s solicitation counsels in favor of avoiding the situation altogether,\u201d said Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the chief of Kalorama Partners, a Washington consulting firm. \u201cThe logical alternative \u2014 having a very strong and clear disclaimer \u2014 doesn\u2019t really work, since many employees might not believe the disclaimer, no matter how strongly it is worded.\u201dTony Fratto, a former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush who now operates a consulting firm, Hamilton Place, took issue with the idea that C.E.O.s should remain outside the political campaign arena.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that some employees feel pressure to align with the C.E.O. politically, but my experience is that in most cases both C.E.O.s and employees are overwhelmingly influenced by a candidate\u2019s views or voting record on industry issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI encourage firms to do more to inform their employees at all levels about what political leaders\u2019 records are on their key policies. I actually think that doesn\u2019t happen enough.\u201dThis election cycle, it seems that many C.E.O.s, especially on Wall Street, have chosen to be less public about whom they are supporting in the presidential race. Perhaps because of the lingering negative memories of the financial crisis or perhaps because this presidential election has turned so decidedly nasty, many executives have stayed on the sideline. In June, Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel, canceled an event at his home for Donald Trump after it was reported to be causing a firestorm among Intel employees and peers in Silicon Valley that felt Mr. Trump\u2019s policies were damaging to the industry. Mr. Krzanich later said he canceled the event because it had turned into a fund-raiser without his approval. \u201cI do not intend to endorse any presidential candidate. We are interested in engaging both campaigns in open dialogue on issues in technology,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.When it comes to presidential politics, some executives privately say they worry they could see reprisals against their business or industry if they were to actively campaign for one candidate or another.\u201cThe risk of being on the record publicly against a politician is high, particularly if that politician may take retaliatory action,\u201d said Brian Richter, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin.Clearly the influence of C.E.O.s and other senior executives\u2019 political preferences on the people working for them deserves more scrutiny. In the meantime, while it is hard to know how individuals will ultimately vote when they pull the lever in November, perhaps a new election polling data point should be the preferences of their bosses.Advertisement"}

SCHOTTWashingtonTo the Editor:Clyde Prestowitz makes a compelling case why the Trans-Pacific Partnership follows the path of old-fashioned trade agreements ill suited to today\u2019s fast-moving economic and political developments.Perhaps this is an opportune time for Mr. Prestowitz and his think-tank colleagues to provide some out-of-the-box thinking as to how the United States can meet the challenges of China and other countries in the arena of increasingly fierce international competition in trade and investment.Clearly, taking many years to formulate a TPP-type agreement and many more years to implement its 5,000-plus pages is seriously out of step in today\u2019s world. EDWARD S. FLORKOSKIOld Saybrook, Conn.The writer is the founder of an international trade consulting company operating in Asia.To the Editor:Although Clyde Prestowitz is correct that the TPP alone won\u2019t stop China, passing it is still in America\u2019s national interest. Not only does the deal have strong environmental and worker protection requirements, but it also builds links with two Muslim nations, Brunei and Malaysia, and Vietnam, an emerging market with a historically complicated relationship with the United States. Amid nativist campaign rhetoric, this agreement shows that America remains engaged with the world.The deal also includes Japan, where there have recently been protests over American military bases in Okinawa. Expanding trade links through this deal can keep public opinion of the United States high in Asia.Mr. Prestowitz points out that the more effective solution to counter China is competing with its international infrastructure financing. But it is difficult for Congress to pass a domestic infrastructure bill, so it seems very unlikely that anyone would use significant political capital for infrastructure spending abroad.Congress should pass the TPP and continue to support the Export-Import Bank.BEN RICHMONDPortland, Ore.To the Editor:As Clyde Prestowitz convincingly argues, the TPP deal will not make trade noticeably freer than it already is, and will not set back Chinese economic ambitions either. Then what is its real point?That can be found in its provisions to allow companies to sue governments in arbitration courts independent of national jurisdictions.In other words, that means a surrender of national sovereignty by the participants (including the United States) in matters of industry regulation, implying, above all, a strong check on future environmental or climate legislation.ADAM KORANYITenafly, N.J.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Moderate Republicans, Unite!", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s Labor Day weekend, the traditional seventh-inning stretch of the presidential campaign. The nine remaining weeks until Election Day will no doubt be filled with moments that will be declared utterly race altering. But they probably won\u2019t be: In nearly every presidential election since 1952, the candidate who led on Labor Day weekend won.So let\u2019s assume for the moment a Hillary Clinton victory on Nov. 8. And let\u2019s assume that the Republicans keep the House. The fate of the Senate almost doesn\u2019t matter, except with respect to Supreme Court justices and other presidential appointees, which is a pretty big except; but as it pertains to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s legislative agenda, a Republican House will be enough to stop it cold.Will there be anything she can do? Maybe, around the margins. She did surprise her Republican colleagues when she was a senator with her earnest efforts at compromise. So maybe there\u2019s a slim ray of hope there.But there is no rational reason to believe the Republicans will do anything but block efforts by Mrs. Clinton to deliver on her big campaign pledges: paid family leave, universal prekindergarten, more affordable college, a higher minimum wage. And, of course, Judicial Watch and other Clinton nemeses will keep the scandal spigot flowing, hoping to reduce public support for her and her programs, making their passage that much harder.I will hope against hope that she can overcome all this. But hope isn\u2019t a strategy. What I\u2019m about to describe to you, however, is a strategy for overcoming this dysfunction. It may not be much help to Mrs. Clinton, but given 15 years or so, it can break our stalemate.The central question here is, why can\u2019t the two sides get along? Or more accurately, why has the Republican Party become so resolutely obstructionist? Yes, the Democrats obstructed President Bush on some matters, and no one on Capitol Hill is a boy (or girl) scout. But Republicans are more unified in their opposition.So let\u2019s return to the question: Why do so many Republicans vote no all the time? It\u2019s partly a matter of belief, sure. But only partly. The real reason is that they fear \u201cbeing primaried,\u201d as they say, from the right.I\u2019ve had a few Democratic lawmakers tell me: You know, Senator so-and-so, he\u2019s not a bad guy, and he understands that we need an infrastructure program, or a climate change plan. But he can\u2019t vote for it. They\u2019ll kill him back home.This is the bottom-line reality; this is where the drain gets blocked. There exist groups, like the Club for Growth, that regularly pour money into a conservative challenger to an incumbent who is seen as betraying the cause. And of course the conservative media apparatus will all jump on board.These challenges rarely succeed, but the mere threat of them keeps people in line. There is one thing incumbent politicians don\u2019t want above all else: a tough re-election fight. And they especially don\u2019t want a primary fight. So why vote for an Obama or Clinton proposal, even if you agree, when you know you will be pulverized for voting yes but will pay no price for voting no?That is the problem. And that\u2019s what we need to change.If the problem is that Republican legislators fear a primary challenge from the right, the solution is to make them fear a challenge from the center. That\u2019s what our political system needs: a Club for Growth of the center.It needs to be an extremely well-funded group that identifies Republican senators and House members who might be vulnerable to challenges from moderates, and groom those moderate candidates. It would funnel them money and staff; it might also back ads against their right-wing opponents. I suppose as a side duty it has to reinvigorate the very idea of moderate Republicanism. Yes, as I said, this will take time.But imagine how different our political situation would be if such a group existed right now, a group whose reach and wrath incumbents feared. We saw a version of this during the summer, when moderate groups helped Roger Marshall unseat Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas in the primaries. And that was Kansas \u2014 hardly a swing state.In fact, the districts in which this group could be competitive are more numerous than you think. The Cook Partisan Voting Index gives all 435 congressional districts a score for partisanship; R+10, for example, indicates an extremely partisan Republican district, although there are some R+30s and a couple of D+40s (Charlie Rangel\u2019s New York district is D+42).But anything at R+5 or lower can fairly be called a comparatively moderate district. For the 114th Congress, Cook listed 64 districts at R+5 or lower. Most of those districts would never elect Democrats \u2014 but they could, conceivably, elect more centrist Republicans.Suppose my group existed now. And suppose this fall it managed to elect 15 to 20 actual moderate Republicans to the House. Right now, it appears that the Democrats might pick up 10 to 20 seats. Put those two together and you have a real chance of building a bipartisan coalition that might be interested in passing some legislation.The same could be true of the Senate. The number of moderate Republicans need not be large to exert an outsize influence. And there are a number of states that right now have pretty conservative Republican senators but might elect more moderate Republicans if they existed and were credible.What would we have, if there were 20 or so genuinely moderate Republicans in the House and seven or eight in the Senate? We\u2019d have a functioning government again.Nothing else that I can see would produce one. There are a few bipartisan groups out there trying to do work that might seem similar to what I\u2019m proposing. But those efforts are largely ineffective. Some focus on electing a centrist, independent presidential candidate; a quixotic and indeed foolish idea, since such a candidate could never win 270 electoral votes and would only split the nonconservative vote, ensuring Republican victory.Others want to unite Democrats, Republicans and independents around some core middle-of-the-road goals. Others, like Defending Main Street, play, well, defense against right-wing challenges. But efforts like those will typically fail because they have no point of leverage over lawmakers. To get somebody to behave the way you want them to behave, you have to have leverage. The threat of a primary is leverage. Nothing else is.So this is what America needs. A few wealthy moderate Republicans \u2014 and for that matter, concerned independents and even Democrats \u2014 who are willing to fight muscle with muscle.This is, again, a long-term project. Moderate Republicanism will take time to resuscitate, and it will likely never re-emerge in the old form from the 1960s and 1970s, embodied by figures like the senators Jacob Javits, Charles Percy and Lowell Weicker. There will be very few pro-choice Republicans in our near-term future, for example.\u201cModerate Republican\u201d needs to be defined a bit more leniently \u2014 just as someone who isn\u2019t too rigidly conservative. It\u2019s less about policy litmus tests and more about a person\u2019s approach to process \u2014 that is, someone willing to go to Washington to compromise and legislate. For now, that\u2019ll be good enough.This new Republican won\u2019t compromise and legislate out of the kindness of her heart. She\u2019ll do it because there is organized pressure on her back home to do so. Because she will fear paying a price for not doing it.Now, I am a liberal Democrat, so you might say, \u201cWell, this is exactly the sort of thing I\u2019d expect a liberal Democrat to propose.\u201d To which I say, au contraire. With my partisan hat on, I prefer the Republican Party as is. True, they bottle up a lot of common-sense initiatives.But at least the presidency is seemingly out of this party\u2019s reach for now. I\u2019ll take that trade-off every day of the week.The Republican Party I\u2019m describing, however, could win the White House. It could be competitive again in a number of states it hasn\u2019t won in 30 years. So I don\u2019t advance this proposal as a partisan. I do so as a citizen.And to those who say this sounds good but is impossible, I offer two rejoinders. First, it seemed impossible in the mid-1950s that far-right conservatives could take over the G.O.P. It took them awhile, but they did it, thoroughly.And second, we are witnessing, right now, millions of Republicans rejecting their party\u2019s extreme presidential candidate, who became the nominee only because he galvanized the hard-right portion of the party\u2019s base. Centrist-leaning Republican voters have never been more frustrated \u2014 and more ripe for organizing. But someone has to do it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Plan: Get Humans to Mars, and Beyond", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUADALAJARA, Mexico \u2014 Elon Musk\u2019s plans to get to Mars start with a really big rocket. He still needs to figure out how to pay for it.For years, Mr. Musk, the billionaire founder of the SpaceX rocket company, has been offering hints and teases of his desire to colonize the big red planet.\u201cWhat you saw there is very close to what we\u2019ll actually build,\u201d Mr. Musk said, referring to the rockets and spacecraft in the video.Mr. Musk estimated it would cost $10 billion to develop the rocket, and he said the first passengers to Mars could take off as soon as 2024 if the plans went off without a hitch. For now, SpaceX is financing development costs of a few tens of millions of dollars a year, but eventually the company would look to some kind of public-private partnership.Each of the SpaceX vehicles would take 100 passengers on the journey to Mars, with trips planned every 26 months, when Earth and Mars pass close to each other. Mr. Musk said the first flights would be \u201cfairly expensive\u201d but ticket prices might eventually fall to between $100,000 and $200,000 a person.To establish a self-sustaining Mars civilization of a million people would take 10,000 flights, with many more to ferry equipment and supplies.\u201cWe\u2019re going to need something quite large to do that,\u201d Mr. Musk said. It would take 40 years to a century before the city on Mars became self-sufficient, he said.The mood at the conference was almost as giddy as a rock concert or the launch of a new Apple product, with people lining up for Mr. Musk\u2019s presentation a couple of hours in advance.Mr. Musk has talked of his \u201cMars Colonial Transporter,\u201d but a couple of weeks ago, he suggested that its capabilities would be much greater.He now calls it the Interplanetary Transport System. The booster would include 42 of SpaceX\u2019s new, more powerful Raptor engines. On Monday, he posted an image on Twitter of the first testing of a Raptor.Mars has long been the goal of Mr. Musk and SpaceX.SpaceX has established a successful business with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket launching satellites, and by taking cargo \u2014 and soon astronauts \u2014 to the International Space Station for NASA. But Mr. Musk has stated often that his loftier goal for SpaceX is to send people to Mars to make humanity a \u201cmultiplanetary species\u201d in order to ensure survival in case some calamity like an asteroid strike befell Earth.The new rocket could be used for even more distant trips, to places like Europa, the icy moon of Jupiter.\u201cThis system really gives you freedom to go anywhere you want in the greater solar system,\u201d he said.What is less clear is how SpaceX will raise the money needed to bring its Mars dreams to fruition. The new rocket is by far the largest ever.Scott Pace, a former NASA official who is the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said Mr. Musk\u2019s vision was plausible technically, but added, \u201cOther than emotional appeal, however, it didn\u2019t really address why governments, corporations or other organizations would fund the effort.\u201d His bottom-line opinion: \u201cPossible, but not probable.\u201dDuring his talk, Mr. Musk put up a slide titled \u201cFunding.\u201d The first item was \u201cSteal underpants,\u201d a joking reference to a \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode. He also listed SpaceX\u2019s businesses \u2014 launching satellites and sending NASA cargo and astronauts to the space station \u2014 and \u201cKickstarter.\u201dBut he admitted that SpaceX would probably not be able to do it alone. \u201cUltimately, this is going to be a huge public-private partnership,\u201d he said.SpaceX has received much of the financing for its rocket development from NASA, from contracts to take cargo to and from the International Space Station. The United States Air Force is providing $33.6 million for development of the Raptor.At a talk here, Robert Meyerson, Blue Origin\u2019s president, said the aim of New Glenn was to take people to space, although it will also be able to launch satellites. The images the company released showed the satellite-carrying version. But Mr. Meyerson disclosed that \u201cthere are other versions that will have a space vehicle on top.\u201dMr. Meyerson said Blue Origin had an even larger rocket, to be called New Armstrong, on the drawing board. Mr. Bezos has said his goal is for millions of people to live in space, although he has not mentioned Mars as a destination.With Mr. Bezos\u2019 Amazon wealth, Blue Origin faces less pressure to be profitable as quickly as SpaceX, or public companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin that have to answer to shareholders.NASA is still talking about its Mars ambitions, too, and its own giant rocket, the Space Launch System, for eventual human missions there. William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said all of the pieces for a crewed Mars mission were in development, at least to reach Mars orbit, by the 2030s and fit within the agency\u2019s existing budget. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a big new budget,\u201d he said.He admitted that in NASA\u2019s plans, astronauts\u2019 setting foot on Mars would take longer, probably not until the 2040s.Mr. Musk was confident that his company could pull off his vision, but he said he would not be among the first colonists, saying he wants to see his children grow up. The chances of dying on that first trip to Mars, he said, are \u201cquite high.\u201dAn article on Sept. 28 about Space X\u2019s plans to send humans to Mars paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Elon Musk, founder of Space X, about the cost of future flights. He said only that initial prices would be fairly expensive \u2014 not that they would initially cost $500,000. (Mr. Musk said the aim would be for ticket prices to fall to less than $200,000.) The article also referred imprecisely to Mr. Musk\u2019s relationship with PayPal when it was acquired by eBay. While he was still a board member and made money from the sale, he was not PayPal\u2019s C.E.O. at the time and he did not sell it to eBay. This correction was delayed because editors did not follow through when the errors were pointed out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why We Should Stop Grading Students on a Curve", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe goal is to fight grade inflation, but the forced curve suffers from two serious flaws. One: It arbitrarily limits the number of students who can excel. If your forced curve allows for only seven A\u2019s, but 10 students have mastered the material, three of them will be unfairly punished. (I\u2019ve found a huge variation in overall performance among the classes I teach.)The more important argument against grade curves is that they create an atmosphere that\u2019s toxic by pitting students against one another. At best, it creates a hypercompetitive culture, and at worst, it sends students the message that the world is a zero-sum game: Your success means my failure.A few years into my teaching career, I set out to change that attitude among my students. I started experimenting with grading schemes that would encourage community and collaboration \u2014 while still maintaining standards and assessing students individually.In fairness, plenty of people believe in the opposite view \u2014 that the world is a zero-sum game \u2014 and that colleges (especially business schools like the one where I teach) should reflect that reality. I understand their view, but as an organizational psychologist, I\u2019ve found that they\u2019re wrong.I began my experiment by writing unusually difficult exams. That was enough to motivate students to study hard. And I introduced a rule: No student will ever be hurt by another student\u2019s grade. After several voiced worries that they would all be hurt, I promised them that I would never curve downward, only upward. If the highest mark was an 83, I would add 17 points to everyone\u2019s score. Now one student\u2019s excellence didn\u2019t hurt another\u2019s grade.But while that removed a level of competition, it didn\u2019t address the bigger goal, which was to make preparing for my exam a team effort. How could I get students to help one another?Four years ago, I found a way. The most difficult section of my final exam was multiple choice. I told the students that they could pick the one question about which they were most unsure, and write down the name of a classmate who might know the answer \u2014 the equivalent of a lifeline on the game show \u201cWho Wants to Be a Millionaire?\u201d If the classmate got it right, they would both earn the points.Essentially, I was trying to build a collaborative culture with a reward system where one person\u2019s success benefited someone else. It was a small offering \u2014 two points on a 120-point exam \u2014 but it made a big difference. More students started studying together in small groups, then the groups started pooling their knowledge.I had been trying to teach this lesson through my research on givers and takers, but it was so much more powerful for them to live it.When students take the time to find out who has expertise, they become smarter at learning. And that\u2019s ultimately what we\u2019re trying to teach, isn\u2019t it? The mark of higher education isn\u2019t the knowledge you accumulate in your head. It\u2019s the skills you gain about how to learn.That year, the scores climbed another 2.4 percent. \u201cYour class has changed the way students work together,\u201d one student wrote to me. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a group of students so willing to help one another succeed.\u201dColleges today are trying to deal with a substantial suicide risk among students and growing rates of depression and anxiety. On my most optimistic days, I wonder whether campus mental health would improve if more classes were designed to encourage participants to support one another. Would students be better off if they saw classmates as people who had their back, rather than as people who might stab them in the back?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where to Live? Ask an App", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySearching for an apartment online has long been limited to plugging in what you can afford and where you think you might want to live and then sifting through dozens of listings. But what if you don\u2019t have a neighborhood in mind? In a city as large as New York, there are probably neighborhoods you\u2019ve never heard of. And even a place you think you know can change character within just a few blocks.So many factors are involved: Is it safe? Are there good schools? Is the subway nearby? Where will I take yoga class? And don\u2019t forget the crucial but less tangible concerns: Will my family be happy here? Will we be welcome?You could end up spending hours researching school test scores, interviewing families at the local playground and besieging your friend\u2019s sister\u2019s cousin with questions about what it\u2019s like to live there.I searched for a two-bedroom for $750,000 in a quiet, green and safe residential neighborhood with restaurants, schools, car parking and a half-hour commute, preferably by subway, from The New York Times, which just happens to be the default address in the office field. In short order the site delivered a top 10 list, with Washington Heights as the No. 1 match, followed by Inwood and Harlem; Longwood and Fordham in the Bronx; Woodside, Queens; East Harlem; and Astoria, Elmhurst, and Maspeth in Queens. I could have clicked \u201cmore neighborhoods\u201d for more results.While some of those places seemed like no-brainers, there were a couple of neighborhoods I would not have considered on my own, like Longwood in the Bronx, an area I have yet to explore. But Maspeth, which lacks a subway, seemed like a stretch. Google Maps estimated the commute by bus and train would take about 50 minutes.Even with all these data points, however, it can be difficult to get a feel for what a neighborhood is like to live in. While StreetAdvisor, which offers neighborhood ratings and reviews from locals, provided some context, some areas, like Longwood, didn\u2019t have any. And some school ratings used by the site were slightly outdated, according to Greatschools.Sarunas Legeckas, a founder of PlaceILive, said the site is working to refine its results and pointed out that if the neighborhoods don\u2019t suit your fancy, you can let the site know by clicking on the X beneath the neighborhood, which will pull up a list of the reasons the neighborhood might not be right for you \u2014 such as it\u2019s too trendy, or not hip enough, or it doesn\u2019t have a great commute.\u201cWe don\u2019t claim all our results are perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a guidance tool to make you think, to make you explore and maybe point you in a new direction \u2014 like looking in Queens instead of Manhattan.\u201d As more users take the quiz and leave feedback, he added, the tool will get smarter.Bushwick, Brooklyn, for example, is described as \u201cfull of converted lofts in old industrial factories, sometimes with great access to outdoor space.\u201d The mood: \u201cEqual parts old-school Hispanic and hipster bohemian, the neighborhood is both a working-class community and the site of much creativity.\u201d Best perk: \u201cSeemingly every week, there\u2019s a new restaurant, bar, or art gallery popping up.\u201d Biggest downside: \u201cVestiges of the poverty from the 70s and 80s remain. Many buildings are rundown and pockets of crime still exist.\u201dWhile there are just 35 searchable neighborhoods compared with the 288 at PlaceILive, StreetEasy\u2019s results are presented in a rich, image-heavy format that may appeal to those less data-inclined.Selecting from StreetEasy\u2019s list of neighborhood characteristics like \u201cpet-friendly\u201d and \u201claid-back\u201d whittles down the number of places. Information on schools, while included in StreetEasy listings pages, is not mentioned in the neighborhood guides given the complexity of school zones, which can vary within a given neighborhood, said Susan Daimler, the general manager of StreetEasy, which is owned by Zillow Group, an online real estate database company.Word of mouth eventually led Mr. Leibowitz\u2019s family to Maplewood, N.J., but the process, he said, \u201cjust seemed so lacking in rigor.\u201d With hundreds of towns outside the city to choose among, all with different commutes, school systems and personalities, he added, \u201cit was hard to make sense of all these variables.\u201dPicketFencer, which Mr. Leibowitz subsequently founded, made its debut last month. New Yorkers looking to move to the suburbs can filter some 600 towns throughout New Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island and Connecticut by commute time, school ratings, affordability or walkability.Selecting a 50-minute commute from New York City, for example, school ratings of at least nine out of 10 and a walkability score of at least 70 of 100 produced nine neighborhoods, including Larchmont in Westchester County, New Hyde Park on Long Island, and Cranford, N.J., in Union County.Social content from Instagram, YouTube, Yelp and Twitter provides a snapshot of the town\u2019s personality. And there are links to descriptive articles from The New York Times and other publications. For more hand-holding, PicketFencer also offers to connect users with a real estate agent.But the site still has a way to go in terms of data context. It wasn\u2019t initially clear, for example, what kind of transportation \u2014 car, train, bus? \u2014 the commute time to New York City is based on or why one town has a walkability score of 70 and another a 90.\u201cWe definitely want to do a better job of that,\u201d Mr. Leibowitz said. Clicking an information icon to the left of the filters, he pointed out, explains that commute time is based on \u201cpublic transportation.\u201dEven with kinks that need working out, such tools help fill an information gap. Real estate agents, citing fair-housing laws that prevent them from steering people to or from certain places based on race, religion, sex, marital status and other categories, tend to sidestep many questions about neighborhoods.\u201cI totally appreciate the intent behind the law,\u201d said Frederick Warburg Peters, the chief executive of Warburg Realty in New York. \u201cBut the intense fear of offending anyone or making anyone feel possibly excluded goes to such lengths that literally we end up being able not to say anything. People ask us, \u2018Are there other young children in the building?\u2019 and we are not supposed to answer.\u201dKara I. Rakowski, a partner at the law firm Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman, said if the online tools are involved with the sale, rental and financing of dwellings, by, say, offering listings or selling advertising to brokerage firms, they could be subject to fair-housing laws. \u201cThe fact that they are providing a service to try to assist people in finding the right neighborhood that fits them is great,\u201d she said, but if the service \u201cis really encouraging or discouraging protected classes from those neighborhoods, that could be an issue for them.\u201dBecause it is a data company and does not sell or rent homes, Mr. Legeckas said PlaceILive is not in violation of fair housing laws. Other sites pointed out that they do not display data about or allow searching by any of the categories protected by fair-housing laws.Some services still rely on the human touch. Alison Bernstein is the founder of Suburban Jungle, a seven-year-old real estate advisory firm that works personally with city dwellers to find the right suburb for their lifestyle.

{"Headline": "U.S. and South Korea to Seek Strong Punishment Over North\u2019s Nuclear Test", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe top American and South Korean envoys on North Korea expressed their resolve during a news conference in Seoul, the South\u2019s capital, on Tuesday, speaking shortly after two nuclear-capable supersonic bombers from the United States Air Force base in Guam streaked over the South in a show of force.The flight by the B-1B bombers demonstrated the United States\u2019 commitment to providing \u201cextended deterrence,\u201d including the threat of using nuclear weapons, to protect the South, said Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, the top American military commander in the country. It was also intended to help counter calls among nationalist politicians and scholars here who contend that the South must arm itself with nuclear weapons.On Tuesday, Sung Kim, Washington\u2019s top official dealing with North Korea, and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Hong-kyun, reiterated that the South did not need to build its own nuclear bombs or to reintroduce American tactical atomic bombs that were withdrawn in the early 1990s.Their intention was \u201cto secure the strongest possible resolution that includes new sanctions as quickly as possible,\u201d Sung Kim said, declining to elaborate on how China, the North\u2019s main ally on the Security Council, would respond. \u201cThe situation requires a swift and strong international response.\u201dKim Hong-kyun said such a resolution would seek to \u201cclose the loopholes\u201d in the existing sanctions as well as to place \u201cpressure on North Korea from all directions so that it will no longer be able to operate normally in the international community.\u201dThe resolution called for inspecting all cargo going in and out of the country, banning all weapons trade and expanding the list of individuals facing sanctions.But critics identified significant loopholes. North Korea was still able to buy oil and sell its coal and iron ore, as long as it was not used to finance the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program \u2014 an activity that would be difficult to prove.The recent statistics on trade between China and North Korea, as well as news reports from their border, indicate that the Chinese still allow a booming network of trade and smuggling across their 870-mile frontier. North Korea is also accused of running fronts based in China or using Chinese middlemen to circumvent the sanctions.The resolution in March also did not affect tens of thousands of North Koreans employed in factories, construction projects and logging camps in Africa, China, the Middle East and Russia. Such workers send home $200 million to $300 million a year, most of which, rights groups contend, ends up in the coffers of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.Washington and Seoul said on Tuesday that they would also try to enforce new bilateral sanctions against North Korea. But both have so few trade and other transactions there that their actions would be largely symbolic, analysts said. President Park Geun-hye of South Korea and her diplomats have been visiting countries in Africa and elsewhere in recent months to persuade them to curtail trade ties with the North, offering weapons and trade deals as incentives.Siegfried S. Hecker, an American nuclear expert at Stanford University, said the latest nuclear test by the North must be viewed with great concern, given what he called its growing ability to secure nuclear bomb fuel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u00adRecreation and Commerce Collide on New York\u2019s Crowded Waterways", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe three siblings, two brothers and their sister, were on a kayaking trip on the Hudson River on Tuesday, celebrating the younger brother\u2019s high school graduation with a sunset paddle.Suddenly, they noticed a boat bearing down on them. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m about to get hit by this ferry,\u2019\u201d said one of the siblings, a 24-year-old woman who asked not to be named because she wanted to protect her privacy. \u201cIt didn\u2019t stop.\u201dThe two were eventually rescued and taken to a hospital, plucked from the Hudson with the other kayakers near 39th Street after a collision with a NY Waterway ferry, the authorities said. Four of the kayakers were injured, two seriously.To many boating experts, the accident was a frightening and almost inevitable consequence of the growing perils on waterways around New York City, where commercial needs and recreational desires are struggling to coexist.Moored along a four-block stretch of shore where the Hudson meets Manhattan are turbocharged tour boats painted green with gaping jaws, hulking ferries, yawing cruise ships, idling tugboats and a conga line of sightseeing craft picking up tourists. Beside the churning piers is a slim wooden building with a plastic kayak hung in place of a sign \u2014 the clubhouse for the Manhattan Kayak Company, which sends kayakers out all summer long, no experience necessary, into what may be some of the busiest currents in the country.The result, just offshore, is a chaos of wakes, close calls and frequent clashes between those who use the city\u2019s rivers as a thoroughfare and those who use them as a playground.\u201cYou have every single marine traffic situation that is known to man, every single day,\u201d said Capt. Frank Crescitelli, who runs fishing charters in New York Harbor aboard the Fin Chaser, a 28-foot twin-engine motorboat. \u201cYou have high-speed ferries of different sizes that have different routes, you have pleasure craft, you have ocean liners, you have commercial dredges. It all exists there.\u201dAnd, he added, \u201cYou see kayak and paddleboard people on the Hudson River with a 3- or 4-knot current at dusk \u2014 it\u2019s insane.\u201dIn a sense, the congestion is a product of extraordinary success: Robust environmental campaigns have made the waters cleaner than they have been in decades, a siren call not just for riders of water scooters and stand-up paddleboarders, but also for an array of city-financed initiatives intended to get New Yorkers rowing or commuting on waterways that still thrum with maritime commerce.Decades ago, the picture was far different. \u201cIt was frankly an open sewer for a large portion of the waterfront,\u201d said Roland Lewis, president and chief executive of the Waterfront Alliance, a coalition that works to protect New York\u2019s waterways and shoreline.Today, there are at least 55 launching points for kayakers across the city, according to the Parks and Recreation Department. A day after the accident, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on Governors Island for a kayak dock. This summer, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan to expand commuter ferry service.Today, on a revitalized river, water scooters play chicken, darting in the wakes of barges, while flimsy single-person craft slip among sailboats and tugboats. The Coast Guard receives about one search-and-rescue call in city waters a day, said Charles Rowe, a spokesman for the service, and the numbers have steadily increased over the past five years. In 2015, the Coast Guard responded to 360 rescue cases in New York Harbor, and 2016 is on track to produce a similar total, Mr. Rowe said.The collision on the Hudson occurred just before 6 p.m. on Tuesday, when the NY Waterway ferry backed out of a slip at Pier 79, striking some of the kayakers who were part of an excursion with Manhattan Kayak. The ship\u2019s captain, whose name has not been released, was unable to see the group because of glare from the sun, the police said. NY Waterway, a private company, said it was complying with the Coast Guard\u2019s investigation.One of the people who were injured, an instructor for the kayaking company, had a punctured lung and a fractured rib, and was still hospitalized, said Eric Stiller, the owner of Manhattan Kayak.The high school graduate, an 18-year-old visiting from Missouri, had a deep cut on his arm and underwent surgery, according to his family.Some people aboard the ferry threw a rope ladder into the water, but the 18-year-old, who was bleeding profusely, could not climb it, said his sister, who lives in New York. He was eventually rescued by a police boat and taken to Bellevue Hospital Center. It is unclear, she said, if he will regain mobility in his arm. \u201cThat gash in his arm could have been any of our heads,\u201d said the sister, who had a cut on her head that required stitches. \u201cIt was very traumatizing.\u201dThe accident has set off a discussion about the need for more order on the water. \u201cWe are of course always working to ensure that the city\u2019s waterways are safe for all New Yorkers,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Blasio said. \u201cWe would be willing to engage with our colleagues at the state and federal level to see if anything can be done to further improve safety.\u201dOn Wednesday morning, Manhattan Kayak\u2019s clubhouse appeared to be closed \u2014 photographs of kayakers with cityscapes in the background hung on the doors. Tours will continue, the owner, Mr. Stiller, said, but the company will re-examine its rules and its routes. The company has operated for 20 years and had never had a collision, he said. The group that was out on Tuesday was part of a class that began at 5 p.m. with a safety check and a brief lesson, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re teachers and trainers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t casually take people on larks. As a group, we\u2019re very upset because it hits us at our core.\u201dBut those who work on the river said it was the seeming ease of paddling in a tiny craft that had enticed the inexperienced to serious waters.\u201cIt\u2019s a super-accessible way to get exposure to the waterways, where there is a really undiscovered part of New York City; there\u2019s a mystique to it,\u201d said Elias Vaisberg, who runs kayak fishing tours out of Staten Island. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve never experienced a 40-knot vessel coming at you with a kayak, that\u2019s a problem.\u201dThe woman who was injured along with her brother said she would be back on the water. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing too extreme about this sport \u2014 kayaking in the Hudson is nothing crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun.\u201dSamantha Schmidt contributed reporting, and Susan C.

{"Headline": "Saad Hariri: Iran Must Stop Meddling in Arab Affairs", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOn Feb. 14, 2005, a massive bomb killed the former prime minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri, my father, along with 22 other Lebanese. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon at The Hague identified five Hezbollah operatives as suspected collaborators in the murder. If proved, that would mean his assassination was carried out by Iran\u2019s allies in Lebanon, who are financed and controlled by the regime in Tehran.Three years later, in 2008, Hezbollah moved to occupy Beirut, and after many years of promising that its vast, Iranian-supplied arsenal was intended only to protect Lebanon from Israel, turned its weapons against the Lebanese people.More recently, Hezbollah has prevented Lebanon from electing a new president and has imposed a devastating gridlock on the country\u2019s government in order to blackmail the citizenry into accepting its demands.Meanwhile, Hezbollah has sent thousands of young Lebanese men to fight and die in Syria to defend the odious regime of Bashar al-Assad, the brutal dictator condemned in the United Nations and around the world for presiding over the deaths of at least a quarter million of his own people. Mr. Assad \u2014 with the help of Iran; its Revolutionary Guards and its proxies; Hezbollah and militias in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 has created the worst refugee problem since World War II, ruthlessly displacing millions of people into neighboring countries and Europe.We Lebanese are all too familiar with the violence, discord, sectarian hatred, brutality and terrorism that Iran and its allies inflict on other countries, whatever Iranian officials might try to claim to the outside world. Iran has been the world\u2019s greatest state sponsor of terrorism since the late 1970s.We have not forgotten the taking of Americans, and other Westerners, as hostages in the 1980s by Iranian proxies in Lebanon. We have not forgotten the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut airport, which killed 241 United States Marines, sailors and soldiers. The amnesia in much of the world about these events, let alone what is happening today in Syria and elsewhere, leaves us dumbfounded.In Syria, the disaster that has befallen its people began when Iran and its allies intervened to prop up the brutal dictatorship of Mr. Assad against a popular, and originally nonviolent and nonsectarian, pro-democracy uprising. The Syrian people were merely asking for the reform of a vicious and corrupt system by a government that rules by brute force. Now Lebanon is overwhelmed by some 1.3 million Syrian refugees driven from their homes by this remorseless regime.The tragedy in Yemen, too, began when the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel militia began its battle against its own people in a coup condemned by the United Nations Security Council. They did this simply to menace and threaten the stability of Saudi Arabia and the other Persian Gulf Arab states.In Iraq, Iran has promoted and funded brutal proxy militias that have spread sectarian hate in the country and are now undermining efforts to defeat the Islamic State.As Lebanon was trying to rebuild its economy after the civil war, Saudi Arabia stepped in with crucial assistance to the Paris conferences for the financial reconstruction of Lebanon, contributing more than $1.5 billion in aid.How many schools and hospitals has Iran built in Lebanon? How much help has it provided for Lebanon to rebuild itself? The answer, of course, is little to none, and any such Iranian aid is structured entirely to the political benefit of Hezbollah.Iran has a unique opportunity to help those who are really fighting extremism in the Arab world. But to do that, it must stop meddling in Arab affairs, from Yemen and Bahrain to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. It must stop feeding Sunni resentment, which only encourages a fringe minority to think terrorism is the answer. And Iran can force militias from Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Iran to leave Syria. That would be a great first step to clear the last tactical hurdle facing those who are really fighting extremism in the Muslim world.Iran can be part of the solution. But it must accept the extended Arab hand, led by Saudi Arabia, for normalized, neighborly relations, allowing Sunni Arabs to get down to the real task of getting rid of extremism.Saad Hariri is a member of the Lebanese Parliament and served as prime minister between 2009 and 2011.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Risks of Suing the Saudis for 9/11", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe legislation would, among other things, amend a 1976 law that grants other countries broad immunity from American lawsuits \u2014 unless the country is on the State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism (Iran, Sudan and Syria) or is alleged to have committed a terrorist attack that killed Americans on United States soil. The new bill would clarify that foreign governments can be held liable for aiding terrorist groups, even if that conduct occurred overseas.Advocates say the measure is narrowly drawn, but administration officials argue that it would apply much more broadly and result in retaliatory actions by other nations. The European Union has warned that if the bill becomes law, other countries could adopt similar legislation defining their own exemptions to sovereign immunity. Because no country is more engaged in the world than the United States \u2014 with military bases, drone operations, intelligence missions and training programs \u2014 the Obama administration fears that Americans could be subject to legal actions abroad.The legislation is motivated by a belief among the 9/11 families that Saudi Arabia played a role in the attacks, because 15 of the 19 hijackers, who were members of Al Qaeda, were Saudis. But the independent American commission that investigated the attacks found no evidence that the Saudi government or senior Saudi officials financed the terrorists.Proponents of the legislation cite two assassination cases in which legal claims were allowed against Chile and Taiwan. Administration officials, however, say that those cases alleged the direct involvement of foreign government agents operating in the United States.The current debate is complicated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is a difficult ally, at odds with the United States over the Iran nuclear deal, a Saudi-led war in Yemen and the war in Syria. It is home of the fundamentalist strand of Islam known as Wahhabism, which has inspired many of the extremists the United States is trying to defeat. But it is also a partner in combating terrorism. The legislation could damage this fraught relationship. Riyadh has already threatened to withdraw billions of dollars in American-based assets to protect them from court action.The desire to assist the Sept. 11 families is understandable, and the bill is expected to become law. The question is, at what cost?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Fight for a National African-American Museum Was Won", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "The doors open soon. To reach that point, the museum had to raise $270 million, navigate Congress and claim land on the nation\u2019s front lawn.Supported byEleven years ago, Lonnie G. Bunch III was a museum director with no museum.No land. No building. Not even a collection.Now all Mr. Bunch and a team of colleagues had to do was find an unprecedented number of private donors willing to finance a public museum. They had to secure hundreds of millions of additional dollars from a Congress, Republican controlled, that had long fought the project.And they had to counter efforts to locate the museum not at the center of Washington\u2019s cultural landscape on the National Mall, but several blocks offstage.A curated walk through the hallways of the newest Smithsonian museum before it opens next week. 13 years in the making, it attempts to depict the pain and pride of the black experience in America.\u201cI knew it was going to be hard, but not how hard it was going to be,\u201d Mr. Bunch, 63, said in an interview last month.In less than three weeks, though, with President Obama presiding, the new museum, a project that once thirsted for money, land and political support, is scheduled to open on the Mall.Visitors to the $540 million building, designed to resemble a three-tiered crown, will encounter the sweeping history of black America from the Middle Passage of slavery to the achievements and complexities of modern black life.But also compelling is the story of how the museum itself came to be through a combination of negotiation, diplomacy, persistence and cunning political instincts.The strategy included an approach that framed the museum as an institution for all Americans, one that depicted the black experience, as Mr. Bunch often puts it, as \u201cthe quintessential American story\u201d of measured progress and remarkable achievement after an ugly period of painful oppression.The tactics included the appointment of Republicans like Laura Bush and Colin L. Powell to the museum\u2019s board to broaden bipartisan support beyond Democratic constituencies, and there were critical efforts to shape the thinking of essential political leaders.Long before its building was complete, for example, the museum staged exhibitions off-site, some on the fraught topics it would confront, such as Thomas Jefferson\u2019s deep involvement with slavery. A Virginia delegation of congressional members was brought through for an early tour of the Jefferson exhibition, which featured a statue of him in front of a semicircular wall marked with 612 names of people he had owned.\u201cI remember being very impacted,\u201d said Eric Cantor, then the House Republican leader, who was part of the delegation.Mr. Bunch said that he hoped the Jefferson exhibition pre-empted criticism by establishing the museum\u2019s bold but balanced approach to difficult material. \u201cSome people were like, \u2018How dare you equate Jefferson with slavery,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut it means that people are going to say, \u2018Of course, that is what they have to do.\u2019\u201dAnd the museum began an exceptional effort to raise money from black donors, not only celebrities, like Michael Jordan ($5 million) and Oprah Winfrey ($21 million), but also churches, sororities and fraternities, which, Mr. Bunch said, had never been asked for big donations before.Nearly three-quarters of the gifts from individuals were from African-Americans. An unusually high amount \u2014 $4 million \u2014 came from average people in gifts of less than $1,000.\u201cWe were able to raise a level of awareness that really galvanized people to make small contributions,\u201d said Kenneth I. Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, who led the capital campaign. \u201cBased on their income level, some of them on a percentage basis were significant.\u201dThe Alfred Street Baptist Church, in Alexandria, Va., donated $1 million to the museum, while three couples who belong to the church gave individual contributions totaling an additional $4 million.\u201cThere is no doubt that we knew you couldn\u2019t build this with African-American money alone,\u201d Mr. Bunch said, \u201cbut we also know that there was much more money in this community than most cultural institutions had ever tapped.\u201dThe idea of a national African-American museum had been hatched more than a century ago by black Civil War veterans. It picked up a bit of steam in Congress in the 1980s, led by Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, who joined the efforts of Mickey Leland, the Texas Democrat.But in 2003, after winning support from Republicans like Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, the museum escaped from the congressional back burner. \u201cThe African-American community has had a particularly difficult road in the United States,\u201d Mr. Brownback, who is now governor of Kansas, said in an interview. \u201cIt was time.\u201d\u201cIt was bad timing,\u201d said Judge Robert L. Wilkins, who led the site-selection committee on a commission that made recommendations to Congress.He and other museum supporters ultimately argued successfully to the Smithsonian\u2019s Board of Regents that a prime location would, among other things, guarantee the most visitors and the most fund-raising success. In 2006, the Regents chose a five-acre site on the Mall near the Washington Monument.Private fund-raising had to be much more of a concern for this federal museum, the 19th in the Smithsonian portfolio. Its predecessors had received public funds for all or most of their building costs. But the legislation that created the African-American museum authorized the government to pay for only half. Mr. Bunch had to raise the other $270 million from private donors.Foundations helped with major gifts, and the museum identified companies likely to give. Some had expressed an interest in diversity or were led by people familiar to the museum\u2019s board. Mr. Bunch made hundreds of trips to meet donors. His pitch: \u201cYou don\u2019t get a chance to build a national museum every day.\u201dThe private money was crucial in securing funds from Congress, officials said. It showed politicians how seriously their constituents were taking the museum. A membership program that has become one of the most popular in the Smithsonian demonstrated public support from individual congressional districts.Also crucial, multiple people said, was the canny persistence of Mr. Bunch, who had intimate experience with Chicago politics and who had honed his skills as a facilitator while president of the historical society there. Those skills helped him when he turned to the byzantine entanglements of the Smithsonian, of Washington and of the federal government.\u201cYou cannot be a director at a place like the Smithsonian without being political,\u201d Mr. Bunch said.He made allies on the Hill before asking them for money. His first supporters were friends from Chicago, like Senator Dick Durbin, and then others, like Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina.\u201cHe has a really good demeanor for a particularly touchy subject in the United States,\u201d said Governor Brownback. \u201cHe needed to have an optimistic outlook. This is not about retribution.\u201dTo maintain fund-raising momentum, the museum tried to exist in some fashion long before the construction materials had even been delivered.Beyond land and money, the new museum needed things to show and a building to show them in. No Smithsonian museum had ever started life without a collection. The museum\u2019s team collected artifacts from around the nation in an \u201cAntiques Roadshow\u201d-style program in 15 cities called \u201cSave Our African American Treasures.\u201d The program yielded many of the 40,000 objects the museum now holds \u2014 3,500 will be exhibited when the building opens \u2014 and elevated the museum\u2019s profile.For the design of their new home, museum officials created a selection committee and displayed the final six plans at the Smithsonian Castle in an effort to be transparent about the process.The winning design, by a team led by the Tanzanian-born British architect David Adjaye, spoke of \u201cuplift, resiliency and spirituality,\u201d Mr. Bunch said, and the bronze color gave the building the symbolism he sought.\u201cI love the notion of a darker building,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s always been a dark presence in America. There have always been African-Americans in this country shaping it whose story gets overlooked or undervalued.\u201dIt was also a vast departure from some of the design proposals he had been sent within days of his appointment as director in 2005. One envisioned a building shaped like a black-power fist, hardly appropriate for the museum he foresaw or that Congress had agreed to finance. He quickly moved on to other options.\u201cI knew what I didn\u2019t want,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Offshore Wind Farms See Promise in Platforms That Float", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORONO, Me. \u2014 The sun was beating down on the leafy campus of the University of Maine one afternoon last month. But inside a hangarlike laboratory, a miniature hurricane was raging.Storm-force gales swept over a deep pool of water, churning waves that, at full scale on the ocean, would have been twice the size of those recorded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.Happily for the researchers, the equipment they were testing, a novel type of floating platform meant to support a wind turbine in open water, remained upright through the maelstrom.True, it was only one fifty-second of the real-world scale. But it was a success as one of many experiments and projects underway worldwide in a similar quest. As clean-energy engineers seek to make offshore wind farms more financially, aesthetically and environmentally viable, they are turning to floating supports to enable wind turbines to move into deeper waters farther from the coast.Right now, almost all offshore wind turbines require fixed platforms built into the seafloor. Floating turbines, with anchors, would mean new flexibility in where wind farms could be placed, with potentially less impact on marine life \u2014 and less opposition from the human neighbors on shore.\u201cLook,\u201d exclaimed Habib Joseph Dagher, executive director of the university\u2019s Advanced Structures and Composites Center here, pointing to a minuscule figure perched on the bobbing deck. \u201cThe water is just reaching his feet.\u201d The Lilliputian plastic platform worker had weathered the storm.The University of Maine testing is part of an elaborate physics experiment meant to simulate conditions that full-scale floating wind turbines could face at an installation being planned about 10 miles off the Maine coast in up to 360 feet of water near tiny Monhegan Island.For nearly 18 months in 2013 and 2014, an operating version of the apparatus \u2014 one-eighth of scale \u2014 sat in the waters off Castine, Me., sending electricity to the grid. That proved the technology fundamentally worked and guided refinements to the design. Now, Dr. Dagher\u2019s team is using the data collected at the lab to confirm the final form, a crucial next step in bringing the technology to market.Meanwhile, energy companies, researchers and government officials are also proceeding with floating technologies adapted from deepwater oil and gas drilling rigs, which use tethers and anchors to moor platforms to the seabed. That could make deeper waters \u2014 like those off the Pacific Coast, around the Hawaiian islands and in the Great Lakes \u2014 accessible for wind-energy development.Statoil, the Norwegian oil and gas giant, is already developing what could become the first commercial-scale floating wind farm, off the coast of Scotland.Trident Winds, a company based in Seattle, is pursuing a federal lease to install about 100 turbines more than 30 miles out from Morro Bay on the central California coast.And the Obama administration recently released an updated offshore wind strategy that identifies the floating structures as important in fighting climate change. More than half of the United States\u2019 potentially capturable offshore wind capacity \u2014 more than what the entire nation can now produce \u2014 is in deeper waters, said Jos\u00e9 Zayas, who directs the Wind Energy Technologies Office at the federal Department of Energy. Mr. Zayas predicts that floating platforms may come to outnumber fixed-foundation installations.The use of floating technologies, proponents say, could help overcome some obstacles that have deterred offshore wind farms.Developers can locate the farms farther out at sea, where they would not be visible from land, and their anchoring mechanisms have a smaller, more flexible footprint than the embedded foundations of conventional wind turbines. That could result in less environmental disturbance and easier transportation and installation.Cost is an obstacle that must be overcome, despite multimillion-dollar grants from the federal government. Floating farms are more expensive to build than land-based ones, and in the early going, at least, would cost more than fixed offshore installations.Ocean wind power, moreover, has had trouble competing with other cheap sources of electricity, including large-scale solar, hydroelectric and natural gas.Principle Power, a multinational company based in Emeryville, Calif., that planned to float five turbines near Oregon in a demonstration project with the help of as much as $47 million from the Department of Energy, could not secure a power purchase agreement because the projected cost of its electricity was considered too expensive.It is now pursuing projects elsewhere in the United States and in France, Portugal, Japan and other European and Asian markets, said Joao Metelo, the company\u2019s chief executive.But advances in the designs are beginning to reduce costs, and there is potential for them to come below those of conventional offshore wind, energy executives say. Fixed-foundation turbines require highly specialized equipment, vessels and installation procedures. In addition, each must be customized to its location, said Irene Rummelhoff, executive vice president for new energy solutions at Statoil.\u201cWith the floating concept, you can use the same turbine everywhere, so you can see the potential for mass production,\u201d Ms. Rummelhoff said.Various types of floating wind platforms are in the works, but two are closest to commercial availability. Statoil\u2019s design, known as Hywind, attaches the turbine to a special buoy that uses a steel cylinder filled with water and rocks as ballast \u2014 a floating structure that extends more than 300 feet beneath the water\u2019s surface.Principle Power\u2019s foundation, known as the WindFloat, sets the turbine atop one of three columns that are partly underwater and connected with a triangular frame.The University of Maine\u2019s prototype, part of a demonstration project called Aqua Ventus that is partly financed by the Department of Energy, is similar to the WindFloat. But Aqua Ventus fixes the turbine on a central concrete pier attached by spokes to three others, a design Dr. Dagher said would make it cheaper to produce. It floats because the concrete contains air.\u201cThe beauty of this is, every 20 years \u2014 which is typically when the turbine reaches the end of its life \u2014 you can tow this back to shore, put a new turbine on and take it back,\u201d he said.The university researchers, who are working in partnership with private companies, have received about $22.7 million in grants from the Energy Department, which in May deemed the demonstration project eligible for as much as $39.9 million more for completion. Dr. Dagher said that if all went well, his team could have two full-scale turbines pumping electricity into the Maine grid in 2019 and larger commercial farms starting construction in the Gulf of Maine by the mid 2020s.Although the project has attracted support throughout the state, it has stirred controversy on Monhegan. The island has a year-round population of about 70 that swells into the thousands over the summer, and its stark beauty has long made it an artists\u2019 haven.The turbines, though about 10 miles from the mainland, will sit less than three miles from Monhegan, interrupting pristine views and lobster fishing operations, opponents say.Supporters point to the potential for cheaper electricity and better internet service through an underwater cable connection from the wind farm to the island. And the local electric company, which labored for years to build its own reliable, independent system, is continuing to work to bring renewable energy to the island.Still, some residents remain wary of connecting to the Aqua Ventus farm because it is a test project with a potentially short life and many uncertainties. Some have even talked of suing to stop the project.But with the federal grant, the project is moving ahead. And that, said Marian Chioffi, the bookkeeper of Monhegan\u2019s electric company, has residents trying to reach consensus on how the island\u2019s energy future should look and what economic gain the project should bring them. The project is required to demonstrate economic benefits for the state.\u201cMonhegan isn\u2019t sure what benefit they wanted,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Chioffi said. \u201cBut if the project is going to go here, they want some sort of benefit out of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Troubles Raise Fear of Global Shock", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Germany\u2019s largest bank appears in danger, sending stock markets worldwide on a wild ride. Yet the biggest source of worry is less about its finances than a vast tangle of unknowns \u2014 not least, whether Europe can muster the will to mount a rescue in the event of an emergency.In short, fears that Europe lacks the cohesion to avoid a financial crisis may be enhancing the threat of one.The immediate source of alarm is the health of Deutsche Bank, whose vast and sprawling operations are entangled with the fates of investment houses from Tokyo to London to New York.Deutsche is staring at a multibillion-dollar fine from the Justice Department for its enthusiastic participation in Wall Street\u2019s festival of toxic mortgage products in the years leading up to financial crisis of 2008. Given Deutsche\u2019s myriad other troubles \u2014 a role in the manipulation of a financial benchmark, claims of trades that violated Russian sanctions and a generalized sense of confusion about its mission \u2014 the American pursuit of a stiff penalty comes at an inopportune time.It heightens the sense that Deutsche \u2014 whose shares have lost more than half their value this year \u2014 needs to secure additional investment, lest it leave itself vulnerable to some new crisis.The biggest worries center on what happens if Deutsche falls apart to the point that it threatens the globe with a financial shock \u2014 and whether new rules and buffers put in place since the last crisis will keep the pain from spreading.Regulations that took effect this year in the European Union standardize how member countries are supposed to handle the potential implosion of a large financial institution. Banks, too, have put aside more money to deal with potential losses.Deutsche could pose the first test of the new arrangement. Recent challenges have underscored concerns about the limits of solidarity in Europe.From the chaos of the sovereign debt crisis to the acrimony over an influx of refugees, European authorities have proved something less than an exemplar of coordinated government action. The European Union has become a focus of populist anger, further constraining options. And Germany has opposed bailouts for lenders in other lands, making a Deutsche rescue politically radioactive.All of which adds to worries that Deutsche amounts to a fire burning, one that might yet become an inferno, while the fire department is consumed with existential arguments over its purpose. If the alarm sounds, no one can be sure what, if anything, will happen.In the worst case \u2014 now highly unlikely \u2014 the bank could collapse, inciting a scramble to pull money from markets around the globe. Institutions that trade with Deutsche would feel an urge to collect their cash immediately. Given the scale of the bank\u2019s balance sheet \u2014 1.8 trillion euros, or more than $2 trillion \u2014 that inclination is likely to spread to every crevice of finance. Economies would grind to a halt. Jobs and fortunes would disappear.Despite murmurings in pundit quarters that this sort of situation may be unfolding, provoking comparisons with the catastrophic bankruptcy of the American investment banking giant Lehman Brothers eight years ago, most economists dismiss such talk as overwrought and overblown.Deutsche is sitting on cash reserves worth \u20ac240 billion, or about $269 billion. It has sold bonds that can be converted to equity should the need arise. The Justice Department\u2019s proposed fine of $14 billion is viewed as the opening of a negotiation that could cost Deutsche a fraction of that amount \u2014 thinking that sent the stock surging on Friday.Not least, Deutsche Bank is a classic example of the species of financial animal known as Too Big To Fail.\u201cWe saw what happened with Lehman,\u201d said Nicola Borri, a finance professor at LUISS, a university in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that the authorities would let something like that happen again. It has ties with all the banks in the world. It is highly leveraged. A disorderly default would be very, very difficult for the entire financial system.\u201dOn both sides of the Atlantic, the financial crisis prompted the construction of new regulatory authorities and requirements that banks set aside more funds in reserve against troubles.\u201cThe system is much more robust and resilient because of the buffers,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research institution in Brussels. \u201cThere are pockets of fragility, but broadly speaking, the system is better prepared.\u201dBut the markets do not appear to fully buy that the defenses are secure.Deutsche is heavily involved in the trading of derivatives, the exotic financial instruments that were at the center of the 2008 crisis. Derivatives can be so mind-bendingly complex that no one fully grasps who owes what to whom until someone big enough to rattle markets suddenly cannot pay.Then, fear takes over, and investors dump holdings indiscriminately. This lowers the value of even solid assets on bank balance sheets, giving rise to further cause for concern.Because Deutsche has been dominated by its investment banking operations \u2014 meaning it is not sitting on a large pile of plain deposits as a cushion \u2014 it is especially vulnerable to such volatility.Fear, in other words, is not just a symptom of trouble but also a cause.A collapse may be exceedingly unlikely. Yet the beginning would probably feel something like recent days.Friday morning, Deutsche\u2019s chief executive officer, John Cryan, released a letter to his staff offering assurances that the bank boasted \u201cstrong fundamentals.\u201d The stock recovered slightly on those comments, but the sense remained that the need for reassurance attested to concerns.The biggest form of insurance against panic is confidence that larger players \u2014 in this case, European authorities \u2014 stand at the ready to mount a rescue, should one be required.But confidence is not something Europe has proved terribly skilled at instilling. Its abilities to marshal a bailout are dubious. New rules introduced to discourage reckless investments by large financial institutions bar taxpayer-financed bailouts.Germany has been adamant that these strictures be applied, rebuffing a recent attempt by the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to secure an exemption allowing him to inject taxpayer money into the Italian banking system. The optics of Germany seeking a way around the rules for its largest lender would be especially problematic.More broadly, Germany has been the most fervent voice that reckless economic pursuits should be punished, no matter the human toll.As Athens has negotiated with European authorities and the International Monetary Fund for a series of bailouts, Germany has demanded deep cuts to Greek public spending, sharply cutting pension payments to retirees. The Greek government used much of the bailout money to pay back debts to German banks.Against this backdrop, a German bailout of its largest bank would reinvigorate accusations that it uses the European Union as a cover to pursue its own national interests.This dynamic has force in the markets, presenting another factor that investors must absorb as the evaluate they risks of holding Deutsche\u2019s debts and shares.\u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t know the reaction of the authorities is a factor of uncertainty,\u201d said Mr. Veron of Bruegel.Here is a feedback loop that amplifies the risks. The likelihood that Deutsche needs a rescue appears small, yet the possibility that a rescue could be forged seems close to nil. That tightens the pressure on Deutsche.And yet Deutsche\u2019s stature may provide the decisive form of insurance. In event of emergency, the authorities might have to act, whatever the politics.\u201cDeutsche Bank is so big and so systemically important that the rules will be bent,\u201d Mr. Borri said. \u201cIf I were an investor, I would assume that the rules would be bent.\u201dFollow Peter S.

{"Headline": "2 Months After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote, Britain\u2019s Push to Leave E.U. Is a Muddle", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than two months later, however, it still cannot say how.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May called cabinet ministers to a brainstorming session about the withdrawal, pledging to examine \u201cthe next steps\u201d for Britain and to identify \u201copportunities that are now open to us as we forge a new role\u201d in the world.However, in ministerial offices, where turf wars have rapidly broken out, advocates of the withdrawal have discovered that four decades of European integration have left Britain so deeply embedded in the 28-nation bloc that there is no easy escape route.British officials currently have neither the expertise nor the staff for the tortuous exit negotiations, which are likely to last at least three years and possibly much longer. Some analysts have even said they might take a decade.But perhaps what they lack most of all is a game plan.Beneath the fog lie fundamental questions about how much economic pain Britain should risk to restore powers to its national Parliament and to curb immigration from the European mainland.For example, ministers must decide whether, to gain the restrictions they want on immigration, they are willing to endanger the health of London\u2019s financial center, which contributes billions in tax revenues, by sacrificing its unfettered access to European markets.The three men do not like one another much and, perhaps mischievously, Mrs. May has instructed them to share the use of Chevening, a 115-room country mansion in Kent, southeast of London, that is normally assigned to the foreign secretary but that is now nicknamed Brexit Towers.Tensions stemming from the turf wars surfaced in a leaked letter in which Mr. Fox asked Mr. Johnson\u2019s Foreign Office to surrender economic diplomacy functions to the Trade Department.Because Britain\u2019s trade deals are currently negotiated by European Union officials, the British government is chronically short on expertise and has had to call in expensive external consultants while starting to recruit its own specialists.In a statement after Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Mrs. May\u2019s office said there was a clear view among ministers that there should be a \u201cunique\u201d deal for Britain, with \u201ccontrols on the numbers of people who come to Britain from Europe but also a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services.\u201dNone of the trading relationships enjoyed by neighbor nations outside the bloc, like Norway, Switzerland or Turkey, seem to fit Britain, suggesting that a tailored trade deal with the European Union \u2014 \u201cenhanced third-country status\u201d in the jargon \u2014 may be the best option.Legally, however, no global deals can be struck until Britain leaves the European Union, a process that will create economic losers at home. As a member of the bloc, Britain has access to Europe\u2019s $19 trillion integrated economy of more than 500 million citizens.Britain also pays into the European Union budget, money that many advocates of withdrawal have argued should be spent at home, particularly on the hard-pressed National Health Service.Supporters of leaving the bloc say that Britain\u2019s economic muscle will allow it to negotiate a better deal. (Mr. Johnson has said that his \u201cpolicy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\u201d) But there is no sign yet that the European Union will breach its principles by allowing Britain full market access without the usual quid pro quos on issues like freedom of movement.One British strategy would be setting political objectives \u2014 like regaining national sovereignty, rejecting free movement and renouncing the right of the European Court of Justice to trump British law \u2014 and fitting the economy around such aims.For the financial sector, a central issue is retaining \u201cpassporting\u201d \u2014 the right that banks and finance companies based in London currently have to offer services throughout the European Union.British businesses, like carmakers, want to avoid export tariffs, and many employers want the flexibility to continue recruiting European workers.\u201cWhat is interesting, is how little Theresa May has said,\u201d said Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIt would be good to get some sense of whether the government wants absolutely no free movement of workers or is willing to accept some free movement; do they want to retain passporting? Is the priority to avoid a situation where there are tariffs on cars?\u201dSome wonder how useful access to the single market would prove in the long run, even if it could be negotiated. That is because Europe\u2019s market is not written in stone but is the sum of various European laws, many of which are updated regularly.For example, the passporting rights prized by London\u2019s financial sector are based on at least nine separate pieces of European legislation, any of which can be amended.When Britain quits the bloc, it will have no vote on how those laws are updated or how new ones are framed, and legislation could easily be skewed to favor competitors in Dublin, Frankfurt, Milan or Paris. That fear has prompted British banks to press for legal agreements to prevent unilateral European changes to any new rules on market access \u2014 a clear sign of the risks they face.\u201cThe single market is dynamic and not static,\u201d said Mr. Grant, adding that countries like France and Germany \u201cwould say, \u2018We will listen to your views, but we will write the rules.\u2019 \u201dOver all, Mr. Grant said that for Britain, \u201cthe trade-offs will be painful, and that\u2019s why the government has said very little: It doesn\u2019t want to admit that it is in a pickle.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2008 Crisis Deepened the Ties Between Clintons and Goldman Sachs", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA blue-ribbon commission had just excoriated Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks for fueling the financial crisis. Prosecutors were investigating whether Goldman had misled investors. The company was a whipping boy for politicians looking to lay blame for the crash.But in spring of 2011, Lloyd C. Blankfein, leading one of the nation\u2019s most reviled companies, found himself onstage with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, one of the nation\u2019s most admired public figures at the time. And Mrs. Clinton had come to praise Goldman Sachs.The State Department, Mrs. Clinton announced that day in an auditorium in its Foggy Bottom headquarters, would throw its weight behind a Goldman philanthropic initiative aimed at encouraging female entrepreneurs around the world \u2014 a program Goldman viewed as central to rehabilitating its reputation.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s blessing \u2014 an important public seal of approval for Goldman at a time when it had few defenders in Washington \u2014 underscored a long-running relationship between one of the country\u2019s most powerful financial firms and one of its most famous political families. Over 20-plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundation\u2019s charitable programs.And in the wake of the worst crash since the Great Depression, as the firm fended off investigations and criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike, the Clintons drew Goldman only closer. Bill Clinton publicly defended the company and leased office space from Goldman for his foundation. Mrs. Clinton, after leaving the State Department, earned $675,000 to deliver three speeches at Goldman events, where she reassured executives that they had an important role to play in the nation\u2019s recovery.The four years between the end of the financial crisis and the start of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s second White House bid revealed a family that viewed Wall Street\u2019s elite as friends and collaborators even as the public viewed them with suspicion and scorn. Those relationships would become a focal point for attacks on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s integrity and independence by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\u201cWall Street now conjures up images of corruption, and if you are a person from Wall Street, you have to overcome that,\u201d said Roy C. Smith, a former Goldman Sachs partner who teaches finance at New York University. \u201cOne of the big rubs against Hillary now is that she was paid by Goldman to give speeches at Goldman.\u201dMrs. Clinton rejects the idea that her loyalties are in doubt. Josh Schwerin, a spokesman, said in a statement on Saturday that Mrs. Clinton was \u201cfighting for tough new rules and more accountability on Wall Street\u201d and to build a more equitable economic system.Goldman\u2019s links to the Clintons date to the 1990s, when Robert E. Rubin, the company\u2019s co-senior partner, left to join President Bill Clinton\u2019s economic policy team. Economically and politically, it was a vastly different era. Mr. Clinton had embraced deficit reduction and balanced budgets, an approach later called \u201cRubinomics\u201d after Mr. Rubin, who became Treasury secretary in 1995.Mr. Trump has unleashed a blizzard of falsehoods, exaggerations and outright lies in the general election. Here's our analysis of 31 untruths from Sept. 15-21.While Wall Street leaned right over all, executives at Goldman gave most of their political contributions to Democrats. Mr. Clinton raised taxes on the wealthy but steered his party to the center on financial issues, helping craft legislation to abolish the Glass-Steagall rules separating commercial and investment banking and exempt some of the products known as derivatives from regulation.\u201cIn the early \u201990s, support from the business community and the financial sector was seen as an important credential for Democrats looking to shed the anti-business label that Republicans had been hanging around their necks,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a top strategist for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly $2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were on-site.And when Mr. Blankfein endorsed Mrs. Clinton in 2007, the campaign proudly promoted his support, releasing a statement in which he called Mrs. Clinton \u201ca strong and experienced leader.\u201dFor Goldman, 10,000 Women became a major philanthropic and public relations success. The program\u2019s events attracted influential figures such as the liberal news media entrepreneur Arianna Huffington, who devoted a section of her Huffington Post to the program\u2019s successes.\u201cI don\u2019t really care why people do good things,\u201d Ms. Huffington said in an interview. \u201cWithout a doubt, thousands of women have been helped by this program.\u201dWhen Mrs. Clinton left the State Department in 2013, she followed her husband into paid speechmaking. If Mrs. Clinton was concerned about the appearance of taking hefty fees from Wall Street while considering a second presidential bid, she did not show it: In her first year on the circuit, more than a third of her paid speeches were for financial companies.Each of her three Goldman speeches were private, and Mrs. Clinton has rebuffed requests to release transcripts of them. And at the time, she still embraced Goldman as a partner. In 2014, she appeared at the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, an offshoot of the Clinton Foundation known as C.G.I., to highlight the 10,000 Women program.\u201cThanks to Goldman Sachs and thanks to 10,000 Women for really shining a bright spotlight on what is possible if you believe in and you provide support to women,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.It would be one of the last times Mrs. Clinton spoke warmly of the company. Within a year, she was running for president and grappling with the anti-Wall Street wave remaking both parties. Amid her primary fight against Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton energetically defended the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and called for even broader regulation of Wall Street.The financial crisis \u201cbasically ended the debate within the Democratic Party,\u201d said Austan Goolsbee, a former Obama economic adviser.Goldman, too, has taken a step back. When C.G.I. held its final conference last week, Goldman sent neither a delegation nor sponsorship cash. Though its employees have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to her campaign, none are among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top bundlers.On CNBC in February, Mr. Blankfein was asked whom he supported in the campaign.\u201cI don\u2019t want to help or hurt anybody,\u201d he demurred, \u201cby giving them an endorsement.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberals See Hillary Clinton\u2019s Focus on Big Donors as Bafflingly Dated", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In 2012, B. Rowe Winecoff, a retired social worker from Newton, Iowa, contributed $120 to President Obama\u2019s re-election campaign. But he has yet to give any money to Hillary Clinton in this election. \u201cThis year just seems dirtier than ever,\u201d said Mr. Winecoff, a Democrat, explaining why he has not contributed to the candidate he intends to vote for.Even as newly released financial disclosures reveal that Mrs. Clinton enjoys a substantial fund-raising advantage over Donald J. Trump, she is struggling to replicate the sort of small-dollar juggernaut that Mr. Obama enjoyed in his campaigns and Senator Bernie Sanders relied on in this year\u2019s Democratic primaries.In an illustration of the lack of enthusiasm for her among some liberal activists, just 24 percent of the contributors to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign so far have given $200 or less. In 2012, 43 percent of the money to Mr. Obama was from contributors who gave $200 or less, and this year 58 percent of the giving to Mr. Sanders\u2019s grass-roots bid came from small-dollar donors.Without this online network, Mrs. Clinton is being made to continue with an aggressive calendar of fund-raisers with rich donors as Election Day grows near \u2014 events that can limit her time in swing states and reinforce concerns that give rank-and-file Democrats pause.\u201cHillary has been at so many fund-raisers and off the campaign trail,\u201d said Mr. Winecoff, bringing up her schedule without prompting. \u201cAnd a lot of money is coming from special interests, so we\u2019re concerned about what that\u2019s going to mean.\u201dSince Labor Day, the traditional start of general election campaigns, Mrs. Clinton has appeared at nine fund-raisers while attending five public events in swing states. And that does not include the multiple money events she was set to attend in California, but instead sent Bill Clinton to after she came down with pneumonia.Mrs. Clinton has tried to meld her need to raise money for advertisements and voter-turnout efforts with her retail campaign. But it can be a stretch. After addressing college students at Temple University this week, for example, she attended a fund-raiser hosted by David L. Cohen, a Comcast executive and Philadelphia Democratic powerhouse, that brought in roughly $3 million. Trying to keep with the day\u2019s theme, college students and young Comcast employees were also invited, to interact with Mrs. Clinton in the kind of rarefied small setting typically reserved for wealthy contributors.\u201cWhat Bernie did in the primary was truly incredible, but we\u2019re very happy with the state of our grass-roots fund-raising,\u201d said Josh Scherwin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, adding that \u201cSeptember is shaping up to be our best month for online fund-raising.\u201dBut the campaign\u2019s traditional approach to raising money is maddening to many Democrats, particularly liberals who have witnessed the evolution of online fund-raising and are baffled at why Mrs. Clinton is so committed to an approach they see as nearly as dated as torchlight parades.\u201cIt boggles my mind that the Clinton campaign didn\u2019t learn their lessons from 2012 or even earlier this year, and haven\u2019t moved toward a more open and public campaign, one that constantly has her in front of real people instead of rich people,\u201d said Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the blog Daily Kos.People who donated to establishment Republican candidates in the primary season are more likely to give money to Hillary Clinton than to Donald J. Trump.He continued: \u201cSanders certainly proved that if you focus all of your energy on the voting public, that core supporters will reward that love with real money. Instead, Clinton\u2019s campaign still seems stuck on the old model of never-ending high-dollar fund-raisers. As a result, she looks secluded and out of reach, further reinforcing the notion that she cares more about the wealthy than regular folks.\u201dThis close to the election, though, Mrs. Clinton may not have much of a choice. Given Democratic fears of Mr. Trump and her advantage in the race, there is an intense demand for her in the ranks of major Democratic givers.\u201cJust trying to find a date has been a challenge,\u201d said James Hodges, a former South Carolina governor who has been trying to organize an event for Mrs. Clinton before the election. Further, the very fund-raising model she is depending on demands a continued stream of events with contribution levels that begin at five figures and often run higher. It is an approach that she and Mr. Clinton are well acquainted with, dating to the 1990s when raising soft money for the national parties was legal.They have enduring relationships with donors in all 50 states going back to those days. So unlike in the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. Sanders, who began as insurgents, necessity has not demanded that Mrs. Clinton raise money any other way. (Mr. Obama ultimately fashioned a network that relied on both modest givers and the wealthy.)\u201cShe\u2019s invested heavily in the infrastructure of human beings: finance directors across the country, photo lines and donor-circle membership,\u201d said Scott Goodstein, the founder of Revolution Messaging, an online Democratic fund-raising firm. \u201cNow they\u2019ve got to play that out. She, unfortunately, made that commitment to do those five house parties or what have you in New York and now she has to stand on that because her bundler network needs it.\u201dMr. Goodstein, whose firm ran Mr. Sanders\u2019s online fund-raising effort, added that \u201cthe mistake that I think they made was not reaching deeper, building deeper infrastructure and a deeper coalition.\u201dInstead, she is relying on the sort of access-oriented fund-raising that is a staple of Washington. And she is not the only one making herself available to major contributors who want to influence policy. This month, for example, Michele Flournoy, who is seen as a favorite to be Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defense secretary, headlined a fund-raiser in defense-industry-rich Northern Virginia where the top contribution requested was $5,000.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s low-dollar fund-raising has picked up in recent months, and over half of the total money she raised last month came through online contributions, according to a campaign aide.And with polls tightening, Democrats expect Mrs. Clinton\u2019s online success to pick up.\u201cUrgency really drives action,\u201d said Mitch Stewart, a veteran of Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns.Yet many in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own party believe she could have done far better had she made Democratic activists feel as invested as the party\u2019s elites.\u201cThe campaigns with the most effective networks of small-dollar donors are the campaigns where small-dollar donors feel their donations matter,\u201d said Ari Rabin-Havt, a SiriusXM radio host who has worked on online fund-raising campaigns for Democrats.Agustin Armendariz, Amy Chozick and Rachel Shorey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Perry, once one of the hedge fund industry\u2019s most successful investors, is shuttering his flagship fund as clients leave after steep losses.His firm, Perry Capital, was founded in 1988 when hedge funds largely were the domain of individuals with vast wealth. It is the latest casualty in a wave of fund closures amid difficult markets and growing investor discontent over high fees and low returns.\u201cThe industry and market headwinds against us have been strong, and the timing for success in our positions too unpredictable,\u201d Mr. Perry, 61, wrote on Monday in a letter to investors. The fund will return a substantial amount of its clients\u2019 capital by the beginning of October, while some harder-to-sell positions will be sold over a longer period, he wrote. These include investments in mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.At its peak, Perry Capital managed $15 billion of investor money.

Last year, however, Perry Capital lost more than 12 percent of its investors\u2019 money, and this year it is down 2.5 percent. The firm shrank to $6.6 billion by the end of last year.Over the firm\u2019s 28 years, it returned an average of about 10 percent a year to investors.\u201cWe are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds,\u201d Daniel S. Loeb, the founder of Third Point, wrote to investors this spring, describing this as a \u201ccatastrophic period\u201d for the industry.The traditional fees hedge funds charge \u2014 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of profits in any year \u2014 also have come under pressure. Some firms have found themselves sitting at the negotiating table with investors who have forced them to lower fees and provide more favorable terms.Mr. Perry, one of many original hedge fund managers to begin his career at Goldman Sachs, founded his hedge fund with Paul Leff.Performance began to suffer at Perry as Mr. Leff and other senior managers left the firm several years ago.Mr. Perry\u2019s firm has been one of the most visible in leading a lawsuit challenging the federal government\u2019s treatment of investors in preferred shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance firms. The government, in return for bailing out Fannie and Freddie during the financial crisis, argued that their private investors were essentially entitled to little or no recovery.Perry Capital and other hedge fund firms have argued that the federal government deprived private investors of billions of dollars in potential profits by taking all of the dividends paid out of by Fannie and Freddie.In his letter, Mr. Perry alluded to the dispute, noting that such longer-term investments \u201cwill take time and energy to successfully realize an appropriate result.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ferrari\u2019s Long Road Back to the Top", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Italian Grand PrixFor Formula One fans, and particularly for Italian ones, there are not enough superlatives in any language to express the importance, the legend, the luster of the Ferrari team.For decades, Formula One\u2019s owners and promoters have acknowledged Ferrari\u2019s special status in the series by giving more of the commercial income to the team, which is the only one to have taken part in every season since the elite racing series began in 1950.Ferrari is a national institution in Italy, and marketing studies have shown that the company, with its distinctive red, black and yellow prancing-horse logo, is among the most recognizable and powerful brands in the world.Clearly, then, Ferrari is as important to Formula One as Formula One is to Ferrari. From its beginning in the 1940s, Enzo Ferrari, the company\u2019s founder, built and sold luxury road cars to finance his racing passion and he used success in racing to sell the road cars. That objective is still true today.\u201cFerrari does not do advertising, and racing is the way of Ferrari to advertise the brand,\u201d said Maurizio Arrivabene, the team director. Yet it is the company\u2019s renown and international status that have always made running a Formula One team more difficult for Ferrari than for other owners. When the Italian team is not winning races or challenging for the title \u2014 which has not often been the case throughout the decades \u2014 there tends to be more pressure on it than on any other team in a similar situation. The same is true where Ferrari\u2019s inner politics and conflicts are concerned. The lowest period in Ferrari\u2019s history was from 1979, when Jody Scheckter won the drivers\u2019 title, to 2000, when Michael Schumacher won it. In between, the team did not win a drivers\u2019 title, though it did take a couple of constructors\u2019 titles in the early 1980s and then the first of six in a row in 1999. Over all, Ferrari has won a total of 224 races. The next highest total in the series is McLaren\u2019s 182 victories.That period at the end of the last century is now remembered as one of poisonous team politics and infighting that ravaged the team. In 1991, Gianni Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat, which owns Ferrari, appointed Luca Cordero di Montezemolo to be the team president. In 1993, di Montezemolo hired Jean Todt as the team director. Todt put an end to the political infighting and set about hiring a dream technical team, including Ross Brawn as the technical director and Rory Byrne as the chief designer. Schumacher joined the team in 1996 after having won his first two drivers\u2019 titles at Benetton, where he had worked with Brawn and Byrne. That Ferrari team would go on to become the strongest in the history of the sport, winning every drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 title for five years in a row, from 2000 to 2004. It was a golden age for Schumacher, Ferrari and Formula One, despite the monotony of the most popular team winning almost every race. The series expanded like never before and reached a level of popularity and financial success never seen by any auto racing series.But little by little, the dream team began to break up. In 2005, Ferrari won just one race. Schumacher, having won a record seven world titles, retired in 2006 and Todt left as team principal after the 2007 season. Meanwhile, despite all the success, Ferrari had been criticized by Italian fans for no longer being an Italian team. Todt, a Frenchman, had been the first non-Italian director of the team, and he had no qualms about hiring the right person for a job, no matter the nationality. So di Montezemolo decided to reintroduce the Italian element to the team.Stefano Domenicali, who had worked at Ferrari since 1991, took over Todt\u2019s job in 2008, and Todt became chief executive and special adviser to Ferrari. (He left those posts the following year to become president of the International Automobile Federation, the sport\u2019s governing body.) Italians were also given several other key jobs at the team, including chief car designer, head of the engine department and technical director.With the organization, mind-set, structure and some of the staff remaining from the triumphant years, Ferrari managed at first to continue winning: There were drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 titles in 2007 and constructors\u2019 title in 2008. Ferrari\u2019s Felipe Massa lost the drivers\u2019 title by one point in 2008 and his teammate Fernando Alonso finished second in 2010, 2012 and 2013. But then in 2014, the team sank to its lowest level in years: It failed to win even a single race for the first time since 1993, when Todt had joined, and it finished fourth in the series.At the end of 2014, Alonso, then 33 and a two-time world champion \u2014 winning in 2005 and 2006, while driving with the Renault team \u2014 left the team to join McLaren, saying he had lost faith in Ferrari\u2019s ability to win the drivers\u2019 title during the years remaining in his career.Alonso\u2019s departure was only one during that year of turmoil. Sergio Marchionne, the new chief executive of Fiat, decided to take a close interest in the team\u2019s operation. Tension between him and di Montezemolo resulted in di Montezemolo\u2019s resignation in September 2014, and Marchionne eventually took over as Ferrari\u2019s president. Domenicali had already left in April 2014. His replacement, Marco Mattiacci, had no experience in racing, having been the head of Ferrari North America. He would last only until the end of the season, when he was replaced by Arrivabene, who had been the head of the Philip Morris company\u2019s sponsorship program for Ferrari and a marketing director all his career. Under Arrivabene, 2015 started well, as Ferrari hired Sebastian Vettel, a four-time drivers\u2019 champion, to replace Alonso as teammate for Kimi Raikkonen, who had won the team\u2019s last title, in 2007, and had rejoined the team in 2014. At the same time, James Allison, technical director since mid-2013, had started putting together a solid technical department. Arrivabene had set two victories as the team\u2019s goal for 2015. Vettel won three \u2014 the only races not won by the Mercedes team. But just when it looked as if the team was set for a resurgence \u2014 2016 was supposed to be the year it hoped to challenge Mercedes for the title \u2014 Ferrari has found itself the third-strongest team, behind Red Bull, and having so far won no races this year. Allison, the technical director and the strongest pillar of the team, quit suddenly in July, and the architect of the engine program, Mattia Binotto, took over. Now, as the team enters the final stretch of the 2016 season, nothing seems to be clear about what the future holds for the most illustrious team in the series. The only certainty is that it has written off hopes of challenging this year. It has begun to focus on building next year\u2019s car, which will have to conform to an entirely different set of technical regulations than the series\u2019 current formula. Ferrari is hoping to restart the race for the title by succeeding with that new formula next year. With the regulations in place since 2014, requiring downsized hybrid engines, it and the other teams, except Mercedes, have failed. And Ferrari, with a need to rebuild from scratch again, is not likely to start winning again quickly. As with all teams in need of rebuilding, it could take two to three years before a new group of engineers begins to jell. But Arrivabene is optimistic.\u201cWe are reorganizing the team, first of all without panicking, because taking that decision means we are clear in mind about what to do with the organization,\u201d he said. Toto Wolff, Arrivabene\u2019s counterpart at the Mercedes team, is not underestimating Ferrari\u2019s ability to bounce back quickly.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can write Ferrari off,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have clearly had a tough time recently.\u201d\u201cThey switched off very early for 2017,\u201d he added, \u201cso never underestimate a team with so many resources and so much passion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At BlackRock, a Wall Street Rock Star\u2019s $5 Trillion Comeback", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Laurence D. Fink, the leader and founder of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, had come home.A Bruin to the bone \u2014 class of 1974 \u2014 he had a story to tell the 5,000 giddy graduates packed into the cavernous basketball arena at the University of California, Los Angeles. Once upon a time he was a rock star on Wall Street. He had big hair and flashed turquoise jewelry, and making money had never seemed so easy.Until it wasn\u2019t.\u201cI screwed up,\u201d Mr. Fink declared, recalling the $100 million he blew thanks to failed mortgage trades in 1986. \u201cAnd it was bad.\u201dFor the graduating millennials, the morality tale resonated not least because it came from a U.C.L.A. grad who had ascended, fallen from and again scaled Wall Street\u2019s treacherous peaks. But it was his description of why he stumbled that truly explained his evolution from down-on-his-luck bond trader to master of a firm that has its eye on a sum about equal to the $16 trillion United States economy.\u201cI had become complacent \u2014 too sure of what I thought I knew,\u201d Mr. Fink said. \u201cI believed I had figured out the market. But I was wrong because while I wasn\u2019t watching, the world had changed.\u201dOver the last decade, no other financial firm has gone further in challenging the classic Wall Street moneymaking model for investment banks and traditional mutual fund companies: Hire \u2014 and handsomely pay \u2014 hotshots to make big bets with other people\u2019s money.The future of finance, Mr. Fink has argued, lies with rules-based, data-driven investment styles such as exchange-traded funds, which track a variety of stock and bond indexes or adhere to a set of financial rules. The idea is that such an approach eliminates at least some of the potential for human error, while lowering costs.It is this notion of using technology to root out investment risks that lies at the heart of BlackRock\u2019s investing strategy. Putting this into practice is the firm\u2019s risk-mitigation platform, Aladdin, which enjoys a ubiquity within the firm \u2014 it tracks everything from bond trades to head count \u2014 that evokes HAL 9000, the sentient computer in the movie \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d Some employees even use Aladdin as a verb, as in, \u201cHas the new portfolio manager been Aladdinized yet?\u201dBut in today\u2019s world of violent price swings and cash-starved markets, those with near infinite buying power \u2014 central banks, sovereign wealth funds and the largest money manager in the land \u2014 have become the new arbiters of flow. \u201cWe have never seen a paradigm shift like this,\u201d said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr., an analyst with the Tabb Group, which analyzes the structure of financial markets. \u201cIt is not about the flow of securities anymore, it is about the flow of information and indications of interest.\u201dBlackRock\u2019s strategy was forged, and ultimately empowered, by two market calamities over the last three decades. The first, of course, was Mr. Fink\u2019s experience at First Boston in 1986, when he bet big on mortgages without assessing how the securities would trade in a period of extreme stress.But BlackRock became the behemoth it is today only after the events of 2008. That is when a souped-up, toxic variety of the securitized mortgages that Mr. Fink helped design years earlier at First Boston imploded \u2014 setting off a chain of bank failures and the deepest global economic downturn since the Great Depression. Chastened investment banks were forced to exit these businesses under pressure from regulators.And in stepped BlackRock. Its assets under management swelled as investors \u2014 starved for higher returns \u2014 piled into the company\u2019s E.T.F.s, which tracked the highflying markets.\u201cThe balance of power is now with firms like BlackRock because they have the \u2018bid,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Perrotta of Tabb, using Wall Street argot to describe the buying power of large asset managers.The power shift was on display this spring, when Mr. Fink took the stage at an investor conference alongside John Cryan, recently charged with reviving the sagging fortunes of Deutsche Bank, one of the global investment firms that was minting money before the markets collapsed in 2008. While the event was billed as a cozy exchange of ideas between two Wall Street heavy-hitters, it played out instead as a series of slightly peevish questions posed by Mr. Cryan to Mr. Fink.\u201cYou are effectively becoming the supplier of liquidity of last resort \u2014 beyond the central banks,\u201d Mr. Cryan said to Mr. Fink.The assertion bordered on the impudent \u2014 suggesting that BlackRock and its $5 trillion stash of assets had become the new guarantor of stability because of its ability to buy and sell stocks and bonds in times of duress. Investment banks, which previously aspired to this duty, have been complaining for years that the financial system has become riskier because BlackRock and similar firms cannot perform such a market-making function.But to say as much to Mr. Fink directly \u2014 and in a room full of investors, no less \u2014 was highly unusual. Mr. Fink was clearly irritated by the query. \u201cWell that is not our role \u2014 we won\u2019t play that role,\u201d he replied stiffly.It was not the most convincing of replies.Over the last 10 years, Mr. Fink has transformed BlackRock from a bond shop catering to pension funds and insurance companies into an asset-gathering machine that uses advanced technology to reimagine how investors buy, sell and assess the risks of a wide variety of securities. Via its $1 trillion-plus in exchange-traded funds, BlackRock has been instrumental in creating newly liquid markets in high-yield and corporate bonds \u2014 a direct attack on the business model of banks like Deutsche Bank.And through its big data-mining risk platform, Aladdin, or Asset Liability and Debt and Derivatives Investment Network, BlackRock says it has developed the market\u2019s most highly evolved framework for stress-testing how securities will respond to certain situations \u2014 such as a sudden rise in interest rates or what happens in the event of a political surprise, like Donald J. Trump being elected president.Staffed by 2,300 of BlackRock\u2019s 13,000 employees, Aladdin promises to help firms trade, analyze and keep a compliant eye on the assets they manage. In an era of severe regulatory scrutiny, the service has become quite popular. Seventy-five firms \u2014 including Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management unit and Freddie Mac \u2014 managing a total of $10 trillion, now use it.Mr. Fink maintains a grueling schedule, mixing regular bicoastal trips in the United States with frequent client jaunts to China and the Middle East. \u201cThis job requires an enormous commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pace is relentless. There will be a day when I wake up one day and say I just can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201dThat day remains well in the future, he says. Still, with BlackRock\u2019s growth in size and sway, the issue of who, if anyone, from within the firm is qualified to succeed Mr. Fink has become an existential question for the company\u2019s board of directors.The problem is typical when replacing a founder: Mr. Fink has increased assets to $5 trillion from zero, and the imprint of his domineering personality has become so profound that virtually anyone will suffer to some degree in comparison, considering his track record.After all, in 1983, he structured one of the first collateral mortgage obligations, and along with Lewis Ranieri at Salomon Brothers made it possible for large investors to enter the market for mortgages. A quarter of a century later, Mr. Fink recognized that the time was right for E.T.F.s and \u2014 in the depths of the financial crisis \u2014 bought Barclays\u2019s iShares business, a deal analysts consider one of the shrewdest in recent Wall Street memory.And beyond a soaring stock price, there are few better ways for a financial chief to command the respect of his peers than to slip through the grasp of regulators. So when Mr. Fink and his high-powered lobbyists in Washington were able to make the case, after the 2008 financial crisis, that major fund companies like BlackRock posed no risks to the markets because of their size, it only added to his aura.That, more or less, is what Mr. Fink told Dexter Senft, his computer expert at First Boston in 1982. \u201cWe are bringing the computer onto the trading floor, Dexter,\u201d Mr. Fink recalls saying at the time. \u201cIf we can do this, it will change our business forever.\u201dNot only would Mr. Fink and his bond wizards be able to sell billions of dollars of new securities, giving birth to today\u2019s market for asset backed mortgages, they could also analyze how these securities would trade in certain situations.The immense losses at First Boston in 1986 taught a lesson that eventually shaped BlackRock. Mr. Fink realized that his clients on the \u201cbuy side\u201d (the fund managers, insurance companies and pension funds shopping for investments) had become dependent on the ability of the \u201csell side\u201d (the Wall Street investment banks) to analyze mortgages. That was because few buy-side clients had invested in computers and technology to the level First Boston had.Most money management firms highlight their investment returns first, and risk controls second. BlackRock has taken a reverse approach: It believes that risk analysis, such as gauging how a security will trade if interest rates go up or down, improves investment results.That is where Aladdin comes in. Aladdin is a network of code, trades, chat, algorithms and predictive models that on any given day can highlight vulnerabilities and opportunities connected to the $15 trillion the firm tracks \u2014 $10 trillion of which belongs to outside firms that pay BlackRock a fee to have access to the platform.Aladdin fills the monitors of most BlackRock employees. One portfolio manager even went so far as to hang a nearly cinema-size screen on his office wall in order to get the full Aladdin experience. And at the company\u2019s investor day in June, Mr. Fink and other top executives mentioned Aladdin 82 times \u2014 more than any other business line \u2014 even though the platform represents just 5 percent of the $11.3 billion in revenues BlackRock took in last year.From Mr. Fink\u2019s early days on Wall Street, his ambition has been stoked by a sense that he has not been receiving the proper credit for his achievements. At First Boston, even though he was among the earliest to popularize trading in mortgage securities, his peers including Mr. Ranieri and others drew more public attention as innovators and moneymakers.As a successful, albeit mostly anonymous, bond manager at BlackRock in the 1990s and 2000s, he saw acclaim, pay and influence go to the chief executives of Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. That began changing only in 2009, when he bought Barclays\u2019s E.T.F. business. Last year he was among a small circle of Wall Street executives to attend the state dinner at the White House for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.A part of Mr. Fink \u2014 a fervent Democrat today \u2014 believes he would make a pretty good Treasury secretary, say people who have discussed politics with him. Although he recently persuaded Cheryl Mills, one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest advisers, to join the board of BlackRock, the view is fairly strongly held that if Mrs. Clinton becomes president, there is little chance that she will tap a Wall Street insider for the Treasury job.With BlackRock\u2019s stock having more than doubled since 2011, far outpacing the likes of Goldman and JPMorgan and trading close to its record high, it seems that the market has come around to Mr. Fink\u2019s financial worldview: that a low cost, systematic style of investing will, over time, grow faster than the costlier \u201cactive investing\u201d model in which individuals, not algorithms, make stock, bond and asset allocation decisions.And the numbers in that regard are arresting. Through July, E.T.F.s and traditional index funds made up 30 percent of total mutual fund assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, a ratio that has doubled in just under 10 years.Of course, with close to $1.5 trillion in actively managed funds, Mr. Fink is not ready to write off a segment of the industry that even after years of outflows clocks in at $11 trillion. And he underlines the importance of being able to offer the best of both active and passive investing styles to BlackRock clients.But inside the firm and out, there is little doubt that he is betting the ranch on E.T.F.s and similarly themed investments choices. These include so-called factor strategies, in which a bet is made on a certain investment outcome \u2014 like value stocks outpacing growth stocks, or a basket of low-volatility equities beating the broader indexes.In San Francisco, a team of equity investors deploys data analysis to study the language that a chief executive uses during an earnings call. Does he seem unusually bearish this quarter, compared with last? If so, maybe the stock is a sell.\u201cWe have more information than anyone,\u201d Mr. Fink said.Some analysts, in fact, argue that BlackRock should be valued as a technology company, as opposed to an asset manager.Mark Wiedman, 45, a BlackRock executive who is on the short list to succeed Mr. Fink, believes that bond E.T.F.s, in particular, are creating a liquid market where a new generation of bond investors can freely buy and sell.For years, he and Mr. Fink have been pitching insurance companies and pension funds to stop buying individual bonds (from the likes of Deutsche Bank) and instead choose a BlackRock bond E.T.F. Now it\u2019s happening.\u201cI think of E.T.F.s as technology,\u201d Mr. Wiedman said, as he leaned back in a swivel chair in his office. \u201cIt is a product that bundles up a bunch of securities, puts them on a screen and makes them easier to trade.\u201dLike many top executives here, Mr. Wiedman can get a bit manic when discussing the subject: Midway through an interview, he felt the need to somewhat violently undo his tie and cast it aside.Regulators are less enthusiastic. Global watchdogs like the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund have described these bountiful flows into and out of BlackRock bond E.T.F.s as a liquidity illusion. Which means, according to Ken Monaghan, an investor in high-yielding corporate bonds, that easy-to-trade E.T.F.s have lured \u201ctourist\u201d investors \u2014 people seduced by the rich yields, but who may not be able to stomach a sustained market reversal.And if they all leave at once, watch out.\u201cE.T.F.s do not create liquidity,\u201d said Mr. Monaghan, of the global fund manager Amundi Smith Breeden. \u201cThese new investors are not permanent.\u201dAside from Mr. Wiedman of BlackRock, the short list to succeed Mr. Fink includes Robert S. Kapito, 59, a founding partner and current president of the firm who is seen as the top choice if a handover occurs sooner rather than later. Other candidates are Rob Goldstein, the 42-year-old chief operating officer and driving force behind Aladdin\u2019s growth; Mark McCombe, 50, a former HSBC executive who looks after the firm\u2019s big clients; Rich Kushel, 50, who oversees multi-asset investment strategies for clients; and Gary Shedlin, 52, the chief financial officer. There is also Mark Wiseman, a new hire who joined the firm this month to oversee its equity business.It is a long list, and purposely so. For Mr. Fink, recommending a successor to his board is probably the weightiest decision he will make as BlackRock chief. He has taken pains to not tip his hand. \u201cI want to make sure that the day after I leave, the firm is better off without me,\u201d he said.This spring, Mr. Fink called together more than 100 of the firm\u2019s most senior executives for two days of meetings in Barcelona, Spain. BlackRock was approaching its 30th anniversary and Mr. Fink was in a nostalgic mood. Yet there was an edge to his remarks.Yes, BlackRock was thriving because of its focus on low-risk, low-cost funds and the all-seeing wonders of Aladdin. But now was not the time to coast.Nor was this a time to sit fat and happy on a big pile of assets and let the fees roll in, an indirect slap at actively managed giants such as Franklin Templeton and Pimco, where assets under management have recently been declining.Never before, he said, had the fund management industry been so competitive and changing. \u201cIf you think you know everything about our business, you are kidding yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest question we have to answer is: \u2018Are we developing the right leaders?\u2019\u201dAnd then, looking out over the striving BlackRock executives gathered before him, he put it to them directly. \u201cAre you,\u201d he asked, \u201cprepared to be one of those leaders?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Sour Surprise for Public Pensions: Two Sets of Books", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen one of the tiniest pension funds imaginable \u2014 for Citrus Pest Control District No. 2, serving just six people in California \u2014 decided last year to convert itself to a 401(k) plan, it seemed like a no-brainer.After all, the little fund held far more money than it needed, according to its official numbers from California\u2019s renowned public pension system, Calpers.Except it really didn\u2019t.In fact, it was significantly underfunded. Suddenly Calpers began demanding a payment of more than half a million dollars.\u201cMy board was somewhat shocked,\u201d said Larry Houser, the general manager of the pest control district, whose workers tame the bugs and blights that threaten their corner of California citrus country. It is just a few miles down the road from Joshua Tree National Park.It turns out that Calpers, which managed the little pension plan, keeps two sets of books: the officially stated numbers, and another set that reflects the \u201cmarket value\u201d of the pensions that people have earned. The second number is not publicly disclosed. And it typically paints a much more troubling picture, according to people who follow the money.The crisis at Citrus Pest Control District No. 2 illuminates a profound debate now sweeping the American public pension system. It is pitting specialist against specialist \u2014 this year in the rarefied confines of the American Academy of Actuaries, not far from the White House, the elite professionals who crunch pension numbers for a living came close to blows over this very issue.But more important, it raises serious concerns that governments nationwide do not know the true condition of the pension funds they are responsible for. That exposes millions of people, including retired public workers, local taxpayers and municipal bond buyers \u2014 who are often retirees themselves \u2014 to risks they have no way of knowing about.\u201cOne of the first things I think you should do is publish that number for every city,\u201d said William F. Sharpe, professor emeritus of finance at Stanford University\u2019s Graduate School of Business who won the Nobel in economic science in 1990 for his work on how the markets price financial instruments. He is also a California resident who voluntarily helped his city, Carmel-by-the-Sea, crack the secret pension code \u2014 figuring out the market value of its debt to its retirees in 2011 before Calpers resolved to start divulging the information later that year.\u201cWe just about nailed it, which made us feel very good for ourselves \u2014 but very bad for the city,\u201d Professor Sharpe said. On a market basis, the city turned out to be $48 million short of what it owed retirees, or four times what the official numbers showed.The two competing ways of valuing a pension fund are often called the actuarial approach (which is geared toward helping employers plan stable annual budgets, as opposed to measuring assets and liabilities), and the market approach, which reflects more hard-nosed math.The market value of a pension reflects the full cost today of providing a steady, guaranteed income for life \u2014 and it\u2019s large. Alarmingly large, in fact. This is one reason most states and cities don\u2019t let the market numbers see the light of day.But in recent years, even the more modest actuarial numbers have been growing, as populations age and many public workers retire. In California, some struggling local governments now doubt they can really afford their pension plans, and have told Calpers they want out.In response, Calpers has calculated the heretofore unknown market value of their pension promises \u2014 and told them that\u2019s the price of leaving, payable immediately. Few have that much cash, so it\u2019s welcome to the Hotel California: You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.Calpers says it must bill departing governments for every penny their pensions could possibly cost because once they cash out, Calpers has no way of going back and getting more money from them if something goes wrong. Calpers keeps that money in a separate \u201ctermination pool.\u201dThings went differently for Citrus Pest Control District No. 2. It withdrew first, before realizing the shortfall. Then, four months later, it got the unexpected bill from Calpers.\u201cI was opening the mail and thinking, \u2018Can this be right?\u2019 I thought they put an extra zero on it,\u201d said Tim Hoesterey, one of the district\u2019s two employees.The bill came just as the district was building up a war chest to fight a virulent new citrus blight, a disease that had already devastated groves in Florida. The directors had armed themselves by raising a growers\u2019 tax per acre fivefold. Suddenly, paying Calpers would wipe out the whole citrus blight reserve.Some wondered if they should just declare bankruptcy.\u201cThere are people selling their farms, trying to get out of the business, because they can\u2019t make a profit anymore,\u201d Mr. Hoesterey said. He called Calpers to see if the district could get a break, an extended due date, or even stay with Calpers after all. Calpers said no. It was a done deal.A Calpers spokeswoman, Amy Morgan, said such questions suggested \u201ca misunderstanding of the purpose of Calpers.\u201d\u201cCalpers does not exist to make money,\u201d she said. \u201cCalpers exists to fully pay out benefits that are promised to its members.\u201d She said the law required Calpers to perform a complete valuation after the termination date had passed, and to recover all the money needed to ensure that the retirees would be paid in full.The market-based numbers are \u201cclose to the truth of the liability,\u201d Professor Sharpe said. But most elected officials want the smaller numbers, and actuaries provide what their clients want. \u201cSomebody just should have stopped this whole charade,\u201d he said.For years, people have been trying to do just that. In 2003, the Society of Actuaries, a respected professional body, devoted most of its annual meeting to what was called \u201cthe Great Controversy\u201d \u2014 the notion that the actuarial standards for pensions were fundamentally flawed, causing systemic underfunding and setting up a slow-moving train wreck when baby boomers retired. It drew a standing-room-only crowd.The problem reaches far beyond pensions, and into the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market. The reason is that municipal bond ratings take into account the strength (or weakness) of government pension plans. If those numbers have been consistently wrong, as dissidents argued, then actuaries were helping mislead the investors buying municipal bonds.Arguably, the flawed standards worsened the problem with each passing year: Actuarial values determine the annual contributions that states and local governments make to their pension plans, so if the target numbers are too low, the contributions will always be too small. Shortfalls will be compounding, invisibly.Much of the debate surrounded the routine practice of translating future pension payments into today\u2019s dollars, which is called discounting. The tiny pension plan at Citrus Pest Control District No. 2 shows clearly what the problem is.With everybody either retired, or about to be (Mr. Houser will retire later this year), there is no guesswork in determining everybody\u2019s pensions. The actuaries at Calpers project each of the future monthly payments due to Mr. Houser and the other five retirees, assuming they will live to age 90. (Mr. Hoesterey is not included because his retirement benefit is the new 401(k) plan.) Then, they translate all those future payments into today\u2019s dollars with a rate \u2014 often called a discount rate. This is exactly how a lender would calculate a home mortgage.The problem is, which rate should be used? An economist would say the right rate for Calpers is the one for a risk-free bond, like a Treasury bond, because public pensions in California are guaranteed by the state and therefore risk-free. And that\u2019s what Calpers does when it calculates market values. It used 2.56 percent when it calculated the bill for the pest control district, producing a $447,000 shortfall.But the rest of the time, Calpers and virtually all other public pension funds use their assumed annual rate of return on assets, now generally around 7.5 percent. Presto: This makes a pension appear to have a much smaller liability \u2014 or even a surplus.That was the case with the pest control district for years. And since there seemed to be a surplus, Calpers said the district owed no annual contributions. Calpers\u2019s numbers hid it, but the six members\u2019 pensions were going unfunded.\u201cEvery economist who has looked at this has said, \u2018It\u2019s crazy to use what you expect to earn on assets to discount a guaranteed promise you have made. That\u2019s nuts!\u2019\u201d Professor Sharpe said.But what he calls crazy is enshrined in the actuarial standards. And since adhering to the standards makes public pensions look affordable, there is a powerful incentive to preserve those standards.Mr. Gold was also a ringleader of that stormy professional meeting in 2003. Since then, there have been more conferences, monographs, speeches, blue-ribbon panels and recommendations \u2014 to say nothing of an unusual spate of municipal bankruptcies and insolvencies in which ailing pension plans have played starring roles. And yet little has changed.Even as Citrus Pest Control District No. 2 was scrambling to find the cash to pay its unexpected bill this year, another fight broke out within the American Academy of Actuaries, which represents the profession in Washington, over the same issues.An academy task force had commissioned a paper on how financial economists would measure public pensions. But during the peer review process, the opus was spiked, the task force disbanded and the four authors \u2014 Mr. Gold among them \u2014 barred from publishing the work elsewhere.Professor Sharpe noted that Calpers\u2019s market-based method was \u201cvirtually the precise approach advocated in this paper.\u201dAlmost, but not entirely.At Citrus Pest Control District No. 2, Mr. Hoesterey said Calpers added a final twist. It took so long to calculate the district\u2019s final payment that the bill arrived four months after the district\u2019s withdrawal date \u2014 and then it charged four months\u2019 interest, at 7.5 percent, on the late payment.Ms. Morgan, the spokeswoman, said the four-month lag was \u201cunfortunate but unavoidable.\u201dMr. Hoesterey said Calpers should have warned the district well in advance how big the bill might be, to give it time to find the money. \u201cI kept asking: \u2018Does this seem fair to you? What other organization conducts business like this?\u2019\u201d he said.Seeing no way out, the district paid the whole thing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Scenes With Shimon Peres", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI was on my way to Afghanistan in 2013 when I received a call from my editor asking me to stop in Jerusalem and photograph Shimon Peres, who was about to celebrate his 90th birthday.The difficulty of photographing a world leader is to see past his carefully curated persona in order to reveal a more intimate portrait.Mr. Peres, then the president of Israel, evoked both the weight and levity of accumulated wisdom. Whether in the sanctuary of his official residence or among the throng of admirers vying for his ear at an endless stream of public appearances, he possessed the grandeur of a man who had spent his life making history.His schedule was relentless. I began photographing him one day just after dawn. In the quiet of the morning, he adjusted his tie, pushed on his cuff links as he fielded phone calls, and sat down to work methodically on a speech.Despite his long list of accomplishments over seven decades in politics, he was humble and industrious, sharp and focused.His age meant that he had outlived many of his friends, colleagues and family members. Experience had taught him that regrets were futile. As he was whisked from an elementary school to a tech conference to a wedding, he appeared to hover above the frenzy.Before his death at 93, Mr. Peres served as Israel\u2019s defense minister, finance minister and transportation minister, and twice as prime minister. When I met him, he was six years into a seven-year term as president.I have spent most of my career covering strife and suffering in the Middle East and Africa. And at the end of the day with Shimon Peres, I wondered whether anyone could ever have enough power or wisdom to bring peace to the region.A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s first prime minister, Mr. Peres was the last of the nation\u2019s founders still in office in 2013. He stretched the largely ceremonial contours of the presidency by speaking out on the urgency of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and against a unilateral Israeli attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.His public career paralleled the development of the modern state of Israel. \u201cI never dreamed we should be eight million people,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2013. \u201cI never knew that there will be more Hebrew-speaking people than, say, Danish-speaking people.\u201d\u201cFor me, work is not tiring but enjoying,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like vacations. I think this is another invention which is foolish. I see a person sitting on the shore of the sea with a dog, I say, \u2018My God, what is he doing there?\u2019 He can better read. He can better think.\u201dWhen his term ended in 2014, Mr. Peres moved from the presidential residence to a modest apartment he owns in Tel Aviv and continued to promote his ideas on medical research, teaching English in Israeli kindergartens and providing free food for children until age 3.\u201cWhen did civilizations start?\u201d he asked while adjusting his tie before a meeting during my 2013 visit. \u201cWhen a very primitive instrument was introduced: the mirror. Before the mirror, people didn\u2019t comb their hair, didn\u2019t cut their nails. With a mirror, everybody washes himself any morning, without any order from the government.\u201dAt the wedding of the daughter of the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Mr. Peres posed with the family for pictures and left immediately after the ceremony.Mr. Peres then spoke at a technology conference. In his interview with The Times, he lauded Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, for making \u201ca revolution without revolutionaries, a revolution without bloodshed.\u201dAsked whether he regretted his early support for Israeli settlements or ordering the assassination of a Palestinian master bomb-maker, Mr. Peres said: \u201cThe past for sure is unchangeable, so what can I do with my regrets? I\u2019m trying to mobilize all my energies to understand what is next.\u201dOf the myriad public positions he held over the years, Mr. Peres told The Times that his favorite was among his first: director general of the Defense Ministry in the 1950s.\u201cTo end poverty,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to do a very simple thing: to teach the children English, which is a global language. Otherwise, you will remain provincial. Poverty is immobility, and when you have another language, you can move.\u201dIn the interview, he described the 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, with whom he had quarreled publicly, as \u201ca personal tragedy,\u201d adding, \u201cTwo persons are more than two when they are together; one person is less than one when he loses his colleague.\u201dMr. Peres often found himself offering condolences or delivering eulogies for friends and colleagues, many of them younger than he was. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reason to celebrate,\u201d he said of his then-approaching birthday. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day, you know, because it means that I\u2019m a year older.\u201d\u201cHere, I\u2019m alone on Fridays and on Saturdays, so I have time to read, I have time to think,\u201d Mr. Peres said. \u201cI decided to make my loneliness an advantage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But not too good.\u201cIt confirms that the economy is performing well, but does not provide the threat of overheating that might have caused an interest-rate increase sooner rather than later,\u201d said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust.Republicans and Democrats mined the report for evidence that supported the economic arguments they will make through the November election. How to handle a recovery that has delivered steady but less than spectacular growth has not only been a flash point among Fed bankers \u2014 who will next meet on Sept. 20 and 21 \u2014 but also between the presidential candidates Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton.\u201cThe latest economic numbers from the past day paint a bleak picture,\u201d said Curtis Ellis, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump.At the same time, Democrats have pointed to the positive signs in the overall economy, highlighting sturdy job growth in the private sector that has lasted a record 78 months, and a low jobless rate.Some economists say that a recovery as modest and uneven as this one would normally add to the problems for the incumbent political party, but the unorthodox nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy could help Mrs. Clinton overcome the odds.\u201cA kind of ho-hum status quo economy might not have been good enough for Clinton against a normal Republican candidate,\u201d Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, said. \u201cBut against Trump maybe it will be enough.\u201dThe jobless rate, based on a separate survey of households, stayed at 4.9 percent, roughly half of what it was seven years ago, and consumer spending remains healthy. But a broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged and underemployed workers is nearly twice that figure.Wages have only recently begun to climb. The 12-month increase was a modest 2.4 percent in August, slower than in the previous month but a pace that keeps most workers ahead of inflation.Earlier, monthly job gains flip-flopped, plummeting to 24,000 in May and swelling to more than 10 times that number in June and July.As Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez said, \u201cSometimes the porridge is really hot; sometimes the porridge is really cold; this one is in between.\u201dEconomists, who estimate that the nation needs about 100,000 new jobs every month to keep up with population growth, say it is natural for the jobs machine to slow as the pool of unemployed workers gradually dries up.Still, large numbers of prime-age workers remain out of the labor market altogether, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots and depressing wage gains.\u201cA lot of people are still on the bench that could come into the labor market,\u201d said Ken Esch, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC, an accounting and consulting network. \u201cUntil more people are participating, I don\u2019t see the inflationary pressures, and our data says we don\u2019t expect to see much over the next 12 months.\u201d\u201cThe tide has begun to turn,\u201d William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said when the report was released. \u201cFor the first time in quite a while, we are seeing gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide.\u201dIn his view, older workers who were able to delay retirement when the recession hit did so, blocking more junior employees from moving up the pipeline. That clog is finally beginning to clear.\u201cThat leads me to the conclusion that it is not caused by technology but is a result of institutional and policy choices we\u2019ve made as a country,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cFor women, we do very little to subsidize child care or make workplaces flexible. When it comes to men, we spend very little money to train people for jobs or find jobs.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter:@PatcohenNYTAlan Rappeport contributed to this article.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada to Join China-Led Bank, Signaling Readiness to Bolster Ties", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Canada said on Wednesday that it had applied to join China\u2019s version of the World Bank, breaking with previous leaders who had shared United States officials\u2019 skepticism of the new Beijing-led lender.The move came during a five-day trip to China by the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, who is seeking to burnish trade, business and political ties with Beijing. China\u2019s relationship with the previous Canadian government had been lukewarm.The previous Canadian government, led by Stephen Harper, hesitated in joining the bank, saying that it wanted to ensure that the institution\u2019s financial and environmental standards were sound. The Obama administration expressed similar reservations, and during the genesis of the bank, it advised several allies, including Australia and South Korea, not to join.Both countries eventually ignored Washington and became founding members of the bank that is intended to both compete and cooperate with existing lending institutions. Britain also broke with the United States over the new bank and became an inaugural member along with France, Germany and Italy.American officials have since softened their criticism and have encouraged the Chinese to finance projects with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank as a way of ensuring what they consider acceptable standards of environmental and lending practices.Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Li Keqiang, China\u2019s premier, said that the case would be looked at according to Chinese law and that Mr. Garratt would be treated humanely.For Canada, joining the bank could help strengthen its relationship with a country that is increasingly important to its economy. \u201cCanada\u2019s membership will create commercial opportunities for Canadian companies and create jobs for the middle class,\u201d said Canada\u2019s finance minister, Bill Morneau, at a news conference with the bank\u2019s president, Jin Liqun.Mr. Jin said he interpreted Canada\u2019s application for membership as a \u201cvote of confidence.\u201d Canada is a leader in environmental matters and had a record as a \u201cclean\u201d government, attributes that match the bank\u2019s efforts to be \u201clean, green and clean,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have zero tolerance of corruption,\u201d he said.Mr. Jin acknowledged that one of the bank\u2019s five vice presidents, Hong Kyttack, a former finance official in South Korea, had taken a six-month leave after allegations that he had been negligent in giving loans to Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering during his tenure at the Korean Development Bank.Mr. Hong had served as the chief risk officer for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the bank was now seeking a replacement, Mr. Jin said.The bank said Canada and other new members are expected to join early next year.Advertisement"}

The richest person that year among all three branches of the United States government, Representative Darrell Issa of California, would only rank as the 166th richest if he were a Chinese lawmaker.\u201cFor reasons that don\u2019t make sense to outsiders given the \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 nature of the N.P.C., membership in any honorary body is coveted by people who see it as a mark of social status, something to add to their resumes,\u201d said Suzanne Pepper, a scholar based in Hong Kong who studies Chinese elections.Many of the expelled delegates are executives of private businesses or leaders of state-owned companies, rather than career politicians and military officers \u2014 who are also well represented on the body.The vote-buying scandal in Liaoning has been brewing for at least five years, with hundreds of officials and lawmakers in its provincial bodies accused of engaging in the bribery, according to a report in Caixin, a well-regarded Chinese newsmagazine. The report, posted online on Tuesday, has since been taken off the internet.In 2013, in the southern province of Hunan, 56 provincial lawmakers in one city had offered more 110 million renminbi, or $16.5 million, in vote-related bribes to lower-ranking officials there, Xinhua reported at the time.Delegates to the National People\u2019s Congress are elected for five-year terms. The current term began in 2013.News that China faced new accusations of election fraud has drawn some tart comments on social media from people who are not accustomed to what for some in other countries can be an all-consuming obsession with following electoral politics. Usually, Chinese audiences read about elections in other countries.\u201cWhen I saw the news about the vote buying scandal in Liaoning, I was shocked,\u201d wrote one user on Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like social media platform. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there were elections in the motherland!\u201dKiki Zhao and Owen Guo in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sheldon Adelson Focuses on Congressional Races, Despite Donald Trump\u2019s Pleas", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon G. Adelson and his wife are giving more than $40 million to groups backing Republican congressional candidates, according to campaign filings and interviews with Republican strategists, disregarding repeated entreaties for support from allies of Donald J. Trump and dealing a major setback to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to rally the deepest-pocketed Republican givers.The Adelson family\u2019s biggest contributions are going instead to two \u201csuper PACs\u201d backing Senate and House Republicans, each of which will get $20 million, making Mr. Adelson the single largest known donor to political organizations in the country. Mr. Adelson also gave $1.5 million in August to a super PAC backing Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire.Mr. Trump is already raising far less money directly for his campaign than Mrs. Clinton is raising for hers, taking in $42 million in August compared with her $59 million. Now he is also heading toward Nov. 8 with relatively limited financial help from super PACs and outside groups that can accept unlimited contributions from rich donors.Groups supporting Mr. Trump have aired just $12 million in broadcast advertising, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies, buoyed by a sharp increase in giving by wealthy liberals on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, are expected to spend at least $160 million by Election Day.\u201cIf you want to help that Senate candidate or that gubernatorial candidate, the best way we could have done it was to nominate any of the other people who were running,\u201d said Douglas Heye, a former adviser to House Republicans. \u201cThat\u2019s not the reality of the world right now. The best way to do that now is to help that campaign directly.\u201dTwo Republicans with knowledge of his giving said that Mr. Adelson was allocating a far smaller sum, $5 million, to benefit the top of the Republican ticket: token support by Mr. Adelson\u2019s standards. And in a striking move, the money will go not to any of the pro-Trump super PACs but to organizations controlled by a fellow billionaire, Joe Ricketts, a Wyoming investor, whose own political operation will decide how to spend it. The Ricketts family spent millions of dollars during the primaries to defeat Mr. Trump, who responded with a Twitter message that the Rickettses \u201cbetter be careful, they have a lot to hide!\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Adelson declined to comment.\u201cEveryone reached out to him. He promised $100 million,\u201d said Ed Rollins, an adviser to Great America, one of several outside groups supporting Mr. Trump. \u201cAt this point in time, he\u2019s like everyone else. Now he\u2019s going to be a player, just not to the same extent.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s efforts have been hampered in part by confusion: There are at least three competing super PACs supporting him. One is controlled and chiefly funded by the New York billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer, who have close ties to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign team.Two others, Great America PAC and Rebuild America Now, are controlled by rival teams of consultants, but each has received a blessing of sorts from the Trump family. Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric appeared at a fund-raiser this month for Great America, while another son, Donald Jr., was the special guest at an event for Rebuild America Now less than a week later.While Mr. Trump has enjoyed success for a Republican presidential candidate in raising small contributions, the same qualities that have fired up his grass-roots supporters have turned off many wealthier Republican contributors, making it difficult for both Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee to keep pace among larger donors.People who donated to establishment Republican candidates in the primary season are more likely to give money to Hillary Clinton than to Donald J. Trump.But in the months since, Mr. Trump has shrugged off private pleas from Mr. Adelson and others within his party to modulate his tone and message against Mrs. Clinton. Those issues came to a head at a meeting this month of major conservative donors convened by the billionaire hedge fund executive Paul Singer, a resolute Trump opponent who has opined that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign proposals would cause a \u201cwidespread global depression\u201d if enacted.Representatives of the Ricketts family, the Senate Leadership Fund and Americans for Prosperity, the political organization overseen by the billionaire industrialists David H. and Charles G. Koch, were among those pitching donors at the meeting. So was the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, who told donors that he needed to raise another $60 million to $70 million to support the party and Mr. Trump through Nov. 8.According to a person who attended, Mr. Priebus urged donors to view the Republican slate as a package and argued that supporting Mr. Trump would help down-ballot races.But the Kochs\u2019 political organization, backed by an overlapping group of large conservative donors, is so far steering clear of the presidential race and focusing its efforts on the House and Senate. And some of the top Republican donors in the country have now, like Mr. Adelson, given to the Koch organization or the Senate Leadership Fund, according to Tuesday\u2019s filings. These donors include Mr. Singer, the Chicago hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, and a company controlled by Frank L. VanderSloot, a prominent Idaho businessman.Mr. Adelson\u2019s $5 million will go to yet another group, called Future45, which was set up and funded last year by the Ricketts family, Mr. Singer and Mr. Griffin to test lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton.Future45 and a sister nonprofit group, now being run solely by Mr. Ricketts\u2019s team, are hoping to raise more than $25 million. The Ricketts family has provided $1 million, according to a Republican strategist involved in the effort. The hope is that a round of fall advertising aimed at Mrs. Clinton could help soften her support in states that also feature competitive House and Senate races, aiding Republican candidates in those contests. The Wall Street Journal first reported details of the group\u2019s new direction on Tuesday.\u201cThe Ricketts are committed to helping Republicans win up and down the ballot this fall, including Trump/Pence, and every other Republican candidate up and down the ballot,\u201d said Brian Baker, a spokesman for the family.Mr. Adelson, whose fortune is estimated at almost $32 billion, could easily afford to spend more for Mr. Trump in the weeks ahead. But Mr. Adelson and other donors are rapidly running out of time to have an effect on the race. Even his contributions to Republican congressional efforts are coming late in the game, when the price of advertising is climbing drastically and there are fewer undecided voters to persuade. In part to mitigate those costs, the Senate Leadership Fund reserved $40 million in fall advertising in June, before the cash was available to pay for it.Democratic groups, meanwhile, are enjoying success in persuading rich donors and unions to pour money into super PACs, bolstered by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s warm relationships with wealthy donors in her party.Through the start of September, according to Federal Election Commission filings, the lead pro-Clinton group, Priorities USA Action, had raised $13 million from S. Donald Sussman, a wealthy financier, and $9.5 million from the retired hedge fund billionaire George Soros. S. Daniel Abraham, the billionaire founder of SlimFast, has contributed $9 million to the group. The entertainment executive Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, have contributed $10 million, according to federal records.Other outside Democratic groups are also intensifying their efforts for the final weeks before the election, focusing on grass-roots outreach rather than television advertising.Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist, said in an interview on Tuesday that he was pouring another $15 million into For Our Future, a joint super PAC he is running with several labor unions. The group is spending money in seven swing states, chiefly on field organizing and voter mobilization. It aims to knock on eight million doors between now and the election.\u201cWe believe that that form of communication is the way to actually engage people,\u201d Mr. Steyer said.Rachel Shorey, Nick Corasaniti and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Swiss Open Criminal Investigation of Franz Beckenbauer", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 Franz Beckenbauer, one of German soccer\u2019s most famed players and managers, is one of four top officials under investigation for fraud and other offenses related to Germany\u2019s bid to host the 2006 World Cup, the Switzerland attorney general\u2019s office said Thursday.The Swiss investigators are focusing on a payment of 6.7 million euros ($7.5 million) by the German Football Federation, known by its German acronym D.F.B., that was intended to finance a gala staged as part of the country\u2019s efforts to host the World Cup.Along with Mr. Beckenbauer, who was the head of the organizing committee for the World Cup bid, the attorney general\u2019s office said it was also investigating Horst Schmidt, the committee\u2019s vice president; Theo Zwanziger, a former president of the D.F.B. and former member of the governing council of FIFA; and Wolfgang Niersbach, a current member of FIFA\u2019s ruling council.In addition to fraud, the four men are suspected of money laundering, criminal mismanagement and misappropriation, the Swiss attorney general\u2019s office said. \u201cThe presumption of innocence applies to all four,\u201d it added.In October, Mr. Beckenbauer acknowledged a \u201cmistake\u201d in relation to the World Cup bid, but he denied that there had been any corrupt payments to buy votes.The statement continued: \u201cThis was presumably done by the use of false pretenses or concealment of the truth, thus inducing the other committee members to act in a manner that caused D.F.B. a financial loss.\u201dSwitzerland had jurisdiction in the case because payments linked to the transaction involved bank accounts and individuals located there, said Andre Marty, a spokesman for the prosecutor\u2019s office.That report found no evidence of vote buying in the bidding process, but said that it could not be ruled out. The report also said that it had identified payments whose purpose was unclear that linked Mr. Beckenbauer; the former FIFA president Sepp Blatter; Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the late former chief executive of the German sportswear giant Adidas; and Mohamed bin Hammam, a Qatari member of FIFA\u2019s executive council who was barred from soccer for life in 2012.Advertisement"}

The biggest beneficiaries were Florida, which has taken in close to $3.5 million, and Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have each received more than $2 million.In each of those states, the funds from the national party have made a difference, erasing deficits in federal contributions against the respective Republican state parties.Because there are no limits on how much money party committees can transfer to one another, most of the state parties have cycled their share back to the Democratic National Committee. The party then moved the cash into a smaller number of battleground states to prepare for Election Day.Get the latest national and state polls on the presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.The effect is a legal end-run around contribution limits, allowing wealthy donors to give far more than $5,400 to help Mrs. Clinton where she needs it the most.While both parties have used joint fund-raising arrangements for years, the decision issued two years ago in the McCutcheon case made it easier to raise and concentrate even more money from the same small group of wealthy donors.Democrats also castigated the court, arguing that it had paved the way for the wealthiest donors to further dominate campaign giving.\u201cWith the rate the Supreme Court is going, there will only be three or four people in the whole country that have to finance our entire political system,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said during an appearance in Oregon the week after the McCutcheon decision.Mrs. Clinton was no doubt exaggerating for effect. Still, the actual numbers are striking: Just 250 donors have accounted for about $44 million in contributions to the Hillary Victory Fund during the last year.Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said that Mrs. Clinton continued to support new restrictions on campaign money, but that the only way to achieve them was to elect more Democrats who shared her views.\u201cHillary Clinton has fought for campaign finance reform her entire career and, as president, will make it a priority to restore the role of everyday voters in elections,\u201d Mr. Schwerin said, \u201cbut the stakes of this election are too high to unilaterally disarm.\u201dBy contrast, the money raised by Mr. Trump and the Republicans, while robust, has been driven chiefly by small checks from his grass-roots supporters.And the Republicans have not been as shrewd at maximizing whatever money Mr. Trump\u2019s large-dollar fund-raisers have contributed. More of the Republican big-donor money is being directed into national party accounts that cannot be spent directly on the election.Only one Republican state organization, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, had received any cash through August, according to Federal Election Commission records.

{"Headline": "By Taking Back Money, Wells Fargo\u2019s Board Seems to Recall Its Role", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameAs John G. Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, prepares to face a congressional tribunal on Thursday for the second time in two weeks, questions are intensifying about the bank\u2019s sham accounts scandal and its lethargic response to it.And late Tuesday, with the focus of the criticism spreading from the bank\u2019s chief executive to its board, the company\u2019s directors took action. Announcing an investigation into the bank\u2019s sales practices, the board said Mr. Stumpf would forfeit approximately $41 million worth of stock awards, forgo his salary during the inquiry and receive no bonus for 2016.The Wells Fargo board also announced the immediate retirement of Carrie L. Tolstedt, the former senior executive vice president of community banking, who ran the unit where the fake accounts were created. She will forfeit $19 million in stock grants, will receive neither a bonus for this year nor a severance, and will be denied certain enhancements in retirement pay, the board said.These actions by the Wells Fargo board, while welcome, were slow in coming.A corporate board has many duties, but three of the most crucial are at the center of the Wells Fargo mess. One is to assess the risks inherent in the company\u2019s business and handle them before they develop into a crisis. Another is to dispense compensation that does not encourage bad behavior. And finally, a board must monitor a company\u2019s culture, from top to bottom.The Wells Fargo board has disappointed in all three.\u201cUnfortunately, it appears that the bank\u2019s response was to view the problem as employee misconduct and to fire people as opposed to looking at the supervisory chain and culture,\u201d said Sheila C. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who is now president of Washington College in Chestertown, Md. \u201cCulture and tone at the top are exactly what the board should be looking at.\u201dI asked Mary Eshet, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, to respond to Ms. Bair\u2019s criticism. She declined and said the company had no comment on the board\u2019s discussions.The Wells Fargo culture is under attack for good reason. For years, the bank pressed its employees to open as many different types of accounts as possible, whether or not their customers needed them, rewarding workers who complied with promotions and bonuses and punishing those who did not. The push for these accounts was so intense and relentless that some bank employees forged customers\u2019 signatures on new accounts to make sales quotas.Mr. Stumpf acknowledged in testimony before the Senate last week that Wells Fargo officials knew about the practice far longer than they had initially stated.It is troubling, given the nature of the scandal and the bank\u2019s failure to correct it, that two Wells Fargo directors are former financial regulators with extensive experience in consumer banking. One is Elizabeth A. Duke, a member of the Federal Reserve Board from 2008 to 2013. She served as chairwoman of the Fed\u2019s committee on consumer and community affairs and also sat on its bank supervision and regulation committee. Ms. Duke joined Wells Fargo\u2019s board in 2015 and is a member of the bank\u2019s credit, finance and risk committees.In its proxy filing, Wells Fargo cited Ms. Duke\u2019s \u201cinsight and a unique understanding of risks and opportunities that contribute important risk management experience to the board.\u201dCynthia H. Milligan is the other former bank regulator on the Wells Fargo board. A member since 1992, Ms. Milligan was director of banking and finance for the State of Nebraska from 1987 until 1991, responsible for supervising several hundred banks and other financial institutions, the bank said.Neither director would speak to me for this article.From the outside looking in, the composition of the Wells Fargo board seems to check all the right boxes. Its 15 members include top corporate executives, former high-ranking United States government officials, an accounting expert and an academic. All are paid well for their work. Last year, directors earned from $279,000 to $402,000.As is the case at many large companies, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Stumpf, is also its board chairman. In that role, he made recommendations on pay to the human resources committee charged with setting compensation for his top lieutenants.During the last three years, Ms. Tolstedt received compensation worth over $27 million, according to Wells Fargo\u2019s proxy statement. She stepped down in July and was scheduled to retire at the end of the year. That process was accelerated on Tuesday.Claiming that he was not an expert in compensation, he said the Wells Fargo board and its human resources committee would make that decision independently. \u201cI\u2019m not part of that process,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that\u2019s a very independent process and nothing that I would say would prejudice their deliberative process.\u201dBut Brian T. Foley, a compensation consultant in White Plains, pointed out that Wells Fargo\u2019s proxy filings clearly state Mr. Stumpf\u2019s direct role in the committee\u2019s incentive pay decisions. Last year\u2019s filing stated that for four top executives at the bank, including Ms. Tolstedt, the committee considered \u201cthe recommendations of Mr. Stumpf based on his assessment of their respective 2015 performance,\u201d among other things.Asked about this discrepancy, Ms. Eshet, the Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement: \u201cThe current situation involving the board\u2019s consideration of potential recovery of compensation is different, and Mr. Stumpf did not want to bias that process. He believes it is appropriate for the human resources committee and the board to first consider that issue independently. If the board asks his view during their process, he will of course share it.\u201dStill, by punting the decision to the committee, Mr. Foley said, Mr. Stumpf showed zero leadership. \u201cStumpf is saying, \u2018I have no involvement in assessing the situation,\u2019 but he\u2019s been doing it year in, year out,\u201d Mr. Foley said in an interview. \u201cI would have expected him to have not only apologized but to have said, \u2018I\u2019m not taking a bonus this year, and I\u2019m going to urge the board to be very careful about paying bonuses to any executive officer who knew about the activities or should have known.\u2019\u201dSome of that happened on Tuesday.Since the financial crisis of 2008, it has become clear that a bank\u2019s compensation practices can pose enormous risks if they reward improper behavior. Wells Fargo\u2019s proxy says as much. It noted that the human resources committee meets each year with the company\u2019s chief risk officer \u201cto review and assess any risks posed by our enterprise incentive compensation programs,\u201d the company said.Still, this meeting did not appear to pick up the risks associated with the unauthorized account openings at Wells Fargo.Ms. Bair said one reason for this lapse may have been a communication breakdown between the risk committee of the Wells Fargo board and its human resources committee. \u201cCompensation drives behavior, but was the risk committee ever briefed on compensation?\u201d Ms. Bair asked. \u201cFor any risk committee to do their job, they really have to understand compensation issues.\u201dIn recent years, some shareholders have tried to force Wells Fargo to hire an independent board chairman, contending that the dual role held by Mr. Stumpf assigns too much power to him.Companies whose chief executives also preside over their boards argue that having a lead independent director achieves the necessary balance of power. Wells Fargo made just such a pitch to shareholders at its annual meeting in April when they voted on a proposal requiring the company to engage an independent chairman. The bank\u2019s lead independent director is Stephen W. Sanger, a former chairman and chief executive of General Mills.Contending that its governance structure \u201cis working effectively\u201d and citing Mr. Sanger\u2019s role, Wells Fargo urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. The company was persuasive \u2014 the proposal garnered support of only 17.2 percent of votes cast.Depending upon how the board handles the current difficulties, though, such a vote could have a different outcome next year.It\u2019s doubtful that anyone on the Wells Fargo board welcomes the spotlight that is now trained on it. After all, corporate boards rarely have to answer for their actions or inaction. Clearly, the Wells Fargo board has some \u2019splaining to do. And the sooner it realizes that, the better.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Visa Program Up for Renewal Amid Allegations of Fraud", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A contentious visa program that allows wealthy foreigners to obtain a green card by investing in economic development projects will expire at the end of this month unless Congress acts to extend it.But the program has been marred by fraud and used to build large projects in wealthier areas like Manhattan and the Las Vegas Strip instead of high-unemployment or rural areas. Federal investigators have also discovered that attempts to infiltrate the program were made by people with possible ties to Chinese and Iranian intelligence, and that international fugitives who laundered money in their home countries gained citizenship through the program.Mr. Stenger announced in a statement this month that he had reached a settlement with the federal government. The case against Mr. Quiros is pending.Critics of the EB-5 program, like Senators Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, see reauthorization of the program as an opportunity to fix problems with how the money is used, increase oversight and address national security issues. They sent a letter on Thursday to Senate leaders opposing reauthorization of the program without a significant overhaul.\u201cThe program has become plagued by fraud and abuse and, if not reformed, it should be allowed to expire on September 30th,\u201d they wrote.\u201cThere is a need for more oversight and transparency,\u201d said Ronald R. Fieldstone, a Miami lawyer who has been involved in using EB-5 funding for development projects. \u201cIf there is no independence in the administering and the distribution of the funds, it exposes the program to instances of fraud.\u201dBut Mr. Grassley and Mr. Leahy say other changes are needed.The program, which was created in 1990, has expanded well beyond its original intent, they say. EB-5 requires an investment in either a rural area or a \u201ctargeted employment area,\u201d which is defined as an urban area with an unemployment rate of at least 150 percent of the national average.But Mr. Grassley and Mr. Leahy said developers had broadly defined these areas by adding a few low-income communities to wealthier neighborhoods so they could use EB-5 funding to build luxury condos, convention centers and hotels, amounting to what the senators said was economic gerrymandering.Angelique Brunner, owner of a Washington-based center that raises capital through the EB-5 program, said many of the examples that critics point to as EB-5 investments in upscale areas failed to note that the program helped transform places that were previously economically depressed.\u201cOne of the challenges of EB-5 investment is that people look at what an area looks like after the investment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince them what it looked like before.\u201dThe EB-5 program has grown rapidly. About 10,000 visas are awarded annually, primarily to wealthy Chinese citizens, who make up about 80 percent of the investors and see the program as an easier way to gain United States citizenship for themselves and their families.Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the EB-5 program has sent a terrible message to millions of immigrants waiting their turn to enter the United States through normal channels. A number of other members of Congress echo her concerns, in large part because while most visa applicants must meet education or work requirements, the primary requirement for the EB-5 program is a \u201clawful source of investment income,\u201d as a Homeland Security memo put it.Lawmakers have not said when they would take up the EB-5 reauthorization. Last year, the program was extended as part of the omnibus spending bill.An article on Monday about the EB-5 visa program referred incorrectly to one aspect of the process. The program allows foreign investors to gain permanent residency when they invest between $500,000 and $1 million in a business that creates 10 jobs directly or indirectly. They do not gain citizenship by doing so. (They can apply for full citizenship after five years.) The article also referred incorrectly to Angelique Brunner, a spokeswoman for the EB-5 Investment Coalition, which is made up of investors and developers. Ms. Brunner is the owner of a Washington-based center that raises capital through the EB-5 program; she is not a developer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Fiscal Affairs Will Be Overseen by 7 Experts in Finance and Law", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe White House said it had chosen seven experts in finance and the law to supervise Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal affairs in the coming months under a law enacted this summer intended to help the island restructure its $72 billion debt.Four of the supervisory board members are Republicans and three are Democrats, chosen from lists provided to the White House by the party leaders of both houses of Congress. And four of the members are Puerto Ricans, which is three more than required under the new debt-restructuring law.The Republicans named to the board are:\u25a0 Andrew G. Biggs, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\u25a0 Jos\u00e9 B. Carri\u00f3n III, president of Hub International, an insurance brokerage in Puerto Rico.\u25a0 Carlos M. Garc\u00eda, founder and chief executive of BayBoston Managers, a private equity firm.\u25a0 David A. Skeel Jr., a University of Pennsylvania law professor with expertise in bankruptcy.The new debt relief law is stirring colonial resentment, as Puerto Rican officials denounced the \u201cjunta\u201d \u2014 or federal control board \u2014 that will soon direct this island\u2019s failing governance and finances.The Democrats are:\u25a0 Arthur J. Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the New York University School of Law and a former chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\u25a0 Jos\u00e9 Ramon Gonz\u00e1lez, president and chief executive of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.\u25a0 Ana J. Matosantos, president of Matosantos Consulting and a former director of the California Department of Finance.In addition, the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, will hold a position on the board. He is not seeking a second term as governor, so whoever is elected to succeed him in November will take his seat on the board.\u201cThese officials have the breadth and depth of knowledge that is needed to tackle this complex challenge,\u201d President Obama said in a statement on Wednesday.The board was created as part of a new legal framework to shelter Puerto Rico from creditor lawsuits while it seeks to reduce its debt as its financial crisis intensifies. The law was necessary because federal law prohibits Puerto Rico from entering bankruptcy, which is what mainland cities and counties could do in similarly dire straits. It gives the island some restructuring powers normally available only in bankruptcy, but it also requires it to submit to federal oversight. The board is intended to remain in place until Puerto Rico regains the ability to raise money in the capital markets, which could take years.On the island, public opinion about federal oversight has been mixed, and protesters turned out in San Juan on Wednesday to call for repeal of the new law. Many Puerto Ricans resent Washington oversight, and see the board as an unwelcome vestige of colonialism. But at the same time, many Puerto Ricans have lost faith in their own elected officials, and they harbor some hope that the oversight board will help show the way out of the legal and financial maze in which they are lost.Mr. Obama acknowledged their hopes and misgivings on Wednesday, saying that for the board to succeed, it \u201cwill need to establish an open process for working with the people and government of Puerto Rico.\u201d He said the members would also \u201chave to work collaboratively to build consensus for their decisions.\u201dSenior administration officials said the board\u2019s first substantive task would be to review the multiyear fiscal plan that Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla\u2019s administration is preparing, make sure it meets all requirements under the law and propose revisions as needed. Ultimately the board must certify the soundness of the fiscal plan, which is to be the bedrock of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt restructuring and other important measures to revive its economy.\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d Secretary Jacob J. Lew of the Treasury said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe Puerto Rico government should bring together all of its resources to develop and submit a plan to the Oversight Board as soon as possible.\u201dUnsound fiscal policies in the past have contributed greatly to Puerto Rico\u2019s oversize debt. The government failed for many years to balance its budget, and borrowed money to plug the holes. Even as its creditworthiness crumbled, it could still borrow with ease by issuing municipal bonds. As a United States territory, it could offer interest on the bonds that was exempt from federal, state and local taxes, in all 50 states.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Manipulates Its Currency, but Not in the Way Trump Claims", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 In Monday\u2019s presidential debate, Donald Trump repeated one of his frequent criticisms of China: It keeps its currency artificially cheap.That\u2019s no longer quite the case. Nowadays, China faces the opposite problem: It is shoring up its currency while the rest of the world is trying to push it down.That change speaks to an enormous shift in China\u2019s economic fortunes and to its position in the world. Not long ago, it was still an up-and-coming country looking for ways to nurture an economic boom that was lifting millions of people out of poverty.Today, China is a world power with ambitions to call more of the shots in world economic affairs. Beijing is no longer content to cede that role to the likes of Brussels, London, Tokyo and Washington.With that shift in attitude comes a change in the way China thinks about its money. A decade ago, China saw its currency as merely a tool to help its factories sell goods. That meant keeping it weak.Now, China sees the renminbi as an instrument of its growing power. If more people around the world hold renminbi in their wallets, the thinking goes, then China will have greater say in the decisions they make. Someday, Beijing hopes, the renminbi may even rival the dollar as the world\u2019s de facto currency.With that in mind, China has moved in recent years to make the renminbi more appealing. On Saturday, when the International Monetary Fund is set to formally add the renminbi to its basket of reserve currencies, a move that will lump it in with the dollar, the pound, the euro and the yen, it will take another step in that direction.Tony Gao, a senior at the University of Southern California, helped found a start-up called Easy Transfer three years ago. The company helps Chinese parents with children going to American schools exchange their renminbi for dollars. But business growth is down this year, he said, because many affluent Chinese have already changed their renminbi for dollars.\u201cA lot of them already have acknowledged this depreciation,\u201d Mr. Gao said, adding that he was thinking of switching his renminbi to dollars, too. \u201cNow I\u2019m actually on the edge.\u201dThe situation with the renminbi:Under the traditional rules of economics, the value of a country\u2019s currency will go up if the world moves more money there. That is what should have happened in China. People around the world poured money into the country as they bought its products and as companies built factories and invested in China\u2019s growth.Instead, China largely kept its currency at a steady value compared with the dollar. That contributed to imbalances in the country, but it kept the renminbi weak.For China\u2019s manufacturers, a weak currency is ideal. If the renminbi is at, say, eight to the dollar, then a $100 widget translates into an 800 renminbi sale. At a stronger seven renminbi to the dollar, that same $100 widget generates only 700 renminbi in sales.For starters, China\u2019s growth rate slowed, and the flow of money into the country moderated. Both factors have led economists to say that the renminbi might be fairly valued, or even overvalued. The verdict, for many investors: China\u2019s currency is poised to weaken.There are other forces at work. China has taken steps over the past few years to relax its hold on the renminbi. That makes it easier for banks and merchants abroad to save the renminbi or to use it in transactions. Manufacturing has also declined as a major growth driver in the country\u2019s economy, as the government pushes to build its growing consumer and high-tech sectors.Since August of last year, when Beijing surprised global markets with a one-time devaluation of its currency, investors have been broadly seeking to unload their renminbi in favor of dollars.In Hong Kong, the biggest offshore center for renminbi banking, deposits of the Chinese currency peaked in December 2014 and have since fallen by a third.For five years since 2010, the renminbi had made small but progressive gains as a global payment currency, as measured by transactions processed on the Swift global payment system. But that usage crested in August 2015 at 2.8 percent of transactions, and it has declined steadily since then, to 1.9 percent in August.Even long-term supporters of the renminbi now seem to see the currency\u2019s pause as perhaps inevitable.\u201cIt\u2019s been the strongest currency in the world for the last 10 years or so, and anything that strong should consolidate, should have a correction,\u201d said Jim Rogers, a Singapore-based investor who is well known for being bullish on China. \u201cIs it a normal market correction or being jiggled? Maybe some of both,\u201d he added.Mr. Rogers, who made his name in the 1970s as a co-founder of the Quantum Fund with George Soros, said he retained a positive long-term view of the Chinese currency. But he said the renminbi could continue to come under selling pressure in the next year or so, as investors flock to the perceived safety of the dollar.Some of the renminbi\u2019s declines, Mr. Rogers added, were \u201ca self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s not convertible, people feel trapped and want to get out,\u201d he said.Longer term, despite the I.M.F.\u2019s planned move, few expect the renminbi to rival the dollar as a haven, or even as a significant reserve currency, unless China pushes forward with dramatic legal and financial changes.Inclusion in the monetary fund\u2019s basket is \u201ca symbolically momentous event but is unlikely by itself to be a game changer in global finance,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and a former top I.M.F. official for China. He is also the author of a book called \u201cGaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi.\u201d\u201cNotwithstanding the I.M.F.\u2019s imprimatur, the renminbi will not become a significant reserve currency unless China has better-developed and well-regulated financial markets,\u201d Mr. Prasad added.An article on Saturday about China\u2019s manipulating its currency paraphrased incorrectly from a comment by Tony Gao, who helped found a start-up called Easy Transfer. Mr. Gao said the company\u2019s growth \u2014 not its business \u2014 was down this year.Emily Feng in Beijing and Carolyn Zhang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}

In today\u2019s world of dual-career couples in the work force, our public policy has not caught up.\u201dThe rule, which does not need additional approval, requires that workers in assignments related to many federal contracts receive one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, for up to 56 hours of leave a year. Workers will be able to use the days to receive medical attention, care for a relative or deal with complications arising from domestic violence or sexual assault. The rule affects only contracts solicited by the government beginning on Jan. 1, 2017.Proponents argue that the benefit can have large social consequences.\u201cIt seems such a minor, sideline type of measure, but it does strike at the core of whether a job is workable within the context of family life,\u201d said Lisa Guide, associate director of the Rockefeller Family Fund, which has financed research and advocacy on this subject. At issue, she said, is \u201cwhether a person will be able to take care of their kids and also hold down a job at the same time and pay their bills.\u201dPaola Angel was working as a security guard in New York City when its paid sick leave law went into effect. Before the law, she typically had to leave one of her two school-age sons at home when they got sick because she could not afford to forgo a day of pay or to put her job at risk.\u201cI had them take some medicine before I left the house and crossed my fingers that they don\u2019t get worse,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel horrible.\u201dOpponents of the new rule say that paid sick leave is often a desirable policy in principle, but that the cost of the mandate will be a hardship for many employers, particularly smaller businesses. Among those who will be affected by the rule are franchisees and concessionaires selling food on federal property.\u201cThere are franchise operations in a wide array of locations,\u201d said Marc D. Freedman, executive director of labor law policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIf someone isn\u2019t providing this benefit, there\u2019s a reason. It isn\u2019t because they\u2019re bad people, evil employers.\u201dCritics have questioned the costs of administering the rule even for larger employers. In a comment letter responding to the proposed rule, the Chamber of Commerce and the International Franchise Association called it a \u201ccompliance nightmare.\u201dThe letter raised the possibility that a federal contractor in San Francisco would have to make its policies conform to three separate sick leave rules \u2014 one for the city, one for the state of California and one for the federal government.The administration is including language in the final rule to make clear how a contractor\u2019s current sick leave policy can comport with the mandate.The administration also increased its estimate of the number of workers who will receive some increase in paid sick leave by nearly 300,000.Some critics say the true intent is to affect substantially more workers than even the higher estimate. Many companies that win federal contracts, they say, are quite likely to enact the new paid sick leave policy across their entire work force rather than maintain separate policies, one for workers involved in federal contracts and a less generous one for everyone else.\u201cIn a cynical way, they\u2019re banking on the idea that employers are going to throw up their hands and put everyone under the new plan,\u201d Mr. Freedman said.Mr. Perez, the labor secretary, essentially responded that he was guilty as charged. \u201cIf that\u2019s one of the benefits, the effects of this rule, I will be thrilled,\u201d he said.Michael Shear contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombia Signs Peace Agreement With FARC After 5 Decades of War", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cLet no one doubt that we will now pursue politics without weapons,\u201d said Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o, the top commander of the FARC, offering an apology to the war\u2019s victims.Soon, the choice will be in the hands of the Colombian people, who have the last word. Mr. Santos, who as defense minister ordered offensives against Mr. Londo\u00f1o\u2019s forces, has called for a referendum vote on Sunday to ratify the accord he has signed. Polls indicate that it will coast to victory by a wide double-digit margin.The FARC\u2019s war against the government marked one of the first left-wing insurgencies in Latin America, a struggle that would inspire guerrilla movements from Cuba to Nicaragua. While the conflict gradually diminished, the group\u2019s fighters, in the tents and hammocks of their hide-outs, continued to preach Marxist armed struggle until early this year.All told, some 220,000 people lost their lives, and more than five million were displaced.Many argued that the time had come at last to end generations of unrest.\u201cWith these agreements, there is neither justice nor truth for the victims,\u201d said Mr. Uribe, who is now an opposition senator in Congress, in a Twitter post.In coming months the FARC will hand over arms to United Nations inspectors, beginning a process in which they will begin a life as ordinary Colombians. In return, the country will agree to a \u201ctransitional justice\u201d system in which, according to Mr. Santos, rank-and-file soldiers will be granted amnesty or given reduced sentences for crimes they committed.The process of reconciliation will continue in Colombia, long after the signing ceremony and even the referendum, as the country pulls together.Yet the survivors must live with their memories of war.There are those like Yolanda Perea, who as an 11-year-old in 1997 was living in the village of La Pava when a guerrilla entered her home, which had no door, walked past her five siblings and her grandfather, and raped her with a gun pointed to her head.Ms. Perea did not know she had become pregnant until another guerrilla beat her and she had a miscarriage. Days later, she said, several more guerrillas arrived and fatally shot her mother.Ms. Perea eventually had two children. She lives in Medell\u00edn working with a nongovernmental organization that protects women\u2019s rights.She is planning a \u201cyes\u201d vote for the referendum.\u201cI don\u2019t win anything if I continue to hate,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to vote yes because peace depends on each of us. There are more of us who are good, and we simply have to keep fighting for a quiet country for our children and grandchildren.\u201dThe accord was celebrated in other cities around the world. At a gathering in Times Square, David Oliveros, a 19-year-old college student from Bogot\u00e1 who is studying biochemistry at Columbia, choked up as he described the peace agreement. \u201cI\u2019ve never lived in a country in peace, without war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment I\u2019ve waited for all of my life.\u201dAnnie Correal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abbott\u2019s Sale of Eye Surgery Unit Should Ease Its Merger Woes", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAbbott Laboratories may have eased the flow of its merger pipeline. The $62 billion health firm is selling its eye surgery unit to Johnson & Johnson for $4.3 billion. With two looming acquisitions worth over $30 billion \u2014 and the purchase of Alere, in particular, not going smoothly \u2014 it is a sensible way for Abbott to gain some breathing room.Abbott arguably bit off more than it could chew when it agreed to buy the diagnostic company Alere for $5.8 billion in February and then St. Jude Medical for $25 billion just two months later. After agreeing to its sale to Abbott, Alere failed to file financial statements, announced a product recall, and acknowledged multiple investigations into billing and foreign sales practices.The relationship turned acrimonious. Alere said Abbott was dragging its feet in seeking needed regulatory approvals, while Abbott claimed Alere was hindering attempts to find necessary information. Moreover, Abbott\u2019s travails left investors jittery about its merger and acquistion intentions.A claim by the short-seller Muddy Waters in late August that St. Jude\u2019s cardiac devices were hackable, with potentially fatal results, hit St. Jude\u2019s shares severely and dented Abbott\u2019s. Such worries have been making the rounds for more than a decade and so far seem more Hollywood plot than reality. St. Jude has sued Muddy Waters, but a certain amount of damage has been done.Abbott\u2019s sale of its eye surgery unit, announced on Friday, should help things go more smoothly. Abbott had said it would sell $3 billion of stock to help finance its two acquisitions. The asset disposal will give it more cash to play with, even after taxes. Abbott\u2019s credit rating will still probably get pummeled, because completing both deals will approximately triple its debt. But the extra cash means it can either avoid issuing shares or lessen the credit-rating hit.Moreover, the deal may give Abbott more sway in arbitration with Alere. It weakens the latter\u2019s claim that Abbott\u2019s strained finances make it unwilling to complete the acquisition. Maybe Abbott can now afford to do the deal at a lower price, bolstering its reputation as an acquirer while reflecting Alere\u2019s troubles. Better yet would be for Abbott to take its time checking out its targets before signing deals. That is something the latest asset sale cannot help with.Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews. For more independent commentary and analysis, visit breakingviews.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress Approves Spending Bill, Averting Government Shutdown", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congress averted a government shutdown Wednesday as the Senate and then the House approved a short-term spending bill, allowing lawmakers to avoid a crisis and return home to campaign.The stopgap spending bill, which would fund the government through Dec. 9, had been ensnarled in a debate over financing for the lead-tainted water system in Flint, Mich.But an agreement between congressional leaders late Tuesday \u2014 which would authorize aid for Flint as part of separate legislation for water infrastructure projects \u2014 appeared to ameliorate Democratic concerns, clearing the way for the Senate to pass the spending bill, 72 to 26. The House followed suit late Wednesday, approving the measure 342 to 85.In addition to keeping the government funded at current levels, the bill provides $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus, without the restrictions on Planned Parenthood clinics that foiled earlier negotiations. It also includes funding for military infrastructure, housing and other services.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said Wednesday that he felt \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with reassurances from Republicans that the House deal would result in aid for Flint.\u201cI\u2019m convinced that there\u2019s going to be help for Flint in the lame duck,\u201d he said before the vote, referring to the session of Congress after the presidential election in November.Michigan\u2019s two senators, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Democrats, opposed the bill. Ms. Stabenow said that while she was heartened by the movement on the House side, she would oppose any spending measure \u201cthat does not treat communities equally,\u201d an apparent reference to emergency funding for flood-ravaged places in Louisiana, Maryland and West Virginia.\u201cIt is wrong to ask families in Flint to wait at the back of the line again,\u201d she said in a statement.\u201cI have said many times before, standing in this exact spot, that a continuing resolution is a last resort,\u201d Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said on the House floor, referring to the short-term spending bill. \u201cBut at this point, it is what we must do to fulfill our congressional responsibility to keep the lights on in our government.\u201dAfter the Senate passed the measure Wednesday afternoon, House leaders quickly worked to schedule their vote for the evening. The bill passed despite opposition from some conservatives who objected to additional spending, as well as from a number of Democrats who remained skeptical that Republicans would fully appropriate the money for Flint when lawmakers returned after the election.The House passed that bill earlier Wednesday evening, setting up a meeting between congressional leaders to resolve the differences between the Senate and House versions of the water projects legislation, discrepancies that include the amount of funding for Flint and whether the funding is set aside or simply authorized.But that conference meeting is not expected to happen until lawmakers return after the election, which left some Democrats uneasy. The 45-member Congressional Black Caucus recently vowed to oppose any stopgap spending bill that did not include funding for Flint.The group\u2019s chairman, Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina, said they were disappointed that Democratic leaders had agreed to a deal that relied primarily on the word of their Republican counterparts.\u201cThe question is, are we willing to accept the promise of the Republican leadership that it will come out in conference?\u201d he said in an interview Wednesday.But he said there was growing confidence among Democrats that Republicans would keep their word to ensure that Flint aid was appropriated as part of continuing discussions. Mr. Butterfield said he believed most of the caucus would ultimately support the bill.\u201cWe can\u2019t shut down the government, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said.The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative faction with some 40 members, presented their own objections to the deal, including what they saw as high levels of government spending.But some members also criticized that the spending deal will expire during the lame-duck session, when some members will simply be biding their time until the new Congress is sworn in \u2014 or that final flight home.In a release from the Office of Management and Budget, the Obama administration expressed support for the Zika funding and the movement toward funding for Flint and other communities, urging lawmakers to take immediate action upon returning from the election to provide that aid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump the Philanthropist Is Known for His Reluctance", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Donald J. Trump made an appearance this spring at the New York Military Academy, his high school alma mater in Cornwall-on-Hudson, he spoke of it with gratitude and in glowing terms, describing it as \u201cone of the really great military academies.\u201dOver the years, Mr. Trump has billed himself as an \u201cardent philanthropist,\u201d and his official biography says that he is \u201cinvolved with numerous civic and charitable organizations.\u201dInterviews with people who have worked with or solicited money from him, as well as years of publicly available charity records, paint a picture of Mr. Trump as a reluctant giver despite his wealth. Donations from his foundation, which in recent years has been exclusively financed by others, sometimes served his own needs while helping the recipients.Jack O\u2019Donnell, who was president and chief operating officer of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino in the late 1980s, said Mr. Trump would question the need for donations, even those as small as a couple thousand dollars.\u201cHe\u2019d say \u2018Why are we doing this?\u2019 or \u2018Do we have to give this much?\u2019 \u201d said Mr. O\u2019Donnell, who parted ways with Mr. Trump on bad terms and was described by the Trump campaign as a disgruntled former employee. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to put it: He\u2019s cheap.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s philanthropic endeavors over the past four decades have been dotted with pledges to donate the proceeds from books or speeches. Sometimes, Mr. Trump has stepped in to help a person in need, with the cameras rolling. And Mr. Trump, usually accompanied by his wife, Melania, has been a familiar face at well-publicized benefit galas in New York and Florida, where the rich and famous mingle and are seen.He has also more quietly supported other causes over the years. He has donated to and sits on the board of the Police Athletic League, a youth sports organization in New York. And Mr. Trump has won a lifetime achievement award from the American Cancer Society for his giving.\u201cAt the end of the day, in my narrow world, he\u2019s a board member who has consistently contributed to us,\u201d said Frederick Watts, the executive director of the Police Athletic League.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, in response to questions about his giving practices, called him \u201cextremely generous with both his time and his money.\u201d\u201cMr. Trump regularly makes personal contributions to worthy charitable causes and organizations, but does not seek recognition,\u201d his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said in an email. \u201cMr. Trump has made several significant contributions to the Trump Foundation, including an initial multimillion-dollar lump sum at its inception. Since then he has made personal contributions, and regularly waives fees for appearances, speeches and publicity rights instead encouraging the donations be made to charity.\u201dMr. Trump and his aides say that in addition to what the foundation gives, he writes personal checks directly to charities. His personal tax returns would reveal his deductions for charitable giving, but he has refused to release those returns.Hillary and Bill Clinton\u2019s returns show deductions for $23 million in donations since 2001, about 10 percent of their income.The Post also reported this week that two donations totaling $258,000 had been made from the foundation to settle legal disputes involving Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses. \u201cThis story was not accurate,\u201d Ms. Hicks said in a statement.Other donations have been directed to organizations aligned with Mr. Trump\u2019s politics. The foundation contributed $100,000 to support Citizens United, the conservative watchdog group that, among other things, has sued for access to records from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s State Department. The foundation also gave $25,000 to a foundation affiliated with the conservative monthly The American Spectator. (Neither recipient was a political action committee.)Foundation tax records for 2014 illustrate how Mr. Trump has recently used its money. The Citizens United gift was the largest donation. The foundation gave $50,000 each to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in West Palm Beach, and to the private school his son Barron attends. Four other charities \u2014 the Police Athletic League, two health organizations and the Anti-Defamation League \u2014 received about $100,000 between them, and a collection of other groups received smaller grants totaling about $200,000.His high school alma mater received roughly $30,000 from the foundation over the years, but those contributions ended in 2005. When the academy contingent \u2014 which included Theodore Dobias, a former coach and administrator at the academy whom Mr. Trump has described as a major influence in his life \u2014 came by his office in 2010, Mr. Trump made clear that he did not view the school as a worthwhile investment given its dire financial straits, Mr. Pezzullo, the alumnus, said.The school would eventually declare bankruptcy and was close to closing before an investor bought it at auction last year.Even when donations were effectively made with other people\u2019s money, Mr. Trump sometimes received the attention.In 2012, his foundation made a $10,000 contribution to the charitable arm of the Florida Association of the American Institute of Architects as part of its 100th anniversary. The group had solicited the owners of Florida buildings it highlighted as great architecture, including Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, which was honored as the top historic structure in the state. In return for their donations, the owners \u201cgot great publicity,\u201d said Vicki Long, the association\u2019s vice president and chief executive.The same year, foundation tax records show, it gave $50,000 to the Child Mind Institute in New York, which bought Mr. Trump and his wife seats at the organization\u2019s gala dinner. They also attended a gala for Operation Smile, a nonprofit that treats cleft palates and lips, and to which the foundation gave $100,000.Mr. Trump\u2019s meshing of charity and publicity goes back decades, including an episode in 1986 when he helped a Georgia widow save her farm from foreclosure.After the woman\u2019s husband had committed suicide, Mr. Trump solicited donations on her behalf and made one of his own. When their goal was reached, he held a news conference at Trump Tower at which the widow did a symbolic burning of the mortgage papers.Frank Argenbright, an Atlanta businessman who was part of the fund-raising effort, recalled Mr. Trump paying great attention to the details of the event, including what cigarette lighter to use.\u201cHe said \u2018I don\u2019t want to go down there in front of the cameras and not have it work,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Argenbright said.Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Sailors Needed: Robot Sailboats Scour the Oceans for Data", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALAMEDA, Calif. \u2014 Two robotic sailboats trace lawn-mower-style paths across the violent surface of the Bering Sea, off the coast of Alaska. The boats are counting fish \u2014 pollock, to be specific \u2014 with a fancy version of the fish finder sonar you\u2019d find on a bass fishing boat.About 2,500 miles away, Richard Jenkins, a mechanical engineer and part-time daredevil, is tracking the robot sailboats on a large projection screen in an old hangar that used to be part of the Alameda Naval Air Station. Now the hangar is the command center of a little company called Saildrone.At least 20 companies are chasing the possibly quixotic dream of a self-driving car in Silicon Valley. But self-sailing boats are already a real business.While they are counting fish, Saildrone\u2019s boats are also monitoring the seals that feed on the fish by tracking transponders that scientists have attached to the heads of the seals.\u201cWe can tell them what size fish they are eating and why they are going there,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, who is the chief executive and a co-founder of the company.Last summer, working with scientists and engineers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the boats skimmed along the edge of the retreating Arctic ice cap, giving scientists a detailed account of temperature, salinity and ecosystem information that would have been difficult and expensive to obtain in person.The Saildrone autonomous sailboats look a little like shrunken America\u2019s Cup racing yachts \u2014 small trimarans with hard, carbon-fiber sails.The Saildrone\u2019s carbon fiber sail acts like an aircraft wing. When air passes over it, thrust is created. The sail is stabilized by a counterweight that is placed in front of it and a tab trailing behind it that can automatically make small corrections to make sure it maintains an efficient angle to the wind. Underneath the boat are both a rudder to aid in steering and a keel, which will right the boat if it is knocked over.The big difference, of course, is that there are no sailors on board. The boats are controlled through communications satellites from the operations center here as they collect oceanographic data and monitor fish stocks and the environment.One day, they may be used for weather prediction, oil and gas industry ocean operations, or even to police illegal fishing.Mr. Jenkins has a much grander vision. He believes the missing piece of the puzzle to definitively comprehend the consequences of global warming is scientific data. He envisions a fleet of thousands or even tens of thousands of his 23-foot sailboats creating a web of sensors across the world\u2019s oceans.Vast amounts of data collected by his robots could reveal with greater detail the extent and rate at which global warming might become an existential threat to humanity and whether it is happening in decades rather than centuries.That is, if someone is willing to pay for all that. The boats are not sold \u2014 the scientists, commercial fisherman and weather predictors pay a $2,500-a-day fee per boat for the data they produce.Saildrone got its start with $2.5 million in grants from Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s executive chairman, and his wife, Wendy Schmidt. And Mr. Jenkins\u2019s company recently received $14 million in financing from three socially minded venture capital firms: Social Capital, Lux and Capricorn.\u201cMy interest in Saildrone is very practical,\u201d said Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive who is the founder of Social Capital. \u201cLet\u2019s stop arguing about what is happening, and let\u2019s measure. Once you have data and it\u2019s statistically significant and valid, then we can get to the next step, which is to find what the structural reforms are that need to happen.\u201dEach boat is packed with an armory of scientific sensors that beam data back to the control center.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much taking the earth\u2019s temperature as it is its pulse,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, a 39-year-old, tousle-haired mechanical engineer who was trained at Imperial College London.He has found willing clients in ocean scientists and engineers who previously had limited ways to collect highly specific and accurate data about the ocean surface.\u201cRichard had a great boat but no scientific sensors on it, and we had sensors but no boat,\u201d said Christian Meinig, the director of engineering at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. The scientists at the laboratory have already begun to use the boats to enhance their study of the El Ni\u00f1o warm-water pattern in the Pacific Ocean.The breakthrough for the robots was a sailboat design that Mr. Jenkins originally began pursuing when he set out to capture the world land-sailing speed record in 1999. He succeeded in 2009 in a \u201cland yacht\u201d called Greenbird that reached a speed of 126.2 m.p.h. on a dry lake bed in Southern California.To reach such a high speed and remain stable, Mr. Jenkins replaced the traditional sailboat sail with a rigid vertical carbon-fiber wing coupled with a unique stabilizer trailing behind the wing that would automatically adjust the wing faster than a human sailor could respond by pulling ropes.He has repurposed the wing to sail at slower speeds and to autonomously travel anywhere in the world. Last year, in an experiment, one of the Saildrone boats made its way from Alameda to the Equator in 42 days, collecting a wealth of ocean surface data along the way. A scientific research vessel with a large human crew would be faster, but it would cost about $80,000 a day.That researchers can move the autonomous boats \u2014 unlike the static ocean buoys that are now typically used \u2014 is significant, because it allows scientists to alter collection patterns in response to ocean conditions and interesting discoveries.\u201cA self-correcting model is really a superpowerful way of doing things,\u201d said Christopher Sabine, an oceanographer who is director of Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. \u201cFor climate modeling we need to know what\u2019s going on year-round, and to be perfectly frank, we don\u2019t like to go out into the middle of winter.\u201dSaildrone is not the only autonomous vehicle on the sea. Liquid Robotics, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., makes a boat called Wave Glider, which uses wave rather than wind action to move at more than two knots and carry up to 100 pounds of instruments.The Saildrone payload is more than twice as large, and the boat is potentially twice as fast. The sensor suite is made up of more than a dozen instruments that capture wind speeds, radiation, still and video imagery, temperature, ocean chemistry, and other data.Mr. Jenkins\u2019s contention is that a fleet of robot sensors spread across an ocean like the Pacific will make a huge difference in both weather and climate prediction. For example, a better understanding of a weather phenomenon like El Ni\u00f1o could make a difference worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cThey completely failed to see the last one coming,\u201d he said, noting that climate scientists acknowledge they don\u2019t have the spatial resolution to make accurate predictions. \u201cThey have a pressing need for more data.\u201dAn article on Monday about drone sailboats that gather research data misidentified the variety of fish being counted off the coast of Alaska by boats deployed by a company called Saildrone. The drones are counting pollock, not haddock.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Will Extend HARP Home Loan Program Into Next Year", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserSeven years after the federal government first offered an option to help some homeowners refinance into more affordable mortgages, the program is being extended yet again, and plans for a new refinancing program are being completed.The Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, already had been extended at least twice and was scheduled to end at the end of this year. But HARP will continue through September 2017, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said.Erin Lantz, vice president for mortgages with the real estate site Zillow, said about 12 percent of mortgaged homes remained underwater at the end of June. But borrowers may still not be aware that the HARP program exists, she said. Or, because they may have failed to qualify in the program\u2019s early years because of missed or late payments, they may think they remain ineligible.Cora Fulmore, coordinator of the Florida Housing Counselors Network, said some borrowers remained wary, perhaps because of past tussles with lenders. Housing counselors have tried various outreach efforts to get people to apply, she said, including going door to door and offering gift cards to borrowers.\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of trust,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not believing this program can help them.\u201dSome borrowers may be suspicious that HARP is \u201ctoo good to be true,\u201d or they may simply not want to take the time to apply, said Jay Plum, head of consumer and mortgage lending at Huntington Bank in Columbus, Ohio. The bank has made overtures to eligible borrowers, he said, going so far as to send HARP document packages to homeowners by overnight delivery.He urged borrowers who might think they do not have refinancing options to take a look at the program, noting that it offers a streamlined application process that often does not require an appraisal. \u201cIt really is in their best interest,\u201d he said.Madonna Barwick, 49, a teacher who lives in Canfield, Ohio, said a teller at a Huntington grocery store branch told her about HARP. She was able to refinance her mortgage last year, she said, lowering her monthly payment by more than $300 and easing her financial worries. Her rate dropped to just over 4 percent from more than 6.6 percent. \u201cIt was a blessing,\u201d she said.Here are some questions and answers about special refinancing options:What loans are eligible for HARP refinancing?Loans must have originated on or before May 31, 2009, and must be owned or guaranteed by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The property must have a loan-to-value ratio \u2014 the mortgage divided by the home\u2019s value \u2014 of 80 percent or higher. (A $140,000 house with a $130,000 mortgage would have a loan-to-value ratio of about 93 percent.) The borrower must have had no late payments in the previous six months, and no more than one late payment in the previous year.Do I have to do a HARP refinancing with my current lender?Bob Walters, chief economist with Quicken Loans, said borrowers should not hesitate to inquire about HARP if a loan officer does not mention it: \u201cThey should certainly ask.\u201dHow will the new refinancing option available in October2017 differ from HARP?As with HARP, borrowers will generally have to be current on their payments. Unlike HARP, however, the new refinancing option will not have a cutoff date, so loans made after May 2009 may be eligible. And unlike with HARP, borrowers can use the new refinancing option more than once.The new offering will generally focus on mortgages with loan-to-value ratios of 95 percent or higher. Freddie and Fannie say they will announce more details in November.Advertisement"}

The downturn, which Goldman Sachs likens to a depression, has even exceeded the 7.6 percent decline during the so-called lost decade of the 1980s, when Brazil fought hyperinflation.\u201cHis attack on our democracy will sink the country even further,\u201d said Judson Albino Coswosk, 25, a university biology student who has accused Mr. Temer of ousting Ms. Rousseff for his own political gain.\u201cTemer\u2019s government is requesting sacrifice from the population, but has pushed for wage increases for public servants who already enjoy job stability,\u201d said Marcos Lisboa, the president of Insper, one of Brazil\u2019s top business schools.After the move drew criticism from allies seeking to curb public spending, Mr. Temer suspended the wage increases. But some analysts still expect the plan to advance at some point because it enjoys support from many legislators in the president\u2019s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party.\u201cTo put it simply, the left failed in Brazil,\u201d said Jacques Kfouri, 62, a businessman in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cTemer is fantastic compared with the alternatives. What he needs now is for others to support him.\u201dOthers point out that Mr. Temer could get a boost in the coming months. The economy is still bad, with the authorities reporting on Wednesday that it contracted 0.6 percent from April to June. But some economists drew consolation from data that showed a rise in investments for the first time since 2013, perhaps signaling a floor to Brazil\u2019s most severe economic crisis in decades.Either way, the fate of Mr. Temer\u2019s ambitions will hinge on public sentiment and his ability to bargain with Congress. His approval ratings, which are almost as dismal as Ms. Rousseff\u2019s, have been heavily influenced by the scandals swirling around him and his party.Earlier this year, Mr. Temer was convicted of violating limits on campaign financing. In something of a paradox, he is allowed to occupy the presidency as a result of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment, but the conviction against him could make him ineligible to run for office for eight years.Separately, various political figures and businessmen have tied Mr. Temer to colossal graft schemes around large public energy companies. A construction executive has testified that Mr. Temer was the beneficiary of a $300,000 bribe related to contracts at Eletronuclear, Brazil\u2019s state-controlled nuclear energy producer. Mr. Temer denies that.\u201cThe biggest problem for this administration is the absolute unpredictability of what the investigations are still going to reveal because we are far from the end of this process,\u201d said Rubens Ricupero, a retired diplomat and former finance minister.While Mr. Ricupero supported the impeachment process and considered Ms. Rousseff incompetent, he noted that new information coming out posed a risk that Mr. Temer is \u201cgoing to run all the time because most of the people who are around him, in one way or another, have been under investigation for some time.\u201dOn Wednesday, in his first televised address after the Senate\u2019s vote to oust Ms. Rousseff, Mr. Temer seemed to acknowledge the difficult road ahead, singling out the unemployment rate as an alarming problem.\u201cWe have a horizon of two years and four months,\u201d he said, referring to the time left in his current presidential term. \u201cAs of today, the demands will be much greater on this government.\u201dPaula Moura contributed reporting from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and Vinod Sreeharsha and Mariana Sim\u00f5es from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Unveils Plan for Families in Bid for Women\u2019s Votes", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byASTON, Pa. \u2014 Donald J. Trump unveiled a menu of proposals on Tuesday to help working parents, calling for six weeks of mandatory paid maternity leave and expanded tax credits for child care.\u201cThose in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security or the mom struggling to afford child care,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally here.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to put forward such a plan represents a different approach from the one taken by previous Republican presidential nominees.But in selling his case, Mr. Trump stretched the truth, saying that his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has no such plan of her own and \u201cnever will.\u201dMr. Trump and his daughter spoke about the issue at the Republican National Convention in July, but the candidate had not mentioned it publicly until Tuesday. Mr. Trump faces a potentially record-high gender gap with women, but pushing the proposal so close to the election risks looking slapdash on a serious topic.The campaign staved off potential complaints from social conservatives who have historically frowned on giving incentives to mothers to work outside the home, by vowing to make those caretaker roles tax-deductible.At the speech, Mr. Trump was joined by some female members of Congress. Noting one applauding in the audience as he spoke, Mr. Trump pointed to the crowd and said, \u201cMakes your life a lot easier, right?\u201dMr. Trump first proposed the child care initiative weeks ago, but he broadened it to help working parents after facing criticism that his initial proposal would primarily help high earners rather than women and families on the lower end of the economic spectrum.\u201cChild care is such a big problem,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to solve that problem.\u201dMs. Trump, who stood next to her father as he spoke in Pennsylvania, said she would make the plan\u2019s passage a priority if her father won. Affordable child care \u201cshould not be the luxury of a fortunate few,\u201d she said.The new recommendations contained a number of uncertainties, most notably how Mr. Trump would pay for them, and they still favor people with higher incomes. The candidate\u2019s aides said his goals would be achieved through a change in the tax code to help pay for child care, to be detailed in another speech, probably this week.The main thrust of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan involves a reordering of the tax code so working parents can take an income tax deduction for care of up to four children and older-adult dependents. The deduction is available for individuals earning up to $250,000, or $500,000 for a married couple filing jointly.There would also be child care spending rebates as high as $1,200 a year for families on the lower end of the income scale.People are motivated to vote by a combination of individual priorities, group culture, candidate outreach, and how easy or hard it is to cast a ballot.That is an amount that some critics called inadequate given that the cost of child care in some states is $10,000 to $20,000 a year.Another proposal aimed at lower-income parents is a dependent care savings account, a version of a flexible spending account usually offered by employers. Such accounts would be universal and used for after-school or traditional child care, with a government match of $500 a year \u2014 a minuscule amount given the cost of such care, and given the difficulty that lower-income families have putting away money in such accounts.Among the open questions are whether the deductions that working parents could claim would replace the existing earned-income tax credit, whether there would be an age cap for the children involved, and what the actual scale of benefit would be for people of various incomes.The signature element of the plan, six weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers whose employers do not currently provide coverage, would be financed by eliminating fraud in unemployment insurance.Mr. Trump\u2019s aides trumpeted the proposal as unprecedented for a G.O.P. presidential nominee; many Republicans oppose requiring paid maternity leave as an onerous new regulation on businesses.Earlier Tuesday, at a campaign rally in Clive, Iowa, the candidate singled out Ivanka Trump, a mother of three who has developed her own licensing and branding company, as the driving force behind the plan.Some social conservatives said they were pleasantly surprised by Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed tax benefit for stay-at-home mothers.\u201cI was quite pleased with it,\u201d said Tony Perkins of the conservative Family Research Council. He called it \u201cinnovative\u201d in acknowledging \u201cthe contribution that stay-at-home parents make.\u201dBut the plan was met with criticism from the Clinton campaign and skepticism from some child care advocacy groups, which warned that the people most in need of relief would not get it.\u201cAfter spending his entire career \u2014 and this entire campaign \u2014 demeaning women and dismissing the need to support working families,\u201d Maya Harris, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior policy adviser, said in a statement, \u201cDonald Trump released a regressive and insufficient \u2018maternity leave\u2019 policy that is out of touch, half-baked and ignores the way Americans live and work today.\u201dShe said the earned-income tax credit component meant that families in need would have to wait to receive relief just once a year, and called the $1,200 rebate a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d for low-income families who were facing child care costs of more than $10,000 a year.Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of paid leave would apply only to mothers, as opposed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan, which would cover both parents.Some economists say that when leave is offered only to women, it can backfire by lowering women\u2019s chances of being hired and promoted and getting raises.Ms. Labaton expressed skepticism about the proposal \u201ccoming less than 60 days before Election Day,\u201d deriding it as \u201ca naked attempt to court women voters while not actually offering up much by way of genuine support.\u201dNick Corasaniti reported from Aston, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Revson.At the time, Mr. Bergerac was president of the European unit of International Telephone & Telegraph and he knew very little about perfume and makeup. But he was an astute deal maker and would use that expertise to expand Revlon beyond its core cosmetics business, transforming it into a major player in the health care industry.At Revlon, Mr. Bergerac made dozens of acquisitions, expanding the company\u2019s reach into drugs, vision care and medical diagnostics. By 1984, health care was a major driver of Revlon\u2019s profits.\u201cThe most important thing is to seize a trend, and when we come in with our might it won\u2019t matter that we weren\u2019t the first. Everyone will think we were,\u201d Mr. Bergerac told The New York Times in 1976.Mr. Bergerac was also highly compensated for his day. When he agreed to come to Revlon, he was paid a $1.5 million bonus (more than $7 million in today\u2019s dollars), earning him the nickname Bonus Baby and a spot on the covers of several newsmagazines.Mr. Bergerac was fluent in multiple languages, spoke English with a distinct French accent and brought an international flair to even the most mundane of tasks. For example, he could make \u201cthe proposal for ratification of auditors sound like an invitation to the casbah,\u201d according to an article in The New York Times in 1975, describing one Revlon annual meeting.In 1985, Pantry Pride, a company headed by the investor Ronald O. Perelman, took control of Revlon from Mr. Bergerac in a drama that defined an era on Wall Street of corporate raiders and junk bond financing.Mr. Bergerac had tried unsuccessfully to fend off the takeover by teaming up with the investment firm Forstmann Little.

{"Headline": "How to Raise Trillions for Green Investments", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs a point of comparison, global gross domestic product in 2015 was $73 trillion. But there is no question that the world needs to ramp up its transition to a low-carbon, environmentally sustainable and resilient economy, and to do so rapidly. The question is, how do we pay for it, given the limited availability of government funding, particularly in developing countries?The answer: private financing. The good news is that there is a global abundance of private capital. To unlock these riches, governments must create conditions that encourage private investment in clean technologies and sustainable development. With smart, well-designed and coordinated policies, financing models and instruments like bonds and incentive programs, countries have the potential to solve some of the planet\u2019s most pressing environmental challenges while still maintaining economic growth.The challenge now is to build on these successes and ensure that green finance mechanisms are widely adopted so that capital markets can allocate financing to low-carbon sectors of the economy that have the potential to generate growth and jobs.For this to happen, countries will need to adopt policies that reduce the price of low-carbon investments to make them more attractive for private investors. These policies include environmental regulations to stimulate clean, sustainable development; incentives and subsidies for clean energy investments; and the pricing of carbon emissions, which can be done in a variety of ways, including emissions trading and taxes. We also need to eliminate subsidies that encourage the use and extraction of carbon-based energy like coal and oil. Such policies will take strong political will, especially as economic growth is slowing.China also has announced plans to create a nationwide carbon market in 2017 that is on track to become the largest in the world. Pilot exchanges already allow Chinese pollution emitters in several cities to trade carbon credits, earned by reducing emissions, to other companies that have been less successful in reducing their carbon discharges. In this way, China is trying to turn an environmental liability into an economic asset. If these exchanges work, they will be powerful examples for the rest of the developing world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Caliber Home Loans Embraces Borrowers With Spotty Credit", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMortgages to borrowers with spotty credit histories have yet to come roaring back from the financial crisis, but they are on the rise at the private equity giant Lone Star Funds.Its wholly owned mortgage business, Caliber Home Loans, is one of the few financial firms to report a significant percentage increase this year in the dollar value of subprime mortgages it is managing and servicing for homeowners.Most of the subprime mortgages at Caliber are \u201clegacy\u201d loans, those issued before the housing bust, which Lone Star acquired from banks and federal agencies.But Caliber is also one of the few lenders beginning to issue mortgages to borrowers with less than perfect credit records and to issue bonds backed by those loans.For the second time in three months, Lone Star, which was founded by the billionaire investor John Grayken in 1995, has indicated that it is on the verge of bringing to market a mortgage securitization backed mainly by newly issued mortgages to borrowers with troubled credit histories. Many of the nonprime mortgages bundled into the bond offerings were written by Caliber in the last two years.Lone Star and Caliber sold a similar but smaller bond offering last year.These loans differ in many regards from the worst of the subprime mortgages made before the housing bust. The borrowers taking out these mortgages, known as Fresh Start loans, from Caliber must prove their ability to repay loans, and, while some have had bankruptcies or foreclosures in the recent past, they are seen as likely to keep up with their monthly payments.Lone Star and Caliber are moving into these so-called nonprime mortgages as big banks in the United States continue to leave the business of managing mortgages to borrowers with spotty credit histories in the wake of the foreclosure crisis.Big banks are focusing much of their effort on what are known as jumbo mortgages, home loans issued to wealthier borrowers with pristine credit histories who are borrowing more than $400,000. Jumbo mortgages are more profitable and less risky for banks than smaller loans to homeowners.Caliber, a firm that Lone Star began cobbling together nearly four years ago, is now one of the fastest-growing mortgage finance firms in the country. Caliber is the 10th largest mortgage servicer, or bill collector, out of 30 major firms nationwide.Its portfolio of subprime mortgages increased about 14 percent, to $17 billion, in the last year, according to Fitch Ratings. Mortgages to borrowers with shaky credit histories account for 18 percent of the $93 billion in mortgages that Caliber manages and collects payments on from homeowners.Over all, the percentage of subprime mortgages managed by financial firms has declined by an average 16.7 percent in the last year, according to Inside Nonconforming Markets, a trade publication.In a statement, Caliber said the focus on the increase in the number of subprime mortgages in its portfolio overlooks that the vast majority of mortgages it manages and underwrites are to borrowers with solid credit histories.\u201cThe growth of Caliber\u2019s servicing book should not be characterized by a single data point, as over time it will be driven by Caliber\u2019s origination activity \u2014 which does not include any subprime products,\u201d Caliber said by email.The firm added that its Fresh Start loan program, \u201ca new nonconforming product that Caliber offers to underserved borrowers, makes up less than 1 percent of all annual production and is not considered subprime.\u201dSubprime investing is not new to Mr. Grayken\u2019s firm. In 2014, Lone Star, based in Dallas, bought DFC Global, a payday lender that makes high-interest, short-term loans to consumers.The growth in Caliber\u2019s subprime business in part reflects the fact that Lone Star has emerged as one of the largest buyers of distressed mortgages. One of Lone Star\u2019s biggest purchases of soured mortgages was a pool of 17,000 loans it purchased at a steep discount from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.That deal has prompted criticism. Housing advocates contend that Lone Star and Caliber have been too quick to foreclose on borrowers and have been unwilling to negotiate over the terms of a loan modification.Caliber has foreclosed on roughly 21 percent of the mortgages brought from H.U.D., up from 14 percent at the end of last year, according to an analysis by RealtyTrac of the firm\u2019s loan data that was reviewed by The New York Times.Caliber has defended its handling of the H.U.D. loans, noting that most borrowers were more than two years delinquent on their mortgages.\u201cThe vast majority of the loans in the H.U.D. pools came to Caliber in some stage of foreclosure, including some 8,300 loans associated with abandoned properties or borrowers whose loans we are legally prohibited from contacting to offer a modification opportunity,\u201d the company said.More recently, Lone Star has been buying thousands of distressed loans from auctions staged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The rapid growth at Caliber, which has more than 5,000 employees, has not been without problems.The firm\u2019s mortgage modification and foreclosure practices have prompted investigations by regulators in New York. Last year Fitch issued a negative outlook on Caliber, in part because of its rapid growth and heightened regulatory scrutiny.Roelof Slump, a managing director at Fitch, said the ratings agency had no immediate plans to revise its outlook on Caliber, but had noted that the firm acted this year to \u201cenhance their staffing.\u201d He cited the appointment of Sanjiv Das, the former chief executive of Citigroup\u2019s mortgage division, as Caliber\u2019s chief executive.In June, Fitch reviewed and rated the first securitization of nonprime mortgages Lone Star brought to market, a $161 million bond offering backed by nearly 400 mortgages, which is one of the largest securitization of nonprime mortgages since the financial crisis.In its review, Fitch noted that the \u201ccredit quality of the borrowers is weaker than prime.\u201dNow, Lone Star plans an even larger bond offering backed mainly by nonprime mortgages written by Caliber. In a Sept. 6 pre-sale ratings report, Fitch said the newest $217 million securitization will be backed by 501 mortgages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Proposes Ban on Merchant Banking, a Practice With Little Risk", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorMerchant banking has been around for centuries. Why crack down now?The business originated during the Italian Renaissance. Small, family-run banks would finance sea voyages and other trading missions, taking a share of the profits. This was high-risk finance. All could be lost as a result of a storm, the occasional war or even piracy. In the following centuries, merchant banking spread across Europe and then to the United States, becoming the occupation of the big banking houses like J.P. Morgan.Bank trading activities are more limited today. Now, when the term \u201cmerchant banking\u201d is used, it generally refers to banks like Goldman Sachs buying and selling nonfinancial companies. In other words, when banks act like private equity or venture capital firms in buying a company or investing in a start-up.The study was due in early 2012, but the Fed issued it last week, so only four and a half years late. Better late than never.In the study, the Fed called for Congress to ban the practice. The reason the report provided was the banal-sounding language that \u201cthe existing statutory merchant banking authority\u201d allows for investment banks registered with the Fed as bank holding companies to \u201cengage in activities that pose risks to the organizations\u2019 safety and soundness.\u201dThis is yet another step by the government to restrain big banks in their activities under the guise of tamping down risk, making the banks more like boring utilities.Yet the question is whether this is a step too far. A business that has never substantially affected the soundness of banks is now threatened with extinction.The proposed ban is another step back to the Glass-Steagall Act, the New Deal-era law that separated regular banking from investment banking and also limited the ability of banks to engage in merchant banking.But there was never a complete prohibition even under Glass-Steagall. Investment banks like Goldman, which at the time were not chartered by the Fed as bank holding companies, could regularly engage in merchant banking, while commercial banks were allowed to engage in smaller merchant banking investments not exceeding 5 percent of their capital.These limitations ended in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which ended Glass-Steagall. This law specifically permitted merchant banking by bank holding companies. The removal of this stricture was uncontroversial at the time, as the debate was more focused on whether commercial banks could enter into investment banking and vice versa.But then came the 2008 financial crisis, when the trading activities of investment banks played a part in the near collapse of the financial system. In the years since, banks have been on the defensive, as the Volcker Rule and other regulations have sought to limit their activities to plain-vanilla banking.Nonetheless, the banking industry reacted to the latest regulatory move like a man seeing a headline in his morning paper and spitting out his coffee in shock.\u201cBank holding companies,\u201d a trade group said in response, \u201chave successfully used the merchant banking authority granted to them by law to finance start-ups and growing companies, fueling jobs and economic growth.\u201d This business has been done, it noted, \u201cwithout any threat whatsoever to the safety and soundness of their affiliated banks or to the financial system at large.\u201dRandall D. Guynn, the head of the Davis Polk law firm\u2019s financial institutions group, described the proposed ban as \u201ca solution in search of a problem.\u201dThe reason for the industry\u2019s exasperation is easy to see. Merchant banking is simply the practice of buying operating companies. The risk to a bank holding company is twofold. First, the bank could lose its money \u2014 as with any investment. Or second, it could be held liable for the debts of that company.The risk of losing the entire investment would appear to be the most problematic, but the Fed did not seem too troubled by this. This is in part a result of other regulations that limit the risk.First, banks are penalized for these investments by having a charge applied to their allowable capital. Second, the bank must sell the investment within 10 years, a period that can be extended by application to 15 years. These investments are monitored heavily these days to ensure they are not unduly risky.Merchant banking can be a profitable business. And it allows banks to take part in the business of their clients \u2014 getting to know them better and having more of a stake in their success.This may be why Fed, in its release, relied on the legal technicality of potential liability to argue for a ban. The Fed stated that by investing in these companies, a bank increases the \u201crisks of being legally liable for the operations of the portfolio company when a portfolio company is less likely to be able to satisfy the claims of creditors and tort claimants.\u201dThis argument would be given an \u201cF\u201d by any professor of a basic corporation law class. Corporations are beings of limited liability \u2014 that is one of their key benefits. Courts will not hold shareholders liable for the debts or obligations of a corporate entity they own.A court will sometimes order this shield pierced, but if the bank operates the company separately (as it usually does), this should never happen. Given this, the Fed\u2019s report puts forth a contorted hypothesis that a bank could be liable if a company it owned experienced an \u201cenvironmental\u201d event like bankruptcy. But when has that ever happened?Given the shaky justifications for this proposed ban \u2014 and the fact that Congress would need to enact it, making it unlikely to happen any time soon \u2014 perhaps another explanation is in order. It\u2019s \u201cbank-shaming.\u201d In other words, no risk is worth taking and no investment is worth holding, and any bank that thinks otherwise will be publicly discredited.So regulators are on the march, determined to rein in any activities that may not be core to banking, whether or not those activities make sense or the data supports them.Indeed, in the Fed\u2019s report, there was no data on whether merchant banking was profitable, whether banks were held liable for it or whether it was indeed risky. In fact, there was no data at all. Nor was there any consideration of the downsides to this ban, like the loss of an investor in growth businesses and smaller profits for banks, presumably meaning less credit.The Fed may be right, but in a bank-shaming world, the downsides of eliminating risk for banks do not seem to matter much, nor does the data. We are in a world where regulators want no risk no matter the costs.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley.

But some analysts interpreted it as the latest, and most dramatic, effort by the president to regain the trust of the Mexican public following his meeting with Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who has made criticism of Mexicans and Mexico an incendiary motif of his campaign.\u201cIt will help mitigate the anger,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Antonio Crespo Mendoza, a professor of politics at Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Docencia Econ\u00f3micas, a Mexican research and higher education center. \u201cPresident Pe\u00f1a Nieto realized things could not stay as they were, and that they could no longer insist that it had been a good call\u201d to invite Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump cast his visit as a statesmanlike effort to reach out to a country he had alienated. But hours after his meeting with Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, he gave a combative speech in Phoenix that struck many of the anti-immigrant themes that have defined his candidacy. The episode has left Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his government embarrassed at a time when his approval ratings were already at record lows over rising crime, poor economic growth and conflict of interest scandals.In the days after the meeting, the president scrambled to contain the fallout and to repair the damage \u2014 using a television interview, a newspaper column and a town-hall-style meeting held to mark his annual \u201cInforme de Gobierno,\u201d Mexico\u2019s equivalent of the State of the Union address. But these steps seemed to do little to mollify many Mexicans, who accused the president of humiliating the nation, first by inviting Mr. Trump and then by failing to use the opportunity to push back against the candidate\u2019s criticism of Mexico and Mexicans.The discontent has continued to simmer on social media and in the news, and an anti-Pe\u00f1a Nieto demonstration has been called for Sept. 15. On Tuesday, an opposition senator \u2014 seeking to provide the defense of Mexico that he said Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto had failed to offer \u2014 submitted a bill that would empower the government to fight several of Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy proposals, including his promise to force Mexico to pay for the construction of a border wall and his threat to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement.\u201cOf all the scandals Pe\u00f1a Nieto has faced, this is the most devastating,\u201d said Alfonso Z\u00e1rate, a political analyst and columnist in Mexico City.From Mr. Trump\u2019s perspective, the trip was a risky move from the start, given the potential for embarrassment if the Mexican president were to criticize him publicly.It came together after Jared Kushner, the son-in-law and campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, began to lay the groundwork with Mexican officials in early August. Mr. Kushner dealt with Mr. Videgaray and other government officials in negotiating how the meeting would happen, according to a close ally of Mr. Trump who was involved in the arrangements.Mr. Trump\u2019s visit was largely incident-free, and provided his campaign with pleasing visuals of the Republican nominee standing side by side with a head of state. But any positive effect was undone by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s insistence afterward that he had told Mr. Trump that Mexico would not pay for a border wall, a claim that contradicted Mr. Trump\u2019s account.Even so, the damage to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto seems to have been far worse.While Mr. Videgaray\u2019s resignation may have been intended to stanch the political bleeding in Mexico City and salvage the president\u2019s standing, it also shifted the odds in the contest for future leadership of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I. In addition, it left Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto without one of his closest confidantes in his administration.Mr. Videgaray, who holds a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had been a rising star in the P.R.I., and his name was often mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2018.He had worked for the president since 2005, when Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was the governor of the State of Mexico, helping him restructure the state\u2019s debt and coordinating Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s 2012 presidential bid.Mr. Videgaray became the president\u2019s closest ally and adviser in the cabinet \u2014 \u201cthe power behind the throne,\u201d Mr. Z\u00e1rate said.His reputation was tarnished by reports he had bought a house at a golf club from a government contractor, though not enough to force him out of the cabinet or out of contention for 2018. The president, who is known for his loyalty to his inner circle, stuck by him.Have you registered your disapproval or approval for Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy by, say, discarding or returning Trump-brand clothes \u2014 or by booking a night at a Trump hotel? We want to hear your stories.Indeed, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was accompanied by Mr. Videgaray when he made the announcement on Wednesday, and was warm and effusive toward his longtime adviser, thanking him for being \u201ccommitted to Mexico and loyal to the president of Mexico.\u201dMr. Z\u00e1rate said the departure of Mr. Videgaray was \u201cvery painful for the president.\u201d He added, \u201cwe all know the enormous influence that he has.\u2019\u2019\u201cIt leaves the president orphaned,\u201d Mr. Z\u00e1rate said.During his tenure, however, Mexico saw slow economic growth and a weak peso, and the country\u2019s standing with credit-rating agencies has suffered. Moody\u2019s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings have each lowered their outlook from stable to negative in recent months.Economic performance has been so underwhelming that some analysts believe Mr. Videgaray\u2019s departure was an inevitability discussed well before Mr. Trump\u2019s visit. Furthermore, Mr. Videgaray is rumored to be a possible P.R.I. candidate for the governorship of the State of Mexico.\u201cI see this as a clear electoral play,\u201d said Genaro Lozano, a professor of United States government and society at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. \u201cThe State of Mexico is what they are betting on, what they have their eye on. It is one of the largest states in terms of population, with a solid and powerful P.R.I. structure, electoral support base and political mobilization. Even if they would put Trump\u2019s cousin as candidate for governor, P.R.I. would win.\u201dThe cabinet shuffle occurred a day before the Mexican government was scheduled to present its 2017 budget, a job that now shifts to the new finance minister, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, whose appointment was announced at the news conference.Mr. Meade, 47, who has a doctorate in economics from Yale University, has been a significant player in the last two administrations. He was finance minister under Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s predecessor, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto made him the foreign minister in 2012. In that post, he broke from his reputation as an apolitical technocrat when he led an angry defense of the government against a United Nations report condemning Mexico for its use of torture on suspects in detention.Thirteen months ago, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto appointed him to head the Social Development Ministry, a post that elevated Mr. Meade to the level of a possible presidential candidate as he traveled around the country promoting the government\u2019s programs for the poor.Paulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yesterday, Outraged by Apple\u2019s Tax Dodge. Today, by Its Tax Bill.", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax avoidance has become a lightning rod as the presidential campaign has taken on a strong populist cast, and leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress have demanded that companies be forced to pay their fair share. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have vowed to crack down on deals that allow companies to relocate their headquarters overseas to lower their tax bills, and the Treasury Department has made limiting international loopholes a priority.And for at least some American politicians, the anger stems from a simple calculation: The tax money that the European Union extracts from Apple should be going to the United States Treasury, not that they have figured out how to make that happen.Most lawmakers and business groups do not see it that way. They defended Apple by arguing that the European Union was overstepping its authority and reinterpreting international tax law to unfairly penalize the company. Some called it a new brand of protectionism.In Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe.The European Commission \u201cis using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view,\u201d Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend\u2019s meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies.He pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion, saying legislation that prevents companies from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the United States \u201cwill see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration.\u201dThe European Commission\u2019s ruling has even managed to forge a rare moment of agreement between the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who is likely to become the next leader of his party in the Senate.\u201cThis decision is awful,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement. \u201cSlamming a company with a giant tax bill \u2014 years after the fact \u2014 sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201dMr. Schumer said in an interview that he and Mr. Ryan had been discussing possibilities for a corporate tax overhaul for next year. He said he was optimistic about the prospect of requiring corporate money to return to the United States at a lower tax rate, with some of the proceeds being used to fund a large investment in infrastructure.The action taken by the European Union, he said, should be an impetus to get moving on such legislation.\u201cThe European Union is going to grab this money, instead of the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big signpost here for us. Let\u2019s get moving.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect our U.S. tax base. That money sitting over there should be here in the U.S., not in Ireland and not in the E.U.\u201dThe bipartisan \u201cconsensus\u201d that the corporate tax rate should be cut in exchange for loopholes closures emerged in President Obama\u2019s first term, yet Congress has not formally drafted a bill, much less voted on one. Tax experts said that without a deep cut in the tax rate, companies like Apple would be better off paying back taxes in Europe than repatriating their overseas cash.\u201cThis is not taking 13 billion euros out of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s pocket and U.S. taxpayers\u2019 pocket and putting it into Europe,\u201d said Jeffery M. Kadet, a tax lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be bringing this money back to the U.S. anyway.\u201d\u201cJust because it happens to be an American company, to say that the European Union should not take action, I think, is the height of hypocrisy,\u201d Mr. Avi-Yonah said.\u201cThe royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U.S. should be taxed in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cBut Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U.S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland.\u201dBlaming Apple and the Internal Revenue Service, he added, \u201cWhen Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them.\u201dIt remains to be seen if corporate tax reform will be a priority for the next administration, but the language used by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on the campaign trail suggests that it is a strong possibility.Mrs. Clinton has released a formal proposal to prevent so-called corporate inversions and to reward companies that keep their operations in the United States. Mr. Trump, who has called for a boycott of Apple products, has threatened to punish companies that relocate to other countries by imposing taxes on products they sell in the United States.The news that a corporate giant might have evaded billions of dollars in taxes could become another populist rallying cry.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders did so well in the campaign this year,\u201d Mr. Gascoigne, of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said. \u201cPeople are fed up with the kinds of back-room deals that are happening at the large multinational companies at the expense of the American people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manchester Renowned, and Redrawn, by Its Soccer", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMANCHESTER, England \u2014 It is what Gary Neville sees from the roof terrace of his hotel that gives him a sense that something is happening. Not the immediate view to his right of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand at Old Trafford, with the words \u201cManchester United\u201d \u2014 the club Neville supported, represented and captained \u2014 emblazoned in neon red. Neville points, instead, to the view on his distant left.\u201cThere are cranes,\u201d Neville said, scanning the skyline of Manchester and Salford, sister cities so contiguous that their boundaries have melted. \u201cWhen you see cranes, you know that means things are moving. Now, when I look out, I see a lot of cranes. The city feels alive.\u201dDerby day always acts as an adrenaline shot, but this edition is particularly energizing. If United and City\u2019s matching flawless starts to the Premier League season were not enough, then the slew of subplots \u2014 particularly the first meeting on English soil between City\u2019s new manager, Pep Guardiola, and his United rival, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, soccer\u2019s repelling poles \u2014 have turned the game into a must-see event.Both coaches have tried to play down the tension, Guardiola positively sputtering when he was told they represented a Premier League version of Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. \u201cThe question of the rivalry is something the media talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t control it.\u201dBoth, though, know they are fighting a losing battle. The talk, this week, has been of little other than their shared history, the long-running feud that caught fire while Guardiola was at Barcelona and Mourinho at Real Madrid and that is now expected to ignite the Premier League.But there is another story to this derby, one that casts the clubs not in frenzied opposition but in accidental unison. It may not feel like it, but it is this story that matters more to the city.Manchester\u2019s name has always carried certain connotations. To Victorians, it was \u201cfamed and feared\u201d as the world\u2019s first great industrial city, according to the disc jockey and journalist Dave Haslam. It was here that Friedrich Engels found inspiration for \u201cThe Communist Manifesto.\u201dIn the 1960s, the soap opera \u201cCoronation Street\u201d depicted Manchester as a place of cloth caps and cobbled streets, and by the late 1970s, as the city\u2019s industries disappeared and bands like the Smiths and Joy Division documented the bleakness, the music writer Paul Morley believed it a \u201cvery boring place to be.\u201dThis Manchester \u2014 tough, desolate \u2014 still exists, but it is not the only Manchester.During the past 20 years, the city\u2019s authorities have led a physical regeneration, symbolized by the canopy of glass towers that sprang up after a bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army destroyed much of the city center in 1996. The revival of the spirit, though, has come from elsewhere.Music led the way, with the so-called Madchester era of the late 1980s \u2014 centered on the Hacienda nightclub, and bands like Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses \u2014 turning the city\u2019s public image on its head. Abandoned buildings became nightclubs and bars, and a cottage industry of record shops and independent labels flourished in their wake. Music gave the city its confidence back.\u201cAll Manchester is missing is a beach,\u201d the Stone Roses\u2019 Ian Brown once said.Two decades later, the process is the same, but the engine is different. Sports is Manchester\u2019s driving cultural force.\u201cSince the mid-1990s, it has become an increasingly important part of what is special about Manchester,\u201d said Richard Leese, the leader of the Manchester City Council. The city is home to British Cycling\u2019s so-called Medal Factory; its role in recent Olympic successes is such that Manchester will host one of two parades celebrating Britain\u2019s Olympians. Leese\u2019s pride is evident, but it is soccer, he said, that has had the most impact.\u201cThe rivalry between the clubs has enhanced the international consciousness of the city as a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cManchester is the third-most-visited city in Britain. The single biggest draw is football. In most parts of the world, people have heard of Manchester. Without football, that would not have been the case.\u201dAs well as boosting tourism, the combination of City and United serves to advertise Manchester abroad. Both clubs have played their part in turning that into investment. United hosted events while on tour in China this summer to attract businesses to the city, and City, 13 percent owned by a Chinese consortium, welcomed that country\u2019s soccer-mad president, Xi Jinping, to its training facility last year. That, in turn, attracts others.\u201cIt opens the door,\u201d in Leese\u2019s words.\u201cFootball capital of the world is a difficult claim,\u201d Neville said.He does believe, however, that with a soccer-themed hotel and Britain\u2019s National Football Museum, the sport is part of the fabric of Manchester in a way rarely seen elsewhere.That has an impact in the broader cityscape, just as music did in the 1980s. Neville points to the explosion of bars and restaurants in recent years as a consequence of the boom in investment. Some of them \u2014 San Carlo, Wing\u2019s \u2014 have won fame as regular haunts of players; others, like Tapeo, part-owned by United midfielder Juan Mata, are supported by them more directly.\u201cIt feels like a genuine second city to London now,\u201d Neville said.It is around City\u2019s home in the east of the city, though, that the difference soccer has made is most visible, most tangible.\u201cAll of the area was heavily polluted,\u201d said Pete Bradshaw, the club\u2019s director of estate management. \u201cThe stadium itself is built on a mine shaft. There were wireworks, steelworks, dye makers, chemical plants.\u201dBy the 1980s, Bradshaw said, \u201call of that had gone,\u201d taking jobs and much of the local population with it.It was, for many years, a forgotten part of the city. Hundreds of millions of dollars from Abu Dhabi, through City, changed all that.As well as the stadium, the club has built its state-of-the-art training and academy facilities here, but the biggest difference is in the community. City\u2019s investments have also brought a school, a college, a leisure center, a library. There are new housing developments, and access to health care.Bradshaw, a veteran of the regeneration programs of the 1990s, is adamant that \u201cit would not have been possible without the club, not on this scale.\u201dThe work is not yet finished. Cranes dot the skyline here, too, just as they do on the enemy territory over at Old Trafford. Things are happening. Soccer has brought the city to life.Advertisement"}

She was Craig Claiborne\u2019s go-to expert on Jewish cooking in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Her husband, Judah Nadich, was the rabbi of the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan, where Mr. Levin, 38, grew up in what he calls a \u201cconservadox\u201d family.\u201cMy grandmother had a strong influence on me from childhood,\u201d said Mr. Levin, who spent many after-school dates cooking with her. \u201cI still use one of her aprons and some of her favorite pastry tools.\u201dFor the holiday, which starts on Oct. 2, he omits her cloves, allspice and raisins, and adds an apple cider compote to the batter, which moistens the cake and gives it a caramelized apple flavor. On a recent afternoon, he pulled out a cast-aluminum Bundt pan that his grandmother bought at Zabar\u2019s, one he still uses for the cakes she taught him.For the second day of Rosh Hashana, Mrs. Nadich made double-crusted stone fruit and apple pies, her grandson recalled. He also makes fruit pies, but for his plum tart, he uses a sabl\u00e9 butter crust flavored with vanilla bean; a filling made simply of almonds or pistachios, sugar, egg and a bit of flour; and a topping of sliced plums.While preparing the dessert, he demonstrated a few tricks. \u201cWhen you are creaming confectioners\u2019 sugar with the butter,\u201d he said, \u201cthe texture becomes so smooth that there is no coarseness in the crust as there sometimes is using regular sugar.\u201dBecause he puts sugar in the crust and covers it with a sweetened textured almond filling, he does not douse the plums with sugar (though he does sprinkle turbinado sugar on top for added crunch). \u201cThis almond cream has a delicious flavor all of its own, so it accents the plums,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only does it absorb the juice and all the loveliness of the fruit, but it adds flavor to it in the baking process.\u201dMr. Levin prefers using butter in his desserts, but he believes coconut oil is good in a pie crust (in this case, he recommends solid coconut oil); grapeseed oil can be used to cook down fruit; and olive oil is a good substitute in a cake to make it pareve (neither meat nor milk).What would his grandmother think of his modern takes on her baking rituals? \u201cThey might seem strange to her, but she\u2019d love them,\u201d he said.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Georgetown University Plans Steps to Atone for Slave Past", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeorgetown\u2019s president, John J. DeGioia, who announced the measures in a speech on Thursday afternoon, said he would offer a formal apology, create an institute for the study of slavery and erect a public memorial to the slaves whose labor benefited the institution, including those who were sold in 1838 to help keep the university afloat.In addition, two campus buildings will be renamed \u2014 one for an enslaved African-American man and the other for an African-American educator who belonged to a Catholic religious order.Dr. DeGioia\u2019s decision to offer an advantage in admissions to descendants, similar to that offered to the children and grandchildren of alumni, is unprecedented, historians say. The preference will be offered to the descendants of all the slaves whose labor benefited Georgetown, not just the men, women and children sold in 1838.A report released Thursday by a committee convened last year to consider ways the university should address its history with slavery.Professor Wilder, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Dr. DeGioia\u2019s plans to address Georgetown\u2019s history go beyond any initiatives enacted by a university in the past 10 years.\u201cIt goes farther than just about any institution,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s to Georgetown\u2019s credit. It\u2019s taking steps that a lot of universities have been reluctant to take.\u201dBut whether the initiatives result in meaningful change remains to be seen, he said. Professor Wilder cautioned that the significance of the preferential status in admissions would rest heavily on the degree to which Georgetown invested in outreach to descendants, including identifying them, making sure they are aware of the benefit\u2019s existence and actively recruiting them to the university.\u201cThe question of how effective or meaningful this is going to be will only be answered over time,\u201d Professor Wilder said.Dr. DeGioia\u2019s plan, which builds on the recommendations of the committee that he convened last year, represents the university\u2019s first systematic effort to address its roots in slavery. Georgetown, which was founded and run by Jesuit priests in 1789, relied on the Jesuit plantations in Maryland \u2014 and the sale of produce and slaves \u2014 to finance its operations.Dr. DeGioia said he planned to apologize for the wrongs of the past \u201cwithin the framework of the Catholic tradition,\u201d by offering what he described as a Mass of reconciliation in partnership with the Jesuit leadership in the United States and the Archdiocese of Washington.\u201cThis community participated in the institution of slavery,\u2019\u2019 Dr. DeGioia said, addressing a crowd of hundreds of students, faculty members and descendants at Georgetown\u2019s Gaston Hall. \u201cThis original evil that shaped the early years of the Republic was present here. We have been able to hide from this truth, bury this truth, ignore and deny this truth.\u201d\u201cAs a community and as individuals, we cannot do our best work if we refuse to take ownership of such a critical part of our history,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe must acknowledge it.\u201dWhen Dr. DeGioia invited questions from the audience, a man in a gray suit took the microphone. \u201cMy name is Joe Stewart,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cand I am a descendant of the 272.\u201dMr. Stewart, a retired corporate executive and an organizer of a group of more than 300 descendants, expressed gratitude to the university\u2019s working group on slavery and to Dr. DeGioia for their efforts. But he said that descendants, who had not been included as members of the committee, must be involved in decision making on these initiatives moving forward.\u201cOur attitude is nothing about us, without us,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Stewart, who was flanked by five other descendants.In its 102-page report, the committee said that the university\u2019s dependence on slavery was deeper and broader than originally believed.Slave labor and slave sales were envisioned as part of the financing model of the college even before the doors opened in 1789. And slaves were not only forced to work on the Jesuit plantations. Some also toiled on campus, hired from students and other wealthy people.The committee said that it was likely that all of the earliest buildings on campus \u2014 including the ones named for the university leaders who orchestrated the 1838 sale \u2014 were built with slave labor.More historical research needs to be done, the committee said, and that will be coordinated by the new research center, the Institute for the Study of Slavery and its Legacies. The university has already selected the program director for the institute, which will also support Dr. DeGioia\u2019s plans to deepen engagement with descendants of the enslaved.\u201cAll of these will have a substantial financial impact,\u201d said Dr. DeGioia, who believes that Georgetown\u2019s philanthropic community will support his initiatives. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that will not be a constraint.\u201dBut some descendants on Thursday expressed disappointment, saying that the university\u2019s measures were inadequate, given the suffering that their ancestors endured.Karran Harper Royal, a descendant of slaves sold in 1838, said that Georgetown, which has an endowment of $1.45 billion, should have offered scholarships to descendants. And she said that she and others \u201cfelt the sting\u201d of not being formally invited to Dr. DeGioia\u2019s speech.\u201cIt has to go much farther,\u201d said Ms. Harper Royal, who is also an organizer of the group of descendants. \u201cThey\u2019re calling us family. Well, I\u2019m from New Orleans and when we have a gathering, family\u2019s invited.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Last month, two of its buses collided in downtown Newark, leaving two people dead.The cause of the fatal train crash has not been determined. But whether it proves to have been a case of human error or of mechanical failure, it is sure to focus more attention on a transit agency that has been operating in secrecy.New Jersey Transit\u2019s management \u201chas been told to go into a bear cave and disappear until told to come back out,\u201d said Martin E.

How are they covering their day-to-day operating costs?\u201dMr. Robins pointed to the sharp reduction in the annual contribution to New Jersey Transit from the state\u2019s general fund, less than $35 million last year \u2014 about one-tenth of what it was in 2009.\u201cThis is not an incompetent agency,\u201d Mr. Robins said in an interview earlier in the week. \u201cWhat you\u2019re dealing with is an agency that\u2019s being systematically starved.\u201dAnd since November, it has been an agency without an established leader.\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a leadership vacuum at the agency,\u201d Ms. Vanterpool said.On Monday morning, two New Jersey Transit buses collided in the Lincoln Tunnel, injuring dozens of passengers and causing long delays for other commuters trying to get into Manhattan.But according to federal records, the last New Jersey Transit rail accident that resulted in the death of a passenger happened 20 years ago. On a February morning in 1996, a Hoboken-bound train overshot a stopping point and ran into the path of another New Jersey Transit train. The engineers of both trains and one passenger were killed, and more than 160 others were injured.In its 2015 annual report, New Jersey Transit said that it had equipped a locomotive and a cab car with the components needed for the system and that it would start installing hardware along tracks this year \u201cwhen design plans are finalized.\u201d The Federal Railroad Administration said that New Jersey Transit had not yet installed the technology.It was not clear on Thursday whether the system could have prevented the crash in Hoboken.At a news conference, Mr. Christie, a Republican, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, were reluctant to address that question. Mr. Christie said officials first had to determine the cause before deciding what steps should be taken in the future. \u201cWe cannot answer whether any other apparatus or system could have prevented it,\u201d Mr. Christie said.Mr. Cuomo said that the technology could help in some circumstances, but that officials did not yet know why the train was traveling at a high speed.Hundreds of people die on the nation\u2019s rails each year, but the vast majority of them are motorists or pedestrians who get in the paths of trains and are struck. Workplace accidents kill railroad workers far less often, but still fairly regularly.Passenger fatalities are much rarer, about seven for every 100 million miles traveled by passenger trains. But there have been some major, recent exceptions.Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The daughter, who lives in Britain, now has a child.And so the Balsaras, who, as Parsees, are followers of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster, are among the crowds who pray for Ganesh\u2019s blessing. The giant plaster-of-paris statue of Ganesh before them is the most famous in Khetwadi, one of Mumbai\u2019s oldest, densest neighborhoods, near where the festival was first celebrated.More than 160,000 Ganesh statues had already been dropped in the city\u2019s waterways, some just a foot tall and worshiped in people\u2019s homes, others close to 30 feet high, paid for by politicians and businessmen as centers for worship and merriment at the festival.Worship of an elephant in the Indian subcontinent can be traced to about 325 B.C., with Ganesh becoming part of the Hindu pantheon around the fifth century, and then being absorbed into Buddhism and Jainism in the ensuing centuries.In the 17th century, Shivaji, a ruler after whom Mumbai\u2019s train station and airport are named, spread worship of Ganesh to the wider population in his kingdom in western India. In the late 19th century, after the British banned political gatherings, a leader of India\u2019s independence movement got the idea of spreading nationalist sentiment by organizing a street festival around Ganesh.\u201cThe objective was to create an awakening among the people against British rule,\u201d said Madhukar Keshav Dhavalikar, a former archaeology professor and former director of Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute in Pune, India.The festival spread across the country, although Mumbai remains its heart and soul. In the same chawl where it all began in the late 19th century, residents, some of whose families have lived there for three generations, keep the tradition alive.They have succeeded in holding onto the tradition\u2019s low-key origins, centered on cultural activities, even as the festival has evolved into an ever-noisier competition for the largest, most beautiful statue.Despite the surrounding city, the community has maintained its village feel. On Wednesday, the courtyard in the chawl was an oasis of calm in the midst of all the urban hustle. Children ran in and out of the apartments, most of which had their doors wide open; women wearing saris cooked dinner; and men in shorts napped and watched TV.\u201cYou can just enter anyone\u2019s room,\u201d said Vinod Satpute, a 58-year-old flight attendant with Air India, whose parents moved to the chawl decades ago. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s eating or sleeping. That\u2019s his problem.\u201dA few streets down, vast crowds gathered around the Khetwadi Cha Ganraj. The first statue went up here in the neighborhood\u2019s Lane No. 12 in 1959, and this year\u2019s celebration cost close to $75,000, financed in large part by corporate donations.In addition to many flower garlands, this Ganesh wears a 33-pound necklace of pure gold, the gift of an anonymous donor in 2008, said Ganesh Mathur, who was among those in charge of the Khetwadi Cha Ganraj this year.Along the street, almost every alley has been transformed into a tent with an enormous Ganesh inside. Crowds throng, buying cotton candy, toys, tea and watermelon slices, as couples and families make a day of visiting the idols. Lines snake around almost every tent, inside of which crowds gape at the latest iteration of the revered god.At the Khetwadi Cha Ganraj, it was time for the evening prayers. As they finished, workers on ladders used peacock feathers to dust Ganesh\u2019s massive arms and pink fingernails. Then they began replacing the deity\u2019s many flower garlands with fresh ones.At that, the Balsaras, until now engaged in deep prayer at the back of the room, rushed forward and shouted to the attendants over the temple music that they wanted to take the discarded garlands home.Mr. Balsara, 77, and Mrs. Balsara, 64, said they had not been able to think of any major family or business problem that needed overcoming, so this year they offered more general prayers, wishing happiness for everyone.In minutes, they were weaving their way through the motorcycles and street vendors outside, arms buried in red and white flowers, convinced that another great year lay in store for them and for everyone else.Ayesha Venkataraman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That second subpoena sought a broad range of information, including expenses, agendas and correspondence that related to donations received by the nonprofit.Its lawyers also withheld some documents \u2014 meetings and communications between the Campaign for One New York and the mayor\u2019s office \u2014 requested by the state panel, known as Jcope, in its first subpoena, citing various exemptions to disclosure, including attorney-client privilege and trade secrets.Justice Hartman, at one point, accused the nonprofit\u2019s lawyers of circular reasoning, writing that the Campaign for One New York \u201cinsists that, because it asserts that it did not lobby the mayor but only advised him, Jcope is precluded from obtaining communications between the mayor and the campaign.\u201d\u201cBut having laid a proper foundation,\u201d she continued, \u201cJcope is entitled to review them and make its own determination.\u201dLaurence Laufer, a lawyer for the nonprofit, said that while they were reviewing the decision, \u201cJcope has not conducted this investigation in good faith,\u201d and that no evidence of lobbying by the nonprofit had been provided. The panel, Mr. Laufer said, \u201cshould conclude this politicized investigation.\u201dSome of Mr. Laufer\u2019s own communications, including notes on a phone call, were withheld under attorney-client privilege. The judge ordered those documents turned over and, more broadly, said the investigation and its most recent subpoena were not harassment or a fishing expedition, but rather \u201cstood on firm factual ground.\u201d\u201cThe mayor is a public official,\u201d Justice Hartman wrote. \u201cAny attempt by Campaign to influence the mayor may have constituted lobbying.\u201dDaniel J. Horwitz, the chairman of the state ethics panel, said in a statement that the panel was \u201cpleased with the decision\u201d and \u201cwill continue to robustly enforce the law.\u201dThe court hearing, originally closed to the public but opened after a motion by The New York Times, culminated a bitter and public feud between the state panel and the nonprofit\u2019s lawyers, who suggested the inquiry had been motivated by a political desire to hurt the mayor on the part of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat. The state panel has denied any political motivation behind its investigation.The nonprofit \u201chas not demonstrated that any of the subpoenaed documents are privileged or otherwise exempt from disclosure,\u201d Justice Hartman wrote, with the exception of documents from 2013 \u2014 which she said were not relevant to the inquiry \u2014 and four other documents that might be covered by attorney-client privilege. She ordered those documents to be turned over for review by the court to see if the privilege applies.Advertisement"}

It warned that expansion could slow more and said that it would maintain a program to pump more cash into the financial system to bolster the eurozone economy.\u201cWe see that our monetary policy is effective,\u201d Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, said. \u201cInterest rates have to be low today to be high tomorrow.\u201dEconomists say the bank is moving slowly because with interest rates already at record lows, traditional monetary policy is at its limits.Mr. Draghi and his colleagues have already unleashed an arsenal of unconventional tools, including:\u25a0 Negative deposit rates, which effectively require banks to pay to store cash in the central bank\u2019s vaults, giving them an added incentive to lend it out instead.\u25a0 Quantitative easing, where the central bank buys 80 billion euros, or about $90 billion, of government and corporate bonds each month in an effort to reduce market interest rates to stimulate the economy.\u25a0 Flooding banks with cheap money to encourage them to lend to individuals and businesses.Though the central bank has fallen short of its target of pushing inflation to just under 2 percent \u2014 it has been hovering at 0.2 percent for the last two months \u2014 the bank argues that its policies have averted deflation and encouraged economic growth. Its policies have also helped weaken the euro, which indirectly benefits the economy \u2014 a weaker currency typically encourages inflation and makes eurozone exports look cheaper compared with those from rival countries.\u201cThe jury is still out on whether this is effective,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING-DiBa in Frankfurt. \u201cThe E.C.B. likes to say that if they hadn\u2019t done it, the world would look much worse. I believe that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s something we can\u2019t really prove.\u201dIf more measures are needed, the central bank could move further into unconventional territory by buying stocks as well as bonds. And it could also provide \u201chelicopter money\u201d \u2014 giving cash directly to households to increase spending. But Mr. Draghi will probably need time to prepare public opinion for any such moves, and he said that neither measure was discussed at Thursday\u2019s meeting.\u201cThe economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still-subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties following the U.K. referendum outcome.\u201dMuch remains unclear about the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. Among the possible repercussions:\u25a0 Trade with Britain could be affected, depending on the terms of the final deal between London and Brussels. The fall in the value of the pound could also make British exports more competitive, while making Continental European products more expensive in Britain.\u25a0 Companies, including ones in London\u2019s prized financial services industry, could desert Britain for the Continent to ensure continued access to the eurozone market.For the moment, the central bank has not taken any direct measures to address concerns stemming from \u201cBrexit.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.\u201cIn order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level.\u201dThe unemployment rate across the eurozone stands above 10 percent. Household spending is restricted. Demand across the region is weak. And the advice from several officials, including Mr. Draghi, has been clear: Governments must spend more.The central bank\u2019s policies can create the conditions for more growth and investment, Mr. Brzeski said, \u201cbut they simply can\u2019t force people or companies to invest. That\u2019s why the discussion is gradually moving toward\u201d what role \u201cgovernments should play.\u201dThat may seem to be an unexceptional view, but it is a major departure from the consensus in a bloc dominated by Germany, which has long pushed for balanced budgets. In a sign that times may be changing, even Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, recently suggested the possibility of tax cuts after elections in autumn 2017.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Conflicting Policy From Trump: To Keep, and Remove, Tax Cut", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A few hours after Donald J. Trump publicly backed away from a $1 trillion tax cut for small businesses, campaign aides on Thursday privately assured a leading small-business group that Mr. Trump in fact remained committed to the proposal \u2014 winning the group\u2019s endorsement.Call it the trillion-dollar lie: Both assertions cannot be true.In this case, however, telling two versions of the same story benefited the Trump campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re comfortable\u201d that Mr. Trump is committed to preserving the tax break, Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the group, said Friday morning. \u201cWe have it directly from his campaign.\u201dThe Tax Foundation was not so comfortable.\u201cThere is a disconnect between the plan as understood by us and the plan as understood by the N.F.I.B.,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist at the foundation who worked on the cost estimate that Mr. Trump cited in his speech. \u201cAnd I think your inquiry into this is probably a productive one.\u201dSteven Mnuchin, Mr. Trump\u2019s finance chairman, said Friday that the campaign\u2019s tax plan had not changed at any point on Thursday.He said Mr. Trump was proposing to let any business pay the same low tax rate, 15 percent, on all income retained for business purposes. In effect, that would apply corporate tax rates to some passthrough income.\u201cThe intent of the plan is that big and small businesses have tax relief,\u201d he said.He declined to comment on the conflicting accounts provided by the two groups.There is much at stake in the details, both in tax dollars and in the politics of a tax-code overhaul. Passthrough businesses, which range from mom-and-pop shops to law firms and large real estate partnerships, have become increasingly common in recent decades and now produce more than half of all business income. Under current law, that income is passed through to the tax returns of the business owners, where it is taxed at the same rates as a worker\u2019s wages.Corporations generally pay a lower tax rate, but shareholders must also pay a second round of taxes on any corporate profits distributed as dividends.Both Democrats and Republicans want to overhaul the corporate tax system, which combines a high headline rate with endless loopholes.But the question of what to do about passthroughs has bedeviled those efforts. Democrats have resisted changes to small-business taxes because they have not wanted to lower the top income tax rates for individuals \u2014 the rates small businesses pay. Republicans have stood firmly against a tax overhaul for corporations only, worrying that leaving small-business taxes unchanged would look elitist.That standoff has left intact a corporate tax code that both sides believe has put American companies at a global disadvantage.Mr. Trump proposed last year to sharply reduce the corporate rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent, and to apply the same rate to passthrough income. Democrats sharply criticized that proposal as a giveaway to the owners of passthrough businesses, a group that includes many real estate developers like Mr. Trump, because they would not need to pay a second round of taxes on dividends. The Tax Foundation says it would cost the government about $1 trillion over 10 years.On Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign initially indicated that it had decided to abandon that plan.Mr. Trump took the stage at the Waldorf Astoria, before the members of the Economic Club of New York, and declared that his new tax plan would cost just $2.6 trillion, far less than the estimated $10 trillion price tag for the previous version of his plan.That estimated cost came from the Tax Foundation, which performed an analysis based on the specific changes detailed by the Trump campaign, including the elimination of the small-business tax cut, the Tax Foundation\u2019s Mr. Cole said.The Trump campaign also issued a summary of the proposal that said Mr. Trump intended to reduce the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent, but made no mention of passthroughs.Mr. Mozloom said his group, which strongly advocates a small-business cut, was surprised and reached out to the campaign. A few hours later, convinced by campaign aides that Mr. Trump intended to keep the tax break, the N.F.I.B. renewed its endorsement.\u201cWe strongly support Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to create a single business tax rate that would create parity between small businesses and their larger competitors,\u201d Juanita Duggan, the group\u2019s president, said in the statement.The Trump campaign also changed the language of its proposal to refer to the \u201cbusiness\u201d tax rate rather than \u201ccorporate\u201d tax rate.But after learning about the endorsement Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cole of the Tax Foundation said that he spoke again to the campaign and that he was assured Mr. Trump still intended to eliminate the tax cut. The campaign told him it was making a more modest change in the plan that would reduce taxation for some small businesses.The details of the Trump campaign\u2019s plan remain unclear, as does the cost.\u201cThere is a proposal and it\u2019s in the process of being priced out and some details are being filled in,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, an economic commentator and adviser to Mr. Trump. \u201cIf Mr. Trump becomes president and submits this legislation, it will all have to get worked through,\u201d he said.Kyle Pomerleau, the Tax Foundation\u2019s director of federal projects, said he had hoped to publish an analysis of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan on Friday, but it remained incomplete.\u201cAs time goes on,\u201d he said, \u201cunfortunately things are becoming less clear.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

About five of the items are museum-worthy. But when asked if she had considered donating an Atelier Versace gown, a Valentino something, even her stripy workout leotard to, perhaps, the Met Costume Institute, she offered an unyielding \u201cNo.\u201dMs. Fonda is auctioning her possessions (698 items in all, mostly clothing) in a housecleaning exercise. \u201cI had to do jobs to pay for my storage,\u201d she said of the units she had maintained since her 2001 divorce from the media mogul Ted Turner. \u201cBecause Ted did not like to carry a lot of luggage on his jet \u2014 it was too burdensome \u2014 I would have to buy things in bulk\u201d for their travels to his many properties.Parting with mementos was tough yet ultimately worthwhile. \u201cLighter,\u201d she said of her sense of relief on clearing the space.Here, Ms. Fonda tells the stories behind some pieces going under the gavel.10 PhotosMs. Fonda wore the Yves Saint Laurent pantsuit below when she claimed the Oscar as best actress in 1972. The somber black ensemble, with its sharp Mao-collar jacket, reflected the Communist sympathies she had developed before buying the suit in 1968.Ms. Fonda had just given birth to her daughter Vanessa Vadim, and during her pregnancy said she had grown horrified watching French television broadcasts of the attacks on North Vietnam. By the time of the Oscars Ms. Fonda was divorcing Mr. Vadim, and though she had hung on to her haute couture, she had exchanged her New Wave lifestyle for a self-financed two-year antiwar lecture tour across the United States. The Hollywood establishment feared she would use the Oscars as another stop on it.\u201cI wanted to make a speech about Vietnam,\u201d Ms. Fonda admitted of the ceremony. Instead, she listened to her father, Henry Fonda, who advised her to refrain from politicking at the podium.\u201cHe said to me: \u2018Just say: \u2018There is a lot to be said. But tonight is not the time.\u2019 So I did. And I wore something that made a statement. It was not a time for showy dresses. It was a time for seriousness.\u201dBefore Yeezy, there was Fonda. Ms. Fonda introduced her own line of luxe exercise apparel in 1984, after her workout book and its video adaptation, both fronted by an image of her in this black and red leotard, had dominated best-seller lists for years. Though films like \u201cFlashdance\u201d and \u201cPerfect\u201d made aerobics gear au courant, Ms. Fonda\u2019s namesake aerobics label proved too fashion-forward and quickly folded.The 40 pieces from Atelier Versace that Ms. Fonda is auctioning are the standouts of the sale. The garments run the gamut from her flamboyant Oscar gowns to embellished couture that Lesage, the venerable Paris embroidery house, produced by channeling Gianni Versace\u2019s inimitable rock-star take on Picasso\u2019s Rose Period and Robert Delaunay\u2019s abstract paintings.Many of the pieces were selected for Ms. Fonda by Mr. Versace after they met in 1989. In the midst of divorcing her second husband, Tom Hayden, at the time, she had controversially acquired breast implants and was dating a 35-year-old Italian soccer goalkeeper, Lorenzo Caccialanza.\u201cI was in Italy with him, and I met Gianni then,\u201d Ms. Fonda recalled. \u201cGianni kind of took me under his wing. And whenever I would do a red carpet, he would supply my clothes. He gave me dresses, belts, gloves and shoes. He was very generous.\u201dMs. Fonda sees no conflict between her political stances and her flaunting of Versace, a label that was often criticized for dressing supermodels in bondage numbers. \u201cI used to think, \u2018I have to be very serious,\u2019\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut being a feminist is not about the antithesis of being sexy or looking good.\u201dAlthough her life eventually reflected the part she had played \u2014 a film star who \u201cgave it all up\u201d to become the wife of an industrialist \u2014 she made good use of her glam wardrobe. A decade after making the movie, Ms. Fonda quit acting and donned the floor-length lace \u201cRollover\u201d gown to marry Mr. Turner. A sumptuous sequined velvet gown from the film went to the White House when Ms. Fonda accompanied him to a 1994 dinner for the Emperor and Empress of Japan.\u201cI am very much in favor of wearing things more than once,\u201d Ms. Fonda said.Two months went into the making of this Schiaparelli couture gown, which Ms. Fonda wore at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival premiere of \u201cYouth.\u201d Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s drama, in which Ms. Fonda portrayed an aging starlet, was competing for the Palme d\u2019Or prize. \u201cJane was very proud of the movie, and she wanted to make a special moment of the premiere,\u201d said a Schiaparelli spokeswoman who worked on the dress with Ms. Fonda and her stylist, Tanya Gill.So in a departure from the body-hugging Versace dresses Ms. Fonda has made her signature at Cannes, working the red carpet as a L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris spokeswoman (the cosmetics company sponsors the festival), she opted for a regal full skirt and bustle-back gown, which was adapted from a 1952 Elsa Schiaparelli design.\u201cIt was a lot of fun to wear,\u201d Ms. Fonda said. \u201cIt felt really good.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "And Now, Presidential Dog Days", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI think it\u2019s time to talk about the presidential candidates\u2019 pets.Look, you need a break. And everybody \u2014 or almost everybody \u2014 likes an animal story. I\u2019m not quite sure about Donald Trump, but we\u2019ll get to him in a minute.Pets, particularly dogs, pop up all the time in White House lore. Richard Nixon might never have even gotten there if he hadn\u2019t used Checkers the cocker spaniel as a diversion from a campaign finance scandal. Lyndon Johnson posed \u2014 for reasons we will never understand \u2014 picking up his beagle by the ears. The d\u00e9cor at one Obama White House holiday party was many variations on the theme of Bo. This tradition goes way back. James Garfield had a Newfoundland named Veto. Calvin Coolidge seems to have acquired four cats, seven birds, nine dogs, two lion cubs, a raccoon, a bear, a wallaby, an antelope and 13 ducks.I used to enjoy occasionally pointing out that Mitt Romney had once driven his family to Canada with Seamus the Irish setter strapped to the roof of the car. A campaign consultant told me that the Seamus story elicited stronger reactions from focus groups than any other aspect of the 2012 campaign.Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have any pets, and the animal anecdotes about him seem to be \u2026 unsettling. Clinton has had a number of dogs and cats, but their stories are generally \u2026 kind of boring. While she was first lady, Clinton wrote a book called \u201cDear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids\u2019 Letters to the First Pets.\u201d In it, you can learn that Socks the cat\u2019s tail was one foot long.Socks, the most famous of the Clinton pets, has since passed away. So has Buddy the Labrador retriever, who was replaced by another chocolate Lab named \u2014 yes! \u2014 Seamus. This is a total coincidence. Right now the Clintons have a couple of fuzzy little dogs along the poodle line.If Trump has ever in his life had a pet, his campaign doesn\u2019t know about it. There\u2019s some question, in fact, about whether he\u2019s ever even had an animal friend. For a while, there was a story about Trump begging for prayers for a Lab named Spinee who was undergoing major surgery. I am very, very sorry to tell you that this appears to be a total fabrication.There are two colorful stories about Trump\u2019s previous encounters with animals in books written by ex-employees.The first goes back to the 1980s, when Trump was in his first bloom of glitzy celebrity and acquired a promising 2-year-old racehorse named Alibi. John O\u2019Donnell, a former Trump casino president, wrote that the colt fell apart when Trump insisted, despite the trainer\u2019s objections, that Alibi be worked out even though a virus was going through his barn. O\u2019Donnell claimed Alibi got very sick as a result \u2014 so ill he eventually had to have some of his hooves amputated and was retired. Then, O\u2019Donnell said, Trump announced that he was not buying a defective animal and backed out of the sale.\u201cJack O\u2019Donnell is a disgruntled former employee, and this is a totally unsubstantiated and false claim,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign.A quiz: Match the president to his pet.You decide who\u2019s right. The one thing we do know for sure is that when Trump first bought Alibi, he changed the poor horse\u2019s name to D. J. Trump.The other, much less depressing story involves a chicken named Ginger, who once played tic-tac-toe with Trump at a casino near Palm Springs. Like so very many things in our world, the casino had Trump\u2019s name on it, but it was owned by someone else \u2014 in this case an Indian tribe.Perhaps you have never seen a tic-tac-toe-playing chicken, but they\u2019ve been around a long time. According to Gary Green, another former Trump casino executive who wrote a book, a computer under the board lit up a square, and if the chicken pecked it, said bird got some corn. Hey, it\u2019s a job.After the game was over \u2014 Trump won \u2014 Green ran an advertising campaign that featured Trump firing Ginger and starting a Chicken Apprentice contest for a replacement. While Ginger\u2019s fate was not described explicitly, the casino started serving chicken wings as part of the promotion.Beyond that, connections between Trump and the animal kingdom seem pretty sparse \u2014 if you ignore Jane Goodall\u2019s recent comment to The Atlantic that his performances \u201cremind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance issues.\u201d Bloggers have pointed out that Trump tweets a lot of unflattering dog references. (\u201c\u2026 cheated on him like a dog \u2026\u201d) It is true that he does seem to specialize in insult via canine analogy. I once got a letter from him suggesting I resembled a dog. He did not seem to be thinking about my large, friendly eyes.If he wins the election, we could have the first president in history to refuse to pardon the Thanksgiving turkey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Having Won Re-election, a Black Mayor Is Out to Win Every Voter\u2019s Heart", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPhenix City JournalPHENIX CITY, Ala. \u2014 Eddie Lowe, this city\u2019s first-ever black mayor, could feel the white anxiety here.It was early September in Phenix City, a small east Alabama borough where the percentage of African-Americans has risen over the decades, to the point that they are nearly on a par with whites. Voters had just re-elected Mr. Lowe to a second four-year term \u2014 and, for the first time, elected a 3-to-2 black majority to the City Council.This new reality, Mr. Lowe\u2019s predecessor told a local paper, had created a \u201cgreat division\u201d between blacks and whites in the city of 37,500, and was stoking fears among white residents that minorities would be favored in future board appointments.A few white residents had begun posting racist reactions on social media: On Aug. 28, five days after the election, one man wrote on Facebook that it \u201cmay be time to throw in the towel and admit \u2018the brothas rule.\u2019\u201d A young black activist, meanwhile, had been publicly provoking them by declaring that Phenix City was now \u201cChocolate City.\u201dThe crisis seemed emblematic of this fragile American moment, in which white voters\u2019 fear of diminished political clout has helped fuel the rise of Donald J. Trump. But there was also something distinctly American about the response from Mr. Lowe, a twice-weekly attendee of the Greater Mount Zion Baptist Church and former defensive captain of the University of Alabama football team. On Sept. 8, he held a news conference that turned out to be more of a sermon, mixed with an impassioned locker-room speech.Mr. Lowe is 56 and maintains a linebacker\u2019s form, with dump-truck shoulders and the kind of large, blocky hands one finds on workers in social realist murals. His father was a sharecropper and brick mason. Mr. Lowe, as a child, played football in an empty lot on the poor, black south side of Phenix City, sometimes with an empty bean can in place of a ball. At Alabama, he earned a degree in finance. Today, he is a senior vice president at a bank.Every day, Mr. Lowe teaches himself a new word from the dictionary and reads a chapter of Proverbs. He revels in the occasional dip into cornpone Southern slang. His management theory: Don\u2019t be a caitiff (\u201cYou can look that up,\u201d he said) but rather, a \u201csho nuff leader.\u201d By which he means: Don\u2019t make it about you. Take your knocks if you must. Love people. Lead by example.\u201cYou have to be consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to show and be that person, and be willing to take the bumps and bruises.\u201dMr. Lowe, a part-time mayor, is zealous to an almost Trumpian degree in his promotion of Phenix City. It is a former cotton-mill town somewhat lacking in charm that now serves as a bedroom community to Columbus, Ga., and the Fort Benning military base across the Chattahoochee River. He knows that the city is still half white, and that he will need white support for his visions, like his plan to create a downtown park that will honor Alabama\u2019s fallen military heroes.On race, Mr. Lowe calls himself \u201ckind of a Pollyanna, utopia guy.\u201d He credits football \u2014 even though the football life was not always utopian. His college career began in 1978 at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where during his freshman year most of the black players quit in a protest over the lack of African-Americans on the coaching staff. Mr. Lowe said that he and one other black player refused to quit. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t raise me that way,\u201d he said. The criticism, he recalled, rained down from all sides. \u201cIt got so bad you couldn\u2019t even go to class,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even get a hamburger.\u201dHe transferred to Alabama, and played under the famed coach Paul (Bear) Bryant. Then he was off to the Canadian Football League, where he spent nine years with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. \u201cYou play with guys from all over the world, all over the country,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent cultures, different beliefs, different backgrounds, just totally different.\u201d If \u201ca bunch of dumb jocks\u201d could unite and seek a common goal, he added, why can\u2019t everyone?He helped establish the White Water Classic, a yearly football game between two historically black colleges, Albany State and Tuskegee Universities. And he worked on improving Phenix City\u2019s reputation, still damaged from midcentury, when it was a thriving hub of gambling, prostitution and crime that catered to \u2014 and preyed upon \u2014 the soldiers from Fort Benning.Changes in the old racial dynamic had been brewing since 2008, when a white barber and longtime liberal on race issues, James Wetzel, was elected to the City Council and soon formed a coalition with the Council\u2019s two black members. They hired the first black city manager, Wallace B. Hunter, and began spreading public investments around town after years in which, Mr. Wetzel said, funding had seemed concentrated on the wealthy and largely white north side.Mr. Wetzel said that some north-side whites used racist language to paint him as a race traitor. But not all of them.\u201cI think Phenix City is typical of small Southern cities that are going through the transition,\u201d said Mr. Wetzel, who was defeated for re-election in 2012. \u201cThe old, hard racial sentiment of the older people, that\u2019s dying out. The white people, age 50 on down, they really don\u2019t have those sentiments, unless they\u2019re really hard-core uneducated rednecks.\u201dRacial tensions continued through Mr. Lowe\u2019s first term, however. In May 2014, his brother, Woodrow Lowe, a former linebacker with the San Diego Chargers, was fired from his head coaching job at the main public high school, after a 33-13 record in four seasons. (In his last season as coach, the team went 6-4.) Around that time, the City Council, in a 3-to-2 vote that split on racial lines, also fired Mr. Hunter. But the Council rehired Mr. Hunter two weeks later after hundreds of black residents rallied, raising questions about the treatment of both men.Today, the mayor declines to speak about the episodes and the role race might have played. He does not see what good it will do.He won the Aug. 23 election with 59 percent of the vote, proving that there are many whites here who are comfortable with black leadership. But the lingering grievances are real. Some residents, on social media, have criticized the White Water Classic and the celebrations around it because they catered to blacks. \u201cDid anyone win the CHOCOLATE CITY CLASSIC?\u201d one man wrote on Facebook on Sept. 10, the night of the game.Others questioned Mr. Lowe\u2019s assertion that the game was an economic boon for Phenix City. Mr. Lowe, in rebuttal, points to an in-house study that shows that the net gain for the city in the White Water Classic\u2019s first two years was nearly $600,000.Two days after the game, Mr. Lowe stopped by a TV station in Columbus for an on-camera interview, where he discussed, somewhat vaguely, the reasons he called the news conference. Afterward, the anchor, Mercer Van Schoor, asked, as if seeking reassurance: \u201cYou don\u2019t like \u2018Chocolate City\u2019?\u201d\u201cWell, listen, no,\u201d Mr. Lowe said. \u201cWe are one Phenix City, as I\u2019ve been saying. Positively one Phenix City.\u201dDriving around town in his tiny sedan, Mr. Lowe showed off the empty lots where he wants to put his military park. He vowed never to replace a white good-old-boy system with a black one. Running the city competently and fairly, he said, would demonstrate his character. He is optimistic enough to believe that this might even change the hearts of Phenix City\u2019s staunchest racists.He smiled.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that gorilla out-love us,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dede Wilsey Is the Defiant Socialite", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRUTHERFORD, Calif. \u2014 Dede Wilsey was fuming.For the past year, the San Francisco socialite has been fending off those who would like to see her forced out of the museums she has lavished with her time and money for two decades. That, at least, is how Ms. Wilsey, 72, describes the recent turmoil.During lunch at her Napa Valley estate, a white Maltese sat on her lap, sniffing a plate of sliced peaches and cantaloupe. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat me,\u201d Ms. Wilsey said, stroking the dog, Dazzle. The top of its head was stained pink from her lipstick kisses. \u201cYou will see me prevail. That\u2019s what you will see.\u201dHer coal eyes flashed when she was asked to identify the anonymous wag who had told a reporter her run had come to an end. \u201cI have no idea, and I\u2019d like to kill them,\u201d Ms. Wilsey said. No one was going to run her out, she added. She would remain, overseeing politics and fund-raising. And to her detractors she would like to say: \u201cYou will look like a bunch of idiots. And I am going to laugh myself silly.\u201dHer name is on the Diane B. Wilsey Center for the Opera. She raised funds to restore Grace Cathedral, one of the city\u2019s fabled landmarks, and a Catholic girls school in the Mission District. But Ms. Wilsey is best known for her patronage of the de Young in Golden Gate Park. Many people credit her with saving it after the original 1919 structure was damaged in the 1989 earthquake. She led the campaign to raise $208 million to build a new one, donating $10 million herself and sweet-talking or strong-arming the balance through her deep connections to Northern California\u2019s aristocrats.But friends and others who acknowledge her charitable works say she can be dismissive of less prominent peers, especially those who clash with her. Her stepson, Sean Wilsey, cast her as a ruthless gold digger in his acclaimed 2005 memoir, \u201cOh, the Glory of It All.\u201d\u201cShe can laugh and joke with anyone, even a truck driver,\u201d said Harry Parker, the Fine Arts Museums\u2019 director from 1987 to 2005. \u201cHer failing is that she has not always listened to what people told her if they didn\u2019t have social standing.\u201dIn the end, Ms. Wilsey believes, her critics will be silenced. With the millions of dollars she has given to San Francisco institutions, she believes she should be praised, not pilloried.\u201cI personally feel they should be erecting a statue to me,\u201d she said.\u201cI know you are in town, and I know why you are calling,\u201d said the husky voice on the other end of the telephone. \u201cBut I don\u2019t talk about my friends.\u201dSpeaking was Denise Hale, one of the city\u2019s grande dames, whose late husband earned a fortune running department stores. San Francisco society is dominated by wealthy families who settled there generations earlier. They include the Bechtels (who made their money in construction), the Hellmans (finance), the Gettys (oil), the Fishers (retail) and the Wilseys (real estate).The people who are part of this small, exclusive world close ranks when a scandal breaks. \u201cI think people are loath to criticize society people because of the money,\u201d said Lois Lehrman, who owned the society magazine Nob Hill Gazette for three decades.A number of philanthropists refused to be interviewed for this article, including Vanessa Getty, a socialite and museum trustee with Ms. Wilsey, and the heiress Charlotte Mailliard Shultz, San Francisco\u2019s chief of protocol.\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the people who serve on boards,\u201d said Willie Brown, a former mayor of San Francisco. \u201cThey are shrewd. It is no different than the world of politics.\u201dAnd politics is something Ms. Wilsey understands all too well. She was born in Washington, D.C., in 1944, the second of three children of Wiley T. Buchanan Jr., the chief of protocol under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Her father also served as ambassador to Luxembourg and Austria. Ms. Wilsey\u2019s mother, Ruth, 98, is an heir to the Dow Chemical fortune. As a girl, Ms. Wilsey accompanied her parents to Europe, where they dined with royal families and heads of state. She summered at the family\u2019s estate, once owned by the Vanderbilts, in Newport, R.I.\u201cI sort of always had social standing because my parents did,\u201d she said.At her Napa Valley estate, Dazzle frolicked on the grass with another Maltese, Twinkle. A fountain gurgled. The outdoor table was set with pink monogrammed linens framed by nosegays of fragrant pink roses. To Ms. Wilsey\u2019s left was a brass bell. She rang it when she wanted the cook\u2019s attention.Picking at a skewer of grilled chicken, she said she was overweight as a child and vowed never to be fat again. \u201cI\u2019m a middle child,\u201d she said. \u201cI was also the one nobody listened to.\u201d That caused tension, she said, with her older sister, Bonnie, whom she looked up to. \u201cMy father would say: \u2018This is my pretty daughter, Bonnie. And this is my smart daughter, Dede.\u2019 Do you think I wanted to be \u2018smart\u2019? I just wanted to be dumb and pretty. I just wanted once to have him say, \u2018This is my dumb, pretty daughter, Dede.\u2019\u201dBeauty, though, is relative. Ms. Wilsey was on the cover of Town & Country in June 1962, her svelte figure wrapped in yards of fabric and white lace. She was a debutante, and her father wrote in the magazine about her coming out. At 1 a.m., the guests gathered at \u201cDede\u2019s Peppermint Lounge,\u201d a custom-made dance club designed by Valerian Rybar, a prominent interior decorator at the time. The Bo Diddley Trio played that night; guests did the step that was all the rage at the time, the twist.By all accounts, Ms. Wilsey found a forgiving patriarch in her second husband. He would whisk her off by helicopter to Mendocino, Calif., for picnics. He didn\u2019t mind her razor-sharp tongue. \u201cNever feel guilty for anything you ever did to me,\u201d she said he told her once, \u201cbecause you make these snarky comments once in awhile.\u201d And every Christmas, they kicked off the social season with a party at their Pacific Heights mansion for about 300 of San Francisco\u2019s elite.Mr. Brown, the former mayor, was a regular. \u201cIt was mandatory,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ever get an invitation, you have to go. If you don\u2019t get invited, that is even worse.\u201dGuests in tuxedos and Oscar de la Renta gowns gathered in a receiving line to pay their respects to the Wilseys. The guest list for the event functioned as an annual measure of social status. \u201cShe was very definitive about who was on the list,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cIt was her statement about who really mattered.\u201dMs. Wilsey has continued to hold the party more than a decade after Mr. Wilsey\u2019s death. But such soirees are more than an opportunity to mingle with society friends; they also provide her with a setting where she can shake down her connected friends for money to benefit the institutions she treasures.\u201cMom and I were dancing at a formal event,\u201d said her son Trevor, a technology entrepreneur, \u201cand she said, \u2018Dance me over to that man over there.\u2019 She reached over to the person and said to me, \u2018He is going to give me $1 million for our museum.\u2019 The man said, \u2018I am?\u2019\u201dA month later, she got a $1 million check from the man in question.Ms. Wilsey\u2019s living room tables in Rutherford are cluttered with photos of her sons, their families, her parents and her two former husbands. When asked who her good friends were, she named Todd and Trevor. \u201cMy husbands,\u201d she added. \u201cThey were my best friends.\u201d Mr. Traina\u2019s ashes are stored in a wooden box near the hearth. \u201cMy sons said he liked people and belonged in the living room,\u201d she said. Mr. Wilsey\u2019s ashes are in a stone urn in a private garden visible through a picture window.Ms. Wilsey has a number of close acquaintances. \u201cI\u2019m very circumspect about friends,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is very hard to trust people here. You just don\u2019t know what their motive is.\u201d\u201cI actually had a good relationship with Sean, and I have no idea why he decided to write that idiotic book,\u201d Ms. Wilsey said.Now, Ms. Wilsey indulges her three grandchildren. She built for them a small village a short walk from the main house. It includes a carousel, three squat miniature air-conditioned houses, a general store and a mock train station. Ms. Wilsey decorated the pale yellow walls inside the little station with murals of her dogs, her grandchildren and a monkey wearing a pink tutu.She was elected board president in 1998 and named chief executive of the Fine Arts Museums in 2011. The chief executive title fell to her after John Buchanan, the former museum director who brought a populist sensibility to the de Young, told her he had cancer and was going to die. During his tenure, he ran the museum while she raised the funds to attract the traveling blockbuster exhibits celebrating King Tut and Yves Saint Laurent.But while Ms. Wilsey is applauded for her ability to bring in coin, she is less exalted for her managerial skill absent a strong partner like Mr. Parker, Mr. Buchanan or the newly appointed director, Max Hollein, an art historian and museum administrator from Vienna who was hired in March.\u201cA lowly staff member does not command her attention,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cThere is a master-servant relationship that gets in the way of things.\u201dMs. Wilsey denied the characterization. Still, several curators and others have bristled under her leadership. Robert Flynn Johnson, the museum\u2019s curator emeritus, said he and other curators were asked to wear suits and ties to a gala dinner for the opening of the new de Young in 2005. When he arrived, though, he said, he found that he wasn\u2019t invited for the dinner portion of the evening, only for cocktails.He was irked, too, when Ms. Wilsey paid $1,000 apiece to have the names of her dogs posted on a donor wall meant for patrons unable to lay out huge sums. \u201cSome people had to save $100 a month,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cIt was a sacrifice.

She has a whole court named after her.\u201dMs. Gutierrez, Ms. Wilsey and others involved are not allowed to discuss the situation as part of a settlement agreement. But according to press reports, when trustees involved in the Fine Arts Museums\u2019 organization learned about the payment last year, they expressed concern that it was made without the board\u2019s knowledge or approval.Bernard Osher, a friend of Ms. Wilsey\u2019s who attends her annual Christmas party, resigned from the board.

According to Mr. Parker, Mr. Osher \u201cthought the action was outrageous and couldn\u2019t support it.\u201d More recently, Louise Renne, San Francisco\u2019s former city attorney, was one of two other trustees to resign, saying she could not \u201cfulfill her fiduciary duty,\u201d given the board\u2019s management.\u201cThe old guard can\u2019t stay around forever, and it shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Renne said.In July, the museum settled with Ms. Gutierrez for $2 million to avoid a potential wrongful-termination lawsuit. The money given to Mr. Huggins was repaid to the museum by unnamed donors. (Ms. Wilsey declined to say if she was one of them.)Ms. Wilsey said she expects her detractors to be surprised when they find out that she is not leaving. But in a new arrangement, she said, she will share more management responsibility with six other trustees, a move she has been advocating for months.While accepting the change, Ms. Wilsey said: \u201cThere is no way if I were a man I would be the victim.

A thousand students of all colors joined a vibrant campus \u201cmarch of resilience\u201d \u2014 I know, because I was on campus last fall. Another thousand convened in the chapel to hear classmates and professors speak from their deepest humanity, without malevolence or duplicity. Free speech and open inquiry are alive and well on campus.If anything, the real threat to free inquiry isn\u2019t students, but that same market imperative that First Amendment defenders claim to hold dear. Most university leaders serve not politically correct pieties but pressures to satisfy student \u201ccustomers\u201d and to avoid negative publicity, liability and losses in \u201cbrand\u201d or \u201cmarket share\u201d \u2014 terms that belong in corporate suites but appear, increasingly, in deans\u2019 offices.Such obfuscation is nothing new. In 1953, Buckley, whose book \u201cGod and Man at Yale\u201d urged alumni to roll back professors\u2019 godless socialism, helped found the Intercollegiate Studies Institute to train students to counter \u201cliberal\u201d betrayals of \u201cour nation\u2019s founding principles \u2014 limited government, individual liberty, personal responsibility, the rule of law, market economy.\u201dToday wealthy donors back groups like the Intercollegiate Studies Institute: the Bradley Foundation, the Scaife family foundations and the Koch brothers\u2019 DonorsTrust ( for donors who don\u2019t want to go public) that funnel money to, among others, the David Horowitz Freedom Center (whose \u201cacademic bill of rights\u201d would monitor professors\u2019 syllabuses for \u201cbalance\u201d) and Campus Watch, which tracks comments on the Middle East.Conservatives used to remind us that what the Constitution protects in speech, civil society modulates; freedom requires self-restraint and respect for others, not the hurling of scare words. Yet now their selectively legalistic \u201cfree speech\u201d strategy helps turn collegial contentions into rhetorical battlefields by hyping and even provoking progressive offenders.The reason is that conservatives\u2019 yearning for ordered liberty is being debased not by liberals but by the casino-like financing and predatory lending and marketing of a \u201cdynamic capitalist economy.\u201d Think of Donald J. Trump\u2019s \u201cfree speech\u201d rampages (with attacks just like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education\u2019s on \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d), the Senate\u2019s lockjaw against open hearings, and market-driven entertainment that encourages real violence. Shaming undergraduates who are upset by all this and assailing deans who must cope with them have a chilling effect on \u201cno strings attached\u201d alumni generosity like Mr. Johnston\u2019s, which shielded free inquiry from donors with more mercenary and ideological agendas.A college is a civil society on training wheels. Students, away from home and in an \u201cadult\u201d society for the first time, may try out defensive ethno-racial flag waving, religious and political dogmas, athletic and fraternal self-segregation, and premature career-ladder climbing. They may scare one another a little, but they also learn to stand up for themselves.If collegiate civil societies are lurching into ditches as often now as the \u201cfree speech\u201d campaign claims, that\u2019s partly because the larger society is, too. Yes, some students are as intemperate as the Republican presidential nominee, and some deans accommodate them. Their behavior may not be your daddy\u2019s liberalism, but what their outraged critics are selling isn\u2019t his conservatism, either.An opinion essay last Sunday incorrectly described the headline and details of a video of a protester at Yale. The video was posted online by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, but the headline and details about the student were posted by The Daily Caller.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "EpiPen Price Rises Could Mean More Riches for Mylan Executives", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameThe filings also show that under a special, one-time stock grant created in 2014, top executives \u2014 including Ms. Bresch \u2014 stand to reap further riches at least partly on the back of price increases on the EpiPen. Under the grant, Mylan executives will be rewarded if the company\u2019s earnings and stock price meet certain goals by the end of 2018.Given that EpiPen accounted for $1 billion of Mylan\u2019s $9.4 billion in revenue in its most recent year, the allergy treatment\u2019s price increases seem integral to meeting those targets and generating a big payday.Mylan says the one-time grant aligns management\u2019s interests with those of the shareholders. But relentlessly managing a company with an eye toward its stock price can lead to trouble.In any case, the timing of the one-time stock grant to executives is striking \u2014 especially when set against the history of EpiPen price rises.I asked Mylan if the bigger price increases after the 2014 stock award were intended to help propel its performance toward the earnings and stock price targets.No, replied Nina Devlin, a spokeswoman.In a statement, she elaborated further: \u201cMylan has a large and diverse business, with more than 2,700 products sold in 165 countries and 600 products sold in the U.S. alone. The targets set forth in the one-time special program were not and are not practically achievable based on pricing of any single product.\u201dMs. Devlin added that after Mylan\u2019s recent acquisition of Meda, a company specializing in women\u2019s health, respiratory, allergy, dermatology and pain management, the EpiPen business will represent under 10 percent of the company\u2019s revenue, compared with 11 percent last year.But Brian Foley, an independent compensation consultant in White Plains, said it was impossible to separate the company\u2019s business decisions from its pay practices. \u201cThe pattern of conduct with the EpiPen business seems egregious,\u201d Mr. Foley said in an interview. \u201cIt looks like price gouging, and why would you do that? The answer has got to be because it\u2019s in management\u2019s financial interest to do it.\u201dConsider the special stock award. In 2014, Mylan\u2019s proxy filings valued Ms. Bresch\u2019s grant at $13.2 million. If Mylan clears the price and adjusted earnings hurdle, her payout will be far larger.Now, though, with Mylan\u2019s pricing practices under scrutiny, it may be more difficult for the company\u2019s executives to clear the hurdles necessary to cash in. Its stock is well below the $53.33 price that will be needed to generate a payout. And the company\u2019s decision last week to start selling a generic EpiPen at half the $600 branded price means the adjusted earnings per share target of $5.40 on Dec. 31, 2018 may be more difficult to achieve.But don\u2019t cry for Ms. Bresch. It turns out the earnings hurdle put in place by the board has some wiggle room. That\u2019s because it is based not on generally accepted accounting principles but on a so-called adjusted earnings figure that excludes certain corporate costs chosen by Mylan. The company also uses fantasy figures when calculating its top executives\u2019 incentive pay packages.Among the costs Mylan excludes from its adjusted earnings are those related to acquisitions, financing and investment losses. Last year, these and other exclusions gave a big lift to Mylan\u2019s pretend per-share earnings. Under generally accepted accounting principles, each Mylan share earned $1.70 in 2015. Under its own rules, each share earned $4.30.That spread between Mylan\u2019s actual earnings and its pretend number \u2014 $2.60 a share \u2014 has widened significantly. In 2014, it was $1.22 a share.Note, too, that Mylan\u2019s true earnings in 2015 were 27 percent below what it actually earned in 2014. Luckily for Mylan\u2019s top executives, earnings as computed under accounting rules are not one of the company\u2019s metrics for calculating executive pay.Ms. Devlin, the Mylan spokeswoman, contends that its preferred financial measures are \u201cuseful supplemental information for our investors\u201d in addition to those presented under accounting rules. She added, \u201cAll public companies in our peer group use non-GAAP measures, as do a large number of public companies outside of our peer group. Furthermore, the board and/or compensation committee has discussed these metrics with shareholders and has taken that feedback into consideration.\u201dAt Mylan\u2019s most recent annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, 35 percent of the votes were cast against the company\u2019s pay practices. By contrast, the median company in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index received support from 95 percent of votes cast.On Thursday, Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller and overseer of city pension funds that hold Mylan shares, criticized Mylan\u2019s governance practices in a letter to Douglas J. Leech, chairman of the nominating and governance committee of the company\u2019s board. Mr. Stringer, who has voted the city funds\u2019 shares against Mylan directors in the past, asked that the company install an independent board chairman to provide oversight.We\u2019ll have to wait until December 2018 to see whether Mylan\u2019s executives can cash in their special one-time awards. In the meantime, Ms. Bresch and her colleagues received a windfall after the company acquired certain businesses of Abbott Laboratories in 2014 and incorporated overseas. As part of the deal, executives were allowed to exercise all their unvested stock awards. Ms. Bresch realized $32 million in 2015 as a result, proxy filings show.That\u2019s not all. The company also paid its executives\u2019 income taxes associated with the acceleration of the stock awards. Under that deal, Mylan shareholders paid the extra $5.8 million Ms. Bresch owed in taxes.The outcry over the EpiPen pricing shows Mylan to be the latest example of a company whose board allowed executives to reap bounties from activities that wound up harming other stakeholders. When they do so in the name of the company\u2019s shareholders, it is especially offensive. And now that Mylan has reminded everyone just how common price gouging is in the pharmaceutical industry, even its shareholders are paying a price.\u201cYou would think at least somebody on the board would have the brass and the class to say enough is enough,\u201d Mr. Foley said. \u201cWe were making money at $400; why do we need to charge $600? This reminds me of my 16-month-old grandson who after he\u2019s had a good meal looks at me and says, \u2018More?\u2019\u201dTwitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Future Haunted by Ghosts of the Past", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Democracy 2016A wave of migrants and refugees, the largest since World War II, has strained the fabric of societies across Europe. The American presidential election, with the unusual campaign of the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, has focused the world\u2019s nervous attention on strains in the United States. To varying degrees, countries including Turkey, Poland and Hungary have clamped down on journalists and judges. Governments have struggled to respond to the challenges of religious extremism and gaping disparities in wealth and income. In the United States, Mr. Trump has scorned democratic traditions, arguing that outsourcing of jobs, immigration and terrorism have created a mess and vowing, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d Among the government officials, scholars, activists, journalists and others who gathered last week for the fourth-annual Athens Democracy Forum, organized by The International New York Times, the mood was glum, if not despairing. They agreed that democracy was in danger, and liberalism \u2014 civil rights, the rule of law, the protection of minorities \u2014 even more so. \u201cThe crisis we find ourselves in today is one in which we have started to question the very fundamentals on which our democracies have been built \u2014 our moral values of openness and equality, our fundamental freedoms, our resilience and, most importantly, what unites us, what binds us,\u201d said Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship. Mr. Avramopoulos, a former foreign minister and defense minister of Greece, said the greatest threat to Europe came not from migration or terrorism but from the demons within. \u201cWhat I believe can weaken us is what comes from inside: the rise of nationalism, populism, demagogy and xenophobia \u2014 the rise of dark ghosts from our recent past,\u201d he said.The conference itself, said Roger Cohen, a New York Times columnist who delivered the opening speech, was conceived as a \u201cconfident celebration\u201d of democracy but instead became an \u201canxious interrogation.\u201d \u201cI am pessimistic in the short term, optimistic in the long term, particularly as I won\u2019t be around to see if I was right,\u201d he said. Pessimistic, he said, because \u201cthe problems are deep, can no longer be ignored, and cannot be righted in short order.\u201d Mr. Cohen said there was some truth to the criticism that political and economic elites have profoundly failed their citizens. Free trade and large-scale immigration have produced enormous gains for those at the top of the ladder, but broad gains in prosperity have been elusive, he said. Among the results: The anxiety that propelled Britain\u2019s decision, in a June 23 referendum, to leave the European Union, and the ascent of anti-establishment politicians like Mr. Trump and the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen.In the long run, though, Mr. Cohen is upbeat: \u201cThe democratic idea is stubborn.\u201d Are democratic societies prepared to deal with large-scale movements of people fleeing persecution and violence? \u201cUnder no circumstances do you shut the door to someone whose only crime is that they were born in a war-torn or impoverished country or region,\u201d said Stavros Lambrinidis, the European Union\u2019s special representative for human rights and a former foreign minister of Greece. \u201cAt the same time, you must make sure that you address the root causes of these problems.\u201d Mario Monti, a former prime minister of Italy and a former member of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, lamented that \u201cthe short-term nature of political discourse\u201d had made it increasingly difficult to engage in the kind of reasoned, nuanced policy debates necessary to deal with thorny issues. Lucas Papademos, a former prime minister of Greece who is also an economist, said it was \u201cnot realistic\u201d to \u201ckeep the doors totally open\u201d but urged recognition of the long-term benefits of migration: replenishing an aging work force, supporting welfare and pension systems, and assisting entrepreneurship. Just as efforts to lift people out of poverty must be balanced against the impact on the environment, the rights of migrants have to be balanced against the need to keep societies safe, Mr. Lambrinidis said. \u201cSustainable security, like sustainable development, has to become the new paradigm,\u201d he said.Mr. Papademos pronounced himself worried about the future of the European project, saying that conflicts abroad, and the resulting exodus of people, were \u201cthreatening the cohesion\u201d of Europe and turning the \u201cbedrock\u201d of values upon which the European Union was built into \u201cquicksand.\u201d Mr. Monti sees signs that \u201cinternational integration is moving backward,\u201d as societies turn against the free movement of goods and people.\u201dHe pointed to a lack of leadership in Europe. \u201cWhereas in the past, member states considered Europe a huge investment in their own long-term interest, now most leaders see Europe as a useful consumption good that you can try to squeeze in order hopefully to generate more short-term domestic political consensus,\u201d he said.As democracies falter, candidates promising quick fixes through sheer force of personality have captured the imagination of voters. Alison Smale, the Berlin bureau chief of The New York Times, moderated a discussion on the appeal of the \u201cbig man.\u201d (The candidates seem invariably to be male.) Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis, who was the United States ambassador to Hungary from 2010 to 2013, recalled the rise of Viktor Orban, who became prime minister a few months after she arrived in Budapest. The previous government, led by Socialists, was widely seen as discredited after the global financial crisis, she said, and Mr. Orban swept to power after urging voters to give his nationalist, conservative party, Fidesz, a supermajority in Parliament.Once in office, Mr. Orban passed legislation deploring the Treaty of Trianon, which in 1920 set Hungary\u2019s borders after World War I, while strengthening the government\u2019s control over news outlets, the judiciary, universities and local governments. Mr. Orban even embraced the term \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d arguing that his mandate from voters (he was re-elected in 2014) justified restrictions on civil rights and civil liberties.Mr. Orban set an example that has been emulated by the far-right government that took power in Poland last year, Ms. Kounalakis said.Christiane Amanpour, the CNN journalist, described her experiences interviewing strongmen, including Robert Mugabe, the longtime president of Zimbabwe; Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president who was ousted in 2011; Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader who was murdered by a mob in 2011; and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has led an authoritarian turn in that country. \u201cI\u2019ve interviewed a lot of these people who have come in as democrats and turned into authoritarians, never-ending rulers,\u201d she said, describing Mr. Erdogan\u2019s outrage when she asked him about his request that Germany prosecute a satirist who had mocked him. \u201cHe was shocked that I would ask him that question,\u201d Ms. Amanpour said.Ms. Amanpour, who grew up in Iran when it was led by an authoritarian shah, said control of the news media was the first point on the authoritarian agenda. \u201cNone of these authoritarians could have a lock on so-called success if they didn\u2019t have a compliant media,\u201d she said, noting crackdowns on the press in Russia, Poland, Turkey and elsewhere.Concerns about the ability of governments to rein in capitalism were brought to the fore during the 2008 global economic crisis and continue to reverberate around the West. At a panel moderated by Paul Krugman, the New York Times columnist and Nobel-laureate economist, Yasheng Huang, a professor of global economics at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, said the allure of the business strongman was unsurprising since many chief executives \u201crule their own companies\u201d as unquestioned leaders. Yanis Varoufakis, a former finance minister of Greece and one of the best-known critics of economic austerity in Europe, said there were three threats to democracy from the rising power of business: the banking sector (which helped cause the financial crisis), the news media (which has been increasingly consolidated) and monopolies (whose concentrated power defies attempts at regulation and control). \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the political-democratic realm is not doing very well,\u201d he said.Mr. Varoufakis did not blame businesses for the austerity policies, which he believes have contributed to a series of economic crises in Greece. \u201cMy experience in Europe is that business was much more progressive in demanding an end to austerity, and is to this day, than governments are,\u201d he said.Does economic development eventually lead to democratic reform, as Seymour Martin Lipset and other political scientists proposed in the decades after World War II?Mr. Huang was not optimistic. \u201cBefore the current leadership,\u201d he said, \u201cChina has had generations of leaders who were not democrats, but trending toward the liberal direction.\u201d That has stopped with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s paramount leader since 2012.\u201cThis is one of the big problems with an authoritarian system because the leadership selection is a very unpredictable process,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cNobody knew the characteristics of this current leader before he was selected. He had a lot of room to maneuver and he decided to move backward.\u201d Private-sector confidence in China is declining, and people are taking money out of the country, he added.\u201cThe more that people of different faiths can interact to pursue some common goal, the more well-off we are as democracies,\u201d said the Rev. Chloe Breyer, an Episcopalian minister and the executive director of the Interfaith Center of New York, reflecting a common belief in the United States. Serge Schmemann, a member of the Times editorial board who led the discussion, said he wanted to steer clear of familiar debates about Islam in public life. He invited two men born in the Soviet Union \u2014 Natan Sharansky, a Jewish human-rights activist who is now chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, and Sergei Chapnin, a former editor of the official journal of the Moscow Patriarchate, the seat of the Russian Orthodox Church board \u2014 to talk about the misuses of faith. Mr. Sharansky said that during his days as a human rights dissident, religious people were \u201cby far our strongest, best comrades in arms.\u201dMr. Chapnin lamented the co-opting of the Russian Orthodox Church by President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government. As the identity of the Russian government changed from \u201cdemocratic state to empire,\u201d church officials agreed to make their faith \u201ca church of empire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a kind of post-Soviet civil religion based on Orthodox traditions \u2014 or incorporating Orthodox elements \u2014 but in fact this is not the true spiritual tradition,\u201d Mr. Chapnin said, adding that he believed \u201cthe church is in crisis now.\u201dAs for the threat of religious extremism to liberal democracies, Ms. Breyer said of Western societies: \u201cWe should be much less apologetic about teaching the good things about secularism, the Enlightenment, to people who are very religious and haven\u2019t necessarily encountered those values. We should not treat traditions as though they were static.\u201d Advertisement"}

Or would you prefer first dibs on tickets for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s world tour, or a private dinner cooked by a \u201cTop Chef\u201d winner?\u201cMany people have under-optimized wallets,\u201d said Matthew Goldman, the chief product officer for the credit card sites at Bankrate, which offers a variety of consumer finance comparison tools. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a really good time to be a customer, especially one with good credit. The issuers are really going after each other with lucrative deals.\u201dCash isn\u2019t as exciting as a fantasy vacation, but for most people, it is the most lucrative choice.\u201cWe haven\u2019t worked through all the details yet,\u201d said Michael Saccucci, the director of statistics for Consumer Reports, who tinkered for several years with an internal tool before releasing it to the public in June. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it more consistent, and one of my goals for future versions is to add a two-card optimization.\u201dSo, 10 months in, has he stuck with his cash card resolution?\u201cThat bonus was too big to ignore,\u201d Mr. McQuay said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it fits my long-term spending, but I think I\u2019ll spend enough to justify the card for the first year.\u201dThere is a reason so many cards focus their rewards structure on travel. It\u2019s aspirational \u2014 who doesn\u2019t like to daydream about jetting off to the tropics? \u2014 and it\u2019s cost-effective. Airline miles and similar benefits can be bought in bulk by card issuers for a fraction of their cash value.But delving into the fine print of actually redeeming all those miles and points is a quick buzz-kill, which means that many accumulate and languish, unused.The way to stretch the dollar value of your points and miles the farthest, though, is by jumping through the hoops and redeeming them for airline travel and hotel stays. For customers with a preferred airline or hotel chain, that brand\u2019s credit card is still typically the best deal, but travelers who bounce around are fueling a growing market for flexible cards with transferable perks.Dedicated points ninjas tend to juggle multiple cards to squeeze out the maximum bonus on each. Mr. Saccucci of Consumer Reports said his analysis found that average card holders could increase the yield of their rewards programs by about 30 percent by strategically using two different cards.The app is still a beta version, with some flaws, but Jonathan Hayes, the company\u2019s founder, sees a big future in helping customers treat rewards points like the currency they have become.\u201cWhen you buy stocks, you have a broker,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. \u201cPeople have a lot of points stored up in various programs, but they don\u2019t know how to get real value out of them. There\u2019s no system set up for this sector of personal finance. That\u2019s the role we hope to fill.\u201dBut if you decide to stop using an older card, it often pays off to keep it open. The age of your accounts factors into your credit score and closing older accounts takes a toll, especially if it reduces the total amount of untapped credit you have available.\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve figured out yet how to help people understand all of those options and benefits,\u201d said Mr. Goldman of Bankrate. \u201cIt\u2019s a more nuanced thing to market, but we\u2019re going to keep seeing more of them, because there\u2019s an upper limit on rewards and cash.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included an outdated reference to a rewards card offered through Fidelity Investments.

{"Headline": "Afghanistan Signs Draft Peace Deal With Faction Led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Afghan government signed a draft peace deal on Thursday with a small insurgent faction led by a warlord who has been designated a \u201cglobal terrorist\u201d by the United States.\u201cThe result of war is only destruction,\u201d said Pir Said Ahmad Gaillani, leader of the government\u2019s High Peace Council, who also signed the agreement. \u201cThe other groups who are fighting with the government should accept Hezb-i-Islami as a model and should join the peace process.\u201dThe draft agreement does not go into effect until it has been signed by President Ashraf Ghani and by Mr. Hekmatyar, who officials said would come to Kabul to do so in \u201cthe coming days.\u201d Part of the deal is to arrange for Mr. Hekmatyar to re-establish himself in the capital and join the political process, and the Afghan leadership is promising to give him an \u201chonorary post\u201d in the government. Power-sharing, however, is not part of the agreement.On a more practical level, negotiators from Hezb-i-Islami said their leader would not come to Kabul until sanctions against him were lifted, which, in the case of the United Nations, is a protracted, complex process that would take much longer than a matter of days.The American Embassy issued a brief statement on Thursday welcoming the accord as part of \u201can Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process.\u201dHezb-i-Islami split after the Afghan government was established, with a political wing that disassociated itself from the insurgency. Many leading figures in that wing joined the government, and several were prominent during the presidency of Hamid Karzai. Few of them have explicitly repudiated Mr. Hekmatyar\u2019s leadership of the party, and some were present at the signing of the draft agreement on Thursday.That could mean that if Mr. Hekmatyar does return, he could again be a significant force in Afghanistan\u2019s complex political scene. Mr. Hekmatyar is known for his shifting alliances, having been on nearly every side of the Afghan conflict at one time or another, be they the Communists or the Taliban, and he is also known for breaking agreements and turning on his allies.Before Mr. Hekmatyar actually returns to Kabul, his aides and government officials need to negotiate the details of where he and his followers will live and work, the financing of their return and other aspects of the agreement, details that could prove contentious.Days before the signing, Habiburrahman Hekmatyar, the Hezb-i-Islami leader\u2019s son, said by telephone that party negotiators had met with both Western and Afghan officials concerning Gulbuddin\u2019s removal from terrorist blacklists, suggesting the insurgents were confident that would happen.One major issue of disagreement, he said, was language in the agreement regarding an end to foreign military presence in Afghanistan. In the end, they agreed to compromise on that, agreeing in the draft accord that \u201cthe two sides have their own unique perspectives\u201d on foreign withdrawal.\u201cThe restoration of independence is our main demand,\u201d said Muhammad Amin Karim, a Hezb-i-Islami representative. \u201cNinety percent of foreign troops have already left Afghanistan. We will keep struggling until the last foreign soldier leaves.\u201dMr. Atmar replied, \u201cYou can follow the issue of ending foreign presence in Afghanistan, but through peaceful means.\u201dFahim Abed and Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting from Kabul, and Mujib Mashal from Oslo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Where Ex-Taliban Minister Sits, Demand Is Growing for Afghan Peace", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileWITH the Taliban making territorial advances and bombing the capital every week, it may seem the least likely moment to be talking about an Afghan peace deal. But Agha Jan Motasim, a former Taliban minister, insists that now is the time.Once the Taliban\u2019s finance minister and chief auditor, and a close associate of the Taliban\u2019s founder, Mullah Muhammad Omar, Mr. Motasim has positioned himself as a back-channel negotiator between the insurgents and the Afghan government for the last eight years. He lives in hiding most of the time, shuttling through multiple cities of the Persian Gulf, Turkey and Afghanistan, holding meetings in well-guarded government guesthouses.In a rare four-hour interview over dinner, he spoke of how the changing circumstances in Afghanistan and new pressures on the Taliban meant that demands for peace were growing inside the movement. He spoke on the condition that the interview\u2019s location not be disclosed because of security concerns and the political implications of his work.Mr. Motasim, whose full name is Sayed Abdul Wasi Motasim, is well known in intelligence and diplomatic circles \u2014 not least because he was featured until three years ago on the United Nations Security Council sanctions list and on the most-wanted list of the United States.But with the peace process stuck for the last two years, Mr. Motasim has picked up the baton again.He insists that prospects for talks are growing: He says the Taliban leadership council recently met in the Pakistani border town of Quetta and agreed to proceed with peace negotiations. (Taliban figures who were reached for comment on Mr. Motasim\u2019s claim were split on whether the final verdict of the meeting was to pursue talks, with some saying the matter had not been resolved.)Afterward, he said, several members of the Taliban leadership council asked him to restart his negotiations with the Afghan government.Mr. Motasim is one of very few people in the world who might legitimately serve as such a go-between. But his personal experiences speak to the perils of trying to negotiate peace. He walks with a limp after narrowly surviving an assassination attempt in 2010, his family lives in exile, and he leads a secret life.Mr. Motasim, 45, comes from the Taliban heartland of Kandahar Province and bears the title \u201csayed,\u201d which denotes that his family is descended from the Prophet Muhammad. A religious student, he joined the mujahedeen for a year at the end of the war against the Soviet Union and then joined the Taliban when it formed in 1994 in Kandahar.He was close to Mullah Omar when he was in power \u2014 eating meals with him and overseeing his security \u2014 but says he never saw him after the fall of the Taliban government in 2001. The Taliban leadership regrouped in Quetta in Pakistan, but he said they never met with Mullah Omar. Only two personal messengers ever had direct access to the leader, and even close relatives did not see him, he said.Mr. Motasim was at the heart of the movement when it organized to fight an insurgency against the American military presence in Afghanistan and the government it supported. He said an early attempt to seek reconciliation through the governor of Kandahar was rejected, so the Taliban had no other choice but to fight.He led the financial committee and later the political committee of the Taliban movement and traveled frequently to Saudi Arabia on fund-raising tours. He became known to the Saudi authorities, and when President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan asked the Saudi king to mediate peace with the Taliban, the Saudis enlisted Mr. Motasim\u2019s help.HE began back-channel negotiations as head of the Taliban\u2019s political committee, and says he twice met with a brother of Mr. Karzai\u2019s, in 2008 and 2009. The two successfully worked on confidence-building measures that focused on having the Taliban end attacks on schools and government officials and on having the government work on releasing Taliban prisoners and removing Taliban leaders from the sanctions list, Afghan officials and Western diplomats confirm.Then in August 2010, as he was backing his car through the gate at his home in Karachi, Pakistan, a gunman opened fire on him. As Mr. Motasim dived out of the car, the gunman pumped 12 bullets from a pistol into his head, stomach and legs. It left him in a hospital unable to speak for months and ended the Saudi-led peace initiative.\u201cI saw the danger, and people used to warn me about the possible danger,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut I told them that for the sake of my country and my people, I will accept this danger so we can bring our people peace and stability.\u201dMr. Motasim left Pakistan with his family for medical treatment in Turkey and returned to peacemaking.He was removed from the United Nations\u2019 sanctions list, as well as the United States\u2019 wanted-terrorist list in 2013. A year later he gathered 22 Taliban ministers and leaders in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, to meet with senior Afghan officials and members of the Afghan High Peace Council \u2014 proof, he says, of the level of support for peace. \u201cWe had lots of discussions and we had achieved a lot toward peace,\u201d he said.He declines to name the source of his trials, but he points out that he had to escape Pakistan. He says the way forward is for the Taliban and the Afghan government to hold direct talks and to work out foreign relations afterward.\u201cIt is a long process,\u201d he said.\u201cFor this we must have lots of committees, gatherings of tribal elders, of the Taliban themselves, lots of research is needed, and then we will go step by step forward.\u201dIN person, Mr. Motasim exudes a diplomatic patience, and the diligent hospitality that is the hallmark of influential Afghans. He answered hours of questions calmly and at length, personally serving his guests kebabs and rice and handing out gifts at the end.He seemed to speak at least partly for himself when he said that the Taliban were ready to share in the political life of Afghanistan and want to return home with dignity.He said he did not receive instructions directly from the new Taliban leader, Mullah Haibatullah, but he said he understood the instructions came with his sanction.\u201cIndirectly it might be coming from his side,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past I was not asked or approached to struggle for peace, but now the desire has increased.\u201dHe says that despite their gains on the battlefield, the Taliban are under pressure and are feeling their losses \u2014 including Mullah Omar, whose death was announced last year, and his successor Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, who was killed in an American drone strike in the Taliban\u2019s longtime haven in Pakistan in May.\u201cThey say that if they had chosen to make peace, their leaders would be alive,\u201d Mr. Motasim said.He said that the most important shift in favor of peace was the main American troop withdrawal after 2014. The Taliban could not consider peace talks when tens of thousands of foreign troops were conducting offensive operations in Afghanistan, but the current arrangement for many fewer troops serving under a restrained security agreement would be more acceptable to the Taliban generally, he said.\u201cIf there is a genuine effort toward peace,\u201d he said, \u201cthen all Afghans would choose to make peace.\u201dRuhullah Khapalwak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Contests in New Hampshire May Alter Political Map", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonNew Hampshire is in the bottom quarter of states in terms of its electoral and popular votes in the United States presidential race. But no other place has more competitive races with national implications.The presidential contest, a Senate race, both House seats and the election for governor are all up for grabs. The outcomes could shape the 2017 political map.It is worth remembering the state\u2019s crucial role in 2000. Despite all the attention to Florida, if Al Gore had taken New Hampshire \u2014 he lost by 7,000 votes \u2014 he would have won the electoral as well as the popular vote.Yet in the last six presidential races, the once reliably Republican state has voted Democratic five times; Barack Obama twice won decisively. The Democratic campaign in the state is much better organized.Five hours later, enthusiastic supporters packed a gymnasium in Laconia to hear Mr. Trump. In his fourth visit to the state since the primaries in February, he accused Mrs. Clinton of corruption and blamed her for every major failure in the Middle East, including a \u201ccentral role in unleashing ISIS.\u201d Along with forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall, he vowed to make the Middle East Gulf states pay for a refugee haven, claiming that these states would not exist \u201cfor very long\u201d without United States support. For good measure, he asserted that New Hampshire lost one in three manufacturing jobs in President Obama\u2019s economy. (The state\u2019s unemployment rate is 2.9 percent, the second lowest in the country.)Ms. Hassan ties Ms. Ayotte to Mr. Trump at every opportunity. In a brief interview, Ms. Hassan said Ms. Ayotte \u201cstands with Donald Trump, even though prominent members of her own party say he presents a clear and present danger to the country.\u201dRepublicans say Ms. Ayotte\u2019s willingness to criticize both the Republican presidential nominee and Mr. Guinta appeals to independent voters.Naturally, much of the national focus is on big battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio. But the Granite State may provide important indicators early on election night. If Mr. Trump loses the state, any path to victory will be elusive. Likewise, Democratic hopes of taking control of the Senate may be dashed if Ms. Hassan loses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In English Lake District, Tradition and Conservation Clash", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThrelkeld JournalTHRELKELD, England \u2014 It was to have been a grand gesture, a deal that would transfer a mountain in the fabled English Lake District from the landed gentry to those who roam its heights, reversing a centuries-old pattern of ownership by the upper-crust few.The campaign to buy the mountain fell apart at a time of broader questions about what the Lake District is for, setting old ways against newer challenges. Much of the debate revolves around land.\u201cThis is the heart of hill-shepherding country,\u201d said Peter Edmondson, 61, gesturing to the craggy, bracken-clad mountains that rise steeply above his whitewashed 17th-century home at Seathwaite Farm. \u201cIf they want to rewild the Lake District, what about me and my family?\u201dThere is no formal link between events on Blencathra and in Borrowdale Valley, but both illuminate the competing visions of how the Lake District\u2019s sylvan valleys and rugged uplands should be run and owned, and for whose benefit.The issue started gaining attention in 2014 with the effort to sell Blencathra, also known as Saddleback.The mountain, along with the ceremonial title of Lord of the Manor of Threlkeld, was priced at \u00a31.75 million, or about $3 million according to exchange rates at the time. Its owner, Hugh Clayton Lowther, the eighth Earl of Lonsdale, whose family has owned it for generations, wanted to raise cash to pay inheritance taxes of \u00a39 million on his father\u2019s estate.In the end, the mystery bidder never materialized. The earl sold off other assets, including a painting by the artist J. M. W. Turner, to pay the estate taxes. In June, he said the mountain was no longer for sale, but the Friends of Blencathra said they still wanted to buy it.After an ultimatum to the Friends by the seller\u2019s agent to come up with a more substantial offer by Sept. 5, the group said its trustees \u201cnow see no prospects of a successful purchase.\u201d That left the question of what to do with the \u00a3250,000.Some donors have taken to social media to say the secretive behavior of the Friends of Blencathra creates suspicions that the donations may not be returned, even though the trustees have promised a \u201cpublic consultation\u201d on the charity\u2019s future.Coincidentally, the Charity Commission has said it is also scrutinizing the National Trust\u2019s purchase in August of 303 acres of sheep-farming land, along with 413 sheep, at Thorneythwaite Farm, next to Seathwaite Farm.The purchase added fuel to a passionate debate between farmers and environmentalists who argue that sheep have overgrazed the hills. Parts of the region, the environmentalists say, should be rewilded to nurture a more complex habitat in the name of biodiversity.That has raised concerns that a landscape immortalized by William Wordsworth and other Romantic poets in the early 19th century will change forever. \u201cThis is a way of life,\u201d Mr. Edmondson said in an interview. Sheep farming itself, he said, is \u201cwhy the hills are so beautiful.\u201dBeyond the ecological debate, Mr. Edmondson\u2019s allies took issue with the tactics used by the National Trust, which is financed by subscriptions from about four million members and owns 630,000 acres across England.With its deep pockets, the trust easily outbid Mr. Edmondson at the auction in August, paying \u00a3950,000 \u2014 \u00a3200,000 above the guide price \u2014 for the land at Thorneythwaite. The sale became contentious because the land was sold separately from the lot that includes the farmhouse and outbuildings, prompting apprehension that its days as an active hill-farm were over.The Trust already owns 90 farms in the Lake District with a total stock of 21,000 of the Lake District\u2019s 50,000 Herdwicks, the dominant breed of hardy sheep that thrive on the remote uplands. Mr. Edmondson himself is a tenant farmer on National Trust land that, he said, offers grazing to his 850 breeding ewes and 1,002 sheep owned by the Trust itself.Part of the rationale for rewilding relates to climate change. The Lake District is widely known as England\u2019s wettest place. But as storms have grown in intensity, some environmentalists argue that the revival of trees and shrubs on land grazed bald by sheep, or colonized by bracken, would prevent the runoff of ever more apocalyptic floodwaters.In December, a storm caused so much damage that part of the Lake District\u2019s main north-south thoroughfare was washed away, in effect cutting the region in two for five months.The floods were only one among recent calamities since a crippling outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. Cumbria, the county that overlaps the Lake District, was hit particularly hard, and hundreds of thousands of sheep were incinerated.\u201cThe look and the feel of the Lake District could be changed utterly for generations to come,\u201d Tim Collins, a local legislator, said at the time. His fears were not borne out, but to a longtime visitor, the region seems caught more than ever between a rose-glow of nostalgia and 21st-century pressures.\u201cI can still remember my grandfather\u2019s day when their life was pretty simple,\u201d Mr. Edmondson said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t drive a vehicle. He didn\u2019t ride a bike. All he had was two dogs, a walking stick and his tobacco.\u201d Sometimes, he said, it would take 14 days to walk his flock to market.These days, tour buses clog narrow lanes, spandex-clad cyclists dodge between them, and kayakers take to the rivers and lakes that inspired Arthur Ransome\u2019s \u201cSwallows and Amazons\u201d children\u2019s stories. Such is the quest for adventure in Britain\u2019s leisured society that developers want to build zip wires down precipices. As they have since the 19th century, rock climbers scale vertiginous crags. Walkers clamber over the high passes and summits, sharing the terrain with the sheep.\u201cSooner or later saturation must be reached,\u201d said Terry Fletcher, a columnist in the monthly magazine Cumbria. \u201cSooner or later enough must be enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The same promotional message was added to a slew of articles by journalists and contributors, some dating back as far as 2001, in a bid to draw readers to Entrepreneur\u2019s new lending venture.Late last week, after The New York Times contacted Entrepreneur about the promotion, the tagline was removed, and in some cases replaced with a more recognizable ad for Entrepreneur Lending at the bottom of the articles.Entrepreneur Media, which started in the 1970s and is based in Irvine, Calif., has always targeted people who own, or aspire to own, a small business, mostly with \u201chow to\u201d information through its monthly magazine, books, website and events.Last month, Entrepreneur Media introduced Entrepreneur Lending, which allows it to profit as it directs readers to short-term, high-rate loans from CAN Capital. It added taglines promoting the business at the start of a wide range of stories related to raising capital, which are either edited contributions from freelancers or produced by its own writers.Mark Vamos, a professor of business journalism at Southern Methodist University, in Dallas, and a former editor of Fast Company magazine, said the potential for conflicts of interest was obvious. \u201cHow can you continue to be neutral when you\u2019ve got skin in the game?\u201d he said.Before the original text was deleted from the stories, he said its placement was troubling for readers because it was not clearly distinguishable from the editorial content.\u201cIt\u2019s positioned at the top of the article in a way that makes it look very important and integral to the article in some way,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certainly visual things they could do to make it clearer that this is an e-commerce link.\u201dBill Shaw, the chief revenue officer of Entrepreneur Media, declined to discuss the ads or terms of the company\u2019s deal with CAN Capital. He pointed to Mr. Shea\u2019s post from Aug. 16 as an example of the company\u2019s \u201ccontinued transparency\u201d and said a similar note would be shared in the October issue of Entrepreneur magazine.Those at Entrepreneur Media take \u201cthe separation of editorial and commerce very seriously and hold the trust of our audience in the highest regard,\u201d he wrote in an email. He said Entrepreneur Lending \u201cis an alternative financing option for small-business owners, not an editorial product; therefore, our editorial staff is not affiliated with the service.\u2019\u2019Mr. Shaw did not return messages seeking comment on why Entrepreneur removed the promotional tagline from the top of the stories.Ms. Balint of SmartBiz said the promotion crossed a line.\u201cIf they put it in a box and said \u2018sponsored\u2019 or \u2018ad\u2019 or something, it would certainly help, and then simply allowing the contributors to not have that right in front of their article,\u201d she said.Mr. Vamos said the company was taking the risk of losing contributors and eroding the value of its core business, which is ultimately the editorial product.\u201cPeople do try to blur the lines between editorial and advertising, because editorial has more credibility,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if a publication starts going too far and blurring those lines and damages its credibility with readers, it also in the long term damages its value for advertisers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Jersey Will Increase Gas Tax 23\u00a2, Ending Long Political Stalemate", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Chris Christie, who has long resisted raising any taxes, has battled with Democratic leaders since early summer over raising New Jersey\u2019s gas tax, reaching an impasse that brought hundreds of highway and transit projects to a standstill that lasted months.But on Friday, a day after a fatal train crash in Hoboken focused attention on the troubled conditions of the state-run railroad, Mr. Christie, a Republican, finally gave way by accepting the first tax increase during his seven years in office. He said he had agreed to raise the gas tax by 23 cents a gallon to replenish the depleted Transportation Trust Fund, which the state uses to pay for improvements to rails, roads and bridges.Mr. Christie, who has just over one year left in his second term, has prided himself on his refusal to raise taxes and promoted his record during his campaign to be the Republican presidential candidate. But he said he made an exception for the gas tax because the need to maintain the state\u2019s transportation infrastructure was so critical.\u201cWhile I\u2019m not authorizing any other tax increase during my time as governor,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m authorizing this one because of the importance of the Transportation Trust Fund, the tax fairness that we\u2019ve accomplished together and the compromise we\u2019ve reached, and because we need to responsibly finance this type of activity.\u201dMr. Christie made the announcement at the State House in Trenton, flanked by the State Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, and the speaker of the State Assembly, Vincent Prieto, both Democrats. The three men each described the agreement as a hard-fought compromise.\u201cSorry it took so long,\u201d Senator Sweeney said. \u201cBut we all have strong personalities, and sometimes it just takes time to get together.\u201dThe increase could take effect as soon as next week. The Legislature has scheduled a special session for Wednesday to vote on the matter.In exchange for Mr. Christie\u2019s acceptance of the higher gas tax, the Democrats agreed to lower the state\u2019s sales tax by less than half a penny and to phase out the estate tax by 2018.Mr. Christie said the sales tax rate would decrease next year to 6.875 percent, from 7 percent. In 2018, he said, it will drop again, to 6.625 percent.He said the gas tax would pay for an eight-year, $32 billion reauthorization of the Transportation Trust Fund, adding that \u201c$32 billion will be invested in infrastructure and improvements and modernizations in the state of New Jersey over the next eight years.\u201dMr. Prieto said that the agreement \u201ccouldn\u2019t come soon enough,\u201d and that replenishing the transportation fund was \u201cso important because it\u2019s a public safety issue.\u201dMr. Christie had argued for the reduction of other taxes to balance the tax burden of New Jersey residents. He had called for a 1 cent decrease in the sales tax rate, but settled for a package of cuts that would include the smaller decrease.Along with the two-step drop in the sales tax, the Democrats also accepted a phaseout of the state\u2019s estate tax, an increase in the earned-income tax credit for the working poor and a tax break for veterans.The 23-cent-per-gallon increase in what the state collects on fuel sales \u2014 currently the second-lowest rate of all the states \u2014 would be the first in New Jersey in nearly three decades. It was last raised in 1988, and now only Alaska\u2019s is lower. With the proposed increase, to 37.5 cents, New Jersey\u2019s gas tax would be considerably higher than the national average of about 21 cents.The agreement met with immediate criticism from some advocacy groups.\u201cThese leaders have foolishly paired a big package of tax cuts that will disproportionately benefit well-off New Jerseyans while decimating the state\u2019s ability to pay for essential services, promised obligations and other critical investments,\u201d said Jon Whiten, the vice president of New Jersey Policy Perspectives.\u201cWhile it is absolutely essential that New Jersey invest in its transportation infrastructure, that investment should not be held hostage to some warped idea of so-called tax fairness that will cost the state well over $1 billion a year,\u201d Mr. Whiten added. \u201cThis is, quite simply, the wrong path forward for New Jersey.\u201dMr. Christie said the trust fund would receive $2 billion a year for eight years, which he said would be its biggest and longest reauthorization. With federal matching funds, he said, the state would have $32 billion to spend on road and transit projects over the next eight years.The governor said the tax cuts were estimated to save the state\u2019s taxpayers $164 million next year and as much as $1.4 billion when they are completely in place in 2021.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, the News Can Survive the Newspaper", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorOne day many decades hence, when your grandchildren ask you, \u201cGrandma, what was a newspaper?\u201d you can direct them back to Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2016. Because it may well go down as the day the American newspaper as we\u2019ve known it moved out of intensive care and into the palliative wing on its way to the Great Beyond.The group will be known as the News Media Alliance.There is one obvious reason behind the change: The number of newspapers continues to drop, which has a way of depressing the association\u2019s membership. (It has fallen to about 2,000 from roughly 2,700 in 2008, executives there say.)But the bigger issue, the group\u2019s chief executive, David Chavern, told me last week, was that the word \u201cnewspaper\u201d has become meaningless in reference to many of the group\u2019s members, including The Washington Post, The New York Times and Dow Jones. They may have newspapers, but they get large percentages of their readers online. Actually, you can\u2019t even refer exclusively to \u201creaders\u201d these days when so many millions are \u201cviewers\u201d of online news video.The print requirement was needlessly exclusive for a group that needs all the members it can get to meet numerous existential challenges \u2014 such as ad blocking, ad fraud and aggregators who steal their material and then use it to compete with them.\u201c\u2018Newspaper\u2019 is not a big enough word to describe the industry anymore,\u201d Mr. Chavern said. \u201cThe future of this industry is much broader.\u201dIn this case, as the ad dollars that have long financed journalism vaporize into the electronic ether, you don\u2019t know with any certainty that the best services that newspapers have provided \u2014 holding public officials to account, rooting out corruption \u2014 will live on.If anything, today\u2019s \u201cefficiencies\u201d may even set readers back by pumping out lowest-common-denominator nonsense or, at worst, disinformation.The Facebook program picked up the bogus story and the McChicken item because they were generating copious clicks on the internet \u2014 thus, they were \u201ctrending.\u201dThey represented worst-case examples of what happens when media companies race to give their readers what\u2019s popular \u2014 which is more discernible than ever in an age of ubiquitous data measurement \u2014 at the expense of what\u2019s true or informative.And it is all exacerbated when experienced and discerning journalists fall out of the mix, along with the judgment they bring to the process.In a spoof version of the movie \u201cSpotlight,\u201d about the Boston Globe reporters who uncovered widespread sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, Mr. Oliver envisioned a \u201cmultiplatform content generation distribution network\u201d \u2014 formerly a \u201cnewspaper\u201d \u2014 that puts off a City Hall corruption blockbuster in lieu of a potentially more popular item about a creature that looks like both a raccoon and a cat \u2014 a \u201cRac-Cat.\u201dMr. Oliver devoted his show that week to digital-age threats to local newspapers and the industry\u2019s sometimes ham-handed attempts to overcome them. It took particular aim at Tronc, formerly known as Tribune Publishing \u2014 owner of big regional newspapers like The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and The Baltimore Sun \u2014 whose new, tech-world management team boasts that it will \u201coptimize\u201d Tronc\u2019s journalism with \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d\u201cMy mantra is, \u2018We can\u2019t be the general store that we used to be,\u2019\u201d Stan Wischnowski, the executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News and Philly.com, told me. \u201cWe have to make choices \u2014 we have to use our informed, experienced editors to make really smart decisions.\u201dKnow-nothing press haters may say that news organizations are going out of business because the public is shunning them, but that\u2019s not the case at all. Through online exposure, newspapers are reaching more people than ever. The problem is how they make money. Circulation for physical newspapers is declining, and so is print advertising; digital ads remain far less profitable. The trick is finding a way to make up the lost revenue.That\u2019s one reason that physical newspapers have stuck around as long as they have. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in the industry whose majority revenue is not still print,\u201d said Michael J. Klingensmith, the publisher and chief executive of The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, and the vice chairman of the soon-to-be News Media Alliance. He added, \u201cThe name change to me isn\u2019t about not being paper anymore \u2014 it\u2019s really just about expanding opportunities.\u201dWe fell into the usual conversation about how long newspapers would remain. He said he figured Sunday newspapers would be around at least another 20 years, though he wasn\u2019t sure he could say the same for the rest of the week.That leads back to where this column started. The newspaper, as we\u2019ve always known it, is dying. There will be a lot less to mourn, and even something to celebrate, if we come to find that it has an everlasting soul that lives on.The Mediator column on Monday, about the Newspaper Association of America\u2019s name change, misstated, in some copies, when it will become the News Media Alliance.

{"Headline": "No Clear Logic in Verizon\u2019s Digital Media Venture", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneMaybe I am a Luddite. I just don\u2019t get the industrial logic behind Verizon Communications\u2019 recent $9.2 billion foray into the digital media \u201cspace,\u201d especially because the way it has chosen to compete in it is by buying Yahoo and AOL, two companies that have seen much better days.In late July, Verizon, the telephone and wireless behemoth, agreed to buy Yahoo for $4.8 billion in cash. A year or so earlier, it bought AOL for $4.4 billion in cash. The money Verizon spent is hardly material to its $220 billion market capitalization, although it is still a lot of money. And both businesses combined generate about $7 billion revenue annually.Does it still have a good handle on how to invest the nearly $50 billion in cash flow that it has generated in the last 12 months, mostly from its gigantic wireless and old-fashioned telephone businesses? Or is flailing in unknown waters in a misguided quest to get into the business of providing digital advertising, where the two biggest competitors by far are the formidable Google (market cap, $530 billion) and Facebook (market cap, $363 billion)?Both AOL and Yahoo, when that deal closes early next year, will report up the Verizon chain of command to Marni M. Walden, an executive vice president, who is a leading contender to succeed Lowell McAdam, the Verizon chief executive, when he retires. (Mr. McAdam is 62; there is no mandatory retirement age for executives at Verizon.) Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL and the man generally credited with creating Google\u2019s online advertising sales team, appears to be the executive who will run both AOL and Yahoo on a day-to-day basis for Ms. Walden.Ms. Walden\u2019s future at Verizon is likely to depend on how well she and Mr. Armstrong execute on Verizon\u2019s AOL-Yahoo strategy. At 49, she is a highflier, for sure. She was paid nearly $7 million in 2015, and along with Tami Erwin, the head of Verizon\u2019s wireless business, she is one of only two women senior executives at the company. Verizon declined to make any of its executives available to discuss the logic of the AOL and Yahoo deals.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on moving forward running the business,\u201d Bob Varettoni, the head of corporate communications, emailed me.Instead, Mr. Varettoni pointed me to previous public comments Verizon executives have made. For instance, at the time of the AOL acquisition, Ms. Walden said, \u201cWe\u2019ve begun the next chapter in our history where we intend to become the No. 1 global media technology company for creators and advertisers and consumers.\u201d\u201cOur vision is to provide customers with a premium digital experience based on a global multiscreen platform,\u201d she added.She noted that AOL was a leader in \u201cdigital content and advertising platforms\u201d and that with Verizon, the combined company \u201ccreates a scaled mobile first platform directly targeted at the global advertising industry.\u201dVerizon\u2019s public relations team also pointed me to a transcript of Verizon\u2019s second-quarter 2016 earnings call. In the call, Mr. McAdam said that thanks to the AOL deal, which also brought with it The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, Verizon has learned \u201ca tremendous amount\u201d about the video market and opportunities for future growth. As for the Yahoo acquisition, Mr. McAdam said Verizon saw \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d in the digital video marketplace, which he said was expected to reach $180 billion by 2020.Without naming them, he said that two brands \u2013 the aforementioned Google and Facebook \u2014 dominated the market and that Verizon intended to be \u201ca significant player,\u201d too. \u201cContent creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption,\u201d he said.The Yahoo acquisition will allow Verizon to be a \u201cmajor competitor\u201d in mobile media, Mr. McAdam continued. He said Yahoo brought \u201cmarket-leading content\u201d in sports, finance, news and email and expanded Verizon\u2019s \u201canalytics and ad tech capabilities\u201d and enhanced \u201cour competitive position and value proposition to advertisers.\u201d For his part, Mr. Armstrong told Mr. Gelles: \u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new. People act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future.\u201dHonestly, I don\u2019t know what any of this means. It sounds like Verizon recognizes that the growth in its wireless business, while a cash machine, has peaked and that it needs to find new opportunities. It must think it has found that opportunity by trying to take a piece of the digital advertising market away from Google and Facebook. And even if AOL and Yahoo end up with only 5 percent of the market, by 2020, that will be nearly $4 billion in new revenue for Verizon, which is still just a fraction of its $130 billion in trailing 12 months\u2019 revenue.When I was a Wall Street banker covering the telecommunications industry, I worked on a number of mergers and acquisitions deals for what is now Verizon: the merger of GTE and Bell Atlantic, which created Verizon; the creation of Verizon Wireless; and the sale of groups of Verizon\u2019s wireless assets that posed conflicts for the company. I also worked on two deals that never came to fruition: Verizon\u2019s failed attempt to buy AirTouch, a big wireless provider, and Verizon\u2019s exploration of buying WorldCom for $100 billion, before WorldCom disintegrated. In each of these deals, I always had a clear sense of the company\u2019s strategic direction and priorities.But now I\u2019m more than a little confused. Which leads me to wonder what the market makes of Verizon\u2019s acquisition of Yahoo. Verizon\u2019s stock hovered around $56 a share before it announced the widely expected Yahoo acquisition. These days the stock is hovering around $53, a decline in Verizon\u2019s market capitalization of nearly $12 billion, or three times what it agreed to pay for Yahoo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shimon Peres, an Enduring Pillar From Israel\u2019s Founding Era, Dies at 93", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShimon Peres, one of the last surviving pillars of Israel\u2019s founding generation, who did more than anyone to build up his country\u2019s formidable military might, then worked as hard to establish a lasting peace with Israel\u2019s Arab neighbors, died on Wednesday in a Tel Aviv area hospital. He was 93.His death was announced by his son Nehemya Peres, who is known as Chemi, and his personal physician and son-in-law Dr. Rafi Walden, outside the Sheba Medical Center, where he had been hospitalized for the last two weeks.Mr. Peres died just over two weeks after suffering a stroke. Doctors kept him largely unconscious and on a breathing tube since then in the hope that it would give his brain a chance to heal. But he deteriorated as the nation he once led watched his last battle play out publicly and as leaders from around the world sent wishes for his recovery.As prime minister (twice); as minister of defense, foreign affairs, finance and transportation; and, until 2014, as president, Mr. Peres never left the public stage during Israel\u2019s seven decades.He led the creation of Israel\u2019s defense industry, negotiated key arms deals with France and Germany and was the prime mover behind the development of Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons. But he was consistent in his search for an accommodation with the Arab world, a search that in recent years left him orphaned as Israeli society lost interest, especially after the upheavals of the 2011 Arab Spring led to tumult on its borders.For someone who was dogged for decades by a reputation for vanity and back-room dealing, Mr. Peres ended his years in public office as a remarkably beloved figure, a founding pioneer who set an example for forward thinking by promoting the country\u2019s high-tech prowess and cultural reach.Never at a loss for a bon mot in his Polish-accented Hebrew, English and French, Mr. Peres said of his transformation: \u201cFor 60 years I was the most controversial figure in the country, and suddenly I\u2019m the most popular man in the land. Truth be told, I don\u2019t know when I was happier, then or now.\u201d12 PhotosIn his efforts to help Israel find acceptance in a hostile region, Mr. Peres\u2019s biggest breakthrough came in 1993, when he worked out a plan with the Palestine Liberation Organization for self-government in Gaza and in part of the West Bank, both of which were occupied by Israel.After months of secret negotiation with representatives of the P.L.O., conducted with the help of Norwegian diplomats and intellectuals, Mr. Peres persuaded his old political rival Yitzhak Rabin, then the prime minister, to accept the plan. It became known as the Oslo Accords.It was a gesture both unprecedented and historic. Up to that time, Israel had refused to negotiate directly with the P.L.O. Mr. Peres broke the taboo, and the impasse.\u201cWhat we are doing today is more than signing an agreement; it is a revolution,\u201d he said at the ceremony. \u201cYesterday a dream, today a commitment.\u201d\u201cWe are sincere,\u201d he pledged to the Palestinians. \u201cWe mean business. We do not seek to shape your lives or determine your destiny. Let all of us turn from bullets to ballots, from guns to shovels.\u201dThe former prime minister and president of Israel was a fountain of seemingly effortless bons mots and poetic musings.Later that day, in a television interview, Mr. Peres pronounced himself 100 percent sure that peace had arrived. With the changes in the world \u2014 the end of the Cold War; the collapse of the Soviet Union and with it its military, financial and diplomatic support of the P.L.O.; and the drying up of funds from Arab countries angered over Arafat\u2019s support of Iraq in the recent Persian Gulf war \u2014 the time had come for the Palestinians, too, to seek peace.\u201cIf you have children,\u201d he said, \u201cyou cannot feed them forever with flags for breakfast and cartridges for lunch. You need something more substantial. Unless you educate your children and spend less money on conflicts, unless you develop your science, technology and industry, you don\u2019t have a future.\u201dMr. Peres, Mr. Rabin and Arafat were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994.But the era of good feelings did not last. Barely a year later, Mr. Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish gunman upset by the accords; the death elevated Mr. Peres to the post of prime minister. But a series of Palestinian suicide bombings undercut Mr. Peres\u2019s authority, and he lost a narrow election to Mr. Netanyahu in 1996.Conflict between Israel and the Palestinians accelerated in 2000 after a visit by the opposition leader Ariel Sharon to the sacred plaza in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. The next day, the Israeli police fired on stone-throwing protesters, inaugurating a new round of violence that became known as the second intifada.Mr. Peres had tried before to get a peace settlement, in 1987, between Israel and Jordan. He was foreign minister in a coalition government with Yitzhak Shamir when he proposed an international peace conference on the Middle East. But Mr. Shamir and his Likud faction scuttled the plan.Mr. Peres had sought to settle the future of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel had occupied since the Arab-Israeli War in 1967. As a first step, he proposed that Jordan and Israel could either divide the land or share the government but that Israel should not control the area forever.Mr. Peres became prime minister at the head of an unusual coalition of Israel\u2019s two major political parties, his own Labor Party, and the Likud, the party led by Yitzhak Shamir, who served as deputy prime minister and foreign minister. In accordance with the coalition agreement, the two men exchanged posts after 25 months.Mr. Peres brought a period of tranquillity to the social environment, which had been frayed by animosities between European and Middle Eastern Jews and between religious Jews and secular Jews.He presided over the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon after an invasion that had generated unprecedented controversy, and he became the first Israeli prime minister to take the difficult steps required to deal with the nation\u2019s fundamental economic problems and ruinous inflation.During his time in office, Israel airlifted some 7,000 Ethiopian Jews who had trekked to refugee camps in Sudan to escape famine, anti-Semitism, forced conscription of boys and other threats that had made their lives in Ethiopia precarious. Mr. Peres called the clandestine rescue operation a \u201cdaring and wonderful\u201d act of \u201cself-redemption.\u201dTaking over what was expected to be a government of national impasse, Mr. Peres left office with an image as a dignified, self-confident statesman.But while he was prime minister, severe strains developed in relations between the United States and Israel growing out of a major spy scandal involving an American, Jonathan Jay Pollard, and the disclosure in 1986 of Iranian arms deals.A man of medium height and slender, athletic build \u2014 his dark hair turned gray and then white in his later years \u2014 Mr. Peres always exuded vitality, despite a schedule that kept him going 18 hours a day. When, on his 88th birthday, he was offered a traditional Jewish greeting, \u201cMay you live till 120,\u201d he retorted without missing a beat, \u201cDon\u2019t be stingy.\u201dMr. Peres was married to the former Sonya Gelman, who shunned the spotlight to the point of refusing to move into the president\u2019s house when he took his last public post. She died in January 2011. They had three children: a daughter, Zvia, and two sons, Jonathan and Nehemya. They and Mr. Peres\u2019s eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive him.Mr. Peres was an effective speaker, comfortable in front of large audiences as well as the television camera. He cultivated party members \u2014 remembering their names and attending their weddings and bar mitzvahs \u2014 and nurtured his relationship with the intelligentsia.He also wrote poetry and was given to quoting the ancient Greeks and Flaubert and Churchill. He published a dozen books, including \u201cThe New Middle East,\u201d in 1993, and \u201cBattling for Peace,\u201d a memoir, in 1995. His last book was an affectionate political biography of his mentor, the country\u2019s founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion.He was born Shimon Persky on Aug. 16, 1923, to a merchant family in the small village of Vishniewa, Poland. His parents, Yitzhak and Sara Persky, took him to Palestine when he was 11, where he studied in Tel Aviv and then entered an agricultural school.In 1941, he helped found Kibbutz Alumot in the eastern Lower Galilee, where he worked as a herdsman and was elected kibbutz secretary. He soon became active in the Mapai, which was to become Israel\u2019s Labor Party, and at 18 was appointed the coordinator of the youth movement of the Histadrut, the General Labor Federation.He rose rapidly, getting experience in the intricacies of Israeli political life. In 1944, Ben-Gurion, then the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, sent Mr. Peres with a small reconnaissance group to Eilat on the Red Sea to survey the Sinai Desert and make maps, which became important strategic assets during the 1948 war of independence.It was on that mission that a friend sighted a nest of eagles, \u201cperes\u201d in Hebrew. \u201cPersky,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you change your family name to Peres?\u201d He accepted the suggestion, though the bird they saw was in fact more a vulture than an eagle.When Israel became independent in 1948, Mr. Peres was named head of the naval service. Within two years, he was sent to the United States to lead a defense supply mission in New York. He was 27 and spoke no English, but within three months, after rounds of intensive private lessons, he was fluent. He took courses at the New School for Social Research and New York University, and later at the Harvard School of Public Administration.In 1951, Ben-Gurion, then prime minister and minister of defense, appointed Mr. Peres director general of the Defense Ministry, where he used his Harvard training to reorganize the department. Mr. Peres became known as one of \u201cBen-Gurion\u2019s boys\u201d \u2014 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of the \u201cOld Man\u201d \u2014 a group that included Teddy Kollek and Moshe Dayan.Those years may have been the genesis of a lifelong rivalry with Mr. Rabin, who at the time was chief of the operations branch, the second-highest position in the Israeli Army. He complained of what he called Mr. Peres\u2019s excessive authority.At the Defense Ministry, Mr. Peres was in charge of a substantial portion of the nation\u2019s total budget, and he played a central role in developing the young nation\u2019s industry, particularly in aeronautics and electronics.He stressed domestic weapons production, but when Egypt received advanced military equipment from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, Mr. Peres began to cast about for new sources of supply. He finally turned to France.His timing was excellent. The French believed the Algerian revolutionaries fighting for independence were fueled by President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and saw Israel as a source of intelligence about Egypt. Mr. Peres negotiated a $1 billion arms deal and acquired a reputation as a canny bargainer.The arms negotiations formed a basis for the Franco-Israeli alliance that led to Israel\u2019s lightning capture of Sinai in 1956. Zeev Schiff, for many years the military editor of the newspaper Haaretz, said, \u201cThere is no doubt that Peres was one of the brains behind Suez.\u201dBen-Gurion felt that a pre-emptive war was bad for Israel in terms of public opinion and was reluctant until the last. Mr. Peres saw it as an opportunity to get a better position among the superpowers, a special relationship through a \u201cjoint venture of going to war together.\u201dOut of that joint venture came French help in building a nuclear reactor in Dimona, which provided Israel with the ability to build nuclear weapons.\u201cI reached the stage in France where I was trusted by everybody, and really the sky was the limit,\u201d Mr. Peres said many years later.In 1957, Mr. Peres was awarded the French Legion of Honor, one of many international distinctions. In 2012, President Obama presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.The American honor partly reflected Israel\u2019s shift in alliance to the United States from Europe in previous decades. While under Ben-Gurion, and his successor, Levi Eshkol, Mr. Peres had negotiated with the West German defense minister, Franz Josef Strauss, to get arms and continued to get weapons from France as well. But he came to rely increasingly on the United States. He visited Washington frequently and met with Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.Mr. Peres ran for the country\u2019s Parliament, the Knesset, in 1959, in his first bid for national elective office. With the support of Ben-Gurion, he was given a position high enough on his party\u2019s electoral list to be assured of victory.In the political turmoil that preceded the 1967 Middle East War, Mr. Peres tried to negotiate a return to power for Ben-Gurion, who had retired. In the course of his negotiations, he proposed a coalition to Menachem Begin, the head of the right-wing Herut Party, despite Ben-Gurion\u2019s belief that if Mr. Begin ever came to power, he would bring Israel to the \u201cprecipice of destruction.\u201dShabtai Teveth, a professor of history at Tel Aviv University and the biographer of Ben-Gurion, said in an interview, \u201cI believe Peres will go down in Zionist and Israeli history as the man who legitimized Begin and the Herut.\u201dTen years later, in 1977, when Mr. Peres challenged Mr. Rabin, the split in the Labor Party opened the way for the election of Mr. Begin as prime minister.When Israel\u2019s top leaders were discredited because of the country\u2019s lack of preparedness for the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Mr. Peres made a bid for power. To block him, Finance Minister Pinchas Sapir recruited Mr. Rabin, who had been ambassador to the United States and bore no responsibility for the wartime failures. Mr. Rabin named Mr. Peres defense minister, a decision he later came to regret. In his memoirs, Mr. Rabin called him unscrupulous and untrustworthy. He wrote that he could not believe a word Mr. Peres said.Their decades-old feud flared again in 1976 when an Air France plane that left Tel Aviv for Paris was hijacked in Athens and taken to Entebbe, Uganda. The hijackers held about 100 Israeli passengers hostage. Mr. Peres accused Prime Minister Rabin of weakness for resisting a military solution. A raid by Israeli commandos on July 3, 1976, rescued 91 passengers and 12 crew members.The next year, Mr. Peres again sought nomination as his party\u2019s candidate for prime minister, but he again lost out to Mr. Rabin. When Mr. Rabin was forced to drop out after disclosures that he and his wife had violated Israeli law by maintaining a bank account in Washington, Mr. Peres led the party, but he lost in the general election to Mr. Begin.Mr. Peres finally became prime minister in 1984 when he led his Labor Party into the coalition with Likud.He returned to office as foreign minister in July 1992 in the government of Mr. Rabin and was soon working toward the accord signed a year later. In 1996, Mr. Peres, who had taken over as prime minister after Mr. Rabin\u2019s assassination, called an early election, certain of victory.But a series of terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and Mr. Peres\u2019s decision to mount an offensive against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon \u2014 during which scores of Lebanese refugees sheltering at a United Nations base in Qana died in an Israeli artillery barrage \u2014 led to ill feelings in Israel and the surprise victory by Mr. Netanyahu of Likud.Ehud Barak then replaced Mr. Peres as head of Labor and kept him in a minor role in his government, which was elected in 1999.Mr. Peres took Labor into the Sharon-led government in a bid for national unity. Later, in 2005, he left Labor and joined the new centrist party, Kadima, formed by Mr. Sharon.Mr. Peres, who frequently drew on historical allusions, thought of himself as a philosopher more than a politician. When asked about the 1993 Oslo Accords, he said: \u201cThere was no alternative. We had to do it.\u201d He added, \u201cAn ancient Greek philosopher was asked what is the difference between war and peace. \u2018In war,\u2019 he replied, \u2018the old bury the young. In peace, the young bury the old.\u2019 I felt that if I could make the world better for the young, that would be the greatest thing we can do.\u201dRemembering Nancy Reagan, David Bowie, Harper Lee, Merle Haggard, Anita Brookner, Clyde Lovellette, Anne Jackson, Monte Irvin, Maurice White, Umberto Eco and others who died this year.Because of an editing error, an obituary in some editions on Wednesday about Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and president of Israel, misstated the year that a Franco-Israeli alliance led to Israel\u2019s capture of Sinai.

That could change soon. Were a Democratic appointee to fill the current opening, laws could change on voting rights, corporate power, campaign finance, criminal justice and many other issues.Toobin\u2019s article got me thinking about how quickly the Supreme Court is likely to dominate the political scene if Hillary Clinton wins.Obama nominated a compromise candidate, in Merrick Garland, a highly regarded moderate who will soon turn 64, considerably older than other recent nominees. Garland\u2019s nomination expires at year\u2019s end. If the vacancy falls to Clinton to fill, she will face a decision.She could re-nominate him in the hope that this time he really would be easily confirmed. Or she could be more ambitious and choose a younger nominee, such as Sri Srinivasan, a 49-year-old federal judge whom Republicans have supported in the past.All things equal, Srinivasan would be likely to serve almost twice as long as Garland.Clinton will be in a stronger position if the Democrats retake the Senate \u2013 strong enough that choosing Garland again would strike me as a mistake. I\u2019ll delve into the details of a Senate vote in a future newsletter.

And what Bernie has done by speaking truth to power is connected to young people who are tired of career politicians and want to hear somebody just saying, \u2018Hey! The billionaires have a problem.\u2019 \u201dIn her race against the Republican nominee, John Faso \u2014 a former state assemblyman who mounted an unsuccessful bid for New York governor in 2006 \u2014 Ms. Teachout has challenged two of his biggest \u201csuper PAC\u201d donors to a debate. (They have not responded to her request.) And like Mr. Sanders, she splits with party leaders on trade, calling international trade deals like Nafta and the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u201cdisastrous.\u201dShe\u2019s even taken a page out of his stump speech, emphasizing her own small-dollar donations over her opponent\u2019s super PAC funding.\u201cBernie Sanders\u2019s average contribution was $27. What\u2019s our average contribution?\u201d Ms. Teachout asked attendees, who responded dutifully: \u201cNineteen dollars!\u201dJessica Visconte, a senior at SUNY New Paltz, said she hadn\u2019t heard of Ms. Teachout before the rally. She added that many of her fellow students voted for Mr. Sanders in the presidential race, and have now turned their support to the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein. She said she found Mrs. Clinton untrustworthy because of her shifting stance on issues.\u201cI feel like a lot of her opinions have changed over the course of the campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if she\u2019s learning new things, that\u2019s good, too.\u201dFor now, she\u2019s undecided between Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Stein, but knows one thing for sure.\u201cI know I\u2019m not voting for a Republican,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the consensus I\u2019ve reached.\u201dConstance Rudd, a retired court stenographer from Kingston, N.Y., said she voted for Ralph Nader in 2000 and supported Ms. Teachout when she ran for governor in 2014. In the presidential race this year, she\u2019s tempted to vote for Ms. Stein, but said she will probably end up voting for Mrs. Clinton.And what about Donald Trump?\u201cIf it gives you any indication, I bought a Trump dog toy,\u201d she said, adding that she was excited to get it home and have her dog \u201csink her teeth into it.\u201dDuncan Gilchrist, a recent graduate of American University in Washington, also planned to exercise the luxury of voting with his heart. He ran for, and won, his race to support Mr. Sanders as a delegate from New York\u2019s 18th Congressional District, but didn\u2019t end up going to the Democratic National Convention, citing prohibitively expensive hotel rates in Philadelphia that week.He said he\u2019s going to vote for Ms. Stein instead of Mrs. Clinton, in part because he knows Mrs. Clinton will likely win New York regardless.\u201cI\u2019m going to use my vote as an opportunity to actually vote my conscience, which is kind of a rare privilege,\u201d he said.\u201cBefore you cast a \u2018protest vote\u2019 \u2014 because either Clinton or Trump will become president \u2014 think hard about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a governor\u2019s race, this is not a state legislative race. This is the presidency of the United States. And I would say to those people out there who are thinking of the \u2018protest vote,\u2019 think about what the country looks like and whether you\u2019re comfortable with four years of a Trump presidency.\u201d\u201cEven if you\u2019re totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that, and I want to do my best to answer those questions,\u201d she said, later adding: \u201cI can\u2019t promise you\u2019ll agree with me all the time, but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better.\u201dIf young voters do turn out for Mrs. Clinton in November, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll take Greyhound buses to swing states to knock on doors in for her campaign. For many older millennials, Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in 2008 was a moment of political awakening. For many younger millennials, Mr. Sanders\u2019s run served as a similar awakening. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own historic candidacy is treated as an afterthought.Brianna Alberga, a freshman political science major, was making her way across the field in New Paltz carrying a small skateboard when she was accosted by both a reporter and a volunteer from the Teachout campaign.She said she\u2019d voted for Mr. Sanders in the presidential primary, and argued with her mother and grandparents, who voted for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI might vote for Hillary, but I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, adding that she\u2019s afraid Mrs. Clinton won\u2019t follow through on the promises she made after Mr. Sanders pushed her campaign to the left in the primary.\u201cBut I hope she proves me wrong,\u201d she added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chicago\u2019s Plan to Toughen Oversight of Police Is Under Fire", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe appointed a task force made up of leading civil rights experts, academics and lawyers to improve policing. The task force made blunt recommendations for fundamental changes in the oversight of the Chicago police.One of the most important recommendations was the creation of a tough new agency to investigate serious misconduct and police shootings, replacing a feckless predecessor. Crucial to the agency would be the selection of an administrator by a new community oversight board, a process that was to be insulated from politics to discourage interference in investigations.The task force also said the new agency\u2019s budget should be determined by a set formula that guaranteed enough money to do a credible job \u2014 which also would avoid efforts by a mayor or by aldermen to starve it if they were upset by crackdowns on wayward police officers or wanted to appease the powerful police union.Mayor Emanuel revealed his proposal for the new agency, to be called the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, last week. But a decision on how to choose its administrator was put off, with his office saying only that the to-be-determined community board would \u201cplay a role.\u201d There was no mention of the process being sheltered from political influence, as the task force urged. Nor did his proposal include a mechanism to protect the agency\u2019s budget or ensure it would have enough money.The mayor\u2019s plan disappointed some who worked on the task force, who said it showed little willingness to change. They said that the proposal seemed to indicate a reluctance by the mayor to cede control of the oversight of the police, which he had shared under the system that was being replaced.Others, while concerned the proposal fell short, said that the mayor deserved some credit, that his plan incorporated other recommendations, and that they were optimistic that it would be amended before the City Council voted on the plan at the end of the month.\u201cThis has an unhappy feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d said Locke Bowman, executive director of the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center at Northwestern\u2019s Pritzker School of Law, comparing the plan to previous efforts to change oversight of the police. He added that the proposed agency \u201cseems like alphabet soup, changing the letters and very little else.\u201dBut Lori E. Lightfoot, the chairwoman of the task force, said she believed the process was \u201cmoving forward in a way that is giving me optimism,\u201d though more must be done to guarantee that the new agency and a proposed police inspector general had enough resources.What the city is now deciding is how much latitude \u2014 and independence \u2014 to give those who would oversee and investigate serious allegations of misconduct by the police. The decision carries significance in the national debate on policing in the aftermath of video of black people being shot in Chicago and other American cities and towns that has spurred investigations and demand for change.Activists are looking to the proposal for signs of how far Chicago is willing to go to mend the deeply fractured relationship between the police and minority residents, which worsened after the video emerged in November of the police killing of Laquan McDonald, 17.The Council vote, which includes the plan for the new police inspector general, is Sept. 29.A mayoral aide who was authorized to speak about the plan only without attribution declined to say whether the mayor\u2019s proposal might be substantially altered by then, but said nothing had been ruled out. The aide noted that decisions about how to structure the new community oversight board \u2014 another task force recommendation \u2014 were delayed at the request of community leaders, who sought more time for review. \u201cWe should wait to see what they come up with,\u201d the aide said.The aide also pointed out that the plan had been released a month early, providing critics with a chance to weigh in. The aide said that many of its details were in line with other recommendation by the task force.For almost a year, Chicago and its high-profile mayor have been reeling from the fallout of the McDonald slaying. The public reaction to the video drove out the police superintendent and led to an investigation by the Justice Department.So far, critics said, the progress has been slow.\u201cThe mayor\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t embrace accountability and transparency, and really just seems like window dressing,\u201d said Sheila Bedi, a professor at Northwestern\u2019s law school and a member of one task force working group. \u201cElemental concepts of police oversight are being ignored.\u201dShe noted another problem: The Civilian Office of Police Accountability would use the city\u2019s Law Department \u2014 which also represents the mayor and police officers \u2014 to enforce subpoenas and take other action in pursuit of officers whom the same law department may also be defending, she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a legal scholar to see the clear conflict.\u201dIn the past, failures of the system have presented leaders with opportunities to improve accountability, but the city has not followed through, said Mr. Bowman, a member of the task force working group on the oversight of the police. He recalled the cover-up after an officer assaulted a female bartender in 2007.Ms. Lightfoot, who headed the task force, said the mayor should get some credit for his proposal, which she said contained elements of the recommendations. And she said she was hopeful the mayor would resolve the financing and legal conflict issues by the time the City Council voted.\u201cI don\u2019t think the final die has been cast,\u201d she said, adding that the mayor was aware of \u201cthe very strong desire\u201d in the community that the agency\u2019s future leaders be selected in a way that fosters credibility and independence.Asked why Mayor Emanuel did not embrace more of what the task force recommended, she answered, \u201cI don\u2019t do mind-reading very well.\u201dThe mayor could tighten his plan out of tactical necessity, if minority aldermen who often support him want a tougher measure. Some say his staff is working to address those concerns.\u201cThere are a handful of provisions that the ordinance absolutely must get right, and the mayor\u2019s proposal gets some of them right,\u201d said Adam Gross, another member of the oversight working group. \u201cThere is a lot of time between now and Sept. 29 to get things right, and a lot of reasons to get them right.\u201dAdditional changes may lie ahead, depending on the conclusions of the Justice Department investigation and on whether city leaders agree with a task force recommendation to revise a police contract that gives officers wide protections, like being able to amend statements if video or audio evidence contradicts them.But Mr. Gross, director of justice reform at Business and Professional People for the Public Interest in Chicago, a law and public policy center, said the current plan contained \u201cvery troubling gaps that threaten the independence\u201d of the oversight agency and the police inspector general, which \u201ccan\u2019t worry that their budget will be cut just for telling the truth.\u201dThe mayoral aide said the fixed-budget proposal for the new agency required more study because it would be a departure from usual practice.Deferring decisions on the agency\u2019s leadership and powers of the community oversight board may also mean that those choices are hashed out around the same time the Justice Department completes its investigation \u2014 possibly influencing the final oversight package.Still, Alderman Ricardo Mu\u00f1oz, chairman of the council\u2019s police reform subcommittee, said, \u201cWe cannot wait for D.O.J.\u2019s recommendations, because we need to fix the trust issue between the police and the community as soon as possible.\u201dHe said Mr. Emanuel\u2019s proposal was a \u201cgood first draft\u201d but needed improvements that he suggested might include ceding some control.\u201cHis style is to be a micromanager,\u201d Mr. Munoz said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Refugees in Lebanon, Cash Instead of Camps", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesDoes 10,000 seem a lot?Consider Lebanon, a country of 4.5 million people that has taken in probably close to 1.5 million Syrians fleeing their civil war. At equivalent levels, the United States would have 107 million Syrian refugees by now.I am not arguing that the United States should take in millions of Syrians. But Americans should appreciate that Lebanon is doing them and Europe a huge favor.And at great cost. Lebanon is not a prosperous country. The economy is weak and its democracy is battered by destructive religious divisions, complicated by outside intervention \u2014 Syrian troops occupied the country from 1976 to 2005. There has been no president for two years.Lebanon, of course, is also home to half a million Palestinians, some of them residents of refugee camps for 60 years. Largely for that reason, Lebanon has not permitted the building of camps for the Syrians.Instead, they live in limbo.Until January 2015, Lebanon\u2019s border with Syria was open. Now it is closed and the country has set rules that make life much harder for the refugees who are there. Perhaps 70 percent of Syrian refugees do not have legal residency, which can also mean they can\u2019t get work, shelter, education or health care, according to Human Rights Watch.That leaves them open to all kinds of exploitation. Syrians do off-the-books jobs for a pittance. Their children sell candy on the street. They squat in abandoned buildings with no water or electricity, lodge with families who are struggling themselves, sleep in makeshift tent cities.The world has well-worn systems for dealing with refugees in camps. But how do you help urban refugees?Lebanon\u2019s government and international aid groups are doing something new. Cash is keeping the refugees alive \u2014 and it should be noted, off the path to Europe.Cash isn\u2019t the solution everywhere. Goods must be available. Markets must be functional, and large enough so that an infusion of new cash isn\u2019t inflationary. Since it\u2019s easier, safer and carries less risk of corruption to provide cash electronically instead of handing people envelopes of bills, mechanisms should exist for debit cards or cellphone banking.But that covers much of the world, even in emergency situations. It\u2019s no problem in Lebanon, a middle-income country known for commerce. \u201cWe\u2019re using in the humanitarian sector what you and I experience in our normal retail life,\u201d said Dominik Heinrich, the food program\u2019s country director for Lebanon.Here\u2019s how it works: Each needy Syrian refugee family gets a banking card. Family members use it to shop for food at the 450 participating stores and markets; a family of five gets about $135 per month.Especially vulnerable families also get cash. They can withdraw $174 per month in cash, to spend anywhere, on whatever they need most.Next month, all the different agencies that give cash will be combining forces to use the same bank card. The food comes from the World Food Program. The cash comes from either the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or the Lebanon Cash Consortium, which is a collaboration of several private relief groups, led by Save the Children. Unicef also gives cash to families who need it to keep warm in the winter.Many humanitarian groups in Lebanon help with sanitation systems and other in-kind assistance. Many run schools, or provide skills or business training. The cash is intended to address (a little; it\u2019s not really enough to live on) refugees\u2019 most urgent problems: What\u2019s for dinner? Where am I sleeping?\u201cThere is nothing that could replace cash,\u201d said Alan Moseley, the Lebanon country director for the International Rescue Committee, a member of the Lebanon Cash Consortium. \u201cIf we provided shelter materials, clothing, food or direct rent subsidies, it would be more costly to deliver and people would be getting things they don\u2019t necessarily need.\u201dCash has particular advantages for refugees, who are sometimes on the move. A cash card travels better than grain, buckets and blankets.Another major way cash can help refugees: it builds good will with hosts far better than sacks of grain can. Lebanon\u2019s enormous generosity has many critics: politicians demonize refugees, and citizens resent the strain they put on schools, social services and local wages. Locals also see foreigners get help that the citizens themselves could use.When refugees get foodstuffs it can make tensions worse \u2014 they often sell their grain for prices lower than in local stores.In Lebanon, however, Syrians go to nearby stores to buy food that has been grown by local farmers and transported in local trucks. Kevin Murphy, senior manager for cash assistance at the International Rescue Committee, said that every dollar in cash assistance generates more than $2 for the Lebanese economy. When the food program cut its payments last year, \u201cwe saw a lot of backlash from local vendors,\u201d Moseley said.The International Rescue Committee, for example, runs cash-for-work programs in two regions. About 2,500 people, both Syrians and Lebanese, can earn $200 each month for 10 days of collecting trash, cleaning up public areas and making repairs in parks.On a much wider scale, the food program\u2019s cards also go to the poorest Lebanese. Their card is a different color, but Lebanese families can shop in the same stores. Heinrich said that Lebanon first tried to set up such a program for its citizens in 2008, but the logistics had been troublesome (the program used paper vouchers). The country succeeded only after the refugees\u2019 digital cash system was in place \u2014 an example of locals benefiting in some ways from hosting refugees.One problem that cash can\u2019t solve is the big one: There\u2019s not enough aid. Last year a conference of rich-country donors to Syria raised only half its goal. As a result, in July 2015 the food program cut its assistance in half, and Syrian refugees in Lebanon began receiving only $13 per person per month to buy food.It\u2019s strongly in the interest of Europe and the United States to compensate Lebanon richly for its service to the refugees, and to help Syrians there live lives as close as possible to normal. \u201cHere, home is 50 kilometers away,\u201d said Heinrich. \u201cYou are in an environment with the same culture, food, climate, religion. If you have hope, you don\u2019t reach the desperate measures of using your last savings to move thousands of kilometers to a strange country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge, Citing Inequality, Orders Connecticut to Overhaul Its School System", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a decision that could fundamentally reshape public education in Connecticut, the state was ordered on Wednesday to make changes in everything from how schools are financed to which students are eligible to graduate from high school to how teachers are paid and evaluated.Reading his ruling from the bench for more than two hours, Judge Thomas Moukawsher of State Superior Court in Hartford said that \u201cConnecticut is defaulting on its constitutional duty\u201d to give all children an adequate education.Judge Moukawsher\u2019s decision was a response to a lawsuit filed more than a decade ago that claimed the state was shortchanging the poorest districts when it came to school funding. What separates the decision from those in dozens of similar suits around the country is that rather than addressing money only, it requires the state to rethink nearly every major aspect of its system.\u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d said Joseph P. Ganim, the mayor of Bridgeport, Conn., one of the state\u2019s poorest and lowest-performing school districts. \u201cIt\u2019s an indictment of the application of the system, and of the system itself.\u201dJoseph P. Moodhe, who represented the plaintiffs in the case, Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding, said that virtually every state had faced an education funding suit. This year, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that the state\u2019s financing plan created \u201cintolerable\u201d inequities. And in New York, a 2006 lawsuit was supposed to yield additional money in New York City and districts with high poverty rates, but a battle persists over whether the state is meeting its obligations.William S. Koski, a professor of law and education at Stanford University, called the scope of the ruling \u201chighly unusual.\u201d\u201cMost of these school finance lawsuits are about numbers, and about whether adequate funding is being provided for whatever learning outcomes the court establishes,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, it\u2019s typically about the money.\u201dIn his ruling, Judge Thomas Moukawsher of State Superior Court in Hartford said that \u201cConnecticut is defaulting on its constitutional duty\u201d to give all children an adequate education.As for the Connecticut ruling, he said, \u201cI would call it a school reform decision rather than a school funding decision.\u201dConnecticut is known for the quality of its schools, and the decision cited several impressive statistics about the good ones, including the highest average reading scores in the country for fourth and eighth graders on the 2013 National Assessment of Education Progress, or N.A.E.P., often called the nation\u2019s report card.But the state is also home to failing schools, especially those serving poor children. The 2015 N.A.E.P. report found that poor students in 40 other states, including perennial poorly performing Mississippi and Arkansas, did better than poor students in Connecticut. Schools serving the poorest children are concentrated in 30 of the state\u2019s 169 municipalities.The current system \u201chas left rich school districts to flourish and poor school districts to flounder,\u201d Judge Moukawsher said, betraying a promise in the State Constitution to give children a \u201cfair opportunity for an elementary and secondary school education.\u201dConnecticut finances its schools with a combination of local property taxes and federal and state money in a way that is supposed to offset the huge disparities in property values between rich and poor towns. Bridgeport, court documents noted, has nearly eight times the population of nearby New Canaan, but property in that wealthy Fairfield County town is worth more than $1 billion more.The state has faced a punishing fiscal crisis this year, resulting in layoffs and spending cutbacks. That led the General Assembly to cut state education aid to some of the poorest districts, with more than $905,000 cut from Bridgeport, and more than $600,000 cut from New Haven. Comparatively wealthy districts got more money: Branford, a New Haven suburb, got a funding increase of $300,000.\u201cAn approach that allows rich towns to raid money desperately needed by poor towns makes a mockery of the state\u2019s constitutional duty to provide adequate educational opportunities to all students,\u201d Judge Moukawsher wrote.The heart of the decision was a critique of the different quality of education the state\u2019s children receive.Sixth graders in the richest school districts are four grade levels ahead of children in the poorest districts.Judge Moukawsher called graduation standards and rising graduation rates meaningless. He said that the Bridgeport school superintendent acknowledged that a \u201cfunctionally illiterate person could get a Bridgeport high school degree.\u201dThe judge also criticized how teachers are evaluated and paid. Teachers in Connecticut, as elsewhere, are almost universally rated as effective on evaluations, even when their students fail. Teachers\u2019 unions have argued that teachers should not be held responsible for all of the difficulties poor students have. And while the judge called those concerns legitimate, he was unconvinced that no reasonable way existed to measure how much teachers managed to teach.\u201cWhy bother measuring students if it never has any direct connection to how they\u2019re being taught,\u201d he wrote.He said that the state also needed to revamp how it identified and served children with special education needs because the criteria for receiving services varied widely from town to town.Judge Moukawsher did not dictate any new funding formula in his ruling or explain what the state\u2019s graduation requirements or other policies should be. Instead, he ordered the attorney general\u2019s office to submit plans within 180 days to fix the areas he had found deficient. It was not immediately clear who might draw up the proposals or whether the state would appeal the decision.The attorney general\u2019s office said in an email that \u201cwe are reviewing this decision in consultation with our client agencies and decline to comment further at this time.\u201dOn Wednesday, he said, \u201cWe know that to improve outcomes for all Connecticut students and to close persistent achievement gaps, we need to challenge the status quo and take bold action.\u201d He added, \u201cWe know there is more work to do.\u201dPutting the sweep of Judge Moukawsher\u2019s decision into practice will be a challenge for the state, said Mr. Ganim, the Bridgeport mayor. \u201cThe easiest part of this,\u201d he said, \u201cis probably the funding.\u201dAn article on Sept. 8 about a judge\u2019s order that Connecticut overhaul its school system quoted incorrectly from part of the ruling. Judge Thomas Moukawsher wrote that the current system \u201chas left rich school districts to flourish and poor school districts to flounder,\u201d not \u201cfounder.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Clash of Titans? Opponents of Pier 55 Have Secret Backer, Media Mogul Says", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sides are due back in court on Tuesday, when the State Supreme Court\u2019s Appellate Division will hear arguments on whether to dismiss objections to the project or impose an injunction barring further work on it.But Mr. Diller now says there is a hidden hand at work in all of this, one nursing a grudge and possessing deep pockets. If true, this legal battle could actually be something much bigger \u2014 a proxy war between two titans of industry.\u201cThe backer of all this,\u201d Mr. Diller said in a recent interview, \u201cis one Douglas Durst.\u201dMr. Durst, the real estate tycoon whose family owns a dozen Manhattan skyscrapers and who was an active supporter of the nonprofit Friends of Hudson River Park, the fund-raising partner of the trust, when it formed in 1999, might seem an unlikely antagonist. He served as chairman of the group and donated $1 million to it.He declined last week to say whether he is financing the lawsuits against the project, known formally as Pier 55 and informally as Diller Island. But in a terse statement, he said, \u201cI do not like the process or the project and I am in favor of the litigation.\u201dCity Club\u2019s lawyer, Richard D. Emery, argues that the trust failed to conduct a proper environmental review. The club has also said that the trust should have sought other potential developers, rather than simply handing such a valuable site over to Mr. Diller.David Paget, a lawyer representing the trust in the Pier 55 lawsuits, said his clients went well beyond what was required in the group\u2019s environmental review, its solicitation of public input and its publication of public comments and responses.Hudson River Park, which runs for four miles along the West Side of Manhattan, is supposed to be a self-sustaining public-private partnership. It is run by the trust, whose board is appointed by the governor and the mayor. Commercial ventures within its boundaries, such as the sports complex Chelsea Piers, are supposed to generate funds for the maintenance of the park. But the park itself remains unfinished and has long been starved for money.Though Mr. Durst publicly said then that he had agreed \u201cto step down for the benefit of the park,\u201d making way for others who could donate or solicit more money, he seethed in an unpublished interview at what he saw as the highhandedness of the trust\u2019s leadership.Around the same time, Ms. Taylor secretly approached Mr. Diller for help in rebuilding the decaying Pier 54, at 13th Street, which was slowly falling into the Hudson River.Mr. Diller eventually suggested that Pier 54 be replaced with an entirely new, 2.4-acre pier shaped like a parallelogram, with three performance venues amid trees.The idea was that Mr. Diller would cover most of the cost and create a nonprofit to oversee theatrical, musical and other performances. He enlisted help from Scott Rudin, the film and theater producer, and George C. Wolfe, the former head of the Public Theater. He promised to run the park and pay the operating expenses for 20 years. The cost has now swelled to more than $200 million from its original $130 million.The proposal went public in November 2014. It gained support from many quarters, but some groups questioned the secretive planning, private control of public spaces and the impact on the environment.\u201cSomebody\u2019s got to pay for it,\u201d Ms. Taylor said at the time. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the money.\u201dOver the last year, the trust approved a lease with a nonprofit group established by Mr. Diller and his family foundation. The city and the state approved the project, as did the Army Corps of Engineers and the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation.City Club filed its first lawsuit last year in State Supreme Court. The suit was dismissed last April, but Mr. Emery went to the Appellate Division for an expedited appeal and a temporary halt to construction, which was granted. The court did allow the trust to install nine of 550 piles for the pier before the appeal could be heard this month.Mr. Emery, when asked whether Mr. Durst was involved, said that all decisions about the case had been made by his client, City Club. A spokesman for the club said its president, Michael Gruen, could not be reached for comment.Those looking for connections might note that another party to the suit is Tom Fox, also a longtime member of the Friends group\u2019s board who was pushed out in 2011. Mr. Fox was a co-owner with Mr. Durst of New York Water Taxi, a ferry company now run by Mr. Durst\u2019s daughter Helena. Mr. Fox could not be reached for comment.And Mr. Emery represented Mr. Durst and the Durst Organization in connection with the HBO documentary \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d about Mr. Durst\u2019s estranged brother, Robert, who is in federal prison awaiting trial on murder charges.Then there is City Club itself, which has actions in three courts against Mr. Diller\u2019s project. That is an enormously expensive undertaking for an organization that suspended activities in 2003 for lack of money, only to be revived a few years ago by Mr. Gruen and other civic advocates.Mr. Diller was convinced enough of Mr. Durst\u2019s involvement that this spring he called Mr. Durst in an attempt to gain his support. They held two meetings. On May 2, Mr. Durst went to the IAC building. A week later, they met in Mr. Durst\u2019s Midtown office.Mr. Durst declined to divulge any details, saying they were supposed to be \u201coff-the-record, one-on-one meetings.\u201d But Mr. Diller said that at the first meeting, Mr. Durst did not raise any objections to the project itself, but described his unhappiness with Ms. Taylor and Ms. Wils.At the second meeting, Mr. Diller recalled, Mr. Durst told him, \u201cI don\u2019t like your process,\u201d saying that there should have been a full environmental review of the project and an auction offering the pier project to competing developers, which were points raised by City Club in its legal actions.In the end, according to Mr. Diller, Mr. Durst told him, \u201cYou have my sympathy.\u201d\u201cI turned around and walked out,\u201d Mr. Diller said.In the latest court filings, City Club contends that Mr. Diller has total control over the park and the nonprofit that would run Pier 55, and holds any potential rights to rebroadcast performances at Pier 55. Those could be lucrative rights that could be assigned to Mr. Diller\u2019s media company, the legal papers say.\u201cSo when Taylor Swift plays Diller Island, the audio, the video and all other ancillary rights are (un)fair game for IAC distribution and exploitation,\u201d Mr. Emery wrote in court papers filed on Aug. 19.Mr. Diller scoffed at the notion and said the lawsuits are multiple \u201cgarbage balls thrown at us.\u201d He, Mr. Rudin and Mr. Wolfe have no interest in Pier 55 being a stop on anyone\u2019s tour, he said. He added that most of the venues are too small for big acts like Ms. Swift. One stage, Mr. Diller said, could accommodate about 300 people, while the amphitheater might seat up to 750 people. The main area, or piazza, would fit about 3,000, he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll use that very sparingly.\u201d\u201cPier 55 will never own any copyrights,\u201d Mr. Diller said. \u201cIf profits ever accrue to a production, they go back into the pier. Not me, not my family, Scott Rudin or George Wolfe will profit from this. We\u2019re all in a nonprofit enterprise, full stop.\u201dHe said he remained undaunted.\u201cIt\u2019s what you expect when you put a good New York foot forward,\u201d he said.An article on Monday about accusations by the media mogul Barry Diller that the real estate tycoon Douglas Durst has secretly backed efforts to block a cultural pier on the West Side of Manhattan misstated the role of a Durst ally, Tom Fox, at New York Water Taxi, a ferry company now run by Mr. Durst\u2019s daughter Helena. Mr. Fox was a co-owner of the company, not an employee.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hinkley Point Nuclear Plant Will Go Ahead, Britain Says", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 After delaying a project to build a nuclear power plant with Chinese investment, Britain\u2019s government on Thursday gave the go-ahead for the plant, but insisted on new conditions designed to protect the security of critical infrastructure.The decision ended weeks of uncertainty that had strained relations with China, which is financing more than a third of the $23.7 billion power station, and with France, whose largely state-owned energy giant EDF is paying for the bulk of the project.By pressing ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant on the Somerset coast of England, Prime Minister Theresa May appears to be open to greater involvement by China in Britain\u2019s energy industry. China also wants to build and operate a nuclear plant of its own design at another British site, at Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex.Mrs. May said in July that her government would not yet sign off on the Hinkley Point deal, reportedly on security and economic grounds, deciding instead to review the plans for the new power plant. It was one of her first big political moves after succeeding David Cameron as prime minister, and was seen as a sign that she was uncomfortable with some aspects of Mr. Cameron\u2019s aggressive pursuit of an economic partnership with Beijing.In recent weeks, Mrs. May has upended a variety of Mr. Cameron\u2019s domestic policies. She has abandoned his financial targets and, most recently, overturned his education policy by advocating for allowing selective admissions in schools.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Thursday\u2019s decision suggested that the price of any significant policy shift on the Hinkley project would simply have been too high.If the project did not proceed, the French energy firm, EDF, would have made claims to be compensated for development and construction; trade with China would have almost certainly suffered; and Britain would have lost out on the Hinkley plant\u2019s production, expected to be able to cover 7 percent of the country\u2019s electricity needs. And with around 26,000 jobs at stake, British trade unions were campaigning for the power station to go ahead.Britain\u2019s energy secretary, Greg Clark, promised on Thursday that the government \u201cwill introduce a series of measures to enhance security and will ensure Hinkley cannot change hands without the government\u2019s agreement.\u201d\u201cAfter Hinkley, the British government will take a special share in all future nuclear new build projects,\u201d he added.That announcement seemed designed to increase British control over critical aspects of national infrastructure, similar to those exercised by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.After the delay to the Hinkley project\u2019s approval was announced in July, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, said in a commentary that it added \u201cuncertainties to the \u2018Golden Era\u2019 of China-U.K. ties.\u201d\u201cChina can wait for a rational British government to make responsible decisions,\u201d the editorial said, \u201cbut cannot tolerate any unwanted accusation against its sincere and benign willingness for win-win cooperation.\u201dWith its huge economic muscle, China is a formidable trade partner for Britain, particularly after Britain\u2019s vote to quit the European Union. Mrs. May\u2019s government is hoping to boost trade with non-European partners. She and President Xi Jinping of China met at the gathering of Group of 20 leaders this month in Hangzhou, China.On Thursday, China\u2019s CGN, which is one of the partners in the Hinkley deal, said it was \u201cdelighted that the British government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation.\u201dMichel Sapin, the French finance and economy minister, said in a statement Thursday that the decision was \u201ca major step in French-British industrial and energy cooperation.\u201dHowever the opposition Labour Party in Britain dismissed the new security safeguards announced by the government as \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d saying that most of the protection they afforded could already be achieved under existing legislation.Critics of the Hinkley project said the British government had ignored the biggest failing of the project: It is a bad deal for the money.In exchange for building the plant, EDF has been guaranteed 92.50 pounds (about $120) for every megawatt hour of electricity produced, rising with inflation, for 35 years \u2014 equivalent to more than twice the current wholesale price of electricity.Javier C.

Her efforts brought in $143 million for her campaign and for Democratic organizations, according to her campaign. That is far more than the $90 million haul Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats reported in July.But most of the increase is coming in the form of contributions earmarked for Democratic Party organizations.Mrs. Clinton has been making particularly avid use of new fund-raising limits ushered in by court rulings and new campaign finance rules. Her largest donors are writing checks for $350,000 or more, effectively a combined contribution to her campaign, the D.N.C. and dozens of state parties participating in her joint fund-raising effort.Though a relatively small chunk of the money goes back to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, the party cash can be used to buttress her with field efforts and other spending in swing states.\u201cWe are heading into the final two months of the race with the resources we need to organize and mobilize millions of voters across the country,\u201d Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign began September with $68 million in cash on hand.

{"Headline": "Does Donald Trump Pay Taxes? Here\u2019s What We Know", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd she pounced at Monday night\u2019s debate, suggesting that perhaps Mr. Trump was concealing that he had not been so charitable or was not as wealthy as he claimed.But another possibility she raised \u2014 that Mr. Trump had not been paying income taxes \u2014 set off a curious response from him that sounded a lot like an admission.\u201cThat makes me smart,\u201d Mr. Trump said after Mrs. Clinton brought up how he had paid no taxes more than two decades ago. When she suggested that Mr. Trump was still paying no federal taxes, and had not done so for many years, Mr. Trump offered another retort: \u201cIt would be squandered, too, believe me.\u201dFor someone as wealthy as Mr. Trump to pay no federal income taxes would be remarkable, and it was a startling twist. By Tuesday, he was awash in questions \u2014 and, in some quarters, outrage \u2014 about how a self-described billionaire could possibly avoid having to pay a single dollar to the tax man.\u201cTrump Sniffs at Paying Taxes,\u201d the Democratic National Committee said in a statement during the debate.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his returns, it remains unclear whether he has managed to pay no taxes. Mr. Trump suggested after the debate that viewers would be mistaken to draw that conclusion from his comments onstage.\u201cOf course I pay federal taxes,\u201d he told reporters.Though it is not required by law, every other presidential nominee from a major party since 1976 has released tax returns, or at least a summary of them, and the public has pored over the paperwork for clues about how wealthy and charitable the candidates are. In recent years, with rising concerns about income inequality and the emergence of ultrarich candidates, those returns have also been scrutinized for whatever breaks officeseekers might be using to avoid paying the higher rates expected of the top 1 percent.Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, even gave up $1.75 million in charitable deductions that they were entitled to, in order to make their tax return consistent with Mr. Romney\u2019s earlier claim that he had paid at least 13 percent of his income in taxes.Mr. Romney, who had a long career in finance, benefited from the lower tax rate on so-called carried interest, which can make up a substantial portion of a private equity manager\u2019s income. Democrats in Congress have tried unsuccessfully to tax carried interest as ordinary income.Though Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has declined to answer questions about his taxes and tax rates, there are several ways tax law could be helping him, experts said.When President Ronald Reagan and Congress agreed to a tax overhaul in 1986, those loopholes were mostly closed for outside investors \u2014 including lawyers, dentists and small-business owners \u2014 who put money in such developments for the sole reason of generating losses on paper that would enable them to shelter their other income from taxes. But active real estate investors and developers were allowed to keep that tax break, Mr. Rosenthal said, and the power of the real estate lobby has muted any thought of revoking it.Limited liability companies, of which Mr. Trump has scores, and partnerships can also deduct the cost of the interest they pay on loans, a benefit for sectors like real estate that depend on debt financing. (Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, included a proposal to end interest payment deductions in his tax blueprint.)Though little is known about Mr. Trump\u2019s recent income taxes, limited information about his taxes in some years has surfaced in court and regulatory records.In a 1981 report assessing Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for a casino license, New Jersey\u2019s casino commission reported that he had paid more than $71,000 in federal income taxes on about $218,000 of taxable income earned from 1975 to 1977.But in 1978 and 1979, the report said, Mr. Trump paid no federal income taxes. By taking advantage of deductions available to real estate developers and claiming losses from partnerships, Mr. Trump reported a \u201cnegative income\u201d of $406,379 in 1978 and $3.4 million in 1979 \u2014 thus avoiding any tax liability for those two years, a time when he claimed to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Tax court records indicate that Mr. Trump also avoided paying any federal income taxes in 1984. In 1991 and 1993, at a time when Mr. Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casinos were in deep financial trouble, casino commission reports show that he claimed losses that would have allowed him to avoid paying income taxes in those years, too. Mr. Trump may have been able to use those losses to reduce or eliminate his federal tax bill for years to come.With the race in its final phase, there is substantial interest among voters in Mr. Trump\u2019s making his taxes public, according to recent polls. A CBS News/New York Times Poll this month showed that 59 percent of respondents said it was necessary for him to release his tax returns. In a survey by Fox News last month, 60 percent said they believed Mr. Trump was hiding something in his returns.During the debate, Mrs. Clinton seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, saying that if he had not paid taxes, that meant \u201czero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.\u201dGrover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a prominent Trump supporter, said in an interview that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s line of attack was unfair.\u201cIt is a dirty trick of her to pull that,\u201d Mr. Norquist said. \u201cShe knows damn well that people in that industry, housing and construction, lose millions of dollars or gain millions of dollars in a year,\u201d based on a number of factors, sometimes outside the control of the developer.Lost in the debate is that Mr. Trump did not fail to pay taxes that he owed, Mr. Norquist said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t owe any taxes.\u201dIn hindsight, Mr. Norquist said, Mr. Trump should have simply said, \u201cI\u2019ve paid every dollar in taxes I owed.\u201dBut Bob McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, which favors tax policies in which the wealthy pay a larger share, called Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming pride in paying little or nothing in taxes an \u201canti-American\u201d view.He said he worried that Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters would take his words as inspiration to pay no taxes themselves, legally or otherwise, because they \u201chate the government and think they are going to waste your money.\u201d\u201cThink where we would be if everyone did that,\u201d Mr. McIntyre said.David Barstow contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

News of the outside world comes as a rumor. Daily life is a melodrama, a musical, a rom-com, an epic.This is a story of two men in the early phase of romantic love. It begins with Evan Garland, 24, who lives in Los Angeles and works in finance and accounting for the media streaming service Hulu.On June 2, Mr. Garland stared at his smartphone screen, flipping through the dating app Tinder for what he supposed would be the last time. In roughly 400 dates, he had not come close to anything resembling true love.He hadn\u2019t been on a date in over a month, and none of his friends were in long-term relationships. After years of dating, Mr. Garland felt his heart had grown cold.\u201cIf one thing is wrong with someone on a date,\u201d he said, \u201cyour mind-set is, \u2018O.K., I can just swipe right and find someone new.\u2019\u201dHe was on the verge of deleting Tinder when he matched with a dance instructor, Diego Gasca, also 24. Mr. Garland and Mr. Gasca started texting each other and soon fell into a bantering dispute over who was better: Beyonc\u00e9 or Madonna.As more texts came rapid-fire, they realized they shared a love for horror movies, \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and \u201cWill & Grace.\u201dOn June 4, in the hours before their first in-person encounter, Mr. Garland realized he was nervous. By the time Mr. Gasca arrived at his apartment in West Hollywood, Calif., Mr. Garland was in free fall.Before they set out for the night, they talked. About important things. About trivial things. About everything. About nothing. Somehow the conversation lasted two hours.In the morning, they talked for another four hours. And when it was time for Mr. Gasca to go, neither wanted to part. Mr. Garland was still in the thrall of intense emotions when he was interviewed for this article at the end of August.\u201cWhenever I hear a love song, I get teary-eyed and sing along, because I\u2019m so happy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird, because I felt so coldhearted before. Now I want to talk to him all the time. I\u2019m constantly wanting to text him, to be with him anytime I can.\u201cI\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been with Diego,\u201d said Mr. Garland, whose only other serious relationship was as a first-year student at Georgia Tech. \u201cWhen you feel it, you feel it. I was the kind of person who used to overthink everything, especially with my college boyfriend. I was always asking myself, \u2018Do I really love him?\u2019 That\u2019s the difference. I\u2019m not overanalyzing this. I just felt a spark with him, and knew this was the guy. I know that I love him.\u201dBut what, exactly, is happening to a person like Mr. Garland, who finds himself in the throes of something that has inspired or stumped the bards, from Ovid to Frank Ocean? Let\u2019s go to the scientists.\u201cThere are a lot of clients who are obsessive and intellectualized, who are terrified of losing control in any area,\u201d Dr. Olds said. \u201cAnd so being in love makes them feel out of control.\u201dAndrew Simon, 28, a law student at Georgetown University, had no idea his life was about to go topsy-turvy when he sat down June 24 to a wedding rehearsal dinner in Portland, Ore.But then a friend grabbed his phone and started swiping through the dating app Bumble while saying half-jokingly that Mr. Simon needed to find someone who could be his date the following day.He matched with a woman named Shelby Neal, a 25-year-old marketing strategist for Twenty Four 7, a design firm in Portland. Mr. Simon and Ms. Neal didn\u2019t end up going to the wedding together, but the two texted each other furiously throughout the ceremony.\u201cHer language was so striking and vivid and powerful and real, but it also felt like language that I could engage with all day,\u201d said Mr. Simon, who was born and raised in Portland. \u201cAnd so I just couldn\u2019t get enough of talking with her.\u201dThey agreed to meet June 27, hours before Mr. Simon planned to meet a friend for dinner. And when they did meet, the conversation flowed as easily as the texts. They laughed a lot, although it was hard for Mr. Simon to recall what they were laughing about, exactly.When they said goodbye, Mr. Simon felt sad but also elated that \u201csomeone like this exists on this planet.\u201d Ms. Neal, for her part, didn\u2019t expect to hear from him again.A half-hour into his dinner commitment, Mr. Simon couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He told his friend he couldn\u2019t stay a minute longer. He said he had met someone, and she was incredible, and he absolutely had to see her again before he flew back home early the next morning.Mr. Simon called her to see if she wanted to go out for ice cream.\u201cI asked myself: \u2018Is this \u201cThe Notebook\u201d?\u2019\u201d Ms. Neal said. \u201cHe was interesting and thoughtful and compassionate and funny and smart. And it felt too good to be true.\u201dAfter he made it back to Washington, D.C., Mr. Simon and Ms. Neal talked or texted every day. One night Ms. Neal was out with friends when a group of young men approached. She should have been flattered or at least vaguely interested, she felt, but all she wanted to do was text with Mr. Simon.He called her one morning not long after that. An actual phone call. He said he had something to tell her.\u201cI was going to wait until we were in person, because I thought that was more meaningful,\u201d Mr. Simon said. \u201cBut every bone in my body was telling me I must share this with this person, and I couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\u201cIt was a feeling I had never felt before, this intense desire to tell someone that I love them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I told her, and she paused. And she said, \u2018I love you, too.\u2019 I think I was shaken by the whole ordeal.

{"Headline": "Decoding North Korea\u2019s Claim of a Successful Nuclear Test", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Korean Central News Agency, the official news service of North Korea, on Friday published a statement issued by the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons institute. Following is the complete text of the statement, with key passages highlighted, accompanied by context and analysis by the correspondents of The New York Times:The use of the phrase \u201cnuclear warhead\u201d rather than \u201cnuclear device\u201d is noteworthy, suggesting a specific, miniaturized design that can be mounted on a missile. D.P.R.K. refers to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the North\u2019s official name, and the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea is the ruling party, led by Kim Jong-un.The Central Committee of the W.P.K. sent warm congratulations to nuclear scientists and technicians of the northern nuclear test ground on the successful nuclear warhead explosion test.The Hwasong artillery units are believed to be involved in the development of intercontinental missiles, but Hwasong also refers to a class of medium-range North Korean missiles, their version of a Scud missile. The Hwasong units have been conducting a series of missile tests in recent months, raising regional fears that the North can already mount a nuclear weapon on a missile capable of striking its neighbors, South Korea and Japan.The North recently tested a missile that may be able to reach American bases in the Pacific and has been working on one that can reach the continental United States. But experts say it could take five years for the North to develop the technology needed, including a warhead capable of surviving the stress of re-entering the atmosphere.It was confirmed through the results of analysis of the test that the measured values including explosion might and the nuclear material usage coefficient conformed with the calculated values and that there was no radioactive materials leakage during the test and, therefore, no adverse impact on the ecological environment of the surroundings.The reference to standardization may be intended to suggest progress in the North\u2019s manufacturing process after five tests as well as the possibility that it is ready to produce warheads for deployment.By citing \u201cvarious fissile materials,\u201d the North may be signaling that it has a second source of nuclear material besides the plutonium from Yongbyon reactor \u2014 a program to produce highly enriched uranium that it disclosed to a visiting American nuclear physicist in 2010. North Korea is believed to have material for at least a dozen, and perhaps as many as 20, nuclear weapons, but it is unclear how many it has actually built. Experts say that number depends in large part on how much highly enriched uranium it has produced.In case you missed it the first time, the statement makes a second reference here to mounting nuclear warheads on missiles.The statement reminds the world that sanctions imposed against North Korea over the past decade have neither prevented it from financing and procuring materials needed to make advances in its nuclear program, nor caused enough pain for it to abandon the effort. The North has demanded that the United States recognize it as a nuclear power, but Washington has insisted that it agree to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula before talks resume.The D.P.R.K. will take further measures to bolster the state nuclear force in quality and quantity for safeguarding its dignity and right to existence and genuine peace from the U.S. increasing threat of a nuclear war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dodd-Frank Rollback Bill Clears a House Committee", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A House committee on Tuesday approved a bill to roll back significant portions of the financial-crisis-era overhaul known as the Dodd-Frank Act in a vote that was largely down party lines.The legislation, the Financial Choice Act, is not expected to be adopted this year. But it could influence the broader debate over financial reform and provide a starting point for its sponsor, Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, whose leadership role on the panel is set to end in two years.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to frame the debate going forward and lay some groundwork for next year,\u201d said Mark A. Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute, and a former Republican staff member in the Senate. \u201cThis is your last window before the election.\u201dThe Financial Choice Act split the banking panel with a vote of 30 to 26, with just one Republican, Representative Bruce Poliquin of Maine, siding with the committee\u2019s Democrats against it.Mr. Hensarling has been a prominent critic of Dodd-Frank and other changes after the 2008 financial crisis, including the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate the consumer finance industry.\u201cIt has been six years since the passage of Dodd-Frank. We were told it would lift our economy, but instead we are stuck in the slowest, weakest, most tepid recovery in the history of the Republic,\u201d said Mr. Hensarling at Tuesday\u2019s session. \u201cThe economy does not work for working people.\u201dThe bill would also repeal the Volcker Rule, which aimed to stop banks from making risky bets with their own money, and replace regulators\u2019 authority to wind down troubled banks with a new chapter of the bankruptcy code. In addition, it would remove the Durbin Amendment, which set a limit on certain fees retailers are charged for debit card transactions.Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who is the committee\u2019s ranking member, said at the vote that the plan was a nonstarter for any conversations about amending Dodd-Frank.\u201cThis bill is so bad that it simply cannot be fixed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this is a rushed, partisan messaging tool.\u201d\u201cThe chairman\u2019s bill strips, takes away, from the C.F.P.B. its authority to punish abusive conduct, which means Wells Fargo would have gotten off even easier for this scandalous conduct,\u201d said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York.Still, a handful of lawmakers signaled interest in finding opportunities to tweak Dodd-Frank, though they cautioned that the Republican bill being considered went too far.\u201cAre there mistakes in Dodd-Frank? Of course there are. We are human beings,\u201d said Representative Emanuel Cleaver, Democrat of Missouri. \u201cRather than correct the mistakes, we decided to just throw the baby out with the bath water.\u201dThe piecemeal approach may prove to be the model for other revisions to Dodd-Frank.\u201cFor any financial regulatory relief legislation to pass, it looks like it will have to be targeted toward a group in good standing with the Hill and incredibly narrow in its overall impact,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for Compass Point Research & Trading.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Did You Hear the Latest About Hillary?", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDid you also hear that Mrs. Clinton has Parkinson\u2019s disease? Her coughing fits prove it, as does her latest bout of illness. She has epilepsy, as well as advancing dementia. She has managed to hide all these illnesses through almost a year and a half of a grueling campaign because the man the world thinks is the head of her Secret Service detail is actually her hypnotist. He\u2019s also a medical doctor.No, I haven\u2019t lost my mind. I\u2019ve just lost many hours on social media, where these conspiracy theories run rampant.Well before Mrs. Clinton fell ill and had to be assisted into a van on Sunday, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, a supporter of Donald J. Trump, said on Fox News that the news media had failed to cover her health and that viewers should \u201cgo online and put down \u2018Hillary Clinton illness,\u2019 take a look at the videos for yourself.\u201dYes, the Clinton campaign should have disclosed her pneumonia diagnosis on Friday, curtailed her schedule and allowed her to recover. Lack of disclosure only increases the number of people who suspect she\u2019s hiding something.But there\u2019s also no amount of disclosure that would change the minds of people who think she\u2019s been hiding epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s and dementia, thanks to her secret hypnotist and persuasive body double.The problem is much bigger than a single moment, or this particular campaign. Conspiracy theories are like mosquitoes that thrive in swamps of low-trust societies, weak institutions, secretive elites and technology that allows theories unanchored from truth to spread rapidly. Swatting them one at a time is mostly futile: The real answer is draining the swamps.And now, with social media, what remained of controls on keeping the worst stuff out of the public sphere has been demolished.Wait, what part of the world was I writing about again?My coughing fit brought about by my own advanced dementia must have confused me again.Conspiracy theories have been around a long time, but thanks to new technologies and decline of trust in institutions, it\u2019s getting worse.We expect traditional news outlets to act as gatekeepers for information, helping us distinguish truth from rumor. They\u2019ve never been perfect at this job, but the precarious economics of the industry is making the situation even worse. The new, internet-driven financing model for news outlets is great for spreading conspiracy theories. Each story lives or dies by how much attention it attracts. This rewards the outrageous, which can get clicks more easily.However, conspiracy theories can live only to the degree they can find communities to flourish in. That\u2019s where social media comes in. Finding a community online has been great for many people \u2014 the dissident in Egypt, the gay teenager in a conservative town \u2014 but the internet is not Thor\u2019s hammer, which only the purest of heart can pick up. Connecting online also works for an anti-vaccination parent or a Sept. 11 truther. Conspiracists can organize online and can push their version of the world into the mainstream.To fight conspiracy theories, we also don\u2019t just need more fact-checkers. We need to fix the underlying dynamics.People think that their governments are working against them, or at least not for them, and in some cases this is true. Ruling elites around the world are circling their wagons, and fueling more suspicion and mistrust. Reversing that would be the best defense against baseless paranoia that masquerades as political action.The predominant internet business model isn\u2019t always great for democracy, but it\u2019s not the only option. We should support subscription, donation and philanthropy funded sources of information. Once \u201cgo viral or die\u201d isn\u2019t the only game in town, and with a more transparent and responsive government, our conspiracy fever might break.Zeynep Tufekci is an associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Information and Library Science and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Physicist in Albany Corruption Case Was a Geek With Big Goals", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for Alain E. Kaloyeros, a physicist who rose from a basement laboratory at the State University at Albany to oversee hundreds of millions of dollars in state economic development funds over a quarter-century, a more complex purpose seemed to be at work. Beyond money, the rewards he sought appeared to be power, prestige and, perhaps most of all, the fulfillment of a long-held dream: reinventing upstate New York as a Rust Belt Silicon Valley.With an early zeal for nanotechnology, a taste for head-turning cars, a sardonic tongue and a talent for luring major corporations with government financing, Dr. Kaloyeros, 60, is widely credited with transforming Albany from a drowsy government town into an unlikely center for high-tech research.\u201cIt was pretty much a miracle,\u201d said Lloyd Constantine, a top aide to Eliot Spitzer, the former governor. \u201cFrom my standpoint, from the administration\u2019s standpoint, he was doing a spectacular job. Revitalization of the upstate economy was Job No. 1. And he was doing it, and doing it really well.\u201dOften working with a lobbyist, Todd R. Howe, a former aide to Mr. Cuomo, Dr. Kaloyeros is accused of personally drafting and revising several requests for proposals to favor certain developers, including one for a SUNY Polytechnic dorm, another for a campus research building and two connected to huge economic development contracts in Syracuse and Buffalo.Untethered from the usual government safeguards, the university all but supplanted the state\u2019s economic development agency as the Cuomo administration\u2019s chief economic engine in upstate New York.The grants, rents and business he brought in to SUNY Polytechnic \u201call benefited him personally through his compensation package, and also added to his status as a kingmaker and an important person in state government,\u201d said the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who charged Dr. Kaloyeros with three felony counts of bid-rigging at a news conference. Additional federal charges were brought by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan.Michael C. Miller, a lawyer for Dr. Kaloyeros, said his client was innocent and \u201clooks forward to being exonerated.\u201dDr. Kaloyeros had bragged about his ability to \u201cwrite an RFP in such a way that only one company could win it,\u201d according to the state criminal complaint. Dr. Kaloyeros, referred to as \u201cDr. K\u201d in the federal complaint, did so, according to prosecutors, to preserve his status as one of the state\u2019s highest-paid employees, draw more research financing to SUNY Polytechnic and inflate his reputation as Albany\u2019s most successful rainmaker.\u201cThe job requires being a scientist, being a psychiatrist, being a priest, being a cop, being a negotiator, being a business developer or manager, being a teacher, being an adviser and being an ego-kisser,\u201d Mr. Kaloyeros told the Albany Business Review in 2011. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I do all of them very well.\u201dWheedling and wooing over sushi and Starbucks coffee, he made every college president, legislative leader and governor who supported him feel like a visionary, even as he outlasted, and out-earned, all of them. He consistently ranked among the state\u2019s highest paid employees, earning a total of $1.17 million in salary and other performance-based payments last year.\u201cHe worked the power, in a sense, and knew what buttons to push,\u201d said Ronald Canestrari, the former majority leader of the State Assembly. \u201cThe more he produced, the more he received. He was king of the hill.\u201dMr. Percoco, who had served as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315,000 in bribes. In addition, corruption charges were announced against another former aide, a senior state official and six other people.In 2012, after Mr. Cuomo announced that the state would spend $50 million to open a medical research hub in Buffalo, modeled on what Dr. Kaloyeros had done at SUNY Polytechnic, Dr. Kaloyeros christened the Albany-Buffalo pipeline \u201cthe Andrew Cuomo 21st century high-tech innovation canal.\u201dMr. Cuomo happily reciprocated: The state owed the scientist \u201ca tremendous amount of gratitude,\u201d the governor said last year.In the sometimes drab world of state government, awash in power suits and committee hearings, Mr. Kaloyeros \u2014 with his elegant but hard-to-identify accent, his taste for John Varvatos and his wardrobe full of jeans frayed just so \u2014 openly flaunted his unconventionality.Dr. Kaloyeros\u2019s Facebook page pulsed with off-color jokes about women (\u201cI bought a Ferrari for my girlfriend,\u201d read one image he posted. \u201cBest trade ever.\u201d) and lighthearted Darth Vader memes.Raised in East Beirut, Lebanon, Dr. Kaloyeros was a 19-year-old American University student when, he later told Albany acquaintances, he was attacked by members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the early stages of Lebanon\u2019s civil war. Later, he joined a small Christian militia before immigrating to the United States, where he earned a doctorate in physics from the University of Illinois.By the early 2000s, as a State University at Albany professor, Dr. Kaloyeros was persuading state leaders to commit millions of dollars of state funds to high-tech equipment and laboratories, which he used to entice corporations and jobs to the area.\u201cWe\u2019re out to put Stanford out of business,\u201d he told the Albany Times-Union in 2002.Two of his most important political relationships were with Sheldon Silver, the former State Assembly speaker, and Joseph Bruno, the former State Senate majority leader. To keep the state money flowing, he often played the governor and the two legislative leaders off one another.By the time Dr. Kaloyeros had amassed the clout to spin off the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at SUNY Albany into the independent campus known as SUNY Polytechnic, in 2013, the state\u2019s top politicians were all but squabbling over who should receive credit for his work.Whenever questions arose about the power and the money the state had concentrated in Dr. Kaloyeros, his bosses always concluded that he had earned it.\u201cHis salary was a bargain,\u201d Mr. Constantine said.Mr. Cuomo apparently made the same calculation.The professor\u2019s face spread into a corrugated smile.\u201cStay tuned,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Become a C.E.O.? The Quickest Path Is a Winding One", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrail of the ChiefHow does a person get to be the boss? What does it take for an ambitious young person starting a career to reach upper rungs of the corporate world \u2014 the C.E.O.\u2019s office, or other jobs that come with words like \u201cchief\u201d or \u201cvice president\u201d on the office door?The answer has always included hard work, brains, leadership ability and luck. But in the 21st century, another, less understood attribute seems to be particularly important.To get a job as a top executive, new evidence shows, it helps greatly to have experience in as many of a business\u2019s functional areas as possible. A person who burrows down for years in, say, the finance department stands less of a chance of reaching a top executive job than a corporate finance specialist who has also spent time in, say, marketing. Or engineering. Or both of those, plus others.However, there is still such a thing as too much variety: Switching industries has a negative correlation with corporate success, which may speak to the importance of building relationships and experience within an industry. Switching between companies within an industry neither helps nor hurts in making it to a top job.This interactive graphic shows how different traits affected a former consultant\u2019s likelihood of ending up as a top executive of a midsize or large company.While some of this might sound intuitive, and top executives have always needed to have grounding in a range of specialties, huge collections of data about individuals have only recently made it possible to analyze in such detail what traits and experiences seem to predict success in the job market.In effect, the increased ability to collect and analyze such troves of data raises the possibility that in the future we\u2019ll be able to better understand what types of education the workers of the future most need, how companies can best recruit future star performers and how individuals can position themselves to benefit from shifts in what skills the modern economy most rewards.There is a lot of work to be done to get to that point. But this early evidence suggests that success in the business world isn\u2019t just about brainpower or climbing a linear path to the top, but about accumulating diverse skills and showing an ability to learn about fields outside one\u2019s comfort zone.\u201cWork used to be much more hierarchical, and in many instances rote,\u201d said Gary Pinkus, McKinsey & Company\u2019s managing partner for North America. \u201cYou could build a nice career within any particular function by taking on more responsibility within that specialty. But if you look at most companies now, work has become incredibly cross-functional.\u201dOnce upon a time, Mr. Pinkus said, an operations manager might be laser-focused on making a factory work efficiently. Now to be great at that job \u2014 and earn a promotion to vice president or beyond \u2014 that manager had better also understand how the factory\u2019s inventory procedures tie in with the company\u2019s sales and marketing strategy, and any tax laws affecting inventory management, while assuring the reliability of the supply chain.The manager had better also be adept at using the technology that links all that information together.Marc Andreessen, the prominent venture capitalist, has gone so far as to call this the \u201csecret formula to becoming a C.E.O.\u201d The most successful corporate leaders, he wrote, \u201care almost never the best product visionaries, or the best salespeople, or the best marketing people, or the best finance people, or even the best managers, but they are top 25 percent in some set of those skills, and then all of a sudden they\u2019re qualified to actually run something important.\u201dGeorge Kurian was a young engineer at Oracle in the early 1990s, helping build database software. Then a manager pushed him to break out of his software engineering silo and see what it was like to deal with potential customers.That\u2019s when things got interesting.\u201cI had built a set of technologies I thought were groundbreaking,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cI went into this meeting expecting I was going to bring my engineering skills and wow this customer with our amazing technology. She asked, \u2018Who built this piece of software?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes, that was me.\u2019 \u201dHer next comment, though, wasn\u2019t what Mr. Kurian expected at all.\u201cShe said, \u2018You have no idea what my day looks like,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Kurian recalled.The software didn\u2019t solve the problems the customer actually had. The valuable lesson for the young engineer? Work that seems impressive on an engineering level isn\u2019t always what will most satisfy paying clients.As a product manager, Mr. Kurian added sales and marketing and team management to his engineering background. He later did a stint as a strategy consultant, which he recalls as a crash course in quickly synthesizing information about unfamiliar situations. He considers the combination of all of these areas a key to his path to becoming chief executive of NetApp, a data storage company with a $10 billion market value.He represents one common way to collect experience across functions: Within a larger company, pursue opportunities that are adjacent to, yet different from, existing expertise.\u201cPeople tend to think of their career as a linear progression,\u201d he said. \u201cI think having a nonlinear career progression helped me.\u201dThe LinkedIn data doesn\u2019t address causality. Did Mr. Kurian advance to a C.E.O. job because he gained experience across different functions, or did the traits that led him to take on a variety of assignments in his career also lead to his being an attractive candidate for top jobs? And the former consultants who created detailed LinkedIn profiles may be different in some systematic way from those who did not, which would distort the results.Beyond the results on job functions, the data from LinkedIn shows some trends for which the explanations aren\u2019t completely obvious. For example, former consultants who lived in New York or Los Angeles had higher odds of ending up with a top job than people in other large cities like Washington or Houston. A former management consultant with 15 years of work experience in six different functions and an M.B.A. from a top school had a 66 percent chance of becoming a top executive if he lived in New York compared with a 38 percent chance in Washington.But regardless of how exactly the cause and effect works and how the consultants analyzed might be different from others who weren\u2019t included in the sample, there is evidence that more top jobs in business require an ability to meld knowledge from different fields.Burning Glass found a 53 percent rise in the number of openings for hybrid jobs requiring both technological and business acumen from 2011 to 2015, for jobs like product management and marketing analytics.\u201cThe common theme that we see in the jobs that are the fastest-growing and have the highest value for employers and job seekers is this set of jobs that require a mix of skills that don\u2019t tend to ride together in nature,\u201d said Matthew Sigelman, the chief executive of Burning Glass.There are ways a young person can gain experience across functions that aren\u2019t a matter of taking on different assignments within a big company. Marla Malcolm Beck embodies this other, more entrepreneurial path.Ms. Beck worked in consulting right out of college in the mid-1990s, then studied at Harvard Business School and worked briefly in private equity. But she found the work unfulfilling, and in 1999 started Blue Mercury as an online seller of beauty products. Soon after, as the dot-com boom turned bust, the company pivoted toward physical stores.Ms. Beck built Blue Mercury into a 109-store chain. Macy\u2019s acquired the company for $210 million last year, and she remains its chief executive.In her days as a consultant she had worked on projects like figuring out the pricing of mutual funds and re-engineering the claims process for an insurance company. As a retail C.E.O., she essentially trained herself across the various functions it takes to make a retail business work: inventory and supply chain management, information technology systems and everything else.She acted as the company\u2019s chief financial officer even as it grew, entrusting routine accounting to a controller but doing the strategic work of forecasting and financial modeling herself. Some fields have come easier to her than others. \u201cI think I\u2019m almost too logical for some of the emotion around marketing,\u201d she said.Her approach has been to break down each of these new areas in which she had to immerse herself as a start-up founder the way she once did in unfamiliar fields as a consultant.\u201cWhat I really learned from those experiences was how to break down even the most complicated processes into their most minuscule components,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an approach that you can use to tackle any process in any organization.\u201dIn hiring at Blue Mercury\u2019s corporate headquarters in Washington, she has focused less on traditional retail industry experience and more on people who have a comfort with engineering processes, skills they can apply to whatever urgent task arises.In other words, she didn\u2019t become chief executive by getting loads of experience across functions. Rather, she took some core analytical skills and used them to learn to develop experience in those functions as she went.There are some parallels with programs that the biggest companies have long operated to deliberately rotate promising young executives across different divisions, to ensure that as they hit midcareer they have broad experience. The challenge can be to replicate that kind of experience even in a world where few people sign on with a single large employer for decades.To be a C.E.O. or other top executive, said Guy Berger, an economist at LinkedIn, \u201cyou need to understand how the different parts of a company work and how they interact with each other and understand how other people do their job, even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t know well enough to do yourself.\u201dKai Monahan embodies a third pathway through different specialties into top executive jobs. He didn\u2019t start his own company, like Ms. Beck, or gradually add different layers of experience that were adjacent to his previous job, like Mr. Kurian.Rather, at some key junctures he jumped headlong into an entirely new function. In 1999, he left the (now defunct) accounting and consulting firm Arthur Andersen, where he had worked on projects to transform businesses, for Ernst & Young, where he focused on risk management, a less sexy field that became more in demand after the accounting scandals at Enron and others starting in 2001. In 2008, he joined Nationwide Insurance as its chief audit executive, before quickly moving out of the back office and into selling financial products to consumers in an operational role. He became president of Nationwide\u2019s mortgage business in 2014.It helped that he had an early mentor who encouraged him to take risks in his career by taking on jobs he was unfamiliar with \u2014 and bosses willing to take a chance on assigning him jobs he wasn\u2019t qualified for on paper.After all, if you assign, say, an accounting specialist to run a logistics operation, there\u2019s a chance that person will fail. What\u2019s best for the employee who wants to get broad experience to help climb the ranks may not be what is best for the employer who wants deeply experienced people in every job.\u201cThere\u2019s comfort in familiarity,\u201d Mr. Monahan said. \u201cLeaders can be reluctant to hire someone who doesn\u2019t have directly applicable experience. That\u2019s still a mind-set that is fairly prevalent.\u201dBut how does one navigate into sharply different functional specialties while also dealing with new colleagues and a new organizational culture? \u201cIf you\u2019re in your comfort zone, it\u2019s very easy to stay in your comfort zone,\u201d said Paul McDonald, a senior executive director at the recruitment firm Robert Half International.\u201cWhat was critical for me in going into new functional areas was breaking that habit of feeling like you have to know it all,\u201d Mr. Monahan said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re honest with yourself and with others in terms of your need for their support and involvement, generally people are willing to share with you what they know and help you be successful.\u201dIn other words, the path to the executive suite may be long and winding, and include stops in many different types of specialties. But the key to navigating it is being able to learn from others all along the way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Woman Who Took Husband\u2019s Intestine on Flight Wanted It Tested, Lawyer Says", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 A Moroccan woman who took a piece of her dead husband\u2019s intestine on a flight to their home in Austria was carrying the sample because she suspected that he had been poisoned and she wanted European doctors to examine it, her lawyer said on Tuesday.The woman, 35, who has not been publicly identified, packed the four-inch piece in her checked baggage on a flight to the southern Austrian city of Graz, where she and her husband, 40, had been living for eight years, said the lawyer, Anton Karner.Mr. Karner said his client had been acting on the advice of a doctor in Marrakesh who shared her suspicion that her husband had been poisoned at a meal the couple ate while visiting his relatives.The Moroccan doctor extracted the piece of intestine, Mr. Karner said, and apparently helped pack it in formaldehyde and in thick plastic containers.Gerald H\u00f6fler, who leads the pathology institute in Graz where the intestine is being examined, described the packaging as very professional.\u201cI would imagine that it was done by a pathologist,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was absolutely secure, triple wrapped, according to European Union norms.\u201dDr. H\u00f6fler said the results of the examination would probably not be known until next week.The unusual cargo was found by customs officials on Sept. 8 after they searched the woman\u2019s bag as part of standard random checks when she landed in Graz, said Johannes Pasquali, a spokesman for the Austrian Finance Ministry, which oversees the country\u2019s customs operations.The story was first reported over the weekend by Kleine Zeitung, the main local newspaper in Graz.Leo Josefus, a spokesman for the police in the state of Styria, of which Graz is the capital, said customs officials had first turned to the police for guidance.Officers determined that the woman had violated no Austrian laws by bringing the sample into the country, and the intestine was then sent to Dr. H\u00f6fler\u2019s clinic.Mr. Karner, who declined to name his client, said she suspected poisoning after the family meal because some members of her husband\u2019s family had opposed their marriage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This North Dakota Bike Trail Is Stunning. Just Hope You Survive It.", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "The Maah Daah Hey Trail is the longest and arguably most grueling single-track mountain biking route in the United States.Supported byIt had been decades since I\u2019d flown over a pair of handlebars.One moment I was bouncing along, knee-deep in sagebrush, mind reeling from all the natural beauty zipping by, and the next I\u2019d caught a wheel on a rock and gone sailing into that familiar somersault: butt rising from the saddle, shoulders twisting violently, hips lurching up-and-over, heels actually clicking midair, sunglasses and water bottle and half-eaten Clif Bar hurtling into the trees, the ground closing in.Because I was aimed steeply downhill, partway into a soft-clay gully, I landed more or less on my feet, like a gymnast, before flopping onto my stomach with an \u201cUgh!\u201d and briefly bodysurfing. Miraculously unscathed, I dusted myself off and glanced around. Out here, alone in the wilderness, at least nobody was watching.Looking back, it seems strange that I kept going. I was just one-sixteenth of the way into a 96-mile-long bike-packing trip with an old friend, Dacus, whom I had abandoned an hour earlier with a broken chain. It wasn\u2019t even my first wipeout. My shins were already pulped after crashing through a wall of thistle. Most alarmingly, I had scant cellphone reception.From the very start, it was all up, up, up. With an elevation gain of 8,600 sidewinding feet, it began to feel Dantean. Everywhere were wonderful reminders of our mortality: sheer 300-foot drops into saw-toothed river bottoms; eroding hillside ledges that slid away in our wake; Yugo-size cows with a knack for materializing around blind turns; and at road crossings, careening oil trucks. Had I been in a morbid frame of mind, I might have chucked it all at Mile 3, when Dacus\u2019s chain broke.The plan at that point was to reconnect farther along, after Dacus had hiked back to the trailhead, called Dakota Cyclery for help, and had them drop him off around Mile 10. I rolled on, feeling abruptly, utterly alone. We\u2019d seen no one else all morning, and our first campsite was still 22 miles away.My prevailing concern, however, was staying on my bike. Before my acrobatic dismount, I\u2019d narrowly missed being brained by a lolling branch. Later, I had screeched to a halt at the lip of a sharp declivity and, unable to find a foothold, simply timberrrrrrrrred into the sagebrush.But it was a warm day, in the low 80s, with a delicious tailwind. Wildflowers crowded my wheels: blue flax and sego lily, golden pea and spiderwort. Prairie grasses of muted yellows and olives bristled under a heartbreakingly blue sky. I startled a pronghorn, a relative of the antelope, which took off, kicking up sparks of dirt; I trailed it across several hundred yards of upland meadow, until it was a bead in the distance.Straddling a $2,000 state-of-the-art, carbon-fiber mountain bike, and with three liters of cold water in my insulated hydration pack, it was humbling to think of Sitting Bull, a fugitive in his own home, short on water and horses, trying to lead his people to safety over this broken ground.Onward I slogged, from tabletop plain to forests of pinyon and juniper to gravel culvert and back again. Where the trail crossed County Road 50, the outfitter\u2019s van appeared with Dacus grinning in a window. A doctored chain, a high-five, and we were off again.And then, within minutes, we were lost. While mostly well marked, with signposts placed every 500 feet or so, the Maah Daah Hey can devolve into a latticework of tracks \u2014 some of them cow paths, some blazed by backcountry regulars \u2014 forking this way and that, and ebbing into ever-unpromising voids. I yanked-out the map and scanned its stupefying squiggles for a clue. Which way was north again? And then there it was, in the dirt at my feet: Some benevolent soul had scrawled an arrow with a fingertip, pointing the way ahead.We soon crossed Beicegel Creek, where 65-million-year-old petrified cedar stumps stood in the shallows, a reminder that western North Dakota had once been subtropical wetlands, like today\u2019s Everglades. I gazed down at fossilized abalone and nautilus shells.Toward dusk, we found ourselves flying through an immense pasture, scattering herds of black cows and calves, the light running out behind us. It felt like a reward for a very patchy first day, perched in our pedals and roaring across the beautiful emptiness, tilted slightly downhill with the wind in our faces. After 25 hard miles, our campsite was just minutes away. Now I got this whole mountain biking deal. We were ripping! Until Dacus went airborne.He lacked the luck I\u2019d had earlier and bounced off his head before crashing onto his tailbone. Somehow he walked away, but with the air of a sky diver whose chute had only partly opened. We inspected his helmet. It had a crack down the middle.\u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cYou O.K.?\u201d\u201cI think so,\u201d he said, woozily.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIt was so beautiful, I decided to look around for a second.\u201d\u201cBig mistake.\u201dWe camped that night next to coffee-colored creek called Magpie, in a copse of ash and cottonwood. It was shady down in there, so cool and quiet. I crawled on all fours into my tent and sat plucking ticks from my legs. I was spent, my body a factory of pain. But as I stared into the woods, into the fields beyond, I felt wide-awake.Before arriving in North Dakota, I had spoken to Gerard Baker, a Mandan-Hidatsa and former superintendent of the Mount Rushmore National Monument. It was Mr. Baker who had named the trail \u2014 at the Forest Service\u2019s request \u2014 partly inspired by stories his late father, Paige Baker Sr., had told him about the longstanding Mandan-Hidatsa presence there.\u201cI wanted to name it \u2018maah daah hey\u2019 because grandfathers are always supposed to be around,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cFrom a clanship standpoint, we Indians have a lot of grandfathers, and whether you\u2019re having hard times or good times, they\u2019re supposed to be there for you. That\u2019s what the trail means. You can go out there by yourself and cry and nobody will hear you except the spirits, and they\u2019ll help you.\u201dMr. Baker had little interest in mountain biking, and saw the trail more as a symbol of his secular and spiritual bond with the Badlands. \u201cThis is an area that the Mandan-Hidatsa associate with our spirits and our history,\u201d he said, adding that the trail\u2019s northern end is a short drive from the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara reservation at Fort Berthold. \u201cThe Badlands were closed off to us for so long. Now they\u2019re open to us again. We have a lot of spirits that still live out there, and we feel an ownership to the land. Deep in our hearts, it\u2019s still ours, man.\u201dAt Mr. Baker\u2019s suggestion, I had placed a clump of tobacco on the trail as Dacus and I had set out, praying to the four directions \u2014 North, South, East, West \u2014 for our safe delivery. Whether or not it was working seemed to be an open question.Each morning we wondered what the day would bring. The wind was constantly at our backs, like a gentle hand pushing us. Rain that had churned the ground into impassable sludge days earlier was nowhere to be seen. Pronghorn sprung from crowns of gamagrass and foxtail barley. Western meadowlarks and bobolinks shot over the fields. At a place called Devils Pass, we gingerly negotiated a gangplank of shattered stone as the trail narrowed over a shadowy gorge.But then the Maah Daah Hey mellowed into flatlands, veering southwesterly and roughly paralleling the Little Missouri River. We crossed the shallows carrying our bikes on our shoulders, wading the reddened, sluggish water up to our thighs. Dacus, hankering for a swim, plopped down in the middle and flapped his legs, kiddie-pool style.We cruised into a maze of huge cottonwoods, a rare length of shade where the grass grew up past our saddles. This was the best part of the trail. The air was stunningly crisp, birdsong flaring and fading. The going was easy. I found a deer antler, a tiny forked thing that I stuffed into my pack, and a little farther on, a red-tailed hawk feather, fluted gray-black, rustling across the grass.We headed up again, a dizzying climb in equatorial heat, past the tree line, then stopped for lunch on an alcove with amphitheater views. Miles and miles of rough country rolled to the horizon, a leafy sandstone valley sprouting interior courtyards and alleyways, the swollen sun overhead. Scattered incongruously on distant bluffs were several pumpjack oil drilling rigs, most of them inactive, poised over the earth like herons.By 3 p.m., we had put 22 miles behind us. Whooping and shouting, we rode a rushing swell of grass, birds in orbit all around, then dropped into a fang-shaped draw, snaking through shoals of heaped-up boulders. One boulder turned out to be a dead cow, its face and hindquarters eaten away. It was hard not to think of it as an omen.Our camp was a wide basin a mile or two from Elkhorn Ranch, where a young Theodore Roosevelt lived from 1884 to 1887. Roosevelt loved the Badlands. He came to rely on their restorative qualities after wearying stints back East. As an avid hunter, partly what he loved was the chance to shoot the fast-disappearing bison, elk and bighorn sheep. Evenings, he\u2019d sit on his veranda with a rifle close at hand. But the Badlands eventually changed Roosevelt, giving shape to a conservationist credo. Sickened by the ravages of hide hunters, he protected 230 million acres of public land during his presidency, including a stunning parcel of North Dakota Badlands.My notes from Day 3 are mostly unprintable here. Twenty-plus miles of blistering, infuriating, jackknifed rock. We pushed and pulled and lugged our oppressive, gear-laden bikes over nearly every inch of ground, cursing and sputtering.We couldn\u2019t get enough water. I have an image of Dacus slumped on the trail, febrile and panting, handkerchief covering his face, madly gulping from his water bottle while turkey vultures circled overhead. We decided to ration the four liters apiece we carried, just in case. When we reached a spot with some shade, Dacus lay down for a nap and I scrambled to the top of a butte, half-joking that I\u2019d check my cell reception to see if I could call for a medevac. As I sat there, a mule deer clomped into the clearing below me twitching its big khaki ears. Far off, wavering on the thermals, two golden eagles swung into view.With twilight approaching, we found ourselves in a petrified forest, swerving wildly to avoid the blackened stumps. Camp had to be close by, we reasoned. But our map showed we were still an hour out. We weren\u2019t quite in tears, but we were close.Sooner or later, the Maah Daah Hey Trail, we had to admit, turns grown men into simpering mama\u2019s boys. It\u2019s a place for stern, bushwhacking cyclists and not for city kids after a fleeting nature fix. Dacus put our problem succinctly: \u201cI think what we\u2019re finding is our skill levels just aren\u2019t very high.\u201dIt was almost dark when we arrived in camp, plumb out of water and near the brink of physical and emotional collapse. By good fortune, four experienced mountain bikers were riding the trail that week, and they greeted us with restorative beers and a stir-fry dinner.It was a no-brainer, deciding to wimp out on the last day. A shortcut via a graded service road, we realized, would put us back in Medora by lunchtime, nearly halving the trail\u2019s last 28 miles. With a cloud of dust in our wake, we were in town by noon, sharing a large Hawaiian pizza and guzzling pints of beer. As we sat toasting our accomplishment, I felt a twinge of pride. It hadn\u2019t been pretty, and I was glad it was over, but we\u2019d ridden the Maah Daah Hey Trail, or a good chunk of it anyway, and lived.\u201cThanks for inviting me along,\u201d Dacus said. \u201cIt was amazing. One of the most incredible trips of my life. And I\u2019ll never do it again.\u201dBut I thought happily of our last night in camp, of those gifted cans of Canadian beer, and of some Maah Daah Hey advice that Gerard Baker had given me: \u201cDon\u2019t just look, but listen. Stand out there in the middle of the night and listen. Listen to the trees and to the grass, because you\u2019ll hear a lot in those Badlands.\u201dAnd I did. I stood in the darkness sipping beer and missing my wife, listening to the chirr of summer insects while the stars brightened, trying to tune my ears to the unknown.John O\u2019Connor is a writer based in Cambridge, Mass.Advertisement"}

Mrs. Clinton defended herself by saying, \u201cNone of the emails sent or received by me had such a header\u201d marking them as classified.In saying this, Mrs. Clinton offered a variation on the explanation she has repeatedly given about whether classified information passed through her private email server. Rather than saying she never \u201csent or received\u201d classified information, Mrs. Clinton was making a distinction about how they were marked classified, with a small notation of a \u201cC\u201d on them, or with a larger, more visible header marking them as such.The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, declared in a July 5 news conference that a \u201cvery small number\u201d of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s correspondence bore the markings indicating classified information, contradicting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s earlier claim. But Mr. Comey said in his testimony to the House Oversight Committee that those emails were not properly labeled with the header Mrs. Clinton made reference to on Wednesday.AMY CHOZICK_____Mr. Trump claimed during the forum that he had forced the resignation of the Mexican finance minister.\u201cIf you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today, the people who arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how well we did, and that\u2019s how well we\u2019re going to do have to do.\u201dThe resignation of the minister, Luis Videgaray, on Wednesday did seem related to widespread criticism of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto after Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico City last week. Mr. Videgaray, a longtime ally of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, had been a strong proponent of extending an invitation to Mr. Trump, according to Mexican news reports. Although the president did not give a reason for Mr. Videgaray\u2019s departure, analysts speculated that he wanted to deflect the barrage of scorn that has been directed at him since Mr. Trump left Mexico.But the Trump visit might not be the only reason for Mr. Videgaray\u2019s exit from the cabinet. The Mexican economy has slowed and the peso has weakened on his watch. He also came under scrutiny after it was reported that he had bought a home at a golf resort from a government contractor.JOHN HARNEY_____Defending his past praise of Russia\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump at one point asserted that President Vladimir V. Putin had the support of 82 percent of Russians.Mr. Trump appears to be basing that on a July poll by the Levada Center in Russia. Another poll taken by Levada in March put his approval rating at 73 percent, a 10 percentage point drop from a year before. During the annexation of Crimea, his approval ratings hit a high of 89 percent.GERRY MULLANYAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "SpaceX Rocket Explodes at Launchpad in Cape Canaveral", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA spectacular explosion of a SpaceX rocket on Thursday destroyed a $200 million communications satellite that would have extended Facebook\u2019s reach across Africa, dealing a serious setback to Elon Musk, the billionaire who runs the rocket company.The blast is likely to disrupt NASA\u2019s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station, exposing the risks of the agency\u2019s growing reliance on private companies like SpaceX to carry materials and, soon, astronauts.The explosion, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., intensified questions about whether Mr. Musk is moving too quickly in his headlong investment in some of the biggest and most complex industries, not just space travel but carmakers and electric utilities.\u201cSpaceX is running a punishing schedule,\u201d said Scott Pace, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a former NASA official.\u201cThere is probably some human factor involved here. To what extent was human error part of this? And if so, why? Are you running your people too hard? What are your safety requirements?\u201dDr. Pace said an internal investigation would have to look at the company\u2019s operations as it tried to ramp up the pace of launches.The company\u2019s president, Gwynne Shotwell, said in a statement, \u201cOur No. 1 priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, and we will carefully investigate and address this issue.\u201cThe Falcon 9 rocket burst into flames in a violent series of blasts starting at 9:07 a.m., spewing plumes of dark smoke around the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and sending vibrations felt by residents nearby.The rocket had been set to launch on Saturday, carrying a satellite for Spacecom, an Israeli company.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.The explosion was particularly painful news for Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is touring Kenya, promoting a program reliant on the satellite, known as Amos-6, with entrepreneurs in the country. He had promised them connectivity.The Falcon 9, developed by SpaceX with NASA financing, has had previous problems. In June 2015, a rocket carrying NASA cargo to the International Space Station fell apart in-flight when a strut holding a helium bottle snapped, setting off a chain of events that destroyed the rocket moments later. This latest episode is likely to push back the timetable NASA had after hiring SpaceX and Boeing to carry astronauts to the space station by the end of next year.NASA said it was too soon to say how the explosion would affect its space station operations, asserting that it remained \u201cconfident\u201d in its commercial partners. \u201cToday\u2019s incident \u2014 while it was not a NASA launch \u2014 is a reminder that spaceflight is an incredible challenge, but our partners learn from each success and setback,\u201d the agency said.SpaceX\u2019s next cargo mission to the space station is scheduled for November.Coincidentally on Thursday, a report released by NASA\u2019s inspector general, Paul K. Martin, said SpaceX and Boeing were likely to face additional delays in their launch schedules anyway.Launches with crews will probably not lift off before the second half of 2018, three years later than planned, the inspector general said.Changes that SpaceX is making to the design of the capsule, to allow landing in water instead of on land, are causing the latest delays, Mr. Martin said. In addition, NASA has been slow in examining safety reviews submitted by the companies, and as a result, late and costly redesigns might be needed, Mr. Martin said.Space industry experts say that Mr. Musk faces risks in balancing SpaceX\u2019s backlog of contracts \u2014 spanning the next few years \u2014 without cutting corners to stay on the company\u2019s busy schedule.SpaceX had hoped for 18 rocket launches this year; so far, eight have occurred. Over all, SpaceX has had 27 successful launches of Falcon 9 rockets.An episode like Thursday\u2019s is rare. Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., who tracks rocket history, said the last time such an explosion happened on a Cape Canaveral launchpad, before the ignition of engines for liftoff, was in 1959.SpaceX is rebuilding a separate launchpad, one of the two formerly used for NASA\u2019s space shuttle missions, for the astronaut launches. That launchpad is scheduled to be ready by the end of the year.Business analysts were mixed on the effects of the explosion on Mr. Musk\u2019s other investments at a time when he is under considerable financial pressure with the planned merger of Tesla and SolarCity.Mr. Musk draws vocal admirers and detractors, some of whom are \u201cshort\u201d investors betting that Tesla cannot execute on its business plan.Trip Chowdry, a senior analyst at Global Equities Research who studies Tesla\u2019s performance, described Mr. Musk\u2019s situation as a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d\u201cWhen things work out well, people believe Musk to be a superstar,\u201d Mr. Chowdry said. But when things go wrong like an explosion at a separate company, Tesla investors tend to make more general inferences, too.\u201cWhen all is said and done, does it have any impact on Tesla stock? No,\u201d he said. \u201cBut events at SpaceX do create headline risk for Tesla stockholders.\u201dThe demise of the satellite, called Amos-6, puts a significant damper on Facebook\u2019s Internet.org initiative, a grand plan spearheaded by Mr. Zuckerberg to provide wireless connectivity to nations across the world that do not otherwise have easy internet access.On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg struck an upbeat tone in his post about the rocket failure, noting that the company has other strategies in the works to expand internet connectivity across the world. Aquila, the Facebook-built drone, he noted, recently undertook its first successful flight in the desert.Still, the setback will delay Facebook\u2019s ambitious plans and even more ambitious timetable.Advertisement"}

According to the council, both had taken MDMA, a drug better known as Ecstasy. In 2014, the police had also asked the council to review Fabric\u2019s license after the deaths of four others in the previous three years were attributed to drugs.A sad day for London nightlife.It was also seen as a death knell for nightclubs in London, where venues are already being pushed out by creeping gentrification, the lack of business from some millennials short on cash, and austerity-conscious local governments that are more favorable to luxury apartment buildings and shopping malls than to loud, raucous music clubs.In August 2015, the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, a group that represents owners of pubs, bars and restaurants, published figures showing that half of Britain\u2019s nightclubs had shut down since 2005, including dozens in London.The closing of the club reverberated among revelers around the world; a stop at Fabric was a must-do on any clubber\u2019s trip to London. Several regulars, who said they viewed Fabric as a second home, gathered on the steps of the club this week, some overcome by tears.\u201cFabric is a place where people from all socio-economic backgrounds, colors, and sexual orientations, tourists and people from finance come together next to edgy club kids in sneakers and mohawks,\u201d she said. \u201cElectronic music is the music of our generation, and I am devastated. Just as clubs in New York have been pushed out of the center and replaced by shopping venues and luxury apartments during the last decade, now this is happening here.\u201dFabric\u2019s closing also feeds into the debate about the criminalization of recreational drug use. There were questions about whether the authorities were making an unfair example of Fabric, with the club\u2019s supporters contending that those determined to obtain drugs would find a way of using them at the club, with or without tough security checks.In its decision to close Fabric, the Islington council said the two teenagers had been able to sneak into the club without the drugs being detected, and had also bought drugs inside the club. It criticized Fabric for having what it called \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d security.The council said that undercover police operations at the club had revealed patrons displaying symptoms such as \u201csweating, glazed red eyes and staring into space, and people asking for help.\u201dFabric said in a statement that it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the decision. \u201cClosing Fabric is not the answer to the drug-related problems clubs like ours are working to prevent, and sets a troubling precedent for the future of London\u2019s nighttime economy,\u201d it said.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has been pushing to make London more of a 24-hour city by opening the subway for all-night service on weekends, said he was \u201cdisappointed.\u201dBefore the club was closed down, Mr. Khan had told the council that Fabric was important to a nighttime economy in London that contributed 26.3 billion pounds, or about $35 billion, to the city\u2019s coffers every year.\u201cClubbing needs to be safe, but I\u2019m disappointed that Fabric, Islington Council and the Metropolitan Police were unable to reach agreement on how to address concerns about public safety,\u201d he said in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge totem on the London night-life scene, the premiere destination for the world\u2019s biggest D.J.s, and I think the closure is going to have a totally massive impact on the music scene, on dance music culture and on the night-life economy,\u201d he said.\u201cI think it\u2019s got more to do with gentrification, noise complaints and path-of-least-resistance policing than it does with public safety. It\u2019s all a bit post-Brexit apocalyptic,\u201d he added, referring to Britain\u2019s vote this summer to leave the European Union. Some critics say leaving the bloc will make the country, and its culture, more inward-looking.For many, Fabric was more than just a music venue. Jacob Husley, 35, a promoter and D.J., said in May that his favorite experience there came when a Polish couple in their 70s turned up, downed a shot of tequila each, high-fived the D.J. and danced until 5 a.m.\u201cI took them upstairs to the balcony and brought them some tea \u2014 because they wanted to have tea,\u201d he told The Evening Standard. \u201cThey were really sweet, they were on the balcony with their hands together ballroom dancing.\u201dChristopher D.

Stanton, a refugee from Nazi Germany who made a fortune in petrochemicals and then gave or pledged more than $300 million to various charities, most of them in New York, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.Fred Lowenfels, the general counsel emeritus of Mr. Stanton\u2019s company, Trammo Inc., confirmed the death.Mr. Stanton founded Trammo as Transammonia Inc. in 1965. By 2009 it was one of the largest privately owned companies in New York. Trammo markets, trades, distributes and transports ammonia, fertilizers, liquefied petroleum gases, petrochemicals, coal, sulfuric acid and sulfur.\u201cI structured Transammonia so that individual traders create their own businesses, using their own talent and creativity and personal business philosophies,\u201d Mr. Stanton wrote in an autobiography in 2010.He used his wealth to support charities and organizations he cared about. When his $100 million gift to Yeshiva University was announced in 2006, it was described as the largest single gift ever given in support of Jewish education in the United States.For much of his life Mr. Stanton insisted on donating anonymously. But when he gave $25 million to Lincoln Center in 2008, a friend suggested that he take the naming rights of a new pedestrian plaza there to acknowledge his family\u2019s ties to the city and to establish a legacy of charitable giving for his children to follow.He heeded the advice. The plaza at Lincoln Center between 62nd and 65th Streets is now Ronald P. Stanton Way. Other locales also bear his name.\u201cHe believed that when you made good money, it was your obligation to give it away,\u201d Mr. Lowenfels said.Mr. Stanton was born Ronald Philip Steinberg on March 26, 1928, in Wiesbaden, Germany. His mother, the former Hedwig Kern, divorced his father, Eric Steinberg, shortly after giving birth. She and Ronald then moved to live with her parents, Leo and Beatrice Kern, in Mainz.When Hitler rose to power in 1933, Mr. Stanton\u2019s mother began smuggling cash to Switzerland. She used it to escape with her son to New York in 1937. A year later, Mrs. Steinberg\u2019s mother followed. (By then her father had died.)Mr. Stanton\u2019s paternal grandparents, Moritz and Friedel Steinberg, remained in Wiesbaden, where they were part of a group of Jews who committed mass suicide to avoid deportation to concentration camps.In New York, Mr. Stanton attended public schools and changed his last name from Steinberg after high school. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from City College of New York in 1950. After serving in the United States Army, he joined the International Ore and Fertilizer Corporation and began rising through the ranks, becoming executive vice president of its fertilizer trading division. He left that position to incorporate Transammonia.Mr. Stanton served on numerous boards, including those of Yeshiva University, Lincoln Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.He is survived by a son, Oliver, from his first marriage, to the former Ruth Schloss; a daughter, Hedi Stanton, and a son, Philip, from his second marriage, to Mei Wu; and three grandchildren. Both marriages ended in divorce.An art collector, Mr. Stanton owned works by Renoir, Matisse and Picasso, among others. And as a fan of Baroque opera he once financed a production of Jean-Baptiste Lully\u2019s \u201cAtys,\u201d which was staged in Brooklyn, Paris and Versailles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is New York Ready for Solar Power?", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySolar power in New York City may finally be having its moment.The upfront cost for installing solar panels on a single-family house runs between $20,000 and $50,000, but federal, state and city incentives and tax credits can cut that cost in half, said David Sandbank, the director of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority\u2019s NY-Sun initiative, and homeowners say that once solar panels are up and running, monthly energy bills can fall by as much as 85 percent.Most of the city\u2019s existing solar projects are on single-family houses on Staten Island, but townhouse owners in Brooklyn are getting on board, and owners of apartment buildings in the Bronx and Queens are also starting to consider ways to harness the sun\u2019s power.\u201cSolar was a niche market in New York in 2009,\u201d Mr. Sandbank said. \u201cNow you have major commitments from government officials that have made solar more affordable.\u201dAnn Schaetzel, 70, a filmmaker, and Richard Barber, 63, a TV producer and editor, recently converted their two-family home in Gowanus, Brooklyn, to solar power, after being inspired by a neighbor who installed solar photovoltaic panels on his roof a few years ago. \u201cI never thought I could afford it,\u201d Ms. Schaetzel said.Ms. Schaetzel purchased a 4.25 kilowatt solar system, which was up and running in March, with 14 solar panels perched on her rooftop. The average system for a home in New York City is about 6.5 kilowatts. The installers determined the optimal size for Ms. Schaetzel\u2019s home based on her monthly bills.Ms. Schaetzel\u2019s electricity bill in August was $36.10 for a service connection charge to Con Edison, a fraction of the $250.19 bill she paid in August 2015. The connection to Con Edison is required since owners must use the utility\u2019s grid to push back any excess power their solar system produces, and also to have access to electricity if, say, there\u2019s a run of bad weather.Solar panels occasionally short circuit and need replacing. Most solar panels come with a 25-year manufacturer\u2019s warranty but generally require little maintenance. Ms. Schaetzel said her 14-panel system cost $27,225, which was cut to $6,925 after incentives, credits and rebates.It took Ms. Schaetzel about two years from her first meeting to get her solar system connected, but policy changes have trimmed that time frame to about a year, said Christopher Neidl, the director of the Here Comes Solar program at Solar One.Tria Case, the director of sustainability at the City University of New York, said that coordination between government entities, utilities and installers has been \u201cstreamlined so it would be easier for folks to enter the solar process.\u201dMrs. Tornquist said that Samara Levine, the firm\u2019s managing director, helped demystify what can be a complicated topic. Ms. Levine explained the billing system, known as net metering, through which homeowners can be credited for any excess energy they feed back to the electric grid.Mrs. Tornquist said it was important to understand her new meter, which counts backward if more energy is produced by the solar panels than is used in the house.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that our meter runs backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if I see the meter start to run forward, I start turning off our lights.\u201dThe 40 panels on the roof cost the couple about $53,000, and they paid about $5,000 upfront. They received $11,200 back, thanks to federal, state and city incentives and tax credits. The couple decided to take out two loans to pay off the rest of the bill. One loan is from the state energy authority and is paid at the same time as their monthly Con Ed bill, totaling less than $200 per month.Mrs. Tornquist said the electricity bill averaged about $320 per month before they went solar. After the system was installed in May 2015, the bills dropped to $18 a month during the summer and about $50 a month during the winter.Solar power first took off in Staten Island, Long Island and Westchester County, largely because many residents own houses with large pitched roofs that face south, optimal conditions for generating the most kilowatts. It hasn\u2019t been as easy for homeowners in more built-up areas. Shade from neighboring buildings is the most limiting factor, and many solar installers are not interested in setting up systems on small flat roofs, according to Mr. Neidl.\u201cThe large national installers would see a small roof on Google Maps and they would say: small system, big hassle, no thank you,\u201d he said.The New York City Fire Department requires a clear path of six feet from the perimeter of the roof, as well as from all doors, skylights and hatches, so firefighters have enough room for themselves and their equipment. That limits the amount of usable space on a typical townhouse with a 20-by-45-foot roof.\u201cThe city\u2019s stringent fire codes are the reason the solar market hasn\u2019t gotten bigger here,\u201d Mr. Mandler said. That said, installers have come up with some innovative solutions.Mr. McKee said fire codes limit the typical rowhouse to about 16 roof panels, but a canopy system can more than double the number of panels by elevating the panels over the roof, thus using most of the building\u2019s footprint. He said he now installs about eight canopy systems a month and expects to double his business over the next year.Owners of apartment buildings are also eyeing the sun. Jac Zadrima, a principal of Genesis Realty Group in the Bronx, placed solar systems on 21 of the 40 rental buildings the company owns. He estimates that he saves about $6,000 to $10,000 per building a year, and said that savings helps maintain other building operations.\u201cWhen you\u2019re maintaining an older housing stock, a maintenance issue is never minor,\u201d he said, \u201cso it\u2019s nice to have that extra money to offset a good portion of your common-area costs.\u201dSimilarly, after spending $1.7 million to install solar systems on nine rental buildings in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, Daniel Benedict, the founder of Benedict Realty Group, estimated that the investment will have paid for itself in about five years.\u201cSolar is great for long-term owners,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m saving 70 percent on my annual electricity bill.\u201dThe 552 panels across the four buildings that make up the firm\u2019s Alpine Apartments in Jackson Heights, Queens, generate about 157,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. Between January and August, the Con Ed bill for the buildings\u2019 common areas totaled $5,334, significantly less than the $18,850 he paid during the same period last year before he went solar.The organization has urged several Housing Development Fund Corporation co-ops in the neighborhood to go solar, but convincing people to spend money for future savings is difficult. \u201cMany of these buildings don\u2019t have much in reserves, so boards are hesitant to take out loans,\u201d he said.Mr. Southworth understands the struggle: When he was president of his co-op board, it took him over a year to obtain shareholder approval, install a solar system and switch meters at his own building in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.\u201cIt was a lot of collaboration, which included many informal chats in the hallways,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s an identity. We are known as that Sunset Park solar co-op.\u201dA cover article last Sunday about solar energy in New York City misidentified the program through which Ann Schaetzel and four other homeowners formed a solar purchasing group. It is Here Comes Solar, organized by Solar One, a nonprofit \u2014 not the city\u2019s Solarize NYC, organized by Brooklyn Community Board 6 and Solar One. The article also misstated the electricity generated by the 552 solar panels at the Alpine Apartments in Jackson Heights, Queens. It is about 157,000 kilo-watt-hours per year, not 157,000 kilowatts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Russian Fascist Is Meddling in America\u2019s Election", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW HAVEN \u2014 The president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, once described the collapse of the Soviet Union as a \u201cgeopolitical catastrophe.\u201d But the political thinker who today has the most influence on Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia is not Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Communist system, but rather Ivan Ilyin, a prophet of Russian fascism.The brilliant political philosopher has been dead for more than 60 years, but his ideas have found new life in post-Soviet Russia. After 1991, his books were republished with long print runs. President Putin began to cite him in his annual speech to the Federal Assembly, the Russian equivalent of the State of the Union address.To complete the rehabilitation, Mr. Putin saw to it that Ilyin\u2019s corpse was repatriated from Switzerland, and that his archive was returned from Michigan. The Russian president has been seen laying flowers on Ilyin\u2019s Moscow grave. And Mr. Putin is not the only disciple of Ilyin among the Kremlin elite.Vladislav Y. Surkov, Moscow\u2019s arch-propagandist, also sees Ilyin as an authority. Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, who served as president between 2008 and 2012, recommends Ilyin to Russian students. Ilyin figures in the speeches of the foreign minister, the head of the constitutional court and the patriarch of the Orthodox Church.What are the ideas that have inspired such esteem?Ilyin believed that individuality was evil. For him, the \u201cvariety of human beings\u201d demonstrated the failure of God to complete the labor of creation and was therefore essentially satanic. By extension, the middle classes, political parties and civil society were also evil, because they encouraged the development of personalities beyond the single identity of the national community.According to Ilyin, the purpose of politics is to overcome individuality, and establish a \u201cliving totality\u201d of the nation. Writing in the 1920s and \u201930s after his expulsion from the Soviet Union, when he became a leading emigr\u00e9 ideologue of the anti-Communist White Russians, Ilyin looked on Mussolini and Hitler as exemplary leaders who were saving Europe by dissolving democracy. His 1927 article \u201cOn Russian Fascism\u201d was addressed to \u201cMy White brothers, the fascists.\u201d Later, in the 1940s and \u201950s, he provided the outlines for a constitution of a fascist Holy Russia governed by a \u201cnational dictator\u201d who would be \u201cinspired by the spirit of totality.\u201dThis leader would be responsible for all functions of government in a completely centralized state. Elections would be held, with open voting and signed ballots, purely as a ritual of support of the leader. The reckoning of votes was irrelevant: \u201cWe must reject blind faith in the number of votes and its political significance.\u201dIn the light of Ilyin\u2019s rehabilitation as Russia\u2019s leading ideologue, Moscow\u2019s manipulations of elections should be seen not so much as a failure to implement democracy but as a subversion of the very concept of democracy. Neither the parliamentary elections of December 2011 nor the presidential elections of March 2012 produced a majority for Mr. Putin\u2019s party or for Mr. Putin personally. Votes were therefore added to produce a decisive result.Russians who protested the fixed elections were branded as national enemies. Nongovernmental organizations were forced to register as \u201cforeign agents.\u201d Mr. Putin even claimed that Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, \u201cgave the signal\u201d to the Russian opposition to go on the streets. The notion that defending democracy meant betraying Russia was perfectly consistent with Ilyin\u2019s view.Since then, Mr. Putin has relied on Ilyin\u2019s authority at every turning point in Russian politics \u2014 from his return to power in 2012 to the decision to intervene in Ukraine in 2013 and the annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014. Last spring, he claimed that the American intelligence services would intervene in the Russian parliamentary elections held this past weekend and in the Russian presidential elections of 2018. The question of whether anyone in the Kremlin actually believes this is beside the point. These claims of constant American interference are intended to show that the democratic process is nothing more than a geopolitical game.While Russian leaders consciously work to hollow out the idea of democracy in their own country, they also seek to discredit democracy abroad \u2014 including, this year, in the United States. Russia\u2019s interventions in our presidential elections are not only the opportunistic support of a preferred candidate, Donald J. Trump, who backs Russian foreign policy. They are also the logical projection of the new ideology: Democracy is not a means of changing leadership at home, but a means of weakening enemies abroad. If we see politics as Ilyin did, Russia\u2019s ritualization of elections becomes a virtue rather than a vice. Degrading democracy around the world would be a service to mankind.If democracy is merely an invitation to foreign influence, then hacking a foreign political party\u2019s email is the most natural thing in the world. If civil society is nothing but the decadent opening of a rotting society to foreign influence, then constant trolling of media is obviously appropriate. If, as Ilyin wrote, the \u201carithmetical understanding of politics\u201d is harmful, then digital meddling in foreign elections would be just the thing.For a decade, Russia has been sponsoring right-wing extremists as \u201celection observers\u201d \u2014 most recently, in the farcical referendums in the Crimea and in the Donbas region of Ukraine \u2014 in order to discredit both elections and their observation. Since democracy is a sham, as Ilyin believed, then it is right and good to imitate its language and procedures in order to discredit it. It is noteworthy that the Trump campaign has now imitated this very practice, supplying both its own private \u201cobservers\u201d and the advance conclusion about the fraud they will find.The technique of undermining democracy abroad is to generate doubt where there had been certainty. If democratic procedures start to seem shambolic, then democratic ideas will seem questionable as well. And so America would become more like Russia, which is the general idea. If Mr. Trump wins, Russia wins. But if Mr. Trump loses and people doubt the outcome, Russia also wins.From Moscow\u2019s point of view, it is easier to bring down democracy everywhere than it is to hold free, fair elections at home. Russia will seem stronger if other states follow its course of development toward a cynicism about democracy that allows authoritarianism to thrive. So we might as well get used to the interference, and take sensible precautions. It no longer makes sense to carry out elections and regulate campaign finance as if such matters were of no interest to hostile foreign powers.Americans have plenty of other reasons to reform the democratic process, but protecting their integrity should take priority. Paper ballots for every voter and public financing of campaigns, to give two examples, would make sense both for citizens and for the electoral system. A simpler democracy would be a more secure one \u2014 and a more exemplary one.Timothy Snyder, a professor of history at Yale, is the author, most recently, of \u201cBlack Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greek Lawmakers Pass Additional Austerity Measures", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greek lawmakers approved a new set of austerity measures Tuesday evening, including further trims in pensions and the transfer of major state assets to a new privatization fund to be overseen by the country\u2019s creditors.Earlier in the day, hundreds of workers protested outside Parliament, railing against further pension cuts and describing the planned privatizations as \u201cthe biggest sell-off of national wealth in the country\u2019s history.\u201dThe legislation was approved by a 152-141 vote, an outcome that was expected as Greece\u2019s ruling coalition retains a slim majority in the 300-seat Parliament. But the debate preceding the vote was particularly vehement, and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had to intervene to secure the support of two coalition lawmakers.The transfer of the assets, including major organizations such as the country\u2019s power corporation and the water boards of Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second-largest city, is one of a raft of measures demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors in exchange for bailout funding worth 2.8 billion euros.The government is aiming to secure the money at the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers, on Oct. 10. Mr. Tsipras has said he hopes the conclusion of the next review of Greece\u2019s finances by creditors will pave the way for talks on relieving Greece\u2019s huge debt.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s increasingly unpopular government is hoping that the beginning of debt negotiations will raise its political fortunes. The International Monetary Fund is insisting on debt relief before the fund will join the country\u2019s third international bailout, worth 86 billion euros, which eurozone leaders agreed to last year.A succession of Greek governments have enforced a barrage of austerity measures, chiefly pension cuts and tax increases, over the last six years in exchange for three bailouts worth more than 300 billion euros. The era of belt-tightening has reduced the country\u2019s huge deficits but also slashed its economy by 25 percent and left one in four Greeks unemployed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Denmark Will Buy Leaked Panamanian Documents in Fight Against Tax Evasion", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Denmark will buy documents leaked from the Panamanian law firm at the heart of an offshore finance scandal, part of a growing global effort to clamp down on tax evasion by wealthy individuals, Denmark\u2019s tax minister said on Wednesday.A Danish government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in keeping with department policy, said the cost of the data was less than 10 million kroner, or $1.5 million, and the government hoped that the unpaid taxes recovered would more than offset the cost of the information.The move by the Danish authorities, believed to be the first time that a government has publicly acknowledged paying for access to the documents, seems likely to raise ethical questions about governments buying private material that the law firm says was stolen.\u201cFor many years Denmark has been in the forefront internationally when fighting tax evasion,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe owe it to all Danish taxpayers who faithfully pay their taxes. We have to take the necessary measures to catch tax evaders hiding their fortunes in places like Panama, in order to avoid tax payments in Denmark. That\u2019s why we agreed it was wise to buy this material.\u201dThe Danish government official who spoke anonymously said that the country\u2019s Customs and Tax Administration had received an anonymous offer over the summer from a party willing to sell the data, and that the data involved 320 cases concerning up to 600 Danish taxpayers.He said that the purchase of the data would likely take place this month and that the move had received cross-party support.Speaking by telephone from Copenhagen, the official said the Customs and Tax Administration had been authorized to negotiate the purchase of the leaked material in order to help combat tax evasion.He said it was the first time, to his knowledge, that the government had sanctioned payment for material from a whistle-blower, although it was unclear whether the documents came from the same still-anonymous source who provided the Panama Papers to a German newspaper last year. Such transactions may have taken place secretly in the past, he said, and he suggested that other countries were likely to have paid for access to the documents.In recent months, countries including South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe have been ratcheting up their efforts to uncover tax evaders, while the Group of 7 nations have also agreed to take a tougher stance on the issue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Real Risks in Big Banks\u2019 \u2018Merchant Banking\u2019 Activities", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewOf course, if the Fed were writing an exam on a typical question of basic corporate law, then it might make sense to defer to a corporate law professor\u2019s judgment on its merits. But this is a question of banking law. And, on a banking law exam, his critique of the Fed would not pass muster. Let me explain.It\u2019s even more difficult to maintain the separation of banking from commerce \u2014 which is still the foundational tenet of United States bank regulation \u2014 in the face of banks\u2019 extensive private equity operations. Once a banking entity acquires full control of a commercial company, it becomes impossible to determine whether that bank is a passive financier or an actual commercial actor in, for example, oil drilling, uranium mining or arms trading.And how is the Fed supposed to monitor and control the overall levels of risk present in big, systemically important banks\u2019 operations if those operations include all kinds of nonfinancial activities?Even though the Fed\u2019s report emphasized its traditional concerns with the banks\u2019 safety and soundness, the full range of risks that such extensive merchant banking operations pose includes heightened conflicts of interest, unfair competition, misallocation of credit, more complex forms of market manipulation and fraud and excessive concentration of economic and political power. These are all real risks that are rarely invoked in a basic corporate law exam but lie at the heart of banking law and policy.The Fed\u2019s extraordinary step of recommending legislative repeal of merchant banking authority for bank conglomerates must be evaluated in this broader legal and historical context.\u201cMerchant banking\u2019s storied past\u201d is irrelevant here. The original European merchant banks were small private partnerships that took a lot of risk with a lot of their own capital. They did not take federally insured demand deposits from the general public who had no means of policing their affairs. They did not run a nation\u2019s payments system. And their failure could hardly have pushed the global economy into a severe crisis followed by protracted recession.For the same reasons, free-standing investment banks, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley before their conversion into bank holding companies in 2008, were never subject to limitations on their equity investments and risk-taking. Just like the Italian Renaissance merchant houses, pure investment banks were fundamentally different from the publicly insured deposit-taking banks and, as a result, were treated differently for regulatory purposes.What the Fed is proposing is to restore that market to its pre-1999 state of fair, free-market play: Publicly guaranteed banks would not be able to compete with private equity firms, and private equity firms would not be able to piggyback on big banks\u2019 public guarantee to shift their risks over to taxpayers. These are fundamentally different business models, and the law should simply revert to acknowledging that basic fact.True, the Fed\u2019s report does not cite specific amounts of actual losses or gains to individual banks, or to the nation\u2019s economy, from specific merchant banking investments. It\u2019s also true that no bank\u2019s portfolio has yet been shattered by an environmental catastrophe. But those are not proper reasons to dismiss the Fed\u2019s conclusions as the Deal Professor column does.The Fed is not a hyper-populist agency with a penchant for inexplicable \u201cbank-shaming.\u201d The absence of granular portfolio-level data on individual banks\u2019 merchant banking investments may be partially explained by the sheer difficulty of collecting it. If the Fed requested such portfolio-level data, banks would predictably attack it for unnecessarily increasing their compliance burden.Perhaps banks should produce such specific data voluntarily, so that we actually see that their private equity investments do, in fact, generate significant public benefits with no appreciable risks. Let them show to all of us how many specific new nonfinancial technology start-ups they have financed since 1999, and how much their merchant banking activities have actually contributed to the growth of the real American economy and the welfare of ordinary Americans.I trust Professor Davidoff Solomon would also welcome such data.

The potential combined company would be Europe\u2019s largest operator of stock markets by far.\u201cTherefore, we have opened an in-depth investigation to assess the proposed merger.\u201dThe inquiry would look at a variety of areas within the European financial markets, including the clearing of trades; the markets for derivatives and short-term repurchasing agreements known as repos; and other areas of financial market infrastructure.The European Commission noted that the planned merger would combine two of the three markets for German stocks.To address competition concerns, the London Stock Exchange Group said on Wednesday that it intended to explore a potential sale of LCH S.A., the French operating arm of the LCH.Clearnet Group, its majority-owned clearing business.The European Commission expects to conclude its investigation and issue a decision by Feb. 13.Ahead of the shareholder votes this summer, both exchanges spent much of their time trying to reassure investors about the deal in light of the outcome of the British referendum, which could greatly change Britain\u2019s relationship with the rest of Europe.They have said that an exit by Britain would not change the deal but that it could \u201cwell affect the volume or nature\u201d of business carried out by the combined company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rome Mayor\u2019s Troubled First 3 Months Raise Doubts on Her Five Star Movement", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGarbage piled up in the streets through the summer. Five important officials have resigned, some tainted by investigations for malfeasance. By this month, things were so bad that the comedian Beppe Grillo, a founder of the movement, reversed a vow to stay out of politics and stepped in to shore up Ms. Raggi amid speculation about an early resignation.\u201cOf course I voted for her \u2014 the rest of the politicians here are crooks,\u201d said Isabella Vardelli, a market vendor in Rome. \u201cBut I am getting impatient. Maybe she is na\u00efve, maybe she is incompetent. Is it possible that they can\u2019t start working?\u201d\u201cI also wonder whether she really is as honest as she said she was,\u201d Ms. Vardelli added.Rome has never been an easy city to govern, and it has proved the undoing of any number of parties and politicians who have tried.But Ms. Raggi\u2019s early struggles have left analysts wondering whether the victory here, rather than helping the capital find some political stability, will show that the movement is riddled with many of the same flaws as the establishment it has railed against.The troubles in Rome have become an open wound for the movement, rippling out from the capital and tarnishing its image on the national stage.\u201cRome is an example of the limits of the Five Star Movement, and of the city of Rome per se,\u201d said Sergio Fabbrini, the director of the school of government at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome.\u201cWinning the elections in Rome, paradoxically, was a defeat for the movement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s showing how disorganized and divided they are.\u201dEven prominent members of the movement have criticized Ms. Raggi\u2019s close aides and chosen staff members as unfit to govern. Her lack of experience became more evident through the summer, during which questions were raised about her administrative skills as well as about transparency and honesty, two of the movement\u2019s main selling points.At the end of August, a snowball effect began after rumors about the large salary of Ms. Raggi\u2019s chief of cabinet led to her resignation.Soon after, another crucial member of Ms. Raggi\u2019s cabinet, her budget adviser, quit, lamenting a \u201ctransparency deficit.\u201d Then, in one day, top managers of Rome\u2019s transportation and garbage agencies resigned, too, reinforcing a sense of administrative paralysis.For weeks during the most intense summer heat, the city was the hostage of garbage collectors as trash bags piled up at street corners.But the problem has grown so bad that early this summer, videos circulated of children playing by counting the dozens of rats surrounding Roman garbage bins.In what initially seemed like a hands-on approach, one of Ms. Raggi\u2019s strongest advisers, Paola Muraro, who is responsible for the environment, walked into the city-controlled garbage company and ostensibly forced top managers to lay out a plan to fix the dysfunction.It later emerged, however, that Ms. Muraro had been an adviser to that company for about a decade, and that she was under investigation for wrongdoing as part of an inquiry into waste management in Rome.At first, Ms. Raggi denied knowing of the investigation, but she and a national leader of the Five Star Movement conceded later that they had been aware of it for over a month, and the national leader said they had misunderstood the situation.Early this month, Ms. Raggi\u2019s newly appointed finance chief lasted only a few days, after it emerged that he, too, was under investigation, for abuse of office.The chaos in Rome set off such fierce criticism, as well as sparring among current and former members of the movement, that Mr. Grillo, one of the founders, stepped in to try to calm the situation.\u201cWe are demolishing a system that has been in place for 50 years,\u201d he said in a speech this month in Nettuno, near Rome. \u201cAnd the system is compact against us.\u201d\u201cVirginia will go on, and we\u2019ll monitor,\u201d he added, as he endorsed her.Mayors of Rome have historically attracted much attention. But it has not helped Ms. Raggi that the Five Star Movement\u2019s relationship with the news media has never been particularly warm. Ms. Raggi\u2019s staff did not respond to requests for comment.The storm around Ms. Raggi, as the first female mayor of Rome, has been especially intense and frosty. (Last week, Ms. Raggi posted a video of reporters stationed in front of her apartment in northern Rome with the comment, \u201cI pity you.\u201d) Some say her every move is being unfairly scrutinized.The questions now are how lasting the damage will be, and whether it can be reversed. In one week, the movement lost more than four percentage points in approval ratings, according to some national polls. Still, some analysts argue that for now, the drop may not be all that consequential.\u201cIf we had a national election tomorrow, the Five Star Movement would still be stronger than in the 2013 elections,\u201d Mr. Giannuli said.\u201cRome is the most difficult city to govern in Europe,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s undoubted that the Five Star Movement didn\u2019t even prepare the names for their cabinet members in advance, and made a lot of shallow mistakes.\u201dOne beneficiary may be Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who is counting on the outcome of a referendum later this year on constitutional reform as validation of his mandate. The Five Star Movement is his fiercest enemy.\u201cSurely all this chaos is helping Renzi for the referendum,\u201d Mr. Fabbrini said. \u201cThey are proving to be unfit to govern.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mapping Site Shows Shift in Mayor de Blasio\u2019s Fund-Raising", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn politics, geography is money. Political candidates in New York typically trek to Manhattan\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods to rake in big contributions, often neglecting more far-flung parts of the city.But not always.Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s fund-raising this year, as his 2017 re-election bid gets closer, shifted toward smaller contributions from many parts of the city \u2014 a sharp contrast to the way he raised money last year.On the website, users can customize maps that focus on races or candidates.Another version of the same map, customized to show the number of individual contributions by ZIP code, reveals only the barest scattering of donations outside Manhattan.During the second half of 2015, the mayor received only a single contribution, for $400, from the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Park Slope and Gowanus, where he used to live and had usually drawn strong support. In the first six months of this year, however, he received 117 contributions from residents of those neighborhoods, averaging $201 each.\u201cYou can get a sense of where his financial support is coming from,\u201d said Steve Romalewski, director of the CUNY mapping service at the graduate center, who helped develop the mapping website. \u201cYou can instantly see that the support is now from all over the city.\u201dThe mapping website was first created following the 2013 city elections, but this month the Campaign Finance Board unveiled a newer version that gives users more tools to view the data.Matthew Sollars, a spokesman for the board, which administers the city\u2019s matching funds program for political contributions, said the maps \u201cgive voters a new way to look at the benefits of the program, which is designed to put regular New Yorkers in control of elections.\u201dMr. Sollars said the board hoped that the maps would give new tools to both ordinary voters and researchers to explore patterns and trends in campaign financing.The city\u2019s matching funds program is considered to be one of the most progressive in the United States, offering candidates a six-to-one match for the first $175 in contributions from any city resident. So a voter who makes a $175 contribution to a candidate makes it possible for the candidate to receive an additional $1,050 in matching funds. In contrast, a voter who makes the maximum contribution \u2014 which is $4,950 for citywide races \u2014 triggers the same funding match of $1,050, a formula that gives unusual leverage to voters of lesser means.Mr. Sollars said the maps helped illustrate another important facet of the matching funds program, because it requires City Council candidates to receive donations from at least 75 voters who reside in their districts to be eligible. That forces the candidates to work hard to get donations, no matter how small, from their constituents.He said that had the added benefit of increasing the political participation of New Yorkers throughout the city. He cited a study showing that people who contribute money to candidates are far more likely to vote than those who do not.While data for noncity elections are not available through the mapping program, Mr. Sollars said that contributions to other types of races that do not have the same matching funds incentive \u2014 state legislative contests, for example \u2014 rarely showed similar concentrations within the candidate\u2019s district.\u201cThis threshold push really gets people to go out into those neighborhoods,\u201d he said, referring to the 75-contribution requirement. \u201cIt does democratize the fund-raising.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Souring on Donald Trump, Republicans Pour Money Into Senate Races", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Wealthy Republican donors, viewing Donald J. Trump as a losing cause, are turning their firepower toward several key Senate races, threatening to bury Democrats under a deluge of negative advertising.The group, which does not disclose its donors, is run by allies of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Karl Rove. It has already spent at least $25 million on other close Senate races, including those in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.The Freedom Partners Action Fund, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d aligned with Charles G. and David H. Koch, has spent at least $15 million on TV ads, a quarter of it in Pennsylvania, where Senator Patrick J. Toomey is in a tough re-election fight, at least in part because of voters\u2019 distaste for Mr. Trump.\u201cA lot of investors at our level are interested in a concrete plan and strategy,\u201d said Steven Law, the president and chief executive of One Nation and the affiliated Senate Leadership Fund super PAC.The race for the White House \u201cis too volatile for them to feel comfortable investing in, and they see that,\u201d Mr. Law said. \u201cAnd there is a pathway for us to hold the Senate majority, and they are very eager to invest in that.\u201dThe negative ad saturation has shown clear results in Ohio, where Senator Rob Portman, helped by several outside groups, has been hammering former Gov. Ted Strickland, his Democratic challenger, for nearly a year. Mr. Portman holds a sizable lead in polls.Democrats need to gain five seats to retake control of the Senate after the Republicans won it two years ago, or four if Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency, giving Tim Kaine, her vice president, a tiebreaking vote.Many Republican donors who either reject Mr. Trump or simply fear he will lose believe that maintaining control of the Senate is their only hope of standing up to major policy changes with Mrs. Clinton in the White House.\u201cThey decided that they couldn\u2019t be for Trump,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, who will most likely be majority leader if Democrats take back the Senate.\u201cThe Senate is their firewall, and they are going to do what they can to keep it. I wish we could change the rules, and I hope Citizens United is overruled,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, referring to the Supreme Court decision limiting the government\u2019s ability to restrict independent political expenditures. \u201cBut before that, we can\u2019t unilaterally disarm them.\u201dOne Nation and the Senate Leadership Fund reported raising $42 million in August \u2014 both an indication of Republicans\u2019 increasing worry about the Senate and White House races and a clear sign that their attacks will be unrelenting.\u201cAugust is almost always a month where you sit by the phone like the Maytag repairman, waiting for a donor to call,\u201d Mr. Law said. \u201cWhat was remarkable was not only the fact we could reach donors, but they reached out to us. There was intense interest fueled by the post-convention drop at the top of the ticket.\u201dGroups supporting Democrats have not been silent. The Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward have spent some $30 million combined on ads in competitive races, election commission records show. Democrats have also been aided by traditional allies: labor unions, environmentalists and supporters of abortion rights. But Republicans\u2019 outside groups remain significantly ahead in ad spending.Democrats\u2019 stronger candidate spending narrows some of the gap. Candidates can purchase advertising at a lower rate than PACs and other outside groups. But in exchange, they are subject to fund-raising limits of $2,700 per contributor per election, while outside groups can raise and spend unlimited funds.Some donors to groups supporting Republican Senate candidates are clearly in the camp that opposes Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. For instance, two major Senate Leadership Fund donors \u2014 Warren Stephens, an investment banker, and Paul E. Singer, who runs a hedge fund \u2014 previously gave $2.5 million each to an anti-Trump super PAC, according to reports filed with the F.E.C.Mr. Portman, whose courtly demeanor runs counter to the tenor of his attacks on Mr. Strickland, demonstrates what money and old-fashioned negative advertising can do. He amassed a large campaign fund and turned toward negative campaigning more than a year ago, attacking Mr. Strickland early in 2015 for his support of the Iran nuclear deal and never letting up.Mr. Portman has had other advantages: a giant grass-roots team with over 1,000 college interns; the support of the popular sitting governor, John Kasich; and a strong focus on issues like the state\u2019s opioid abuse problem.Republicans in Florida, Nevada and Missouri can expect additional PAC money for television, digital and mailed advertising, as well as other campaign support.How much will the outside groups spend at the end of the day? \u201cAs much as we can raise,\u201d Mr. Law said.Democrats laugh nervously, hoping that antipathy toward Mr. Trump will serve as a counterweight.\u201cNo matter how much special interest money Republicans dump into states to try and save their weak incumbents, they cannot escape Donald Trump at the top of the ticket,\u201d said Shripal Shah, a spokesman for the Democrats\u2019 Senate Majority PAC. \u201cWe\u2019re on offense across the map and are well positioned to win this November.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nicolas Sarkozy Is Back, but France Has Changed", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 One of the most popular items on the social networks as Nicolas Sarkozy opened his new presidential bid last month was a video of an interview he gave to the French news channel BFM-TV on March 8, 2012. Still president then, Mr. Sarkozy was seeking a second five-year term, with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande running against him. Asked whether he would quit politics if he lost, he firmly answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The journalist was taken aback. \u201cWill you quit politics?\u201d he asked again, incredulous. \u201cYou can ask me a third time,\u201d the president shot back. \u201cI\u2019m telling you: yes.\u201dFour years later, \u201cSarko\u201d is back. Just like his interviewer that day, nobody in France quite believed that this man, who admitted as early as 2003 that he thought all the time about running for president, could live without the adrenaline of a life in politics. In 2012, it took him a few months to recover from defeat, but soon enough he was maneuvering to take back his right-wing party, renaming it Les R\u00e9publicains and putting his people in charge. In a book published last January, \u201cLa France pour la vie\u201d (\u201cFrance Forever\u201d), a seemingly humbled Mr. Sarkozy acknowledged a few mistakes and tried to portray himself as a new man. This was the first stage of his campaign.In a way, this is reassuring: He has not changed. The image of a humbled, apologetic politician was short-lived \u2014 all the more so since it did him no favors in the opinion polls. Better go back to the original. The Sarko we knew is back, with a vengeance.It is not so easy to run again when you have been ejected from office by a clear majority of voters (he lost to Mr. Hollande by more than three percentage points). Neither is it easy to run again when every poll since you\u2019ve been back in the political arena shows an intense dislike among a large group of voters and a high rate of negative opinions. But one thing Nicolas Sarkozy, 61, does not lack is political ambition. However unpopular, he will do whatever it takes to come back.The fight will be harder this time, despite President Hollande\u2019s dismal standing in opinion polls. Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s problem is that he first needs to win a primary in November. He is no longer the champion of the right, but rather the challenger: His former foreign minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, 71, leads in the primary race. And a former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who is also running, is crucifying his ex-boss for comparing himself to de Gaulle. (\u201cCan you imagine de Gaulle under investigation?\u201d he lashed out recently, in a reference to long-running charges against Mr. Sarkozy of illegal campaign financing.)So why should France need Mr. Sarkozy in 2017 if it did not want him in 2012? Because, as he explains in his new book, this is not the same country. The situation created by the recent wave of terrorist attacks requires a strong, experienced man at the helm, this argument goes. \u201cI felt I had the strength to lead this battle at such a tormented moment in our history,\u201d he wrote. Some saw in the title \u201cAll for France\u201d a reference to a book written by Jacques Chirac for his 1995 campaign, \u201cLa France pour tous\u201d (\u201cFrance for All\u201d). By reversing the proposition, Mr. Sarkozy hopes that his new patriotic spirit will erase the worst memories he left \u2014 of his obsessive ego, his arrogance, his bragging and his bellicosity.Will he succeed? Convinced that next year\u2019s election will be fought on the right, rather than at the center, the former president is making a huge wager. The No. 1 issue of this campaign, he thinks, will not be the economy, which he did not have the courage to reform when he was in office, but France, war and Islam: It\u2019s the identity, stupid.This is a risky bet. Where Mr. Jupp\u00e9 aims to unify and pacify, Mr. Sarkozy is unabashedly divisive. Immigration, he says, took a wrong turn in 1976 when President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing allowed families to join economic immigrants in France. Since then, he argues, things have been out of control. He advocates stopping economic immigration for five years, reasoning that integrating immigrants is an old-fashioned concept that has failed. He paints France as a country \u201cforced\u201d by \u201cthe ideologues of multiculturalism and the sociologists of inequality\u201d to give up the mission of assimilating newcomers. \u201cAssimilate means not only acquiring French citizenship but also France\u2019s values, culture and way of life,\u201d he has written. \u201cWe are not Anglo-Saxons who allow communities to live side by side, ignoring each other.\u201dJust as Donald J. Trump wants to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d Nicolas Sarkozy wants to \u201cmake France proud again.\u201d Schoolbooks, he says, should \u201cmake our country loved, not make it feel guilty.\u201d He advocates \u201ca French Islam, not Islam in France.\u201d And oh, yes, of course he wants to ban the burkini.The whole question is whether, even in such tense times, the French are ready for another dose of Sarko. Patriotism is indeed on the rise, but not in a divisive way. Immigration and Islam are certainly worth a debate, and will most likely dominate the campaign in the coming months, but the country needs firefighters, not arsonists. Incendiary politics is Marine Le Pen\u2019s territory; Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s plan, obviously, is to siphon off as many votes as he can from her National Front. But he has been down that road before, and it has not served him well. Indeed, the mood has changed France since the current wave of terrorist attacks began in January 2015. But the turn has not been toward confrontation, and Nicolas Sarkozy may well have misjudged it.Sylvie Kauffmann, the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

There are many costs and responsibilities associated with doing so. A board must be set up, regular filings are required and meetings must be held and minutes kept.There are other options that can make the process more cost-effective and easier to manage.A day after Alice Flaherty retired in November 2012 from her nursing job at what was then Lakewood Hospital, in Ohio, she was told she had lung cancer. She died a little over a year later, at age 63.\u201cMy wife made a request to our son and daughter: \u2018Make sure the kids, the grandkids don\u2019t forget about me,\u2019\u201d said her husband, Dan Flaherty, 68, a retired teacher.In September 2014, he and his family enlisted local and corporate sponsors and established the Love a Nurse Run to honor Ms. Flaherty, an avid runner. The inaugural event, a five-kilometer run and a one-mile walk, attracted nearly 800 participants.The fund has awarded 84 scholarships worth over $76,000, and the third annual Love a Nurse Run is scheduled for Sunday.Scholarship America, a nonprofit group based in Minneapolis, will design and manage scholarship programs and memorial funds. Fees for managing the scholarships start at a couple of thousand dollars, depending on the level of complexity and customization of each program, said Mimi Daly Larson, the group\u2019s senior vice president.In addition to participating in blood drives and a bone marrow registry, they hold an event called the Thanksgiving Share a Meal, open to anyone in the Pasadena, Calif., area, at the restaurant their father started 21 years ago.\u201cTo give back when you\u2019ve lost so much is really the only way forward,\u201d said Ashley Galleher, 28, the executive director of CharitySmith, which oversees more than 120 active funds. \u201cThe grieving process is way more of a burden to bear when you\u2019re not giving back to other people.\u201dThen there are those, like Katie Nicholson, who eventually feel confident enough to fly solo. Ms. Nicholson, 31, started the Zio Nick Memorial Fund on CharitySmith in memory of her father, Michael, who died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in October 2014. She is now obtaining her own nonprofit status, to ensure her organization is not subject to federal taxes. \u201cCreating a nonprofit gives me the ability to fully align and set my own mission,\u201d she said.\u201cYou can take a tax deduction right away,\u201d said David Samuels, a New York lawyer who specializes in setting up and advising charitable organizations. \u201cThen you can make requests to that charity as to where the money should go.\u201d\u201cYou try to honor people when they\u2019re alive, but sometimes it\u2019s too late,\u201d Mr. Tucker said. \u201cBut 41 years after my father died, I\u2019ll sell out Carnegie Hall.

Although the roundabout would serve as a gateway to the entire region, only Boothbay\u2019s 2,502 registered voters can vote on it. For now, they appear just as split over the construction as they are over Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Mr. Coulombe has been buying up the town piece by piece with the intention of converting it from a comfortable old shoe of a place into a luxury destination to compete with other high-end coastal towns like Kennebunkport, Camden and Bar Harbor.He has upgraded the golf course and invested $50 million in the adjacent clubhouse. He has transformed a nearby lighthouse into a bed-and-breakfast that costs $500 a night. He has built for himself a $30 million, marble-laden mansion with, among other features, a 14-karat-gold chandelier modeled on one in Versailles, an infinity pool and 37 televisions.And he conveys confidence that he knows what is best for Boothbay.\u201cI think you need to open your doors and open your eyes and open your minds to a better future for the town,\u201d Mr. Coulombe told residents at a meeting in 2013 as he laid out his plan.\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t do the improvements on 27 at some point in time,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to choke you off.\u201d\u201cYou have a nouveau riche person who has decided to change Boothbay Harbor from a cozy, treasured spot to a destination point for the rich and wealthy,\u201d said Sumner H. Lipman, a lawyer who represents several clients with whom Mr. Coulombe has tangled.\u201cWhen he doesn\u2019t get his way, then he takes action to punish people until they give up,\u201d Mr. Lipman added.The roundabout has become a symbol of Mr. Coulombe\u2019s attempt to put his stamp on Boothbay and a proxy for an identity crisis that the town did not quite know it had. Suddenly, everyone is debating whether Boothbay\u2019s future lies in upscale development or in maintaining its more modest aesthetic.The $3.3 million roundabout development is a public matter, involving town property, the reconfiguration of Route 27 and the use of tax increment financing to pay for it. Voters will decide whether to authorize $1.15 million in bonds to finance the town\u2019s one-third share of the cost. (Mr. Coulombe would pick up one-third and the Maine Department of Transportation the other third.)Mr. Coulombe, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has said that the roundabout would reduce congestion, improve safety and create a welcoming gateway to several harbor towns. But mainly, he has indicated that it was part of his grand design to make the area more attractive to young families, strengthen the year-round economy and revitalize the region.Boothbay may be relatively affluent, but parts of the seasonal economy are flagging. With retirees moving in, the area\u2019s population is among the oldest and fastest-aging in the country. Young people are leaving, and school enrollment has plunged by a third over the past decade.\u201cThe fishing industry has been suffering for 20 years now and has been slowly dying away,\u201d said Michael Maxim, the manager of Abacus, a craft shop in adjacent Boothbay Harbor. An official with the chamber of commerce, Mr. Maxim supports the roundabout.\u201cWe have the potential for growth and have a lot of good things happening,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we could use a little bit of a swift kick.\u201dJulie Roberts, who, with her husband, Paul, owns Coastal Maine Popcorn Company, in Boothbay Harbor, is among the merchants who back Mr. Coulombe\u2019s plans. \u201cWe support anything he can do to bring business to town and make it nice for people so they want to come back,\u201d Ms. Roberts said.Opponents acknowledge that the economy needs a lift. But they resent Mr. Coulombe\u2019s trying to impose his will, complain that he is pricing out locals and say he is homogenizing this pre-Revolutionary War area.\u201cA lot of people feel like their heritage is being taken over by someone throwing his weight around,\u201d said Fred Kaplan, an author and historian who has led the opposition.As one letter writer to The Boothbay Register, the local newspaper, put it: \u201cThe things Mr. Too Damn Much Money wants to change are the reasons we come back year after year.\u201dBeyond that, Mr. Kaplan said, \u201cThe prime beneficiary of this development will be the developer himself.\u201dCritics say he is essentially buying off the town.One of the few who shrugs over the controversy, even as she plans to vote against the roundabout, is Bet Finocchiaro, who runs Bet\u2019s Fish Fry, a seafood shack near where the roundabout would go. Mr. Coulombe tried to buy her out, but she refused to sell.\u201cI like my town the way it is,\u201d she said as she breaded haddock for the dinner shift.\u201cEveryone is complaining that he bought the town,\u201d she mused. \u201cBut they sold it to him. They could have said no. I did.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flooding of Coast, Caused by Global Warming, Has Already Begun", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "Scientists\u2019 warnings that the rise of the sea would eventually imperil the United States\u2019 coastline are no longer theoretical.Supported byNORFOLK, Va. \u2014 Huge vertical rulers are sprouting beside low spots in the streets here, so people can judge if the tidal floods that increasingly inundate their roads are too deep to drive through.Five hundred miles down the Atlantic Coast, the only road to Tybee Island, Ga., is disappearing beneath the sea several times a year, cutting the town off from the mainland.And another 500 miles on, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., increased tidal flooding is forcing the city to spend millions fixing battered roads and drains \u2014 and, at times, to send out giant vacuum trucks to suck saltwater off the streets.Now, those warnings are no longer theoretical: The inundation of the coast has begun. The sea has crept up to the point that a high tide and a brisk wind are all it takes to send water pouring into streets and homes.These tidal floods are often just a foot or two deep, but they can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars, kill lawns and forests, and poison wells with salt. Moreover, the high seas interfere with the drainage of storm water.\u201cOnce impacts become noticeable, they\u2019re going to be upon you quickly,\u201d said William V. Sweet, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Silver Spring, Md., who is among the leaders in research on coastal inundation. \u201cIt\u2019s not a hundred years off \u2014 it\u2019s now.\u201dGlobal warming and rising seas are increasing the amount of tidal flooding on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.In many of the worst-hit cities, mayors of both parties are sounding an alarm.But the local leaders say they cannot tackle this problem alone. They are pleading with state and federal governments for guidance and help, including billions to pay for flood walls, pumps and road improvements that would buy them time.Yet Congress has largely ignored these pleas, and has even tried to block plans by the military to head off future problems at the numerous bases imperiled by a rising sea. A Republican congressman from Colorado, Ken Buck, recently called one military proposal part of a \u201cradical climate change agenda.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as if the country was being attacked along every border, simultaneously,\u201d said Andrea Dutton, a climate scientist at the University of Florida and one of the world\u2019s leading experts on rising seas. \u201cIt\u2019s a slow, gradual attack, but it threatens the safety and security of the United States.\u201dOne night eight years ago, Karen Speights, a Norfolk resident, was sitting at the dinner table with her mother, eating crab legs dipped in butter and a tangy sauce. She felt a tingle.\u201cMa!\u201d she cried. \u201cMy feet are wet!\u201dHer mother laughed, but then she felt it, too: a house that had not flooded since the family moved there in 1964 was soon awash in saltwater. Ms. Speights initially hoped that flood was a fluke. Instead, it turned out to be the first of three to hit their home in less than a decade.Nowadays, Ms. Speights, an administrative worker at a utility company, is wondering how to get her and her mother out of the neighborhood before the water comes again, without taking too much of a financial hit. And she pays more attention to problems that once seemed remote, like warnings from scientists about the rising sea.\u201cI believe it because we\u2019re living it,\u201d Ms. Speights said as she sat on her sofa, nodding toward the nearby tidal marsh that sent water into her living room. \u201cThe water has to be rising if we never flooded, and all of a sudden we\u2019ve flooded three times in eight years.\u201dBecause the land is sinking as the ocean rises, Norfolk and the metropolitan region surrounding it, known as Hampton Roads, are among the worst-hit parts of the United States. That local factor means, in essence, that the region is a few decades ahead in feeling the effects of sea-level rise, and illustrates what people along the rest of the American coast can expect.The biggest problems involve frequent flooding of homes and roads. As the sea rises, hundreds of tidal creeks and marshes that thread through the region are bringing saltwater to people\u2019s doorsteps.This summer, on a driving tour of Norfolk and nearby towns, William A. Stiles Jr. pointed to the telltale signs that the ocean is gradually invading the region.He spotted crusts of dried salt in the streets, and salt-loving marsh grasses that are taking over suburban yards. He pointed out trees killed by seawater. He stood next to one of the road signs that Norfolk has been forced to install in recent years, essentially huge vertical rulers so people know the depth of floodwaters at low-lying intersections.\u201cThere\u2019s just more and more visible impacts: water on the street, water that won\u2019t clear from the ditch, these intense rain events, higher tides,\u201d Mr. Stiles said.\u201cIt\u2019s beginning to catch the attention of citizens, restaurant owners, business people, politicians. There\u2019s just much more of a conversation, and it\u2019s not just in the politically safe places. It\u2019s everywhere.\u201dMr. Stiles, known as Skip, heads a local environmental group, Wetlands Watch. At his suggestion, students at two local universities began looking at the neighborhood where Ms. Speights lives, Chesterfield Heights. It has had little history of flooding, but that is starting to change as the water rises.But the size of that grant illustrates the scope of the problem confronting the region, and the country: protecting a single neighborhood from rising water can easily cost tens of millions of dollars. Sea walls and streets may have to be raised, or movable gates built along waterways so they can be closed at times of high water.While the Obama administration is trying to create a few showcase neighborhoods, there is no sign Congress is prepared to spend the money that cities and states say they need: tens of billions of dollars just to catch up to the current flooding problems, much less get ahead of them. Norfolk alone, a town of 250,000 people, has a wish list of $1.2 billion \u2014 or about $5,000 for every man, woman and child in the city.As the national response lags, experts warn that the flooding is putting the country\u2019s defense at risk.Several studies have concluded that Naval Station Norfolk, the world\u2019s largest naval base, is profoundly threatened by rising seas, as are other coastal bases. The Pentagon has managed to build floodgates and other protective measures at some facilities. But attempts by the military to develop broader climate change plans have met fierce resistance in Congress.That was the case this summer, when an effort by the Pentagon to appoint officers to take charge of climate resilience led to a House vote prohibiting taxpayer money from being spent on the plan.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any evidence that there is serious thought about this: What does a world of three, four, five feet of sea-level rise look like?\u201dDeep in a thicket of trees on an out-of-the-way island in the Florida Keys, a diesel engine roared to life. Soon a drill bit was chewing through ancient limestone, pulling up evidence from the geological past that might shed light on the future of the planet.With taxpayer funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Dutton is chasing what might be the most urgent question in climate science: How fast is the ocean going to rise?\u201cIs it going to happen in decades, or centuries, or a thousand years?\u201d Dr. Dutton asked as she took a break to eat lunch on a tarpaulin spread under the trees. \u201cThis will give us an example to say, \u2018Well, the last time this happened, here is how long it took.\u2019\u201dThe opponents of climate science in Congress, and the tiny group of climate researchers allied with them, have argued that the concerns of thousands of mainstream scientists about the future are based on unproven computer forecasts.In reality, their concerns are based in large part on mounting evidence of what has happened in the past.Through decades of research, it has become clear that human civilization, roughly 6,000 years old, developed during an unusually stable period for global sea levels. But over longer spans, coastlines have been much more dynamic.During ice ages, caused by wobbles in the Earth\u2019s orbit, sea levels dropped more than 400 feet as ice piled up on land. But during periods slightly warmer than today, the sea may have risen 70 or more feet above the current level.Dr. Dutton and other leading scientists are focused on the last sea-level high point, which occurred between the last two ice ages, about 125,000 years ago.After years of surveying ancient shorelines around the world, scientists determined that the sea level rose by something like 20 to 30 feet in that era, compared with today. But how long did it take to make that jump? That is the question Dr. Dutton, using improved research techniques, wants to answer.Large parts of the Florida Keys are simply ancient coral reefs that grew during the period of high seas, and were exposed when the levels fell. Trees, roads and houses now sit atop the old reefs. By recovering samples, Dr. Dutton hopes to date a sequence of corals as they grew along with the rising sea, potentially revealing the rate at which the water rose.The research, likely to take years, may supply a figure for how quickly the ocean was able to rise under past conditions, but not necessarily a maximum rate for the coming decades. The release of greenhouse gases from human activity is causing the planet to warm rapidly, perhaps faster than at any other time in the Earth\u2019s history. The ice sheets in both Greenland and West Antarctica are beginning to melt into the sea at an accelerating pace.In essence, by revealing how sensitive the ice sheets have been to past warming, Dr. Dutton\u2019s research may answer the question of whether such a rapid jump is possible.Along the East Coast, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say that many communities have already, or will soon, pass a threshold where sunny-day flooding starts to happen much more often.\u201cWhen you look at the historical record, there\u2019s no trend saying the flooding is going down,\u201d said Dr. Sweet, the NOAA expert. \u201cThe trends are all very clear. They\u2019re going up, and they\u2019re going up in many of these areas in an accelerating fashion.\u201dBut the air is already so full of greenhouse gases that most land ice on the planet has started to melt. So even if the deal survives, it will, at best, slow the rise of the sea and perhaps limit the ultimate increase. Many climate scientists, including Dr. Dutton, believe a rise of at least 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable, over an unknown period.As Brad Tuckman walked the piece of land in Fort Lauderdale where he is building a grand new house, he pointed toward the canal that wraps around three sides of the property.It is scenic, with yachts plying the water, yet as the sea has risen, street flooding in the area has become a recurring nuisance. So before starting construction, Mr. Tuckman said he spent nearly a half-million dollars to raise the sea wall and truck in dirt to elevate the land.\u201cThe predictions of what\u2019s going to happen over the next 20, 30, 40 years \u2014 it\u2019s real,\u201d said Mr. Tuckman, the founder of a company offering creative services to the retail industry.In Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale, as well as in older Northern cities like Boston and New York, tidal marshes and creeks were filled in a century or more ago to make new land, and it is in these areas \u2014 \u201cback bays,\u201d as some of these spots are called \u2014 where the flooding is happening first.That is because they remain the lowest spots in the landscape, vulnerable to the rising water nearby. Old drain pipes empty into the tidal creeks, and at high tide the water can back up through these pipes, bubbling into the streets seemingly from nowhere.In Miami Beach, the city engineer, Bruce A. Mowry, has come up with a plan for combating the flooding. He rips up problematic streets, raises them with extra dirt and repaves them, installing new drains and giant pumps that can push water back into the bay. The approach has already been shown to work in several neighborhoods.The huge county government for the region, Miami-Dade County, is developing its own resilience strategy, one likely to cost billions. It has committed to rebuilding some of its decaying infrastructure, like a sewage plant, in a way that safeguards against sea-level rise and storm surges.\u201cI don\u2019t see doom and gloom here; I see opportunity,\u201d said Harvey Ruvin, the clerk of courts for Miami-Dade County, who has been a leading voice on the environment in Florida for a half-century, and who recently led a county task force on sea-level rise. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the most robust possible jobs program you can think of, and one that can\u2019t be outsourced.\u201dMany of the Republican mayors in the region are on the same page as Democrats in requesting national and state action on climate change, as well as pushing local steps. James C. Cason, the Republican mayor of Coral Gables, has convened informational sessions that draw hundreds of residents, and he has received no complaints for his stance.\u201cI hope in coming years when we have to spend a lot of money, the citizens will still support it,\u201d Mr. Cason said in an interview.Still, his city, and others in South Florida, have some hard decisions to make.Some property owners cannot afford to raise their sea walls, putting their neighborhoods at increased risk of flooding. Will they be held legally responsible when floods do occur? A strict policy could force some people from their homes. Conversely, should public money be spent to do the work, even if it largely benefits private property?Just for streets, storm drains and the like, South Florida governments will need to raise billions, and they have yet to figure out how. Moreover, if the rise of the sea accelerates as much as some scientists fear, it is doubtful the cities will be able to keep up.The region has one mayor, Philip K. Stoddard of South Miami, who is a scientist himself \u2014 he studies animal communication at Florida International University \u2014 and has been a close reader of scientific papers about climate change since the 1990s.\u201cI remember lying in bed at night thinking, \u2018I hope this isn\u2019t real,\u2019\u201d Dr. Stoddard, a Democrat, recalled. \u201cI hope other data comes in that contradicts it. It took me several years to get my head around it and say, \u2018Oh, God, it is real.\u2019\u201dNow he is focused on easing the pain for South Miami, with a $50 million system of sewer pipes to replace septic tanks threatened by the rising water table.\u201cYou can play it really badly and let unpleasant things happen earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cOr you can push them off by doing some infrastructure repairs and some thoughtful planning.\u201dHe is, though, under no illusions about the long-term fate of the region he calls home.\u201cWe\u2019re putting enough heat in the ocean to send water over us, no question,\u201d Dr. Stoddard said. \u201cUltimately, we give up and we leave. That\u2019s how the story ends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Little Nagging Can Help Reduce Credit Card Debt", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserWhile no one likes to be nagged, a bit of prodding \u2014 with periodic emails or online messages \u2014 can help consumers reduce their credit card debt, a new study has found.The six-month study involved nearly 14,000 customers of the Arizona Federal Credit Union in Phoenix who carry balances on their credit cards rather than paying off the balance each month \u2014 known as revolvers. The research was financed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. (The study participants were chosen at random and did not know they were participating, while researchers saw anonymous data about their credit card debt.)The researchers tested two rules of thumb. The first was that participants should use cash, instead of credit, for purchases under $20. The second advised them that paying with a credit card can add about 20 percent to the purchase cost for a typical revolver because of interest charges and fees.The rules were encapsulated in simple slogans: \u201cDon\u2019t swipe the small stuff. Use cash when it\u2019s under $20.\u201d And, \u201cCredit keeps charging. It adds approximately 20 percent to the total.\u201dThe messages were sent to participants in a randomized fashion in three ways: by email twice a month, with the message in the subject line; by a banner ad shown when participants logged onto the bank\u2019s website; and by mailing a refrigerator magnet that included a calendar with the rule of thumb. A control group received no messages.The study found that the rules of thumb produced \u201cmoderate\u201d effects, at a low cost. The first rule, urging people to use cash for purchases of $20 or less, resulted in credit card balances that were on average $104, or 2 percent, lower than they would have been without the intervention. The cost of the effort was 50 cents per person.\u201cThe pain of payment is higher with cash,\u201d said Brett Theodos, senior research associate with the Urban Institute.Researchers did not find a significant effect over all for the second rule, which reminded people that credit can increase the cost of purchases by 20 percent. But the message did show results for some groups of participants, like those under age 40. For those participants, the study found, revolving debt was $160 lower from the second rule and $173 lower from the first rule.Such reminders, Mr. Theodos said, work best for influencing recurring or frequent purchases, rather than those, like car or home purchases, that consumers may make only once over several years or longer.The study did not find a clear winner in terms of the notification method. But receiving the messages by fewer channels seemed to work better than getting them by all three, researchers found \u2014 perhaps, because too many messages may have led to \u201coverexposure and fatigue.\u201dWhile targeting consumers with basic financial information is not necessarily \u201cthe one solution\u201d for improving financial health, Mr. Theodos said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty inexpensive way to nudge people.\u201dHere are some questions and answers about managing your money:How can I set up reminders to help manage my money?How can I calculate how long it will take to pay off my card debt?Should I transfer high-interest credit card debt to a card with a zero percent interest offer?Transferring high-interest rate balances to a zero percent interest-rate card can be a good way to reduce debt and avoid interest charges, if you can qualify \u2014 but only if you can pay off the balance before the no-interest period expires, debt counselors advise. \u201cMost people lack the discipline to do that,\u201d said Mike Sullivan, a personal finance consultant with Take Charge America, a nonprofit debt counseling agency.Mr. Sullivan recommends that any extra money available after making the required minimum credit card payments be applied to the card with the highest interest rate. He also advises checking the rates and terms on your credit cards at least every three years to make sure the card fits your needs and to switch cards if necessary. Consumers who carry a balance, he said, should look for the card with the lowest available rate.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Private Equity Tries to Chip Away at Dodd-Frank With House Bill", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, private equity suffered a rare setback on Capitol Hill.The Dodd-Frank Act, the sweeping legislation passed in response to the crisis, saddled the industry with new regulations. The largest private equity firms, which had operated for decades with relatively little federal oversight, suddenly faced regulatory exams and reporting obligations.But the industry did not give up.Six years after Dodd-Frank\u2019s passage, these firms are now lobbying Congress to undo some of the recent requirements \u2014 and the House of Representatives appears poised to do so.On Friday, the House is scheduled to vote on the Investment Advisers Modernization Act of 2016, a bill championed by the private equity industry\u2019s trade group.The bill would maintain important components of Dodd-Frank \u2014 there would still be federal exams of private equity firms, which manage money for pension funds and other large investors. Yet it represents a significant challenge for Dodd-Frank\u2019s staunchest supporters, who denounced the new bill for, among other things, loosening the requirements on what information the industry must report to regulators about the nature of its investments.Already, the bill has divided pockets of Washington and the financial regulatory world, laying battle lines that transcend partisan politics. The bill has drawn support from Republicans and Democrats alike, along with a sharp rebuke from Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. One of the nation\u2019s largest public pension funds also opposes the bill, as does Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and the White House, which has threatened a possible veto.The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator that oversees the private equity industry, raised concerns about the bill behind the scenes in Washington, people briefed on the matter said. But after a Democratic amendment was offered this week, removing some aspects of the bill, the S.E.C. declined to publicly oppose it, even though the agency\u2019s chairwoman, Mary Jo White, is said to have lingering concerns.A spokeswoman for Ms. White declined to comment.In a statement, the head of the American Investment Council, the private equity trade group, said, \u201cThese common-sense, thoughtful modifications show a commitment to improving the regulatory structure for private funds.\u201d\u201cWe look forward to seeing this bill advance,\u201d said Mike Sommers, the group\u2019s president and chief executive, who previously was chief of staff for former House Speaker John Boehner.Banks and other Wall Street groups have spent years trying to chip away at Dodd-Frank, recognizing that a full repeal would be impossible under the Obama administration. The efforts could accelerate depending on the outcome of the presidential election. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, has vowed to dismantle the law, and House Republicans are circulating another House bill that would strip away even more of Dodd-Frank\u2019s restrictions on private equity.\u201cAccording to The New York Times, profit-driven private equity firms are increasingly investing in emergency services companies and the mortgage market, which has led to slower reaction times for emergency services, aggressive mortgage collection practices and the same sort of foreclosure abuses that we witnessed before the financial crisis,\u201d Ms. Waters said.In a subsequent statement, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we need more oversight of private equity, not less.\u201dThe bill\u2019s chief sponsor, Representative Robert Hurt, a Virginia Republican, tied the legislation to job creation, explaining that his district has benefited from \u201cjobs that have been maintained and created by small companies backed by private equity investment.\u201d\u201cThis bipartisan effort to streamline the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 does not curtail the ability of the Securities and Exchange Commission to carry out its role, nor does it repeal the registration requirements imposed by Dodd-Frank,\u201d Mr. Hurt said about the bill, which is also supported by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Investment Adviser Association and Small Business Investor Alliance.After years of exposing private equity to little oversight, Congress switched gears with the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The law required private fund advisers that manage more than $150 million to register with the S.E.C. and detail aspects of their business to the agency, which also began periodic examinations of the managers. The new scrutiny opened a window into the industry\u2019s conduct, leading the S.E.C. to penalize a number of private equity firms for misleading investors.The bill\u2019s opponents \u2014 including Ms. Waters and the advocacy group Americans for Financial Reform \u2014 question why Congress would undo some restrictions on private equity just as the S.E.C. was identifying problems in the industry.In particular, the opponents have raised concerns about a provision that would reduce the amount of information that large private equity fund managers report to regulators, according to a document prepared by the bill\u2019s critics and reviewed by The Times. The information, including details about how the managers finance investments and whether the companies they own default, is recorded on what is known as Form PF, a private document that allows the S.E.C. and other authorities to monitor risks.In its statement, the American Investment Council said there was no need to worry because private equity did not \u201cpresent any systemic risks.\u201d The group also noted that fund managers would still complete other portions of the Form PF, arguing that \u201cthe bill would merely tailor\u201d how private equity files the form, \u201cso it would be less burdensome.\u201dEven so, critics seized on other aspects of the bill, including a section that would excuse private equity firms from having to notify clients, or obtain their approval, if a fund underwent a change in control or management. The critics also attacked the bill for allowing private equity managers to cite past recommendations from clients in advertising materials, which they said could create a false perception of future performance.The American Investment Council said the bill would reverse \u201coutdated\u201d provisions on advertising. It added that \u201csophisticated investors are able to accurately assess the value of quotes from other investors.\u201dFor critics, it could have been worse. Representative Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat who is co-sponsoring the bill, offered an amendment this week that would remove provisions that critics found most objectionable.Still, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, the giant public pension fund known as Calpers, echoed some of the critics\u2019 concerns. In a statement, Calpers said the bill \u201cwould undermine the significant gains achieved under Dodd-Frank by diminishing transparency into private funds and restricting the S.E.C.\u2019s ability to protect investors.\u201dIn its own statement, the White House noted that pension funds that \u201csupport our nation\u2019s teachers, police officers and firefighters\u201d invest in private equity and argued that lawmakers \u201cshould be encouraging the S.E.C. to fully implement the enhanced investor safeguards provided in current law, not repealing important protections.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Donation Is His Latest Brush With Campaign Fund Rules", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump, who has repeatedly denounced pay-to-play politics during his insurgent campaign, is now defending himself against claims that he donated $25,000 to a group supporting the Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi, to sway her office\u2019s review of fraud allegations at Trump University.Mr. Trump\u2019s payment of a $2,500 penalty to the Internal Revenue Service over that 2013 campaign gift amounted to only the latest slap of his wrist in a decades-long record of shattering political donation limits and circumventing the rules governing contributions and lobbying.In the 1980s, Mr. Trump was compelled to testify under oath before New York State officials after he directed tens of thousands of dollars to the president of the New York City Council through myriad subsidiary companies to evade contribution limits. In the 1990s, the Federal Election Commission fined Mr. Trump for exceeding the annual limit on campaign contributions by $47,050, the largest violation in a single year. And in 2000, the New York State lobbying commission imposed a $250,000 fine for Mr. Trump\u2019s failing to disclose the full extent of his lobbying of state legislators.For the most part, Mr. Trump has seemed unrepentant. Testifying in 1988 about a $50,000 bank loan he had first guaranteed, and then repaid, on behalf of Andrew J. Stein\u2019s successful campaign for New York City Council president, Mr. Trump made no bones about the move.Mr. Trump and Ms. Bondi, who is supporting his campaign, have denied any connection between his donation and her office\u2019s decision not to proceed with an investigation. Asked about the subject on Monday, he called Ms. Bondi \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d and said that he \u201cnever spoke to her about that at all.\u201dA spokesman for the Florida attorney general\u2019s office, Gerald Whitney Ray, said the office\u2019s inquiry never came across Ms. Bondi\u2019s desk: Lower-level staff members made the decision not to proceed with an investigation of their own. Mr. Ray also said the office never gave any thought to joining in the New York attorney general\u2019s case.But Democrats and liberal watchdogs seized the opportunity to accuse Mr. Trump of practicing exactly the sort of corrupt politics that he rails against on the campaign trail.Campaigning in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton demanded details of the conversation in which Ms. Bondi solicited Mr. Trump\u2019s donation. \u201cThe American people deserve to know what was said, because clearly the attorney general did not proceed with the investigation,\u201d she told reporters.And Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for the liberal-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Mr. Trump\u2019s donation to Ms. Bondi gave new meaning to his more recent boasts about the efficacy of his political giving. \u201cIt sure looks like that is what is going on here,\u201d said Mr. Libowitz, whose group filed a complaint about the donation with the I.R.S.Though Mr. Trump denies it in the case of Ms. Bondi, he has been brazen in asserting that he has used political donations to buy influence \u2014 and routinely asks voters to trust that, because he possesses that insider\u2019s knowledge, he can reform a system that he calls \u201crigged.\u201dHave you registered your disapproval or approval for Donald J. Trump\u2019s candidacy by, say, discarding or returning Trump-brand clothes \u2014 or by booking a night at a Trump hotel? We want to hear your stories.During a Republican debate last summer, Mr. Trump responded about his ability to curry favor with public officials when he was confronted with one of his own statements: \u201cWhen you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better believe it,\u201d Mr. Trump responded. He added: \u201cWhen they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s history of political giving stretches back decades \u2014 and has repeatedly drawn regulatory scrutiny.When a New York State commission investigated contributions to state and local officials in the 1980s, it subpoenaed Mr. Trump, who had contributed $150,000 to candidates in 1985. Under oath, he said he had circumvented the state\u2019s $50,000 individual and $5,000 corporate contribution limits by disbursing his contributions to Mr. Stein, the city councilman, through 18 subsidiary companies.\u201cMy attorneys basically said that this was a proper way of doing it,\u201d Mr. Trump testified.In an interview, Mr. Stein said he did not recall what Mr. Trump had sought in return for his contributions, or for a $50,000 campaign loan that Mr. Trump first guaranteed and then repaid. He denied ever agreeing to do Mr. Trump any favors.Years later, Mr. Trump came under fire from the Federal Election Commission for violating a $25,000 annual limit on contributions in the late 1980s. Mr. Trump resisted paying a fine, insisting that he had been unaware of the federal limit and that, once informed of it, he sought refunds.Only when the commission threatened to take him to court did Mr. Trump agree to a $15,000 civil penalty, records show.\u201cWe were going to fight it, but it would have cost more money than the settlement,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time.It was with similar reluctance that in 2000, Mr. Trump apologized for failing to disclose to New York State officials that he had spent $150,000 to finance ads opposing a proposed casino in the Catskills, which he saw as a threat to his Atlantic City properties. The ads were created and placed by a political consultant, Roger Stone, and appeared under the name of a front group, the Institute for Law and Society.A settlement led to what, at the time, was the largest penalty imposed by the state lobbying commission: Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts paid $50,000, and Mr. Stone and the front group each paid $100,000, without admitting wrongdoing. In a statement, all three said they \u201capologize if anyone was misled.\u201dIn recent years, Mr. Trump has made tens of thousands of dollars in contributions to at least four state attorneys general \u2014 Ms. Bondi of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas, both Republicans, and the Democrats Eric Schneiderman of New York and Kamala Harris of California \u2014 whose offices have looked into complaints about Trump University.Ms. Harris\u2019s office said it, too, was investigating the company, and an aide said that she donated the $6,000 from Mr. Trump to charity.Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s fraud lawsuit is still pending. But Mr. Trump, whose donation of $12,500 to Mr. Schneiderman preceded his election, filed a state ethics complaint alleging that Mr. Schneiderman continued to seek donations, calling the fraud case a \u201cshakedown.\u201dKitty Bennett, Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Shimon Peres, Israel Will No Longer Be Young", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEL AVIV \u2014 In a little more than a year and a half, Israel will celebrate its 70th birthday. A few weeks after that, Shimon Peres \u2014 our country\u2019s former president, prime minister, foreign minister, defense minister, finance minister and so much more \u2014 will turn 95. We hope and pray.Israel will never again have a leader like Mr. Peres. He is the last of the giants of the founding generation, and we have been lucky to have him stick around for so long. Mr. Peres\u2019s presence gives Israel the luxury of still feeling young. Since Sept. 12, when he suffered a major stroke, Israelis have united to pray for his health. But as we follow updates from the hospital, we are not just praying for him, but also for ourselves and for our country\u2019s bygone youth.When can a country no longer claim to be young? It may be when the last of the generation who built it fades away and takes with him the spirit of a fading era.Mr. Peres began his life in Vishneva, a village on the border of modern-day Poland and Belarus. When he left for Palestine in 1934, under his original name, Shimon Persky, his grandfather told him, \u201cBe a Jew, forever!\u201d The grandfather, along with much of his family, perished in the Holocaust.The grandson helped secure the future of Jews in Israel, involving himself from the country\u2019s inception in building and expanding its defenses. Two years ago, when Gen. Gadi Eizenkot was appointed chief of staff of Israel\u2019s military, Mr. Peres was probably the only leader who could still claim to have known all 21 of Israel\u2019s military chiefs personally. Working alongside Israel\u2019s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, Mr. Peres began his career as a defense official. In 1952, at age 29 and just four years after Israel\u2019s independence, he became the director general of the Ministry of Defense.Israelis can easily unite around this legacy. But there are other parts of Mr. Peres\u2019s past that are causes of division.To the outside world, Mr. Peres is known as a man of peace, the behind-the-scenes mastermind of the Oslo Accords that put Israel on a course of negotiations with the Palestinians. His great moment of recognition came in 1994, when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, alongside his colleague (and political rival) Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat.But Mr. Peres did not quit when he was defeated. He remained active, as a voice for peace, as an opposition leader, as a partner to his peer Ariel Sharon, and, lastly, serving in the mostly ceremonial role of president. That\u2019s when even many Israelis who vehemently disagreed with his politics grew to like him. They liked him when he no longer had the ability to scheme for advancing the policies that Israel rejected.Mr. Peres never achieved his goal of drawing Israel\u2019s final border with the Palestinians. But a generation of founders rarely sees all of its dreams come true. We\u2019ve lost most of our founders now: David Ben-Gurion, and his archrival, Menachem Begin, the war heroes Mr. Rabin and Mr. Sharon. All of them departed when their mission was not yet complete.A generation of founders also has no control over the way a future generation is going to appreciate its actions. Mr. Peres is gradually losing control over his legacy. We, the Israeli people, will decide what he means for Israel. And it might not be what he has in mind. It might not be Peres the Peacemaker.What happens when a nation loses its youth? It is unburdened from some of its youthful fixations. It also loses perspective. The perspective of those who, like Mr. Peres, still remember the early days. The perspective of those who, like Mr. Peres, still remember what it is like to have real difficulties, to have to be resourceful and daring.Israel is already showing signs of an old country\u2019s amnesia: It tends to forget how remarkable was the journey that brought us to today. It has more difficulties appreciating its many great achievements, rather than constantly complaining about its (also many) shortcomings. These achievements were hard to imagine when young Shimon Peres was standing alongside Ben-Gurion and pondering Israel\u2019s future. Or maybe they weren\u2019t hard to imagine for Mr. Peres, a man known mostly for having many dreams.Here is a legacy worth preserving: Mr. Peres was not just an Israeli leader for so many years, he was also an Israeli dreamer. Chiefly, a dreamer about peace. So as we watch his health deteriorate, and as we begin rewriting his legacy in a way that fits Israel\u2019s current disposition, our pain is obvious: It is the pain of a nation whose dreams about peace were hospitalized.Shmuel Rosner is the political editor at The Jewish Journal, a senior fellow at the Jewish People Policy Institute and a contributing opinion writer.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Novel Tells the Story of a Family Who Lost Everything", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In The early chapters of his second novel, \u201cArk,\u201d Julian Tepper introduces three generations of the once-wealthy Arkin family through a series of phone calls that shift perspective from one speaker to another to another. It\u2019s an efficient and notably cinematic technique: One may recall the introduction of the grown-up children in Wes Anderson\u2019s film \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums,\u201d which also uses correspondence to usher each character onscreen. (This could explain why the book jacket explicitly aligns \u201cArk\u201d with Anderson\u2019s work.) But in a novel, cinematic methods and the omniscient narration necessary to pull them off can lead to little hiccups of confusion, as when we first meet Rebecca Arkin, the nearest thing the book has to a protagonist: \u201cRebecca was in the middle of lunch. The man keeping her company was Randy Nobel, her colleague at the firm.\u201d If this were a movie, the audience, having seen \u201cthe man keeping her company,\u201d would of course implicitly understand to whom the narrator is referring \u2014 but a novel has no such visual cue, so when \u201cthe man\u201d is mentioned here, I went back just to make sure he hadn\u2019t been brought up previously.To be sure, Tepper has good reasons to rely on Hollywood devices, the primary one being the sheer number of characters populating this relatively short work. There\u2019s Ben Arkin, the artist-patriarch, who has assiduously worked for decades in his unrenovated loft on artwork that has never sold. There\u2019s Ben\u2019s long-\u00adsuffering wife, Eliza, who to add insult to injury must sell her mother\u2019s diamonds for the money to fight a lawsuit. Ben and Eliza\u2019s children \u2014 Doris, Oliver and Sondra (the last of whom is the one suing the family) \u2014 ran an unsuccessful record label their father repeatedly financed and are now all in various states of disrepair and dormancy. And then there is Oliver\u2019s daughter, Rebecca, the responsible lawyer trapped in the middle. Throw in Ben\u2019s assistant, Rebecca\u2019s mother, Oliver\u2019s new wife and sundry other \u00adspouses, employees and business relations of the Arkin clan, and you can see the need for some swift way to bring these people together. It\u2019s not hard to imagine the TV show \u201cArrested Development\u201d as another influence: Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything. .\u2008.\u2008. (In this reading, Rebecca is the Michael Bluth character just trying to hold it all together.)\u201cArk\u201d works better when it gets past the obligatory lineup of the dramatis personae and onto the more novelistic sections. An epistolary exchange between the exasperated Rebecca and her filmmaker mother, for instance, creates some of the most touching returns on the theme of lost fortunes. After relating the story of an agonized Ben lamenting that he\u2019s a \u201cpoor, poor man,\u201d Rebecca writes:\u201cCan you imagine a person who had firsthand experience of Depression-era poverty sitting in his multimillion dollar SoHo loft with his multimillion dollar house in the Hamptons just a short car ride away going on about how he was poor? What does that mean, Mom? It confuses and frightens me. There\u2019s some fundamental principle to money which I don\u2019t understand.\u201dAmid lawsuits and scuffles over inheritances, Rebecca\u2019s brief meditation provides a much needed window onto a reasonable, less privileged perspective, and the letter surprises with its comparative depth. Rebecca is the mass around which the whole novel orbits, its plausible center, even though she and her family see things in precisely opposite ways.Despite some early stumbles, \u201cArk\u201d is an engaging and entertaining novel, and an insightful take on just how easy it can be to slip from the upper class. Its characters are funny, too, in that offensive way we seem to forgive mainly in the rich or elderly. The wealthy, of course, have long gotten away with everything \u2014 but now, the novel suggests, with money dwindling and economies struggling, they\u2019ll finally get what they deserve: to be just like the rest of us.

{"Headline": "Cellphones, Not Banks, May Be Key to Finance in the Developing World", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The increasing digitization of finance, and the move away from cash, could add 6 percent to the annual economic output of the world\u2019s developing nations over the next 10 years, according to a new report from the McKinsey consulting firm\u2019s research arm.The report, released on Wednesday, says that developing nations \u2014 and to a lesser extent developed economies like the United States \u2014 lose enormous amounts of economic potential from the continuing reliance on cash and the difficulty many businesses and individuals encounter when trying to gain access to the financial system.The mobile phone, however, has provided a new and cheaper way to provide basic financial services to nearly everyone in the developing world.The 124-page report from the McKinsey Global Institute says that 80 percent of the people in the developing world currently have mobile phones, and by 2020 that will rise to 90 percent.A growing number of start-ups are already providing financial services through cellphones, often without a bank being involved. In Kenya, for instance, more than 70 percent of adults are using a digital money system known as M-Pesa that started less than a decade ago.Susan Lund, one of the co-authors of the McKinsey report, said that as her team crunched the numbers on the impact of digital finance, even she was surprised by the impact it could have on the broader economy \u2014 some $3.7 trillion in additional annual economic activity by 2025.\u201cI thought this was about financial services,\u201d Ms. Lund said. \u201cI now think of this more like basic infrastructure for a modern economy, as opposed to just something that banks do.\u201dAny effort to provide more financial services to the developing world is likely to encounter both resistance and skepticism, given the somewhat spotty record of past financial projects aimed at helping the poor.The flow of financial investments into emerging economies has, in the past, played into currency and financial crises around the world.In the more recent past, elite institutions like McKinsey have also promoted the use of microlending in the developing world, which was aimed at bringing people out of poverty by giving them credit.Ms. Lund acknowledged the lackluster results from microlending. She said that the economic growth projected by McKinsey did not rely much on expanded credit to individuals.Instead, she said, most of the opportunity comes from the transition to digital payments from cash, which can significantly increase productivity and open up a whole set of economic opportunities that aren\u2019t available when people rely on cash.The McKinsey report said that for individuals, the average cash transfer can require three or four hours in developing countries, because of the time required to travel to, and wait at, a financial institution.For businesses and governments, reliance on cash leads to lost time, the \u201cleakage\u201d of money \u2014 read theft \u2014 and missed opportunities to transact with the broader world.Moving countries away from cash has been hard because it has required the addition of new and expensive physical facilities and bank branches. But with the spread of mobile phones, providing financial services costs 80 to 90 percent less, the McKinsey report says.In Kenya, for instance, people who used to rely on cash and services like Western Union can now send money to relatives across the country using M-Pesa.Economists have recently begun to highlight the broader economic benefits of this sort of transition.Once people move to digital money, companies can also do so more easily and governments can distribute funds electronically, leading to less corruption and missing money.With money in a digital account, saving money and planning for the future also becomes easier.The research on these topics has turned financial inclusion and innovation into one of the big priorities at Bill Gates\u2019s family foundation.Perhaps the biggest question facing efforts like those of the Gates Foundation is how hard it will be to spread technology like M-Pesa to other countries.There are many efforts to replicate M-Pesa elsewhere in Africa and Asia, but most of them have been somewhat slow to take off.India is currently in the midst of a large effort to move individuals into electronic financial accounts.Ms. Lund said that in addition to having mobile phones, countries need regulations that allow for the development of new financial technology and start-ups that address the existing landscape. Any new efforts will also face resistance from the existing financial players in developing countries.But Ms. Lund noted that the most expensive requirement for moving forward, the mobile networks, are now in place.\u201cThere are a lot of pieces that have to come together. It\u2019s not so easy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike building roads and ports \u2014 at least the hard infrastructure is in place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Rough Rider", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 To those who concede that the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, is not entirely prepared for the presidency but argue that he would \u2014 of course! \u2014 surround himself with admirable advisers, I have one name for you: Sid Miller.Mr. Miller, at 61, is weathered, blue-eyed and beefy, a classic backslapping good ole West Texas boy. He favors a wide-brimmed, white-as-snow cowboy hat and pointed boots. A former Baptist, he is today an elder in the Cowboy Church of Erath County. The United States Calf Roping Association named him a world champion in 2004. You get the idea.The right-leaning Mr. Miller spent 12 years in the Texas House of Representatives. After losing his seat in 2012, he rose, phoenix-like, to be elected agriculture commissioner in 2014. The work of hard-rock musician Ted Nugent as his campaign treasurer certainly helped.Despite the obvious contrasts, the West Texas rodeo star and the New York real estate magnate may have more in common than you\u2019d think.You can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t share the largess with his staff. A newly elected commissioner, Mr. Miller didn\u2019t post all job openings among his staff and filled several positions with friends and campaign team members. And he gave out more in bonuses in his first nine months in office \u2014 $413,700 to 144 employees \u2014 than his predecessor had in more than two years. One person Mr. Miller hired, at $180,000 a year, has a conviction for abuse of campaign funds.Mr. Miller\u2019s own financial affairs have drawn scrutiny. The Dallas Morning News reported that he invested $97,000 of campaign contributions in stocks; then he used the proceeds to pay himself back for loans he\u2019d made to his campaign fund \u2014 without recording these transfers in his final campaign finance reports.In 2015, Mr. Miller used campaign funds to travel to Mississippi for a rodeo. In another case that year, Mr. Miller took a taxpayer-funded trip that he said was to visit lawmakers in Oklahoma, but was also to visit a practitioner known as Dr. Mike for an injection known as the \u201cJesus shot\u201d that supposedly takes away pain for life.Mr. Miller and Mr. Trump also share an aversion to \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d\u201cIf one more person says \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 to me I just might slap them,\u201d he wrote on Facebook last December. \u201cEither tell me \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 or just don\u2019t say anything.\u201dAs agriculture commissioner, he created the \u201ccupcake amnesty\u201d to defend parents\u2019 right to send their kids to school with sugary confections. He also welcomed deep fryers and soft drinks back to Texas schools, where they had been banned for a decade because of soaring obesity rates.\u201cWe\u2019ve been raising big, strapping, healthy young kids here in Texas nearly 200 years,\u201d Mr. Miller declared. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t need Washington, D.C., telling us how to do it.\u201dMr. Miller was also the author of a Texas House bill requiring women to have a sonogram 24 hours before an abortion and to listen to the fetal heartbeat, accompanied by a doctor\u2019s narration: an approach that some people, like Mr. Trump, might welcome as a \u201cpunishment\u201d for women seeking abortions.And like Mr. Trump, Mr. Miller believes that Muslims belong anywhere but here. One of his Facebook posts suggested we make peace with the Muslim world as we did with Japan \u2014 by using the atomic bomb. In another post, Mr. Miller likened Syrian refugees to rattlesnakes.This is not a guy who is going to raise a stink about building a wall on the southern border \u2014 he\u2019s more likely to lasso illegal crossers with his own rope. Paid for by his campaign contributors, of course.Mimi Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

The Affleck character, we gradually learn, used to be married to a woman played by Michelle Williams, with whom he shares a heartbreaking burden. A scene they have together near the end is almost shattering. \u201cIt was a hard, hard movie to make,\u201d Mr. Affleck recalled recently. \u201cThough the character seems sort of shut down and muted, it never felt that way. It felt like living in a terrible, painful place.\u201d But he added that as soon as he read the script, he knew he wanted the part. \u201cI\u2019m usually pretty tortured about choosing projects,\u201d he said, \u201cand usually when I read a script I like to think about it for a while. But when I read this, there was no question.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a North Shore guy,\u201d Mr. Lonergan said, referring to the Manchester region. \u201cThat was part of the appeal and also part of the challenge.\u201d He spent a lot of time in the area, studying and listening to the local people and educating himself as he went along. He has always been a sort of self-taught filmmaker, he added, and got into the business more or less accidentally. \u201cI started out wanting to be a playwright, and I still want to be a playwright,\u201d he said and then stopped himself. \u201cI want to continue being a playwright, I guess is what I mean.\u201d\u201cIf they see you\u2019ve written a comedy script, they figure you as a comedy writer,\u201d he went on. \u201cThey\u2019re very nervous; they have to protect their jobs, so they can\u2019t lose by saying no.\u201dIt was only while working on \u201cYou Can Count on Me\u201d that Mr. Lonergan, who is now known for the almost painterly quality of his films, began to worry about what his movie was supposed to look like. \u201cEven the word style made me feel really anxious,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s your style?\u2019 I don\u2019t know.\u201d On the advice of some cinematographer friends, he began watching a lot of movies and cribbing from ones he loved: \u201cFive Easy Pieces,\u201d \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d \u201cThe Best Years of Our Lives.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where I started, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I think much more visually from the beginning.\u201dOne habit Mr. Lonergan has carried over from the theater is rehearsal, and for \u201cManchester\u201d the actors sat around a table and went over their parts for almost two weeks, which is highly unusual \u2014 actors tend to be very tightly scheduled. \u201cYou sometimes feel a little silly,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you\u2019re talking about and rehearsing scenes you\u2019re not going to shoot for another month, and so you don\u2019t know how specific and general to be. But it\u2019s still extremely valuable. I can\u2019t imagine doing a movie like this without it.\u201d He added: \u201cSidney Lumet used to rehearse all his movies for five weeks, just like for a play. Not that I\u2019m comparing myself to Sidney Lumet by any means.\u201dMr. Affleck said, \u201cI haven\u2019t always been someone who likes doing much rehearsal, but I\u2019m really glad we did it on this.\u201d Among other things, the extra time allowed him and Mr. Lonergan to work out their different ideas about his character, including his broad New England accent, which Mr. Affleck, though a Boston native, initially resisted.Ms. Williams said that out of respect for Mr. Lonergan she overprepared. \u201cIn theater, words are primary,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing as important as what the character says next. Often in movies that\u2019s not really the case, except in a Lonergan film, because he wrote those words. He\u2019s actually quite specific in sticking to the script, as he should be.\u201dShe worked hard on her accent, which she found difficult at first, and to get a better sense of what North Shore women were like, she even took to hanging around schools in the morning, watching moms drop off their kids. But she still hadn\u2019t seen the finished movie, she confessed. \u201cI sort of don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I feel I have too high expectations.\u201dMr. Affleck said: \u201cAs a community of filmmakers, we have a long way to go in making up to Kenny and giving him his due. He\u2019s been given an enormous amount of grief. This movie wasn\u2019t easy, but they don\u2019t make movies like this anymore. If it was all just run-of-the-mill multiplex stuff, it would be a joyless and draining industry. But when you have someone like Kenny, who can write stuff like this, it just reinvigorates everyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lobbyist Wrote the Bill. Will the Tobacco Industry Win Its E-Cigarette Fight?", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The e-cigarette and cigar industries have enlisted high-profile lobbyists and influential congressional allies in an attempt to stop the Food and Drug Administration from retroactively examining their products for public health risks or banning them from the market.The campaign targets a broad new rule that extends F.D.A. jurisdiction to include cigars, e-cigarettes and pipe and hookah tobacco.The bipartisan effort has featured a former senator who did not register as a lobbyist before going to work for the cigar companies and a former Obama administration official, now a private consultant, who is trying to undo his earlier work reviewing the rule. In addition, one member of Congress introduced industry-written legislation without changing a word of it.With its army of more than 75 lobbyists, tobacco-aligned companies have argued that the F.D.A.\u2019s so-called Deeming Rule could hurt public health by forcing a large share of e-cigarette companies out of business.The lobbying effort has been led by the Altria Group, the nation\u2019s largest tobacco company, which has a growing e-cigarette unit.Documents obtained by The New York Times show that Altria last year distributed draft legislation on Capitol Hill that would eliminate the new requirement that most e-cigarettes already on sale in the United States be evaluated retroactively to determine if they are \u201cappropriate for the protection of public health.\u201dA quick breakdown of the players and products involved in Big Tobacco's latest fight.The proposal was endorsed by the R.J.

Deeming Clarification Act of 2015,\u201d to Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma in April 2015, the documents show, even before the F.D.A. rule became final.Just two weeks later, Mr. Cole, a Republican, introduced the bill \u2014 with the title and 245-word text pulled verbatim from the industry\u2019s draft.\u201cYes, we have shared our views with many policy makers, including Congressman Cole\u2019s office,\u201d David Sutton, a spokesman for Altria, said in a written statement, after being presented with a copy of its \u201clegislative language\u201d draft and Mr. Cole\u2019s resulting bill, which has 71 co-sponsors and is still pending in the House.Separately, former Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, spent part of her first year after losing re-election pressing officials from the White House, State Department and F.D.A. on behalf of the cigar industry \u2014 even though records show she had not registered as a lobbyist as required by federal law, which Ms. Landrieu said was an oversight.\u201cThis is my fault,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m calling my lawyer now to get it corrected.\u201dMr. Cole, and Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr., Democrat of Georgia, who co-sponsored one of the tobacco-related measures originally drafted by Altria, said that the rule would bankrupt small businesses and curb the availability of e-cigarette options, which some use as a way to quit smoking.\u201cI don\u2019t like regulating in the rearview mirror,\u201d Mr. Cole said in an interview.Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said it was embarrassing that more than 70 lawmakers had signed on as co-sponsors of legislation that lobbyists from Altria and other industry groups originally wrote.\u201cFor Congress to consider going backward in how we regulate the public health hazard is simply mind-boggling,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that tobacco companies were telling the public that cigarettes were not addictive and denying clear evidence that they caused cancer.\u201dIndustry executives and their allies on Capitol Hill dismiss such criticism, noting that they support provisions intended to prevent youths from buying and using e-cigarettes or cigars.\u201cThe argument that it would make it more accessible to children is fallacious,\u201d Mr. Bishop said.The cigar industry lobbying pitch has gained the most traction in Congress.The e-cigarette and cigar industries, backed up by dozens of lobbyists, are engaged in an intense fight on Capitol Hill to roll back a new rule that for the first time subjects them to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. Here is a inside look at this fight, with lobbying documents that rarely become public.Mr. Reid, records show, contacted the White House on the industry\u2019s behalf, with his spokeswoman explaining that cigar-oriented events are important to Las Vegas.Mr. Walsh and his lobbying partners from the firm K & L Gates drafted language that was inserted into a House Appropriations bill approved by the full committee in April that defines an exemption for a premium cigar and that would prohibit the F.D.A. from spending money in the 2017 fiscal year on enforcement provisions.\u201cMy fingers are crossed,\u201d Mr. Walsh said, about the prospects for getting the exemption.White House records show that he helped represent the Obama administration at more than a dozen meetings with outside parties, mostly pressing the government to ease the rule, before he was hired by a cigar-industry trade organization and by NJoy, a manufacturer of e-cigarettes.Within less than a year, records show, Mr. Perraut was back at the Office of Management and Budget on the other side of the table.Because Mr. Perraut was not a senior official and the regulation affects numerous industry players, federal revolving door rules did not apply, an agency spokeswoman said. Mr. Perraut said he was simply trying to help stop a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d that will be caused by the F.D.A. overreach.Richard W. Painter, who served as the White House chief ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, said Mr. Perraut\u2019s quick turnabout violated the spirit of President Obama\u2019s ethics pledge, intended to prevent former aides from lobbying the executive branch.\u201cEven if it is not prohibited, it is just not appropriate,\u201d he said.Interest groups attempting to shape the debate also have financial patrons with a clear stake in the outcome.Jeff Stier, a scholar at the National Center for Public Policy Research, and Grover Norquist, from Americans for Tax Reform, both said they opposed the F.D.A. rule as bad policy.The American Lung Association, which has spoken out in defense of the rule, accepts contributions from pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, which sell smoking-cessation products that could lose sales if e-cigarettes continue to gain market share, Mr. Stier added.Erika Sward, an association lobbyist, while acknowledging the money her nonprofit group has received from companies that sell smoking-cessation treatments, said the criticism of her group is a diversionary tactic.\u201cFor so many years the focus in fighting tobacco wars has been on the cigarette industry,\u201d she said. \u201cWith historic declines in cigarette use, which is wonderful, what we are seeing is a surge in use in other tobacco products. And their push on Capitol Hill reflects this new clout.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At the front of the 0.39-acre oceanfront lot, a circular gravel driveway wraps a center island with river rocks surrounding a garden.The 7,848-square-foot house has an outdoor corridor running from the portico through the first level of the four-bedroom three-bath house to a pool terrace overlooking a 109-foot beach. The first level is elevated three feet to protect it from storm surges, said Naomi Anderson, an agent at Belize Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which has the listing.A door in the corridor opens to a foyer on the first level with painted concrete ceiling beams. Creamy marble floors are throughout the house.A staircase with granite treads and stainless-steel railings leads up to the main entertaining level, which has an open floor plan, high ceilings and large windows. Two sets of double doors open to a wraparound balcony with a covered outdoor dining area.

The balcony overhang provides shade at one end of the terrace.MARKET OVERVIEW The 2008 global recession \u201chad a ripple impact on the entire Caribbean, and Belize was not exempt,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. Many condominiums and resorts being planned in Placencia were stalled.In the last five years, however, new investors and individual buyers have breathed \u201cnew life\u201d into the peninsula, which has about 2,500 full-time residents. \u201cThe pace of development has picked up,\u201d she said, with some 20 single-family homes under construction in an eight-mile radius and resort communities experiencing a growth spurt.While beachfront property is \u201cappreciating at a good pace,\u201d it is still less pricey than the more developed Ambergris Caye farther north in Belize, a popular second-home and retirement market for expatriates.Since early 2014, resales of existing beachfront houses in Placencia have risen 15 percent to 20 percent. New homes and condominiums and vacant beachfront lots make up the bulk of sales, Ms. Anderson said.Charmaine Voss, the managing director of Coldwell Banker Belize, said the Central American nation, formerly British Honduras, is gaining popularity but is \u201cstill one of the most affordable places when you are looking at Caribbean real estate.\u201dAt Itz\u2019ana, half the 66 turnkey waterfront residences are under contract, with occupancy beginning in March, said Colin Hannan, a partner in the Foundry Collective, the developer and hospitality firm that is building and running Itz\u2019ana.Prices range from $325,000 for a one-bedroom cottage with solar panels to around $1.035 million for a three-bedroom beachfront villa.The developer chose Placencia \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t have lots of high-rises and development,\u201d Mr. Hannan said.At the Placencia Hotel and Residences, about 45 waterfront homes with docks are completed, five are under construction and 156 lots remain, said Madeleine Lomont, head of real estate sales. Prices range from $368,000 to $1.2 million. Another 1,500 residences and a hotel are planned around the Placencia\u2019s 18-hole Robert Trent Jones golf course, now under construction. A casino opened in May; a Marina Village, with shops, restaurants, music venues and condominiums, is also under construction. A 200-slip marina is partly finished, and the developer is also building an airport, expected to open in a year and a half.WHO BUYS IN PLACENCIACanadian purchases slowed in the last year, while the number of home buyers from the United States increased, Ms. Anderson said.A sizable number of retirees come to Belize, a former British colony, from Britain, said Ryan Wrobel, a lawyer and notary public in Belize City. He also has clients from Norway, Germany and Austria.American buyers at the Itz\u2019ana Resort and Residences have come from California, Colorado, Texas and the New York metropolitan area, said Bryant McClain, the director of sales and marketing.BUYING BASICSForeign ownership of real estate in Belize requires \u201cno special hoops to be jumped through,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said. To entice retirees, household goods can be imported tax-free.Real estate transactions are \u201cfully transparent,\u201d with \u201cprocedures and regulations in place to protect our jurisdiction against money laundering,\u201d Mr. Wrobel said.A lawyer based in Belize is \u201chighly recommended\u201d for international buyers, he said.Legal fees range from 2 percent to 4 percent of the sales price. A transfer tax is 5 percent of the purchase price or assessed value, whichever is higher, with the first $10,000 exempt from taxation.Lots and new residential construction are subject to a general sales tax of 12.5 percent for the first owners, Mr. Wrobel said.Most transactions are cash. Financing from local banks is limited to 40 percent to 60 percent of the purchase price, and \u201cinterest rates would be higher than what a potential buyer would be used to in North America,\u201d he added.

{"Headline": "Shariah With Chinese Characteristics: A Scholar Looks at the Muslim Hui", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySinosphereHow should we understand the statistics on Muslims in China? Officially there are 23 million, but this assumes that Islam is an ethnicity, and that all Hui, or all Uighurs, must be Muslim. It\u2019s a problematic issue because it\u2019s an ethnic category that is used to define members of a religion. Hence, it can be both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. For the former, Muslims outside of China may not consider every Hui to be a Muslim. Many Hui are very pious. They attend mosque regularly and go to the hajj. And then there are people who say they\u2019re Hui, meaning they just don\u2019t eat pork. For the latter, it\u2019s possible that some Chinese citizens who are ethnically Han [the dominant ethnic group in China] or Tibetan are, in fact, Muslims. It\u2019s a very loose category.How about converts to Islam? Can one change one\u2019s legal ethnicity? There are converts, for sure. The motivations are interesting. I met a Han laborer who worked on the railway. He had injured his arm and did not receive benefits. He became disaffected and found solace in Islam. He was also looking for a wife. Poor Han men sometimes convert if they\u2019re looking for a wife, because there are Hui networks that will help out. Hui will help you convert and marry. But changing one\u2019s ethnic identity, officially, is very difficult. It can happen, but it\u2019s hard.One sees in China a huge spiritual hunger and need for traditional values, which some find in religion. Is Islam part of this religious revival? Absolutely. The vacuum created by the end of Maoism has led to a commercialization of Chinese society that is in its own way spiritually void. There\u2019s no question that people are searching for meaning. What\u2019s really important is that some people are doing it through Islam. These are people who were born Hui but not part of that spiritual tradition, and who are returning to it. They find a group of fellow believers and discover strength in that community. Many of these people travel to places like Linxia and study Islam for the first time in their lives.You report that China had 20,000 mosques in 1994 and 34,000 in 2010. That seems like solid evidence for a growth in the religion. The region from Lanzhou to Linxia is often called the Quran belt. When you\u2019re on the highway, it\u2019s impossible to go a minute without seeing a new mosque under construction. What\u2019s driving this is an accumulation of wealth, and people are willing to allocate some of it, because they see mosques as a center of their community. It\u2019s not just where people pray or study but also where they socialize and share news and gossip.Is this government-financed? Almost none of it. Almost all comes from donations. Donors are businesspeople using the money they\u2019ve saved to benefit their communities.What about overseas donations? In the West, many big mosques are financed by the Saudis or Gulf states.That rarely happens in China. The government keeps tight control over this. They don\u2019t want to have these sorts of ties overseas.Is there any international dimension to Islam\u2019s revival? The revival has two aspects. One is almost always personal: a marriage that didn\u2019t work out, or interfamilial strife. And then they learn about larger phenomena through translated texts, social media or on-the-ground missionary activity. Saudi Arabia is a natural pole star. Egypt has major pull given its academic institutions and religious scholars. Missionary work increasingly comes from the Dawa movement. These activists are primarily from South Asia. The idea is that Muslims should return to the pious behavior of the Prophet Muhammad. This can mean a variety of things, from daily prayer to rejecting chopsticks in favor of eating with one\u2019s hands. These people interact with the Hui trying to find themselves. That\u2019s where the rekindling occurs.Some of this seems to parallel Christianity\u2019s rise in China. It also benefits from overseas missionary ties.True, but Islam is different in that you have this global discourse on terrorism, which is oppressive and limits the capacity of Muslims inside China to interact with Muslims outside of China. Islam is so politicized that it\u2019s quite different.Does that hamper Islam\u2019s ability to function as a force for soft power? China makes much of the fact that it is the world\u2019s biggest Buddhist nation. Couldn\u2019t it also win friends in Central Asia or the Middle East by pointing to its vibrant Muslim population? There\u2019s no doubt that the state looks at Islam in a different way than it does Taoism or Buddhism. It makes it hard for them to participate in even a nationalistic revival \u2014 even slogans of Xi Jinping, such as the Yidai Yilu [the One Belt, One Road initiative to link China to Central Asia and South Asia through overland and sea routes]. I was in China this summer and everyone was talking about it, but the question is if Muslims can participate in this. That would be good for the state, but the anxieties are great, too.Your book has rich descriptions of Linxia, a dry, remote city with so much religious life. It\u2019s the base of Islam in the northwest. Muslims have built mosques and prayed there since at least the 14th century. Some say certain Muslim tombs there date to the Tang dynasty. That\u2019s hard to prove, but it shows how important it is. It\u2019s a place where Islam took hold.Your book challenges the idea that the Hui are the \u201cgood\u201d Muslims, while the Uighurs are the \u201cbad\u201d ones, engaged in terrorism. The Hui have had numerous uprisings, most notably during the second half of the 19th century from Yunnan to Gansu and beyond. Not all of these were necessarily against the state. There were a number of local conflicts that often snowballed. They are not submissive lackeys of the state.You show this through the fascinating paradigm of Shariah. In the West, people often think of Shariah as a rigid Muslim legal system from the Middle Ages, with stoning and amputations. Here we see it as something alive and very flexible. What does it encompass?The parameters are wide, from dietary considerations to interpersonal relations. Some of it is deciding what is halal food. But it\u2019s also what we would call torts in the U.S. \u2014 when someone driving a vehicle strikes a pedestrian. A lot of time the authorities will ask the mosques to aid in evidence-gathering. We have a localized sense of Hui morality, that may be inflected with Shariah and that might affect the outcomes \u2014 the amount of the settlement, for example. The ahongs [Hui term for cleric] will help determine an amount.But this consultation has its limits.Definitely. It\u2019s not used in criminal law, where the state has the monopoly on using its own legitimated force. But in social relations, the Hui are part of this local dynamic \u2014 the clerical authority and the authority of the local state.This is a more pragmatic exercise of power than many might expect. The state realizes it needs the local clerics. If the state were to consciously exclude the local religious authorities, it would lose legitimacy in the eyes of the believers.Are Hui satisfied?There is a spectrum of opinions. They push for more autonomy and decision-making ability but are not always allowed to. In this, I think their struggles parallel those of Muslim minorities elsewhere \u2014 in France, Germany or the U.S. \u2014 but in China they do not have recourse to formal law, political institutions or even civil society. Rather, they rely on their ties to the government and increasingly transnational networks to protect their personal and collective interests.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The California Voter Ordeal: 17 Decisions on the Ballot", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Pity the California voter.Seventeen voter initiatives are on the state ballot in November, a glut of citizen-lawmaking that could, among other things, end the death penalty, legalize recreational marijuana, impose a tax surcharge on the wealthy and place limits on prescription drug costs.And considering that there really is no race for president in this overwhelmingly Democratic state, this is where the action is going to be through Election Day. By the time voters make it to the polls, analysts say, they are likely to have endured close to $100 million in television advertisements making the yea or nay case for these measures, usually framed in the most alarming sort of way.California is a state with a long tradition of making law at the ballot box, but the last time there were this many initiatives was 2000. And that does not even account for local initiatives like a Los Angeles County proposal to raise the sales tax to pay for mass transit or a soda tax in San Francisco.What follows is an attempt to counteract some of the confusion.California most certainly does have a Legislature, and because both houses are controlled by Democrats and Gov. Jerry Brown is a Democrat, it is arguably one of the most productive statehouses in the country.But the initiative process has been part of the political culture here since the rise of the Progressive movement in the last century. It was championed by Gov. Hiram Johnson, who served from 1911 to 1917, as a way for the average citizen to counteract the influence of business in Sacramento.Some of the most consequential legislation in this state\u2019s history has been enacted this way: most famously, Proposition 13, which put a cap on property tax increases and required a two-thirds vote by the Legislature to raise taxes.For anyone with money and political savvy, the ballot initiative has been an effective way to work around a balky Legislature. And the only way to change or repeal an initiative is to go back to voters.Mr. Steyer said he had turned to the voting booth because cigarette tax increases had failed 17 times in the Legislature, testimony to the clout of the tobacco industry (which has already raised more than $35 million to finance a campaign against the cigarette tax).One would think.But a few forces have converged to cram the ballot with initiatives. First, since it is a presidential election year, turnout is going to be higher, and in California, a bigger turnout means more Democrats at the polls. (Republicans are more consistent in their voting practices; they are more likely to vote, even in even off-year elections.) Initiatives like ending the death penalty, legalizing marijuana or raising taxes on the wealthy are all likely to find support from Democratic voters.And it was easier to get an initiative on the California ballot this year because fewer signatures were needed. Backers of an initiative must collect signatures from 5 percent of the number of voters who turned out in the last election for governor, which had a notably low turnout. There is an industry of petition signature gatherers, who can be spotted at the Santa Monica Farmers Market, and they are paid by the signature. That means it\u2019s relatively cheaper to get something on the ballot because not as many were needed.Besides the one legalizing marijuana and the one putting an end to the death penalty, there is one that would make it easier to execute someone by setting time limits on appeals. Democratic officials and unions are pushing to extend an income tax surcharge passed in 2012, widely credited for helping the state balance its books. Mr. Brown is backing an initiative that would make more nonviolent criminals eligible for parole.There is one that would impose background checks for people looking to buy ammunition. There is also a vote to ratify or nullify legislation passed that banned plastic bags, and one requiring performers in pornographic films to use condoms during sex scenes.Well, it could take some time and patience. How are backers, and opponents, of these measures going to get a hearing in this din?Ms. Kaufman\u2019s marijuana initiative is tucked away on the 64th line on the ballot.Well, for anyone frustrated by the Legislature \u2014 which has been criticized at times for being too close to business and energy interests \u2014 this is, at least in theory, a powerful tool to give ordinary citizens a voice in the way the state is run. Still, with the cost and complexity of getting an initiative on the ballot and passed these days, it might be hard to still consider this progressivism at its best.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Sudan Leaders Amass Great Wealth as Nation Suffers, Report Says", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe families and top associates of the principal opponents in the conflict, President Salva Kiir and his rival and former vice president, Riek Machar, own multimillion-dollar properties, drive luxury cars and stay at expensive hotels, \u201call while much of their country\u2019s population suffers from the consequences of a brutal civil war and, in many places, experiences near-famine conditions,\u201d according to the report.Neither of the two men nor members of their immediate families are among the half-dozen South Sudanese officials facing the international sanctions imposed last year. But the report said the leaders had \u201cbenefited financially from the continuing war and have effectively ensured that there is no accountability for their human rights violations and financial crimes.\u201dThe report appeared to be the first to draw a direct causal link between public corruption and armed conflict in South Sudan, the world\u2019s youngest country. Tens of thousands have been killed there, mass rape has been used as a weapon, more than two million civilians have been uprooted, and more than five million \u2014 almost half the population \u2014 require food aid.Contrary to perceptions that the conflict is rooted in an ethnically tinged feud between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar that first erupted in 2013, the report said, the real struggle is over control of the country\u2019s vast mineral and oil resources.\u201cThe leaders of South Sudan\u2019s warring parties manipulate and exploit ethnic divisions in order to drum up support for a conflict that serves the interests only of the top leaders of these two kleptocratic networks,\u201d the report said.The report was the first major project by the Sentry, whose partners have focused on the financial connections to endemic conflicts in some of Africa\u2019s most troubled places, including Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.The group\u2019s founders are the actor George Clooney and John Prendergast, a rights activist and former United States government official. Both have long called for stronger laws to thwart the financing of conflicts in Africa.In a telephone interview before the report\u2019s release, Mr. Prendergast said the group had decided to make South Sudan its first priority \u201cbecause it is such a political hot potato right now.\u201dAfter the war in Syria, South Sudan is considered the most urgent humanitarian emergency confronting the United Nations.While it is not uncommon for political elites to exploit power for personal gain, Mr. Prendergast said South Sudan stood out. He said he had been struck by an attitude of impunity among the South Sudanese who have enriched themselves.He expressed hope that the report would serve as a \u201cvulnerability map\u201d that led to legal action against those identified, as well as a warning to international banks and other institutions that do business with South Sudan.The report found that members of the families of both Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar live in \u201cluxurious homes\u201d outside South Sudan, including residences in an upscale neighborhood in Nairobi, Kenya.The report said the chief of staff of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army, Gen. Paul Malong Awan, who officially makes about $45,000 a year, owns at least two luxurious villas in Uganda and a $2 million mansion in a gated community in Nairobi.One of the general\u2019s Ugandan residences, the report said, is next door to a home maintained by Gen. Gabriel Jok Riak, a South Sudanese military commander who is among six South Sudanese placed on a Security Council sanctions list last year. That step should have frozen his assets and prevented him from traveling outside South Sudan.Other findings showed that Mr. Kiir\u2019s wife, his brother-in-law and at least seven of his children, including a 12-year-old son, had stakes in \u201ca wide range of business ventures\u201d in South Sudan that suggested nepotism and corruption in violation of the country\u2019s laws.The report was released amid other signs of international frustration with South Sudanese leaders, particularly by the United States, which had high hopes for the country after it achieved independence in 2011.On Friday, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, who helped lead a Security Council delegation to South Sudan the previous weekend to assess the crisis, expressed outrage that the South Sudanese government had threatened people who had talked to the delegation.Somini Sengupta contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s \u2018Deplorable\u2019 About Presidential Campaigns", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIt\u2019s hard to believe now, but there was a time in American politics, not so long ago, when a presidential candidate might hold only a few fund-raisers, when a serving president \u2014 Ronald Reagan, for example \u2014 might refuse to appear at any fund-raisers at all for his own re-election campaign. That was back before wily political operatives, and then the Supreme Court, opened the floodgates to cash, and candidates began holding fund-raisers by the score.And as candidates spent more and more time cocooned with their wealthiest supporters, who were often also among their most ideological supporters, they made themselves vulnerable to a particular kind of influence. Not just the kind journalists are ever on the watch for \u2014 the classic quid pro quo \u2014 but a more subtle form, a cultural form that tends to be heard and not seen.We heard it in 1995, when, running for re-election, President Bill Clinton delighted donors in Houston by saying: \u201cProbably there are people in this room still mad at me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too much, too.\u201d Congressional Democrats who put their careers on the line to pass that tax increase were furious.We heard it again in 2008, when Barack Obama told donors in San Francisco that people struggling in Pennsylvania towns \u201ccling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren\u2019t like them.\u201dWe heard it when Mitt Romney told donors in Florida that \u201cthere are 47 percent of the people\u201d who \u201care dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims \u2026 my job is not to worry about those people.\u201dMrs. Clinton went on to point out that there are other Trump supporters \u201cwe have to understand and empathize with,\u201d people who are \u201cjust desperate for change.\u201d And she later expressed regret for her remarks. But real damage had been done. In wooing one group of voters \u2014 in reading some members of her elite audience, and reflecting their feelings back to them, and perhaps revealing her own \u2014 she had written off another one as \u201cirredeemable.\u201d This is what happens when candidates spend so much time in what F. Scott Fitzgerald called \u201cthe consoling proximity of millionaires.\u201dMr. Trump, a self-declared billionaire, has also been holding fund-raisers, despite saying in the primaries he would fund his own campaign. He is not letting the press listen in. Although one might wonder what Mr. Trump is telling people who have paid up to $250,000 to hear him, it is almost too painful to think about, given how offensive he is in public.Our campaigns have become so dependent on the wealthy that we are at risk of forgetting that there is any other way to do politics \u2014 and our candidates are at risk of forgetting whom they are running to represent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 van Gogh Paintings Stolen From Amsterdam Are Recovered in Italy", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey were retrieved during a huge and continuing investigation into organized crime by a specialized team in the Italian public prosecutions department, the museum said.\u201cThe paintings have been found!\u201d Axel R\u00fcger, director of the Van Gogh Museum, said in a statement released on Friday. \u201cThat I would be able to ever pronounce these words is something I had no longer dared to hope for.\u201dThe Italian prosecutors\u2019 office said that the works had been recovered during an investigation of the Amato Pagano clan of the Camorra Mafia family, which is associated with international cocaine trafficking.In January, Italian prosecutors issued arrest warrants for several members of the clan and for criminals associated with them in a drug ring with contacts in Spain and the Netherlands, the Naples prosecutor, Giovanni Colangelo, said in a telephone interview. At the same time, Italian financial police identified assets belonging to the clan \u2014 with an estimated value of 20 million euros, or about $22.5 million \u2014 that could be confiscated. Those included real estate, two companies, a plane and a boat.One of the gang members arrested in January told the police that the two paintings were in a house in the town of Castellammare di Stabia, near Naples. The house had at one time been occupied by Raffaele Imperiale, who Mr. Colangelo said was one of the leaders of the trafficking gang. (Mr. Imperiale is in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Colangelo said, and Italian authorities have asked for his extradition.)Lt. Col. Agostino Tortora, a financial police officer who worked on the case, said the paintings were found on Sunday afternoon, wrapped up in a cloth in a small hallway next to a kitchen.Investigations are underway to determine when the paintings had come into the possession of the clan, he said. \u201cWe know they were stolen in 2002, we don\u2019t know when they came here, or if they were stolen specifically for the Camorra, all that has to be investigated,\u201d Colonel Tortora said.Mr. Colangelo could not say whether the paintings were an investment for the mob. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me to say why they bought them, all I can say with certainty is that they were stolen,\u201d he said. He added that the paintings would be returned to the Netherlands, \u201ccompatibly with the time of the trial.\u201dIn a statement, prosecutors described the Amato Pagano clan as \u201cone of the most dangerous and active crime groups among the Camorra gangs of the territory.\u201dCol. Giovanni Salerno, the commander of the Naples financial police group that carried out the investigation, told Sky News on Friday that the Camorra families \u201cmade a fortune for these organizations, because the profits were enormous.\u201dThe Italian culture minister, Dario Franceschini, said in a statement on Friday that the investigation \u201cconfirmed how much criminal organizations are interested in works of art, which are used as a form of investment as well as a front of financing.\u201dAt the time of the crime, the estimated value of both works was 4 million euros, or about $4.5 million, according to Adriaan D\u00f6nszelmann, managing director of the Van Gogh Museum. He declined to comment on the possible value of the works today, because he said \u201cthey will not be traded.\u201dWhile works by van Gogh have sold for as much as $82.5 million at auction, pieces from his Hague period and of this style tend to sell for quite a bit less. In June 2015, Christie\u2019s in London sold a Hague-period van Gogh from 1882 for 2.3 million pounds, or about $3.7 million at the time. A landscape he painted in Nuenen sold at Sotheby\u2019s London in 2013 for \u00a31.3 million.Mr. D\u00f6nszelmann said in an interview that Italian police officials had contacted the museum on Tuesday and had asked if a specialist could travel to Italy to look at two paintings that had been recovered there. \u201cIt was absolutely exciting,\u201d he said.Arthur Brand, an independent Dutch art crimes investigator who has been following the case, said that only 5 percent to 10 percent of stolen art cases were ever solved.\u201cIn this case, they were most likely used in what we call \u2018art-napping\u2019 \u2014 the Mafia often steals work of art and uses them as a kind of payment within their own families,\u201d he said. \u201cOr if a boss is caught, he can sometimes make a deal for a lesser sentence in exchange for offering to help find stolen works of art.\u201dMr. Brand also said that it was known that the paintings had been circulating in the Dutch criminal underworld shortly after they were stolen, and were, at one point, offered to Cornelis van Hout, who was behind the kidnapping of the beer magnate Freddy Heineken. (Mr. van Hout did not buy them, and he was shot and killed shortly after, most likely for reasons unrelated to the paintings.)Both of the paintings were found without their frames and have suffered some damage. The paint on the bottom left corner of \u201cSeascape at Scheveningen\u201d has broken away, and \u201cReformed Church in Nuenen\u201d seems to have minor damage around the edges of the canvas, according to the news release. More examination of the works is needed to determine the extent of the damage.The significance of the works to the Van Gogh Museum comes from the subjects he painted: The Scheveningen painting is one of only two seascape paintings from the Hague period in the museum\u2019s collection. The church painting has personal emotional value, said Mr. D\u00f6nszelmann, because it depicts the church in Nuenen where van Gogh\u2019s father served as pastor. After his father\u2019s death, van Gogh added figures in mourning dress leaving the church, and he gave it as a gift to his mother.Nina Siegal reported from Amsterdam, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.Advertisement"}

Amazon has released a handful of casual games in the past, but these are its first PC games aimed at hard-core players.Amazon is appearing more sure-footed in the entertainment business. It is financing dozens of original television shows and movies, including Emmy winners like \u201cTransparent,\u201d which are available to subscribers through its Prime membership service.The company is wagering it can differentiate itself from the sea of games available online, partly by using Twitch in novel ways. Twitch is most commonly used by players to stream their game-playing sessions live over the internet. The service is also known for its raucous chat rooms that accompany live streams, allowing spectators to comment on the action on a video stream.\u201cThe Twitch community has already changed how games are experienced,\u201d Michael Frazzini, vice president of games at Amazon, said in a phone interview. \u201cWhat we think is next is to change how games are made.\u201dIn Amazon\u2019s new games, for example, there will be a capability called Matchbuilder that allows someone broadcasting a game-playing session on Twitch to pluck people directly from a chat room and allow them to play the next round of the game. Mr. Frazzini compared it to allowing spectators to play basketball with Michael Jordan after watching him take warm-up shots.Another capability will allow broadcasters to pull statistics about player performances out of Amazon\u2019s games and display them for Twitch viewers.The game pits two teams of four players as warriors and sorceresses. The other new offerings are New World, a multiplayer online game set in a desolate, hostile land, and Crucible, a survival game on an alien planet.Here is a Twitch broadcast from Thursday showing Breakaway:On Friday, Amazon also announced a set of gaming-related benefits called Twitch Prime for Amazon Prime subscribers.Anyone with an existing subscription to Prime, which costs $99 a year for an annual membership, can get the Twitch benefits by linking their Prime and Twitch accounts.\u201cIt\u2019s the first really deep integration between Amazon and Twitch,\u201d Mr. Shear said.Advertisement"}

You May Have to Ditch the Brown Shoes", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The right pair of oxfords can make or break a potential job candidate in staid investment banking circles in Britain, according to a report released on Thursday.Researchers at Royal Holloway, University of London, and the University of Birmingham found that some managers placed as much importance on whether a potential hire fit the traditional, polished image of an investment banker as on their skills and qualifications.\u201cIssues relating to dress may seem both superficial and relatively simple for individuals from all backgrounds to adopt,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, interviewees suggested that they do play a material role in the selection process, once again, as demonstration of \u2018fit.\u2019 \u201dThe researchers\u2019 findings came as a number of investment banks and professional services firms have adopted business casual as a dress code in recent years as a way to better connect with clients, who have dropped suits and ties as their standard uniforms.Social mobility is an important issue in Britain, where class and economic background can still play a part in how far a person advances.Investment banks, the report found, are making an effort to open front-office roles to applicants from nonprivileged backgrounds through outreach programs and other initiatives that focus on work experience, internships and skills training, but these remain \u201crelatively small scale.\u201dBankers in Britain are expected to be much more technically savvy than ever, but image remains a barrier if a job involves meeting clients on a regular basis, the report said.An ill-fitting suit, the wrong haircut or a lower-class accent can quickly eliminate a potential hire from corporate finance roles, according to the findings.As an example, the researchers found that wearing brown shoes with a business suit was generally considered unacceptable among British investment bankers, but a similar judgment did not apply to bankers from Continental Europe, where brown shoes were more commonplace.\u201cA further qualification is that some bankers in corporate finance may \u2018get away\u2019 with wearing brown shoes perhaps, for example, if they are sufficiently senior,\u201d the report said.Questions of dress code almost always concerned only male business attire, \u201cunderlining the strong association between investment banking and masculinity,\u201d the report said.It indicated that these subtle messages in dress are a way for individuals to signal their allegiance to \u201ctribes\u201d in the City of London, the traditional financial center of Britain, and to reassure colleagues of their willingness to fit in.Such hurdles can be disheartening to jobseekers.One candidate told researchers that his mentor had said that, while he had done well in an interview and was \u201cclearly quite sharp,\u201d he was not the right \u201cfit\u201d for the bank because he was not polished enough.\u201cHe looked at me and said: \u2018See that tie you\u2019re wearing? It\u2019s too loud. Like you can\u2019t wear that tie with the suit that you\u2019re wearing,\u2019 \u201d the unidentified candidate is quoted in the report as saying. He added, \u201cWhat kind of industry is this where I can be told that I\u2019m a good candidate, I\u2019m sharp, but I\u2019m not polished enough?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Close to Work in Midtown West", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntIn 2010, Andrew Warren, working in London for an American bank, was given a chance to transfer to Salt Lake City. He took it. There, at work, he met his wife-to-be, Ellada Arakelova.Ms. Arakelova, known as Lada, grew up in the former Soviet Union. As a teenager, she had immigrated with her family to Salt Lake City, where her parents had second cousins.The couple came to New York in two stages: She arrived first, landing a job (and a studio on the Upper East Side), and he followed a year later. Now in their 30s, they both work in finance. They married two years ago.At that time, they were renting a sunny but small one-bedroom in a Chelsea high-rise with a great view. They faced Avenue of the Americas, which \u201cwas like a highway for ambulances,\u201d Ms. Arakelova said.The couple began looking for a larger place a year ago. They preferred a two-bedroom in good condition in a prewar elevator co-op building convenient to Midtown.\u201cWe both came from thousands of miles away to be in New York, so we wanted to be in the middle of the action, rather than living on the outskirts or in the suburbs,\u201d Mr. Warren said. They aimed to keep the price under $1 million.A Midtown listing led them to Richard Rojas, a salesman at Compass real estate. That apartment required a gut renovation. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely for first-time home buyers to go for a property like that,\u201d Mr. Rojas said. But \u201cI knew they were determined. They were really serious about getting their first home.\u201dThe couple visited an attractive floor-through in a five-unit, five-story walk-up building on far West 85th Street. The asking price was $899,000, with a monthly maintenance charge of $1,050.The place was two flights up, and they knew that visiting parents and grandparents would struggle with that, and so would they, if they one day had a stroller to carry. But they liked the apartment so much, they felt the sacrifice was worth making. The couple offered $925,000, but when the place was bid up to $990,000 by several other parties, they didn\u2019t pursue it, because of the stairs.They headed to the East Side. \u201cI was kind of giddy to come back, because this was my starting point in New York,\u201d Ms. Arakelova said.A handsome two-bedroom with a dining room, on the top floor of a brick elevator building on East 91st Street in Carnegie Hill, was $985,000. Maintenance was nearly $1,800 a month. It included a full second bathroom, a luxury.Their offer of $995,000 was accepted. But they were upset to find the sellers had scheduled an open house. The couple had not received a contract, Mr. Rojas said; they didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.\u201cThat would not happen in England if you had a gentleman\u2019s agreement,\u201d Mr. Warren said.In the end, the apartment sold for the asking price, which was less than they had offered. \u201cThat was so frustrating,\u201d Ms. Arakelova said. \u201cIt was like a blow.\u201d Mr. Rojas said he was told the other party had stronger finances.They felt they couldn\u2019t compete for a two-bedroom without raising their price. So Mr. Warren sold his half of a house he owned in England. Their budget rose to something over $1 million.They went to Midtown West, within walking distance of their jobs. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a super-cute neighborhood, but it is convenient,\u201d Ms. Arakelova said.Mr. Rojas identified a few promising buildings there, then made phone calls and sent postcards to residents, letting them know he had a prospective buyer.The owners of a two-bedroom co-op in the West 50s bit; they had been planning to sell next spring anyway. The place had an ample 1,200 square feet, one and a half bathrooms, plenty of closets and a washer-dryer.A similar apartment in the same line had sold nearly a year ago for $1.3 million; that one was newly renovated and had two full bathrooms, Mr. Rojas said. He negotiated a price of $1.25 million; maintenance is just over $1,500 a month.Ms. Arakelova and Mr. Warren moved in this summer. Both are glad to avoid commuting on the crowded subways.The downside is the area\u2019s heavy traffic and nighttime noise. A nearby hotel is visited by a beeping, grinding sanitation truck twice a night, at 9 p.m. and again at 3 a.m.\u201cThe truck invites itself into the apartment,\u201d Mr. Warren said. The couple have ordered soundproof windows.In their Midtown West neighborhood, \u201cthere\u2019s always something going on,\u201d Mr. Warren said. \u201cEverything that\u2019s good about New York is at our fingertips.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U., Accused of Bias Against U.S. Companies, Opens Tax Inquiry Into French Utility", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union regulators stand accused of unfairly targeting American companies in a series of inquiries. So with the region\u2019s antitrust chief visiting the United States this week, the bloc\u2019s officials said on Monday that they were investigating whether a French company signed a sweetheart tax deal with Luxembourg.The inquiry into the French utility Engie is at an early stage and officials gave no estimates of the amount of taxes the company potentially owed. Still, the investigation could help Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, rebut allegations of bias as she begins her meetings in the United States on Monday.European authorities are also investigating Amazon, McDonald\u2019s and other companies in multiple areas. The move against Apple prompted anger in Washington, where officials said Ms. Vestager was too focused on American companies.Ricardo Cardoso, a spokesman for Ms. Vestager, told a news conference on Monday that the timing of the announcement was not related to her trip to the United States to meet with American officials, and that her investigations also involved many European companies.Last year, Ms. Vestager ordered Luxembourg to claim up to \u20ac30 million in taxes from a unit of the Italian carmaker Fiat. She has also ordered Belgium to recover significant sums of taxes from a number of companies including the brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, which is based in Leuven, Belgium.Even so, American companies are a major focus for Ms. Vestager.She has previously issued orders to the Netherlands to collect up to \u20ac30 million in taxes from Starbucks, and she still is investigating whether Luxembourg gave favorable tax treatment to McDonald\u2019s and Amazon.In the case of Engie, a utility formerly known as GDF Suez and which is part-owned by the French state, officials said Luxembourg may have given the company an \u201cunfair advantage over other companies.\u201dIn particular, the commission said transactions within the Engie group inside Luxembourg had allowed it to reduce its tax burden. That would be a violation of rules against unfair state aid to favored companies, it said.In a statement, the Luxembourg finance ministry said there had been \u201cno special tax treatment or selective advantage\u201d awarded to Engie.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Modern Housing With Village Virtues", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesWorking families in the United States have many struggles today: expensive child care, not enough time to cook healthy meals, disconnection from nature, a sense of social isolation \u2014 what the sociologist Robert Putnam famously called \u201cbowling alone\u201d \u2014 and more. Older Americans, a booming population, often end up segregated generationally and in dire need of care and companionship.What if there was a potential salve to all of these struggles? One that was introduced to Americans 25 years ago, but hasn\u2019t yet gone to scale?That potential solution is cohousing, a form of shared living in which groups of families with their own private homes (usually about 15 to 40 households) also share common spaces \u2014 a kitchen and eating area, often a garden, tool shed, or laundry facilities, or all of them, and a set of principles and practices about living interdependently.Since 2013, I have experienced the benefit and challenges of living in cohousing as a resident of Temescal Commons, an interfaith community in Oakland, Calif. The principles of these communities vary, depending on their size and type (urban vs. rural, religious vs. secular, intergenerational vs. over 65); still, most groups hold in common a belief that a high quality of life is achieved not through self-sufficiency, but through a village mentality. Families will often share meals, yard work and repair labor, sometimes even cars; they also help one another spontaneously in many other ways.Louise Dunlap, 78, has rented a studio apartment in a nine-unit cohousing community for the last six years. \u201cInterdependence,\u201d she says, \u201cgoes beyond turning the compost and fixing the washing machine. I get a chance to share meals and deep conversations. There\u2019s a kind of love that grows out of these connections \u2014 not romantic love, not family love, but something about our common humanity. I wish everyone could experience this.\u201dThe first distinctive cohousing community in America, Muir Commons, was built in Davis, Calif., in 1991 by the architects Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett, who became familiar with cohousing while studying architecture in Copenhagen in the 1980s. They have written an authoritative book on cohousing in America and today run their architectural firm, the Cohousing Company, from Nevada City, Calif.Europeans have been the pioneers in this particular form of shared living; there are more than 700 cohousing communities in Denmark alone. In comparison, according to the latest count done by the Cohousing Association of the United States, there are only 160 established in just 25 states across the country.So why have we been so slow to catch on?First, there\u2019s a lack of awareness. People often picture hippie communes when they hear \u201ccohousing.\u201d Alice Alexander, the executive director of the Cohousing Association, draws this distinction: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with communes, but cohousers actually value privacy and structure highly.\u201dAnother big hurdle is financing. When they set out in 2009 to create a 24-unit cohousing community in downtown Durham, N.C., Alexander and her co-founders were turned down by 10 institutions before getting a loan. The project didn\u2019t officially open until 2014.The problem, Alexander says, is that \u201cbanks have no mechanism set up to get a loan for a cohousing community to buy land or fund marketing so you can find your \u2018tribe.\u2019 \u201dTraditionally, many people who want to build a home finance the purchase of the land themselves and then use the property as collateral for a building loan. But if you\u2019re buying the larger piece of land necessary to build a comprehensive cohousing community, the cost can be prohibitive. Alexander says that National Cooperative Bank is on the cutting edge of trying to figure out new mechanisms, but it\u2019s slow going. Cohousing communities are typically structured and incorporated as homeowner associations, condo associations or housing cooperatives.But there are alternatives to building from the ground up. More recently, people have been gravitating toward what is called \u201cretrofit cohousing,\u201d in which neighbors transform an existing neighborhood over time. There are 11 retrofit cohousing communities operating in the United States today, and more in development, according to the Cohousing Association.Americans\u2019 interest in cohousing is growing. The Cohousing Association knows of 120 communities currently in formation. The 2015 National Cohousing Conference was the largest yet, and dozens of architectural firms and real estate developers have specialized in working on these types of communities. At Alexander\u2019s community alone, 300 people are on a waiting list.According to Alexander, aging baby boomers are driving the expansion; many want to downsize and find supportive communities. Additionally, millennials, many of whom experienced co-op living in college, are just starting their families. They are accustomed to a sharing economy that subscribes to many of cohousing\u2019s principles and practices.For some, the many benefits of cohousing make the challenges of creating or finding such a community feel worth it. In expensive cities, it can be cost-effective and stimulating, intellectually and emotionally, to share regular meals in a group. Rather than depending on the nuclear family unit to meet all emotional needs, cohousing participants have a wide range of people to talk to.Cohousing also can provide a safety net at times of natural disasters like heat waves or hurricanes. Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist, has found that the tight-knit bonds that are formed set these neighborhoods apart \u2014 more so, even, than money or preparedness \u2014 in effectively surviving such calamities.As a result, Petaluma Avenue Homes, as it\u2019s called, has had a mix of people, some of whom love the cohousing aspect, and some of whom are understandably lukewarm to the experience, quite possibly because they\u2019ve been subjected to the obligatory bureaucratic requirements and vetting often required of the poor by government agencies.Nevertheless, Friedland retains faith in the concept. \u201cDevelopers, architects, builders, we could all learn from the design principles of cohousing \u2014 the common house, moving the parking out of the central space, having the front porches, the centrality of the gardening. All of these are based on human experience and a balance of privacy and connectivity.\u201dOf course another formidable hurdle is how difficult it is to predict the dynamics of a complex group. Many cohousing communities fall apart early on because they fail to agree on principles, practices and finances.\u201cLife together hasn\u2019t been a Cinderella story,\u201d Kate Madden Yee, a founding member of Temescal Commons Cohousing, has written. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, hanging in there with one\u2019s fellow cohousers, despite disagreements, disappointments and disillusionment. Yet therein lies the reward: In our time together, my neighbors and I have learned a thing or two about how to not only create, but negotiate our common life with more ease and compassion.\u201dTwenty-five years in, although the experiment is still small scale, it has yielded a generation of Americans who grew up in cohousing. Many are evangelical about the ways in which the experience has shaped who they are.Ravenna Koenig, now 26, grew up in Vashon Island Cohousing in Washington. \u201cIt taught me communication,\u201d she says, \u201cnot just as a tool, but as a value. When you share your home with 17 other families, all those conversations that you\u2019d normally just have with your spouse or your kids \u2014 about what to do when two kids from different families get in a fight, or whether to prioritize filling potholes or weeding the garden first \u2014 those conversations become much bigger. You have to learn how to articulate what you want, and empathize harder than you ever thought you could.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Starts $5 Million Fund for Women in Film and Theater", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs part of the new initiative, the office will create a $5 million fund for female film- and theater-makers, administered over five years, to help them complete projects that are \u201cby, for, or about women,\u201d Ms. Menin said. The initiative will also sponsor sessions for directors to hone their story pitches, as well as connect them with financiers because, Ms. Menin said, research shows that financing is a major hurdle for female filmmakers.The city office, which recently expanded to cover more creative fields, including advertising, digital distribution and music, was traditionally used to promote the TV and film industry in New York. Local production is already at an all-time high, Ms. Menin said; there were 336 films shot in the city in 2015, compared with 242 in 2014, and 52 episodic prime time TV shows. \u201cWe believe we have a responsibility as an office to focus on other initiatives, such as diversity and inclusion, and so that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. The initiative will also include a research study comparing the career paths of female and male directors nationwide, which Ms. Menin hoped would identify other ways her agency could help.The TV and film businesses contributed $8.7 billion to the city\u2019s economy last year, a 21 percent increase from 2011. The agency\u2019s budget is about $30 million, Ms. Menin said, and the gender initiative is among its largest endeavors. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that we have ever done anything remotely like this,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThis could absolutely serve as a blueprint and a paradigm for what we want to do in these other fields.\u201dMs. Menin was appointed the media and entertainment commissioner by Mayor Bill de Blasio in February, and began her tenure by meeting with entertainment industry guilds and prominent players in the field.The film and theater initiative, Ms. Menin said, \u201cis very much in keeping with the goals\u201d of the de Blasio administration for more equity citywide. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to fire on all cylinders to address this issue of lack of diversity,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Doctor Is In. In Your House, That Is.", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringREMEMBER when doctors made house calls?While only a relative handful of doctors still offer them, there is growing evidence that comprehensive home medical care could be a viable alternative to the attendant woes and soaring expenses of institutional health services, particularly for those in late retirement.It will take some important legislative changes before focused, less intrusive care in a dignified, comfortable setting can become more widely available. The polarizing politics surrounding the Affordable Care Act makes any reform to the health care system particularly challenging. Still, given the overall popularity of Medicare \u2014 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both say they support it \u2014 getting a new home medical care benefit through Congress looks more promising.At the heart of the home care renaissance is a combination of high-tech, portable medical equipment and the age-old practice of doctors coming into the home to personally examine and treat their patients.\u201cWe can do X-rays, EKGs, medical records and other applications in the home,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Cornwell, who has made more than 32,000 house calls in his Chicago-based practice and wants to see Medicare support more home-based medical care.\u201cI had a 92-year-old patient with a very high temperature,\u201d Dr. Cornwell said, citing an example. \u201cI brought in a portable X-ray and diagnosed pneumonia; she didn\u2019t have to go to the hospital, and lived four more years.\u201dHome medical care may well be the key missing link in the \u201caging in place\u201d model aimed at helping millions more older adults avoid spending the last years of their lives in nursing homes and other institutions.Over the past decades, however, home care has been dwarfed by the significant shift of treatment to offices, clinics and hospitals. More than 50,000 practitioners work exclusively in hospitals, compared to about 5,000 doctors who make home-based visits to Medicare patients.Generally, the most expensive patients to treat have myriad health problems like diabetes and congestive heart failure. The top 5 percent of care-intensive patients account for 50 percent of total medical expenses, according to government data, with a median cost of more than $43,000 per person.Dr. Cornwell and others argue that many of these gravely ill Americans can be better cared for \u2014 at less overall expense \u2014 at home.\u201cPeople want to be at home,\u201d said Dr. Joanne G. Schwartzberg, a scholar-in-residence at the Accreditation Council for the Graduate Medical Education, who is working with Dr. Cornwell to advance home-based care. \u201cResearch has shown that these patients have better health outcomes at much lower costs. Now the challenge is to train more physicians in providing this complex but rewarding form of medical care.\u201dThere are signs that the triad of care using doctors, nurses and the latest technology could help patients with multiple conditions.Linda V. DeCherrie, who runs one of the largest academic house call programs in the country out of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, received a $9.6 million Medicare innovation award to study the expansion of home care \u201cto include hospital level care at home and what it means for patients.\u201dDr. DeCherrie, who supervises two programs at Mount Sinai that treat more than 1,500 patients, says comprehensive home-based health care \u201chas the potential to provide solutions for many problems,\u201d suggesting that seeing patients in their natural environment may offer improved care.\u201cIt can be quite an ordeal to see a doctor in a hospital if you are a frail older adult,\u201d Dr. DeCherrie said. \u201cPatients are much happier not to have to go through that. In a home, you can get a better picture of what\u2019s going on.\u201dThe next step for broad-based home medical care is a legislative push to expand Medicare\u2019s reach into the home and to revamp the prevailing fee-for-service model that rewards quantity of treatment over quality and cost savings.Unless the traditional economic model is changed, experts say, few doctors would be interested in providing home-based care. It\u2019s often a money loser for physicians under the current system.Dr. Cornwell said he would like to see a new payment model that would allow Medicare to share any savings \u2014 relative to hospitalization \u2014 with doctors who make house calls.\u201cIt would have profound national impact,\u201d Dr. Cornwell said. \u201cIt would save billions in health care costs. For the horribly sick, hospitals are the worst place.\u201dThe Independence at Home Act (S. 3130), a bill supported by a bipartisan group of senators, would expand a Medicare home care demonstration program \u201cso that it can benefit more Medicare beneficiaries with severe chronic illness and disability through coordinated, home-based primary care,\u201d according to an endorsement letter backed by organizations including AARP and the Retirement Research Foundation.Although the home medical care bill is unlikely to see action in Congress this year, Dr. Cornwell hopes it may be revived next year. But many policy, fiscal and political hurdles need to be crossed before home care can really take off.How will doctors be monitored in the home? How will Medicare gauge the effectiveness of home-based treatments? Will Medicare reimbursement be enough to cover the costs of physicians, nurses and equipment? What about long-term care financing in addition to primary care that could provide better funding for custodial care outside of nursing homes?Those questions, among others, are being considered by a diverse group of lawmakers, health care professionals and Medicare officials. Whether long-term care costs, which often include nonmedical caregiver or semiskilled home care, should also receive more support through government programs is another challenging issue.\u201cMany people who need help with basic tasks of daily life want to and can remain at home, rather than being forced to live in institutions in order to get care,\u201d said Judith Feder, a professor of public policy at Georgetown.The image of a doctor making house calls may recall a quaint Norman Rockwellesque painting, but home medical care could be part of a better future, too.Advertisement"}

But she also came alive when talking about the inspiration for certain items. \u201cI have kept an archive of my most influential fashion pieces, things that came to mean something to me,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cIt encompasses a lot of different time periods, lovers, countries.\u201dThe clothing line arrives during a transitional time for her quirky company, which some women love for its homespun/high-end mix and others find ludicrous for the same reason. In mid-August, Ms. Paltrow said she had raised $10 million from three venture capital firms, an amount she described as \u201cenough runway to get us to profitability.\u201d Goop, which has about 60 employees (up from 15 two years ago), is also relocating its headquarters to California from New York.Being a (nearly) full-time businesswoman \u2014 she greatly scaled back her movie commitments a couple of years ago \u2014 has been energizing, Ms. Paltrow insisted, even though her move away from Hollywood has puzzled some fans. \u201cI felt that I had achieved a lot in the acting world, and I really was ready for a totally different challenge,\u201d she said.But she acknowledged some internal struggle.\u201cIt\u2019s something, to be totally honest, that I\u2019m still wrestling with, because acting was such a huge part of my identity, and I don\u2019t know what it means if I fully stop,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does that do to my perception of myself as an artist and as a woman?\u201d\u201cIn the past, the media has tried to pit us all against each other, and it\u2019s so sexist and so absurd,\u201d she said.Visiting Ms. Paltrow at Goop headquarters was simultaneously nothing like I envisioned and everything I envisioned.Going in, I worried that she would take one glance at my old-fogy Eastland shoes, the ones with cat hair stuck in the laces, and have me escorted from the building. Be gone with this tacky man! She would then shake her head and think these words, which I once read in a Goop newsletter: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more disheartening than the sight of love handles spilling over your pants or a pooched belly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s chic, right?\u201d she said.Goop Label will roll out slowly, with up to five new items made available each month. (The first installment has four: the jacket, the chambray shirt, a pair of culottes and an oversize cotton canvas tote with a leather bottom.) Once pieces sell out \u2014 only \u201cdozens\u201d of each are available \u2014 they will not be restocked. \u201cI\u2019m worried because I think we underordered by a lot,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said, noting that she is using the same Italian factories as luxury brands like Azzedine Ala\u00efa and Dries Van Noten.How did she choose the offerings?\u201cI looked at the analytics \u2014 what sold the best, as in hundreds of units, on our site,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were exclusive pieces that you couldn\u2019t buy anywhere else, they were priced under $1,000 and they were buy-now, wear-now.\u201d Working with a team of designers and consultants, she then looked through her closets to find \u201ctimeless, essential, luxurious basics\u201d that she\u2019s never been able to replace.And then she tweaked them. \u201cI would look at something and think to myself, \u2018I love the little puff sleeve, but I wish that the sleeves were three-quarter, I wish it had a collar, I wish it had buttons,\u2019 whatever,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a weird move, and I understand why people are curious,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I know is that I feel so incredibly on fire professionally here at Goop, in ways that I don\u2019t think I ever felt when I was acting.\u201dBrooks Barnes is a reporter in the Los Angeles bureau of The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Subprime Lender, Busy at State Level, Avoids Federal Scrutiny", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe payday lending industry is bracing for a regulatory crackdown. One of its rivals is not.Yet the nation\u2019s largest subprime installment lender, OneMain Financial, may well avoid the new regulation. OneMain caps its loans at 36 percent interest and would arguably gain an advantage from federal rules that rein in its higher-cost and more aggressive competitors.On the state level, the company may reap greater rewards.OneMain pressed for legislative changes in about eight states this year, records show, telling lawmakers that the changes would help it serve additional borrowers. Although OneMain is not currently lobbying the federal consumer agency, it regularly writes legislation introduced at the state level.OneMain did not win every battle, but it already helped change laws this year in three of those states: Arizona, Mississippi and Florida. Since 2012, when its lobbying campaign began in earnest, OneMain has helped enact legislative changes in at least 10 states.Collectively, these efforts underscore the breadth of OneMain\u2019s influence, and by extension, the influence of its private equity owner, the Fortress Investment Group.Although The Times\u2019s article focused on the efforts of Springleaf, now OneMain, to raise costs on borrowers, the lender recently broadened its legislative agenda. In some states, the lender sought permission to pay other companies what is known as a referral fee, for sending business its way. Another successful bill this year enabled the company to offer new types of insurance policies alongside its loans, including accidental death and dismemberment coverage, an important area for OneMain.In a statement, OneMain argued that its successes were not particularly sweeping, noting that it lost in a handful of states. When it did win, the company said, these bills modified outdated laws and leveled the playing field with online lenders not subject to the same state laws. And if it had not been able to raise costs, OneMain said, its branches would have closed, leaving borrowers with few options aside from higher-cost lenders.OneMain is also not the only consumer lender making the rounds of state capitals. In a year when some state legislatures did not meet and others gathered only briefly, this lobbying raised concerns among consumer advocates.\u201cThese bills were popping up all over the place,\u201d said Diane Standaert, director of state policy at the Center for Responsible Lending, adding that they were \u201caimed at loosening state laws that protect people from high-cost lending.\u201dState regulation is important, she said, because no federal regulator directly examines OneMain and its fellow installment lenders, other than to file enforcement actions for legal violations.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s new rules would impose additional oversight on the industry, but not for every lender.\u201cRelatively few\u201d OneMain loans will fall into those categories, according to a report by Credit Suisse. For one thing, OneMain already evaluates a borrower\u2019s ability to repay. And although OneMain does offer some loans whose costs exceed 36 percent \u2014 once premiums for insurance products are included \u2014 only \u201ca minority\u201d of those loans call for access to a borrower\u2019s bank account, and even then it is an optional feature.To avoid the rule in those instances, OneMain could either delay gaining access to these borrowers\u2019 accounts, or lower the costs ever so slightly. Either way, the rules will have little impact on the lender, even as it puts a crimp in the profits of more aggressive rivals.The difference between payday and installment loans can seem trivial, but there are important distinctions. Installment loans are larger and last longer than payday loans, which are generally for a few hundred dollars and are due on the borrower\u2019s next payday. Payday loans typically have an annual percentage rate of around 390 percent, though installment loan rates can reach triple digits as well. The average OneMain loan totals about $6,093 and carries an interest rate of 26 percent, plus fees.\u201cThe proposed rules address practices common in a different segment of the consumer finance market,\u201d OneMain said in its statement. \u201cOur responsible, fully amortizing, fixed-rate, fixed-payment loans do not result in \u2018debt traps.\u2019\u201dStill, OneMain is not totally in the clear. The consumer agency has plans to supervise large installment lenders like OneMain eventually. And in addition to its proposal for high-cost loans, the agency is soliciting information about \u201chigh-cost, longer-duration installment loans\u201d that do not involve car titles or bank account access.OneMain has not publicly weighed in on the federal proposal, but it has been busy at the state level. In many states, OneMain, and previously Springleaf, benefited from the scarce resources of legislators, who typically work part time and lack financial expertise.John Anderson, an executive vice president at OneMain, had said that \u201cif you want something done, you sometimes have to write the first draft yourself,\u201d though \u201cit is unusual for legislation we propose to be enacted verbatim.\u201dIn Arizona, Springleaf pushed draft legislation two years ago that doubled the maximum origination fee, to $150 from $75, and applied the state\u2019s maximum 36 percent rate to a greater number of loans.The legislation drew concern from Arizona\u2019s financial regulatory agency, which in an email reviewed by The Times told a Springleaf lobbyist, \u201cWe have not seen a willingness to address the concerns stated, nor the research and information that may validate the arguments you\u2019ve made.\u201dThe bill passed anyway, save for a few concessions. In one, Springleaf agreed to have lawmakers withdraw a section that would have allowed it to compensate companies that refer business to it.But that was not the end of Springleaf\u2019s referral-fee plan. After addressing some concerns from policy makers, Springleaf this year proposed a new bill that removed Arizona\u2019s prohibition on \u201cpaying a fee, commission or bonus\u201d to anyone referring borrowers to lenders like Springleaf.Representative Debbie McCune Davis, an Arizona Democrat who led the opposition, called the referral fee a \u201ckickback.\u201dYet Springleaf and OneMain, which note that referral fees are common across the lending industry, also helped pass referral-fee legislation this year in Florida and Mississippi. And in Arizona, the lender did not stop with referral fees.The Arizona bill also allowed lenders to expand the types of insurance policies it can sell alongside loans. In addition to life insurance and other products, the bill permitted the lender to offer accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability income protection.New insurance products like these could have an added bonus. Unlike some of OneMain\u2019s traditional insurance products, these policies might not be counted toward the 36 percent costs that fall under the consumer agency\u2019s rules.OneMain\u2019s lobbyists, who also supported an insurance bill in California this year, have assured lawmakers that the policies are optional. It also refunds premiums if borrowers cancel policies within 30 days, assuaging some lawmakers\u2019 concerns.Still, OneMain has not won all its legislative battles. In Colorado this year, a OneMain bill stalled in committee that would have increased costs on borrowers, a year after a similar bill was vetoed.Soon after Representative Jovan Melton, a Democrat, introduced the first bill, he drafted a letter to fellow lawmakers, emails show, prompting a Springleaf lobbyist to remark to a colleague that \u201cJovan is the best.\u201dThe lobbyist also helped Mr. Melton draft a letter to Gov. John Hickenlooper. Mr. Melton, who did not respond to requests for comment, sent the lobbyist an edited version, saying: \u201cHere is the letter back with my revision on letter head. Did you want to send it to the Gov\u2019s Office or me?\u201dGovernor Hickenlooper, a Democrat, vetoed the bill that would have loosened the requirements.\u201cI wasn\u2019t against rolling them back somewhat,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just the level at which they presented, it seemed like it was going to be excessively onerous.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Cuomo Aides Charged in Federal Corruption Inquiry", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal corruption charges were announced on Thursday against two former close aides to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a senior state official and six other people, in a blow to the governor\u2019s innermost circle and a repudiation of the way his prized upstate economic development programs were managed.The charges against the former aides, Joseph Percoco and Todd R. Howe, and the state official, Alain Kaloyeros, were the culmination of a long-running federal investigation into the Cuomo administration\u2019s efforts to lure jobs and businesses to upstate New York\u2019s limping economy by furnishing billions of dollars in state funds to developers from Buffalo to Albany.The charges mark the second major inquiry of the Cuomo administration by the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan; eight months ago, after investigating Mr. Cuomo\u2019s handling of an anticorruption panel that he had created and abruptly shut down, Mr. Bharara said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to prove a federal crime.\u201dAt a news conference at which he announced the charges, Mr. Bharara was asked if he would essentially give Mr. Cuomo a \u201cclean bill of health\u201d again.\u201cThere are no allegations of any wrongdoing or misconduct by the governor, anywhere in this complaint,\u201d Mr. Bharara replied. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201dIf the charges did not hit Mr. Cuomo directly, they did hit him in a peripheral and personal manner: Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe were both loyalists of Mr. Cuomo and his father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, for whom they had also worked. Andrew Cuomo once referred to Mr. Percoco as \u201cmy father\u2019s third son, who I sometimes think he loved the most.\u201dMr. Cuomo had also spoken highly of Dr. Kaloyeros, depicting him as a visionary in the field of nanotechnology, which Mr. Cuomo has heralded as a potential boon for the state economy.The resulting investigation yielded a rich narrative of three trusted counselors to Mr. Cuomo conspiring to help the favored contractors, rigging bids and doling out other favorable treatment. The complaint also portrayed the defendants as trying to conceal the schemes, sometimes in unusual ways.In emails and other correspondence, Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe referred to bribe money as \u201cziti,\u201d a term used in \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d the complaint says. Mr. Percoco, Mr. Howe and others also called one another \u201cHerb\u201d as a term of endearment, while discussing the arrangement.Mr. Bharara said at a news conference on Thursday that he hoped the case would go to trial \u201cso that all New Yorkers can see, in gory detail, what their state government has been up to.\u201dMr. Percoco, who had served as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315,000 in bribes. In addition, corruption charges were announced against another former aide, a senior state official and six other people.Mr. Percoco, who had served as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315,000 in bribes from 2012 to 2016 from two companies: Competitive Power Ventures, an energy company that was seeking state approval to build a power plant in the Hudson Valley, and COR Development, a major developer in the Syracuse area that ended up with several large state-funded economic development projects.In one instance cited in the complaint, prosecutors say Mr. Howe sent an email to Dr. Kaloyeros saying he had \u201cvitals for Buffalo and Syracuse friends.\u201d He was working with a prominent corporate donor, LPCiminelli, a builder based in Buffalo, to create a request for proposals that effectively made LPCiminelli the only eligible bidder.Neither the energy company nor the developers in Buffalo and Syracuse are named in the complaint, but several defendants charged are among the companies\u2019 top officials.They include Peter Galbraith Kelly Jr., who oversaw lobbying and public relations for Competitive Power Ventures, which is based in Maryland and Massachusetts; Steven Aiello, the president of COR Development; and Joseph Gerardi, another executive at COR. The complaint also charges Louis Ciminelli, the founder of LPCiminelli; and Michael Laipple and Kevin Schuler, two other LPCiminelli executives.Mr. Kelly is accused of offering and paying Mr. Percoco more than $287,000 in bribes in exchange for Mr. Percoco\u2019s help. The payments were made to Lisa Toscano-Percoco, Mr. Percoco\u2019s wife, who was ostensibly employed as a consultant to Competitive Power Ventures\u2019s educational outreach arm starting in 2012.Competitive Power Ventures wanted Mr. Percoco\u2019s help obtaining a state contract worth approximately $100 million to finance its power plant in the Hudson Valley, as well as millions of dollars in energy credits for a power plant it was building in New Jersey.The COR executives, Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi, were accused of giving Mr. Percoco about $35,000 in bribes to use his position in the governor\u2019s office to promote the company\u2019s economic development projects.According to the complaint, they sought Mr. Percoco\u2019s help in reversing a decision by the state\u2019s economic development agency that would have forced COR \u2014 Mr. Cuomo\u2019s largest donor in central New York \u2014 to make an expensive labor peace agreement; pushing the state to release payments that it owed to COR; and getting a $5,000 raise for Mr. Aiello\u2019s son, who worked for Mr. Percoco at the governor\u2019s office.The charges in the complaint included bribery, extortion under color of official right, and wire fraud and honest services fraud conspiracies.\u201cMr. Percoco performed services honestly and within the bounds of the law at all times,\u201d Mr. Bohrer said.A lawyer for Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi declined to comment. Mr. Kelly\u2019s lawyer, Daniel M. Gitner, said his client was innocent and \u201cwill be exonerated.\u201d LPCiminelli, citing its three executives named in the complaint, said it was \u201cconfident that all company officials acted appropriately and legally\u201d and would be vindicated.Virtually all the state-funded projects were shaped under the umbrella of the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute and its subsidiaries. The institute is headed by Dr. Kaloyeros, a physicist who has become something of an economic development guru in Albany.Dr. Kaloyeros had been given free rein by Mr. Cuomo to conceive of high-tech economic development projects that could create jobs across the state.Michael C. Miller, a lawyer for Dr. Kaloyeros, said his client was innocent and \u201clooks forward to being exonerated.\u201dDr. Kaloyeros also was hit with separate charges on Thursday filed by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman.

{"Headline": "A.N.C.\u2019s Combative Response to Election Losses Startles South Africa", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From South AfricaJOHANNESBURG \u2014 When South African voters last month handed the African National Congress its worst-ever losses, seemingly chastened party leaders said they would engage in \u201cintrospection.\u201dThey promised to reach out to South Africans disillusioned by the A.N.C.\u2019s apparent transformation from a celebrated liberation movement with cherished ideals to a corrupt party interested in self-preservation and self-enrichment.\u201cThis is further confirming the people\u2019s suspicions about the A.N.C.,\u201d said Sasabona Manganye, the chairman of the Sefako Makgatho branch of the A.N.C. in Johannesburg, which has called on Mr. Zuma and the party\u2019s top leaders to resign. \u201cUnfortunately, the biggest loser out of all of this is the A.N.C,\u201d he said.\u201cIf the A.N.C. leaves Zuma to remain president until 2019,\u201d he added, \u201cwe should just accept that Zuma will be the last president that the A.N.C. had.\u201dThe liberation movements that helped free much of southern Africa decades ago are still in power \u2014 in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique and Angola. Like the A.N.C., they have used their liberation credentials to maintain their grip on power and to fend off rivals. But their records in government have been mixed at best, or, in the case of Zimbabwe, deeply tarnished.\u201cWe\u2019re in the lingering days of these liberation movements,\u201d said Roger Southall, a professor emeritus at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and an expert on liberation movements. \u201cThey\u2019re not suddenly going to lose power,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ll go on organizationally. But they\u2019ve certainly lost their shine, the hopes that they were embodied with, and, in South Africa, that process has been hugely accelerated by the Zuma presidency.\u201dMany African nations gained their independence in the 1960s after former colonial rulers withdrew from the continent. But the liberation movements took up armed struggle against colonial powers or white settlers, in that way gaining greater moral authority. In the constellation of liberation movements, none shone brighter than the A.N.C. and its most famous leader, Nelson Mandela.To liberation movement leaders like Mr. Zuma, who said last year that the A.N.C. \u201ccomes first,\u201d even before the nation, nothing remains more vital than the movement. Many leaders have described their movement in religious terms, including Mr. Zuma, who until last month often said that the A.N.C. would rule \u201cuntil Jesus comes.\u201dThe qualities that were prized in liberation leaders and movements have often proved detrimental in government.\u201cThe A.N.C. is now being forced to change into a political party,\u201d said Rekgotsofetse Chikane, a university student leader and A.N.C. member who is the son of a famous party leader, the Rev. Frank Chikane. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a political party in name, it is still a liberation movement through its actions \u2014 the way it thinks about how it\u2019s going to deliver services, the way it builds its rhetoric and the way it defends itself.\u201dBecause of its past as a liberation movement, the younger Mr. Chikane said, the A.N.C. practices a \u201ccentralized democracy\u201d in which leaders simply give commands and are not used to a give-and-take with other party members or with voters.Given the strength of South Africa\u2019s democratic institutions compared with those of its neighbors in the region, Mr. Chikane said he was optimistic that the party would successfully transform itself. But he said it would be an arduous process because many in the party, shocked by last month\u2019s elections, were focused simply on retaining power through two more presidential elections, or through 2024.\u201cThose who\u2019ve been pillaging the state in one way or another will pillage as much as possible until the last possible moment, so that when the game is over, they will be set for the rest of their lives,\u201d Mr. Chikane said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see with parastatals,\u201d he added, referring to state enterprises.Zimbabwe\u2019s economy is in free fall; government workers, who make up most of the 10 percent of Zimbabweans fortunate enough to be employed in the formal sector, are being paid weeks late because of the government\u2019s severe cash shortage.In turn, Ms. Mujuru and her allies have said that Mr. Mugabe \u2014 an intellectual who was imprisoned for years before becoming one of the liberation movement\u2019s political leaders \u2014 was not a war veteran. He did not see combat, they said, and did not even have a nom de guerre.Ms. Dongo, who also fought during the war of liberation and was known as Tichaona Muhondo, or We Shall See in the War, led the latest riposte against Mr. Mugabe and his liberation credentials.The back-and-forth has reinforced the popular impression that the country\u2019s politicians make up a class out of touch with the nation\u2019s problems.\u201cPeople are concerned about the bread-and-butter issues of this country and not how this and that became a hero or turned into a villain,\u201d said Richmond Gumbo, a student who was reading newspapers in the library of the University of Zimbabwe in Harare recently.He added, \u201cLeaders need to bow down to the needs, the basic needs of the people, and not to brag about how they fought in the liberation war over 36 years ago.\u201dJeffrey Moyo contributed reporting from Harare, Zimbabwe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Good Technology Investors Sue J.P. Morgan, Claiming Conflicts", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySilicon Valley start-ups often have to grapple with the competing interests of their founders, investors and employees. Now add one more to the list: their bankers.The extent to which start-ups can be influenced by investment banks was highlighted on Thursday by the case of Good Technology, a mobile security software maker that was acquired last year by BlackBerry for a fire-sale price of $425 million.In an amended suit in Delaware Chancery Court, Good\u2019s shareholders said that J. P. Morgan, the start-up\u2019s banker, had faced so many conflicts of interest in its dealings with the company that it led to Good selling itself for less than it was worth.Even as J. P. Morgan was advising Good on its sale, the complaint said, it was also advising BlackBerry in late 2013 and pursuing future business with the company. J. P. Morgan\u2019s need to maintain a business relationship with BlackBerry, which was the larger company, ultimately spurred the bank to put that relationship above the one with Good, according to the amended complaint.While it is not new for banks to be accused of conflicts of interest, the issue is more salient now for start-ups. As the market for private fund-raising has slowed and the initial public offerings market has remained relatively dormant, sales have become more popular \u2014 and the potential for banks to influence how start-ups act in those transactions is set to increase.\u201cWhen a major bank advises on an acquisition, there\u2019s always this odd risk,\u201d said Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners. \u201cThe relationship that matters going forward is probably with the acquirer.\u201dA J. P. Morgan spokesman declined to comment on Good, and a representative for BlackBerry did not immediately return a request for comment.According to an amended lawsuit filed on Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court, shareholders of Good Technology said J.P. Morgan was deeply conflicted in its dealings with the company. That led the start-up to sell itself to BlackBerry last year at a fire- sale price.In the amended complaint, Good shareholders said, \u201cIn 2014 and 2015, J. P. Morgan\u2019s lead banker on the Good transaction and his colleagues were engaged in full court press to gain business from BlackBerry. This included a series of meetings and pitches with BlackBerry executives, even after it was clear that BlackBerry was a potential acquirer of Good.\u201dRandall Baron, a lawyer for Good\u2019s shareholders, said in an interview, \u201cOn many fronts J. P. Morgan was using Good Technology, and the dire straits its conflicted directors put it in, to benefit the bank immediately and in the future.\u201d He added that the bank was \u201cable to make substantially more money on a sale to BlackBerry than on a transaction that would have been better for the company, like a public offering.\u201dIn recent years, several companies have accused investment banks of unfairly swaying the sale price in a deal.In 2011, for instance, Royal Bank of Canada had been hired by Rural/Metro, an ambulance services company, looking to sell itself. The Delaware Chancery Court found that R.B.C. altered its fairness opinion, or a bank\u2019s assessment of what an offer price should be, to make a bid by Warburg Pincus to buy Rural/Metro look more attractive. R.B.C. had also provided Warburg Pincus a financing arrangement in conjunction with the deal.The court ruled that R.B.C. had steered both clients together at the expense of other bidders and shareholders. It became the first case where an investment bank was liable for damages over banker conflicts.Two years earlier, Delaware also ruled on a conflict-of-interest case related to a $21 billion acquisition of the El Paso Corporation by Kinder Morgan. At the time, Goldman Sachs owned about 19 percent of Kinder Morgan stock, held two board seats, and a prominent banker on the deal had failed to disclose that he held about $340,000 of Kinder Morgan stock. The bank was concurrently advising El Paso on the sale.Thursday\u2019s amended complaint from Good\u2019s shareholders is part of a suit that they originally filed last October, in which they said that the Silicon Valley company suffered \u201can extraordinary governance breakdown.\u201dThe defendants \u201cpushed incompatible self-interested agendas about how or when to obtain desperately needed financing for Good, and how or when to sell Good,\u201d according to the amended complaint.The suit has already named Good\u2019s directors and senior executives as defendants, stating that the board and executives had breached their fiduciary duties because they had conflicts that led them to act in their own best interests rather than in the best interests of the company.Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about a lawsuit filed against J.P. Morgan, accusing the financial services firm of conflicts of interest in advising Good Technology on its acquisition by BlackBerry, a company that J.P. Morgan also had a business relationship with, misstated the year Royal Bank of Canada was hired by Rural/Metro, an ambulance services company, looking to sell itself. (In that deal, Royal Bank of Canada was found liable for damages over banker conflicts.) It was 2011, not 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why This Economy Needs Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThis year, the media has been focused largely on the election process \u2014 campaign managers, speaking styles, every slip and misstep. That\u2019s been entertaining, but the policy differences between the two sides are much more important, and the most crucial difference may be over economic policy.Donald J. Trump has campaigned very clearly for change \u2014 a policy upheaval to promote faster growth, repair the economic stagnation and end the corrupt pay-to-play system that favors the well heeled. Hillary Clinton has pledged to extend and build on the policies of the Obama administration.There is no doubt who has the better plan. Our economy is growing at only 1.1 percent per year, a fraction of our average rate, and the Congressional Budget Office forecasts just 2 percent annual growth (in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product) for the next 10 years.Yes, we went through a deep recession, but it ended in 2009. The recovery has been the weakest in decades, and the first that has actually pushed median incomes down. Business investment and profits are lower now than a year ago. Counterproductive federal policies squash small businesses with inane regulatory sprawl that affects hiring, taxes, credit and medical care.The result is a stagnant economy that leaves out millions of Americans who would like to work and get ahead, and a devastating report card on the Obama White House.To restart growth, Mr. Trump would immediately lower tax rates, including for middle-income voters, and simplify the tax code. Americans would be able to exempt average child-care expenses from taxes, and Mr. Trump\u2019s administration would eliminate the death tax, which falls especially hard on some small businesses and farmers.To help create a flood of new business investment and jobs, the Trump plan would reduce corporate tax rates to 15 percent while eliminating or capping many tax deductions. This would simplify the tax system, making us much more competitive with countries and a magnet for new jobs.Mrs. Clinton wants to go in the opposite direction, depressing job growth with an uncompetitive corporate tax rate, higher taxes on estates and short-term capital gains, and a 4 percent surtax on the most successful individuals.She insists that the Trump plan will cause a bigger deficit and a recession, but she is basing that on her party\u2019s view that tax rates don\u2019t matter much to growth and investment; Mr. Trump knows they do. The Moody\u2019s study Mrs. Clinton cites so often says Mr. Trump\u2019s plan would cause higher fiscal deficits but would also create faster growth and a surge in new jobs. It assumes that the Fed would raise interest rates to over 6 percent, causing a recession it attributes to Mr. Trump. A much more likely outcome is faster growth without the spike in interest rates or a recession.Mr. Trump agrees with those who are concerned about the national debt. He wants to help the private sector to grow faster and to create a debt limit that would rein in our debt-to-G.D.P. ratio, which has skyrocketed under President Obama.Critics of tax cuts say the government can\u2019t afford his plan. But what the economy can\u2019t afford is the current inept tax system, slow growth and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s $1.1 trillion in tax hikes.Mr. Trump would immediately halt the crush of new federal regulations on business. In 2015 alone, the Obama administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations \u2014 hidden taxes that add a lead weight on our businesses. To grow faster, the economy has to have relief from this central planning and regulatory overreach. And Mr. Trump would seek consumer choice in education and health care and a repeal of Obamacare.The scant economic gains in the past eight years are even weaker for most Americans than the G.D.P. data indicates because federal policy favored gains for the haves, not the have-nots. Your prosperity is increasing if you work in finance, issuing bonds or trading currencies, or you lobby or arrange government contracts. If not, you\u2019ve most likely gone backward financially.Mr. Trump is proposing to overturn that stagnant, corrupt system. An important part of his transformation is a new trade policy that encourages American jobs rather than undercuts them. His position has been demonized by the press as protectionism, but the reality is that our trade system is broken. Bad deals harmed American workers and gave access to United States markets without achieving vital conditions like intellectual property protection in China.The North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, grew to 1,700 pages, yet still allowed Mexico to enforce its value-added tax on American products while exporting goods to the United States duty-free. The even more complicated Trans-Pacific Partnership would allow foreign companies to challenge United States laws in an international court, but it would do nothing to guarantee that countries couldn\u2019t use currency manipulation to benefit their exporters over ours.Voters will have an opportunity to decide for or against a government that\u2019s failing on health care, taxes, trade, cost control and regulation. One candidate wants higher tax rates. The other would lower them. One candidate thinks the economic recovery has been successful whereas the other thinks it left millions of Americans out. One candidate has spent her lifetime seeking the presidency. Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t.As Thomas Jefferson said, \u201cA little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.\u201d It\u2019s time for one now.David Malpass is a senior economic adviser to the Trump campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lucrative Book Deals Might Finance the Obamas\u2019 Post-White House Life", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House Letter\u201cHis is going to be easily the most valuable presidential memoir ever,\u201d said Raphael Sagalyn of the ICM/Sagalyn Literary Agency, who predicted that Mr. Obama could earn as much as $30 million with a two- or three-book contract. \u201cAnd I think Michelle Obama has the opportunity to sell the most valuable first lady memoir in history.\u201dOther agents suggested similar numbers, but publishers \u2014 who are the ones who actually sign authors\u2019 checks \u2014 balked at such lofty evaluations, with several saying Mr. Obama is unlikely to earn more than $12 million and Mrs. Obama $10 million.Robert B. Barnett, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s agent on a 2004 book deal, and representatives for Crown, which published Mr. Obama\u2019s three previous books, declined to comment. So did the White House.\u201cThere will be plenty of time post-presidency to discuss books and book contracts, but for now the focus of the president and first lady is on squeezing every last ounce of progress out of the next five months,\u201d said Jen Psaki, the White House communications director.Mr. Obama\u2019s three books \u2014 \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d \u201cThe Audacity of Hope\u201d and \u201cOf Thee I Sing\u201d \u2014 have sold more than four million copies, according to publishing lists, and earned him more than $10 million, according to financial disclosures.Publishers hope that Mr. Obama\u2019s writing ability could make his memoir not only profitable in its first years but perhaps for decades to come. Among presidential memoirs, only the one by Ulysses S. Grant, published in 1885, is considered by many historians to be timeless.\u201cYou\u2019re going to sell a lot of books when you first publish Obama\u2019s memoir, but you could also sell a lot to your children\u2019s children,\u201d said David Black, a New York literary agent. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen all that often, but because this guy\u2019s a real writer, it has a good chance.\u201dBut books are the preferred way to make money because they do not have the taint of paid speeches, and they generally sell well.Despite a second term that left him among the most unpopular departing presidents in history, Mr. Bush\u2019s book \u201cDecision Points\u201d was a hit, selling about two million copies and earning Mr. Bush an estimated $10 million. Similarly, Mr. Clinton\u2019s memoir, \u201cMy Life,\u201d was a best seller, with at least 1.4 million copies in print.Memoirs by first ladies have also been profitable. Mrs. Clinton earned an $8 million advance for \u201cLiving History\u201d after she left the White House, and Laura Bush was paid millions for \u201cSpoken From the Heart.\u201dGeorges Borchardt, a New York-based literary agent, said that Mr. Obama\u2019s popularity outside of the United States would make the foreign rights to his books more profitable than those for any other former president. \u201cAnd the same goes for Michelle Obama,\u201d Mr. Borchardt said. \u201cShe can write whatever she wants.\u201dWhether Mr. Obama will be able to deliver a manuscript as quickly as his publisher would like is unclear. His first contract for \u201cDreams From My Father\u201d was canceled after he badly missed his deadline. He was able to finish the memoir only after secluding himself in a cottage on Sanur Beach on Bali, Indonesia.Mr. Obama told Jimmy Fallon in June that, after spending eight winters in Washington, he and Michelle would fly to \u201csome place warm for a while\u201d when their term ends, perhaps to write again.\u201cI think the big surprise could come from Michelle,\u201d said Sandra Dijkstra, a literary agent based in San Diego. \u201cBut one thing is for sure: They\u2019ll be able to afford to buy that house on Martha\u2019s Vineyard they\u2019ve been renting.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Trump Empire Built on Inside Connections and $885 Million in Tax Breaks", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe way Donald J. Trump tells it, his first solo project as a real estate developer, the conversion of a faded railroad hotel on 42nd Street into the sleek, 30-story Grand Hyatt, was a triumph from the very beginning.But that book, and numerous interviews over the years, make little mention of a crucial factor in getting the hotel built: an extraordinary 40-year tax break that has cost New York City $360 million to date in forgiven, or uncollected, taxes, with four years still to run, on a property that cost only $120 million to build in 1980.The project set the pattern for Mr. Trump\u2019s New York career: He used his father\u2019s, and, later, his own, extensive political connections, and relied on a huge amount of assistance from the government and taxpayers in the form of tax breaks, grants and incentives to benefit the 15 buildings at the core of his Manhattan real estate empire.Since then, Mr. Trump has reaped at least $885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies for luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings in New York, according to city tax, housing and finance records. The subsidies helped him lower his own costs and sell apartments at higher prices because of their reduced taxes.Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has made clear over the course of his campaign how proud he is that \u201cas a businessman I want to pay as little tax as possible.\u201dWhile it is impossible to assess how much Mr. Trump pays in personal or corporate income taxes, because he has refused to release his tax returns, an examination of his record as a New York developer shows how aggressively he has fought to lower the taxes on his projects.Mr. Trump successfully sued the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch after being denied a tax break for Trump Tower, his signature building on Fifth Avenue. Two decades later, in a lawsuit that spanned the administrations of Mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg, he won a similar tax break for Trump World Tower, a building on First Avenue with some of the city\u2019s highest-priced condominiums in 2001.The tax breaks for those two projects alone totaled $157 million.The tax break at the 44-story Trump International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle came to $15.9 million.No possible subsidy was left untapped. After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Mr. Trump lined up a $150,000 grant for one of his buildings near ground zero, taking advantage of a program to help small businesses in the area recover, even though he had acknowledged on the day of the attacks that his building was undamaged.In seeking those subsidies, Mr. Trump is not that different from many other developers. But the level of subsidies he has received along with his doggedness in claiming them seem at odds with his rhetoric as an outsider candidate who boasts of his single-handed success and who has denounced what he calls the pay-to-play culture of politics and a \u201crigged\u201d system of government.Without addressing specific questions about his pursuit of tax breaks and other subsidies, Mr. Trump in a telephone interview defended going after them. \u201cIn many cases, they made the difference between building and not being able to build,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten incentives in other parts of the world as well.\u201dIn the mid-1970s, eager to make his mark in Manhattan, the 30-year-old Mr. Trump focused his attention on the failing Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street, next to Grand Central Terminal. The owner, the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad, was keen to sell.But Mr. Trump insisted that the project was not viable without a tax break from the city.\u201cFred was a big macher in Brooklyn,\u201d said Martin J. McLaughlin, a lobbyist who worked for Donald Trump in the 1990s. \u201cHe had an extremely close relationship with Beame and Carey.\u201dMr. Trump visited a young city official, Michael Bailkin, who devised a plan centered on a 40-year tax abatement, still the longest ever granted by the city, under which the state would own the land beneath the hotel and lease it to the partnership for $1 a year.\u201cI viewed him as another developer, one with limited experience, but coming from a family with a lot of experience,\u201d Mr. Bailkin recalled in an interview.Mr. Trump had one other qualification. \u201cHe did say,\u201d Mr. Bailkin added, \u201cthe administration would support it.\u201dMr. Ravitch said in a recent interview that he responded frankly after Mr. Trump laid out the project: \u201cIt\u2019d be great to have a Hyatt on 42nd Street. I thought it\u2019d be successful. But I don\u2019t think it should be exempt from taxation.\u201dMr. Trump stood up, Mr. Ravitch recalled, \u201cand said, \u2018If you don\u2019t give me an exemption I\u2019ll have you fired.\u2019\u201dMs. Sunshine did not respond to requests for comment.In the end, after phone calls from Mr. Beame and other Democratic politicians, Mr. Ravitch and the agency\u2019s board voted to approve the project, though the partners in the hotel had to pay a modest rent for the land based on a percentage of their profits and allow for subway entrances to be built nearby.Mr. Trump said the decision was made on the merits. \u201cWe were a contributor like many people were contributors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there never was a quid pro quo.\u201dEven before it opened, though, Mr. Trump had infuriated the new mayor, Mr. Koch, by reneging on the promise to allow for access to the subway on the east and west sides of the hotel.Mr. Trump eventually granted the western easement and allowed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build a stairwell, but shed his responsibility for the other entryway.City officials initially estimated that the tax break on the Hyatt was worth $4 million a year to Mr. Trump. But according to a recent analysis conducted by the city\u2019s Finance Department at the request of The New York Times, the actual annual giveaway was far higher: $6.3 million in 1983, rising to $17.8 million in 2016. The combined value of the forgiven taxes is $359.3 million, with four years left on the abatement.Over the same period, the hotel\u2019s owners have paid the city $202.5 million in rent and fees, according to the state agency overseeing the project, Empire State Development.Mr. Trump said the tax break did what it was supposed to do. \u201cThe hotel was a great success for the city,\u201d he said. \u201cIt regenerated interest in that area.\u201dBut early on, the city suspected something was amiss with the rent payments, when the total dropped in 1986, despite rising profits. A 1989 review by Karen Burstein, the city\u2019s auditor general at the time, found that Mr. Trump and Hyatt owed the city $2.9 million for 1986, having used \u201caberrant and distortive\u201d accounting methods to reduce their obligation.\u201cThis was subsidized by city residents,\u201d Ms. Burstein said recently of the tax break. \u201cThe last thing you do is cheat the very people who are your partners.\u201dAfter the city and state demanded payment, the hotel partners sued them in 1990. The suit was settled in 2004. Neither court files nor the city\u2019s Law Department have a copy of the agreement, but a city official who requested anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter, said that the city recouped $850,000.When the Hyatt opened, Mr. Trump was already at work on a second project: Trump Tower, the 58-story, bronze-glass building that would become his home, the headquarters for his company and a tourist attraction.The idea was to raze the Bonwit Teller department store, whose prestigious Fifth Avenue address he described as a \u201cTiffany location.\u201dTo build what he called \u201cthe ultimate vision of an elegant life seen through a golden eye,\u201d Mr. Trump wanted a 10-year property tax break under the city\u2019s 421-a program, which was created in 1971 to stimulate housing construction. As the city\u2019s economy rebounded, 421-a and programs like it were coming under criticism as giveaways to developers.The Koch administration rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s application, saying the project did not qualify because he was replacing a store with hundreds of employees and annual sales of $30 million, rather than an \u201cunderutilized property.\u201dMr. Trump sued the city in 1981. Justice Arnold L. Fein of the Appellate Division ruled in the city\u2019s favor, writing that 421-a \u201chardly contemplates the grant of benefits at the most choice, already adequately utilized location in Manhattan to create residential luxury apartments.\u201dMr. Trump appealed and in 1984, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that the city\u2019s action had \u201cimpermissibly erected a barrier to the benefit,\u201d and Mr. Trump was entitled to the tax abatement.Mr. Trump said at the time that the abatement was worth $7 million to $10 million over 10 years.The Finance Department, however, said in its recent analysis that the value of the benefit totaled $22.5 million. Mr. Trump later got an additional $15 million tax break under a separate program for renovating the tower\u2019s commercial space.Mr. Trump continued to fight the Koch administration\u2019s attempts to restrict the tax breaks or to require developer concessions, such as subsidized apartments, in return. After the administration refused to provide tens of millions of dollars in benefits for another project, on the West Side of Manhattan, Mr. Trump declared: \u201cthe city under Ed Koch is a disaster.\u201dIt is easy to understand why the tax breaks were so important to a developer like Mr. Trump.During a building\u2019s two- to three-year construction phase, when there is no rental or sales money coming in, a 421-a tax abatement can save a developer millions of dollars in taxes, because the property is taxed at the rate in effect before improvements are made. Once a building is completed and its apartments are sold, the benefits accrue to the buyers, significantly lowering taxes and making the apartments more appealing.\u201cIt was a great selling point,\u201d said Charles P. Reiss, a retired executive vice president for development at the Trump Organization. \u201cFor condos, the monthly fee was greatly reduced.\u201dThe benefit declines over time, with the apartment owner paying full taxes after 10 years.After winning the court battle over Trump Tower, Mr. Trump received 421-a tax benefits from the Koch administration worth $20.8 million for his Trump Plaza and Trump Palace projects.During the 1990s and into the 2000s, Mr. Trump built a number of New York projects without taxpayer subsidies. But he continued to chase benefits, large \u2014 and small.For instance, he sought, and received, a tax abatement worth $48,000 for the conversion of a condominium tower called Trump Parc East under Mr. Giuliani.And after the Sept. 11 attacks, he obtained a $150,000 grant for 40 Wall Street, an office tower eight blocks from ground zero, through a small-business recovery program.In the hours after the attacks, Mr. Trump told German television that his property \u201cwasn\u2019t, fortunately, affected by what happened at the World Trade Center.\u201dAt the other end of the spectrum, there was the 10-year tax abatement he got on seven apartment buildings in Trump Place-Riverside South in which he held a partial stake.According to the Finance Department analysis, the city forgave a combined $331.8 million in property taxes on the buildings, which were completed from 1998 to 2005.Under the revised rules governing the 421-a program, Mr. Trump was required to set aside 700 of the 3,494 apartments \u2014 roughly 20 percent \u2014 for low- and moderate-income tenants.Ms. Glen, then an assistant commissioner at the city\u2019s Division of Housing Finance, judged the project ineligible for public benefits.After the city\u2019s court battle with Mr. Trump over Trump Tower, the City Council had passed legislation dictating that 421-a benefits no longer be used to demolish usable buildings at public expense.In a letter to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Ms. Glen said Trump World Tower was to be built on the site of a functioning office building, and denied him the tax break.Mr. Trump sued and a State Supreme Court judge ordered the city to review his application. After that suit stalled, he filed a second one that ended in 2003 with a settlement that granted Mr. Trump a 10-year exemption worth $119.5 million for the 371-unit condo, according to the Finance Department.To meet his obligation to build affordable housing, Mr. Trump paid another developer $9.65 million for 124 units earmarked for low- and moderate-income tenants elsewhere in the city., according to court records. He also had to forego a tax abatement during construction.In 2002, apartments at Trump World Tower sold for an average of $1,046 per square foot, or $1.5 million for a small two-bedroom.\u201cHis whole MO is to exploit the government for everything he could get,\u201d said Jerilyn Perine, the city housing commissioner during the Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations. \u201cIn the end, the letter of the law gave it to him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Charity Failed to Heed States\u2019 Rules With Veterans Event", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump boycotted a televised debate in January, instead holding a high-profile charity event for veterans in Iowa that helped raise millions of dollars from donors around the country.But Mr. Trump\u2019s charitable foundation, the organization through which many of the donations were made, did not take a basic legal step that nonprofit experts say is required of charities when they hold fund-raisers that may draw donors from many states.Some 40 states require registration by charities raising money within their borders. But the Donald J. Trump Foundation does not show up in the charity registers of 38 of those states. The foundation has long been registered in New York, its home state.Failure to register in a state before a fund-raiser is not considered a grave misstep in the nonprofit sector, charity specialists say. The omission can usually be rectified if the organization registers later.Still, the Clinton Foundation, associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, and former President Bill Clinton, appears to be registered in nearly all the states, according to a search of state charity records. And the failure of a prominent charity like the Trump Foundation to register could raise questions about the efficiency of its operations.\u201cThere is a legal requirement for charities to register, not in every state, but in most states, before they start soliciting,\u201d said Sandra Miniutti, the chief financial officer of Charity Navigator, an organization that rates charities. Many charities, particularly smaller ones, often do not fulfill state registration requirements, Ms. Miniutti said. But she added, \u201cAny time a charity fails to follow the law, they risk damaging the public\u2019s perception of their ethics.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s fund-raiser for veterans, held on Jan. 28 in Des Moines, drew much attention at the time because he had decided to go to the event instead of attending a Republican primary debate that evening after a clash with the debate host, Fox News.Charities have to register in states where they raise money so that officials there are aware of their activities. The charities may also have to make financial filings with the state in which they register. The process helps make charities more accountable to donors at the state level.\u201cThe Donald J. Trump Foundation is aware of the state charitable-solicitation requirements and believes it was in compliance,\u201d the foundation said in a statement sent by Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump. Iowa does not require charities to register before soliciting, the statement noted. It also said the fund-raising included \u201ca one-time online donation option for the event, which does not require advance registration.\u201dCharity law specialists said they were not aware of any such sweeping exemption. Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation declined to comment further when asked to explain why it did not need to register in states beyond Iowa for the online fund-raiser.The foundation also may not have registered because it does not have a history of raising money through national appeals. In its statement, the foundation said it \u201chas no plans to solicit funds in the future.\u201dRegistration with the states need not be particularly burdensome. Charities can have state registrations handled for a fee by organizations that will do the paperwork. \u201cTypically, charities, if they are of a decent size, will hire an outside firm to manage it for them,\u201d Ms. Miniutti said.While Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation is unlikely to face stiff penalties for not registering, charity specialists noted that some states, like California and Pennsylvania, were stricter than others in enforcement. Officials from Pennsylvania and California confirmed that the Trump Foundation had not registered in those states.\u201cNo charitable organization shall solicit contributions or have contributions solicited in its behalf before approval of its registration statement,\u201d Pennsylvania\u2019s charities law states.When asked if Mr. Trump\u2019s charity had breached the law, Wanda Murren, a spokeswoman for Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of State, said the state could not automatically assume so.\u201cThe question is whether these organizations are actually soliciting in Pennsylvania and whether they are exempt from registration or are required to register,\u201d Ms. Murren wrote in an email. \u201cWe do not have enough information to say they should be registered.\u201dIf a charity is required to register in Pennsylvania but fails to do so, she said, the penalties can range from fines and civil actions to criminal sanctions. \u201cWhen possible, the bureau will first attempt to get the organization to comply with the law,\u201d she wrote, referring to the state\u2019s Bureau of Corporations and Charitable Organizations.\u201cIn other words,\u201d she added, \u201cthe bureau will let them know they need to register.\u201dBrenda Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for California\u2019s Department of Justice, declined to comment specifically on the Trump Foundation. She said California law did not exempt charities from registering if they planned a one-time fund-raising effort.Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation is also at the heart of a campaign finance case that has recently drawn much attention. In 2013, he made a $25,000 donation to a group that was supporting the Florida attorney general, Pam Bondi. He now faces questions over whether the donation was made to sway her office\u2019s review of fraud allegations at another of his ventures, Trump University.The donation actually came from the Trump Foundation and was in violation of tax regulations, which led him to pay a $2,500 penalty to the Internal Revenue Service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Besieged Globalists Ponder What Went Wrong", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil recently, you didn\u2019t hear people being referred to as \u201cglobalist\u201d very often. But in a time of rising nationalism, those who see the upside of globalism have become a distinct \u2014 and often embattled \u2014 tribe.Last week, the globalists had a big family reunion in New York. The gathering was focused on the United Nations General Assembly, but a growing array of side conferences and summits and dinners also attracted concerned internationalists of every stripe: humanitarians, leaders of nongovernmental organizations, donors, investors, app peddlers, celebrities.Again and again, in private conversations and in public forums, the globalists spoke of feeling besieged. Take the valedictory address of former President Bill Clinton, the paterfamilias of the globalist reunion. The Clinton Global Initiative is one of the major factors in helping to transform what had been a week centered on United Nations diplomacy into a broader Davos-on-the-Hudson for international aspirations.Mr. Clinton spoke of the globalist vision of a \u201cnonzero-sum\u201d world in which everyone wins together and of how that idea was under attack by \u201czero-sum\u201d tribal politics.\u201cArgentina has suffered decades of populism,\u201d Mr. Clinton said in welcoming Mr. Macri. Mr. Clinton told Mr. Khan that he was \u201can example of positive interdependence.\u201d But the panel\u2019s insight was limited by the absence of anyone who could explain populist ire with authenticity \u2014 who could explain why, as Mr. Clinton put it, \u201cthe intensity of the feelings of people resisting our being pulled together outweighs the intensity of those who are winning from this.\u201dThe advocates of a more densely enmeshed world seemed caught in a bind. Their project has long been to get people to enlarge the sphere of their worry, to look beyond national boundaries.I asked Mr. Clinton after his conference about the challenge of balancing help for Kenya with care for Kentucky, in an age when Kentucky anger threatens to push the United States toward less engagement in foreign problems.\u201cWhat you call \u2018Kentucky anger\u2019 is being fed in part by the feeling that the most powerful people in the government, economy, and society no longer care about them, or look down on them,\u201d Mr. Clinton responded via email. \u201cThe pain and road rage we see reflected in the election has been building a long time,\u201d he added.\u201cWhen opportunities are increased in one part of the world,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, \u201cthere are often positive effects where you might least expect them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo\u2019s Reaction to Scandal Fails to Satisfy Angry Lawmakers", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 He is forfeiting at least $41 million in pay. He vows that his bank will drop its sales incentive program \u2014 blamed for prompting bankers to set up illegal and unauthorized bank and credit card accounts to meet their sales goals \u2014 by the end of the week, not in January, as he had previously promised.But at a hearing Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee, nobody was impressed. If anything, the House lawmakers who interrogated John G. Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, were even angrier and more hostile than their Senate counterparts who questioned him last week, before either of those steps had been taken.One by one, Democrats and Republicans alike took turns ripping apart Mr. Stumpf and what took place at the bank he leads. They denounced the actions as \u201ctheft,\u201d \u201ca criminal enterprise,\u201d identity fraud, an outrage and a devastating blow to the entire banking industry.But that was not all of Wells Fargo\u2019s bad news for the day.Also on Thursday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Wells Fargo $20 million for violating rules on lending to members of the military, including a rate cap on how much interest can be charged to service members on active duty.In a separate action, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $4 million to resolve a Justice Department investigation into improper seizures of vehicles owned by soldiers who fell behind on their loans.\u201cIn those instances where some service members did not receive the appropriate benefits and protections, we did not live up to our commitment and we apologize,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe have been notifying and fully compensating customers and will complete this work in 60 days.\u201dThe news did not play well with members of the House committee, who spent more than four hours on Thursday questioning and castigating Mr. Stumpf about the misdeeds under his leadership.\u201cIt appears that the company just can\u2019t make it through even this congressional hearing without us learning more and more information about what is going on at Wells Fargo,\u201d Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat of California, said as word began to spread of the coming sanctions over military lending.At the hearing on Thursday, Mr. Stumpf apologized repeatedly for his bank\u2019s failings and repeated his earlier pledge \u2014 given last week to the disgruntled Senate Finance Committee \u2014 to accept \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for them. But he again rejected lawmakers\u2019 attempts to cast the scandal as a consequence of broader failings in Wells Fargo\u2019s leadership and corporate culture.\u201cI led the company with courage,\u201d Mr. Stumpf said, while admitting that the company \u201cshould have done more sooner\u201d to address the problem of unauthorized accounts being created by employees in the names of real customers.Nine days ago, the leader of Wells Fargo faced a skeptical Senate committee for more than two hours. Today, he was denounced for more than four hours at a House panel.Confronted by the lawmakers with evidence that the practice of setting up phony accounts to meet sales goals might have gone back much further than the bank has admitted, perhaps to 2007, Mr. Stumpf said that Wells Fargo was continuing to investigate the extent of the problem, how far back it stretched and who knew.But those steps did not appease the lawmakers. Several called for Mr. Stumpf\u2019s resignation, and others asked why he shouldn\u2019t be jailed, like a bank robber.\u201cSomething is going wrong at this bank, and you are the head of it,\u201d said Gregory Meeks, Democrat of New York, adding, \u201cYou should be fired.\u201dMr. Stumpf replied, \u201cI serve at the pleasure of the board.\u201d Mr. Stumpf is the board chairman.Mr. Meeks, at times pounding the table for emphasis, asked if Mr. Stumpf would have set free someone who had robbed a Wells Fargo Bank, then simply apologized and taken responsibility. Criticizing Wells Fargo\u2019s \u201ccriminal activity,\u201d Mr. Meeks said: \u201cYour bank, Wells Fargo, has given the entire financial services industry a black eye.\u201d\u201cTo the American people, this kind of feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the committee. \u201cSome institution is found engaging in terrible activities. There is a headline, fine, and yet no one seems to be held accountable.\u201dMr. Hensarling asked whether such fines are simply the \u201ccost of doing business.\u201dMr. Stumpf answered no, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want our culture to be defined by these mistakes.\u201dWells Fargo has said it is contacting all of the customers who may have been affected. So far, the bank has contacted 20,000 customers with questionable credit cards. About a quarter of them have said that they did not apply for the card or could not remember if they had, Mr. Stumpf said at the hearing.Mr. Stumpf carried with him a binder filled with material to help him form his answers, and he consulted it repeatedly as lawmakers questioned him about how many customers with potentially unauthorized accounts had been affected in their own home states. He reeled off the answers: Texas, 149,857; Missouri, 1,191; Delaware, 4,255.The plight of Wells Fargo workers who lost their jobs for not meeting sales goals came up several times during the hearing, with lawmakers citing personal experiences from their constituents. Representative Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez, Democrat of New York, asked how many workers Wells Fargo had fired for falling short.\u201cMy understanding is that people should not be fired, terminated for missing sales goals,\u201d Mr. Stumpf answered. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it didn\u2019t happen. We\u2019re doing a review of whatever, whoever might have been terminated for that.\u201dAs for those who did take the fall for the illegal account openings, Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat of California, was particularly acerbic. \u201cYou fired 5,300 people,\u201d he said at the hearing. \u201cYou took 5,300 good Americans and turned them into felons.\u201d It is time, he concluded, to break up the big banks.Jennifer A.
