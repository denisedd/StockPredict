{"Headline": "How Companies Like Apple Dodge Taxes and Their Own Investors", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs an investor, one who has been entrusted with helping to safeguard other people\u2019s money over many years, I value the high degree of disclosure required from American public companies. Corporations and the world in which they operate change every day, so investors need to know the risks their money faces.No area of business demonstrates the need for full disclosure as much as one that has been in the news a lot lately: large American companies\u2019 shifting profits overseas to minimize tax bills, or to avoid taxes altogether. These schemes are starting to attract the attention of regulators and governments who view them more as tax dodges than as legitimate financial arrangements.Given the risks, the last thing investors need is less disclosure. But the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency responsible to ensure that companies are being open and honest, is considering exactly that: scaling back the information available to the public.This is the wrong direction. We need more information, not less.When the S.E.C. was created in the 1930s, we did not have multinational companies with scores of foreign subsidiaries or the constant risk of government crackdowns on shady tax maneuvers. Today, there are an estimated $2.3 trillion in Fortune 500 company revenues currently booked in tax havens.Lately, these companies have been running into opposition from government regulators. Apple has accumulated billions in profits and, with the assistance of tax-haven-based subsidiaries, managed to pay little tax on those profits to any national government anywhere in the world. As a result of its near-zero tax arrangement with Ireland, Apple will now be embroiled for years in lawsuits relating to a ruling by Europe\u2019s antitrust enforcer, which ordered the company to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes.Earlier this year, French tax authorities raided the Paris offices of Google, and Spanish tax authorities did the same in Madrid. Both countries are calling for billions in back taxes.Several years ago, members of the British government called for a consumer boycott of Starbucks because the company paid no taxes in Britain (all of its revenue was offset by \u201cexpenses\u201d paid in other jurisdictions).Incredibly, even though the blowback against egregious tax practices is a substantial risk to multinational companies and a significant threat for shareholders, it is often impossible for investors to determine how healthy a company really is and whether or not the profits are merely a reflection of aggressive tax planning.The S.E.C.\u2019s mandate is to require companies to provide full disclosure to a \u201creasonable investor.\u201d But no reasonable investor could have known the full scope of Apple\u2019s overseas tax shelters, which were not detailed in the company\u2019s financial releases. That took multiple investigators with subpoena power working for a United States Senate subcommittee nearly a year. And there was no obvious way for investors to know the particulars of Apple\u2019s Irish deal or how risky it might prove to be.And even when disclosures are made, the sheer complexity of a company\u2019s international taxes can make even the most elemental decision impossible. During the dispute of a management buyout of Dell Computer earlier this year, two experts in valuation science, using similar methods and principles, were asked to come up with a ballpark figure for Dell\u2019s true value. Their estimates differed by $28 billion, largely because they reached different conclusions about the company\u2019s overseas taxes.With companies engaging in high-risk tax avoidance, the investing public needs more information, clearly expressed. Investors should, at a minimum, be given a list of all countries in which a company operates, the revenue and earnings attributed to each country, and the amount of taxes paid in each. There might still be disputes but at least investors would be working from the same numbers.Nothing in the current S.E.C. rules requires even that simple statement from companies. If we are going to protect the integrity of the market, we should start by requiring companies to report exactly how they are doing business, including where they pay taxes and how much. The world has changed, and our rules must change with it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Do Those Travel Search Results Look Fishy? Here\u2019s Why", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayFamished after a two-leg cross-country flight rife with delays and scarce on nutrition, I tapped open Google Maps on my phone and scanned the area around my LAX airport hotel for someplace interesting to eat.But why had chains popped up first? Isn\u2019t my smartphone supposed to know me better than that? Could they have paid for exposure? Had an algorithm gone awry?As travelers, we\u2019re ever more dependent on apps and online services that show us what to eat or where to sleep. Yet we (or at least I) often forget those sites are not public utilities that exist to make us happy but for-profit businesses trying to make a buck.Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, as long as it\u2019s transparent.The food side was more straightforward. All four companies said there was no direct way for restaurants to pay for higher visibility in their listings or on their maps, except through clearly marked advertisements. A Google spokesman, Joe Osborne, was unequivocal: Search results \u201chave nothing to do with any sort of commercial relationship.\u201dSo why McDonald\u2019s?In short: It\u2019s the algorithm, stupid. Or in this case: It\u2019s the stupid algorithm.MapQuest also said businesses cannot pay for a boost. Its clean, attractive results are a mash-up of more than 40 data sources. Yelp and TripAdvisor base their choices largely or entirely on user reviews and also said it was impossible for businesses to pay to raise their visibility.But restaurants can influence their success with customers indirectly by paying for what Yelp calls an \u201cenhanced profile\u201d and TripAdvisor a \u201cbusiness listing.\u201d Such companies don\u2019t appear higher; they appear better. In Yelp\u2019s case improvements include a photo slide show, the elimination of competitor ads from their profile page and the capacity to insert \u201ccall-to-action\u201d buttons \u2014 to print a coupon, for example.Despite similar setups, Yelp and TripAdvisor searches yield different results. Darnell Holloway, a spokesman for Yelp, said that the site cultivates community participation, leading to more reviews by locals than you might find on TripAdvisor.Which is better? That\u2019s up to you. An adventurous visitor to Taipei might use Yelp to seek local favorites; less daring types might prefer TripAdvisor reviews written by travelers with similar tastes \u2014 even filtering for English-speaking family groups (or solo Russians).Lodging sites were far more complicated. When you plug in a destination and dates on Booking.com and Expedia, the order of results is largely determined by how frequently customers reserve a particular property once they\u2019ve clicked on it, the \u201cconversion\u201d rate.Whether that is beneficial to the consumer is up for debate. It is definitely beneficial to Booking and Expedia, which would prefer closing the sale before you try another site (or take a nap).But hotels can also pay, one way or another, to nudge their way up the list.Even as a frequent Booking.com customer, I had never noticed that a yellow \u201cthumbs up\u201d symbol appears next to many top listings. Users might think that indicates an objective seal of approval. But it actually means that the hotel participates in the \u201cPreferred Property Program,\u201d through which it pays Booking a higher commission rate in exchange for being bumped ahead of all or most nonparticipants. If users somehow think to hover the cursor over the symbol (in the website version), they get a semi-explanation that does not reveal that hotels pay for this privilege.Booking.com notes that hotels in this category must meet certain minimum standards, including solid review scores and few customer complaints. But I find this questionable. Exhibit A: In my searches on Booking.com for New York City, the Hotel Pennsylvania came up consistently in the top five. When I sorted hotels by user ratings, it came up 381st of 383 in the city. It does, however, have a thumbs up.Leslie Cafferty, a spokeswoman for Booking, attributed its high visibility to its excellent conversion rate.Expedia also allows hotels to pay a higher commission in exchange for better placement in search results. Sarah Gavin, a spokeswoman, said that hotels tend to use that when they have rooms to fill.Hotels can also appeal to customers with daily deals, perks and the like. In general, those seem transparent and useful. But Expedia will also \u201cdim\u201d hotels that do not offer the company their best prices by, for instance, eliminating photos from its profile. They say that\u2019s rare; Ms. Cafferty said Booking avoids the practice.Luckily, users can escape some of the manipulation by personalizing results, sorting by review score or price and applying filters.One last thing: Google Maps and Yelp and their competitors show just about every restaurant that\u2019s out there, whether it\u2019s a paying partner or not. But most lodging sites are incomplete: For example, hotels and inns not willing to fork over a hefty commission on bookings won\u2019t be listed.Or, notably, TripAdvisor, which is unique among sites I use in allowing hotels to be listed and reviewed even if you can\u2019t book via the site, a legacy of when TripAdvisor didn\u2019t offer bookings. One point for them.Well, three-quarters of a point. If you click on the Bowen Farm or Friendly Bike pages, TripAdvisor nudges you toward reserving somewhere else. (Unlike Booking and Expedia, the only place hotels can pay for a boost in search results is in a slot marked \u201csponsored,\u201d a spokesman said. )Bottom line: The pickiest among us (those who strive to find that homey Kentucky inn or local Los Angeles burger joint) need to be more diligent. For the rest, Yelp and Booking and the like are miracles of convenience, and will usually lead you to pretty good choices, especially if you keep in mind that their bottom line is always the bottom line.Advertisement"}

However, the land is also claimed by China, the Philippines and Vietnam.In a statement, Google said: \u201cWe received the request and are looking into it.

{"Headline": "For the Debaters: What Shall We Do About the Tech Careening Our Way?", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtHere\u2019s a question I\u2019m hoping comes up at Monday\u2019s presidential debate: Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump, what would you do about self-driving trucks?That sounds goofy, but it\u2019s big league. The self-driving truck is an 18-wheeled trick question barreling toward us from an uncertain future. In testing how Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton might respond to the not-too-distant possibility of trucks that drive themselves, we might get at something most political debates fail to address: how the candidates are weighing the costs and benefits of rapid, unpredictable and transformative technological change.But it wouldn\u2019t all be rainbows. At least at first, the autonomous technology wouldn\u2019t be perfect. Errors and bugs, perhaps fatal ones, might spark politically damaging fear and outrage. In the long run, if the trucks prove successful and our logistics infrastructure adjusts to accommodate them, they could begin to displace the three million Americans (mostly men) who now drive trucks for a living, not to mention truck stops and the small towns that depend on them.There would be deeper issues to consider: The threat of hacking, the narrowing economic control over a vital lane of national commerce, and a growing detachment from America\u2019s ineffable, often irrational love affair with the open road.Though less than a year old, Otto has a fleet of six trucks now constantly driving across California to test its technology, which the company aims to sell as an aftermarket add-on to trucking companies sometime in the next few years. When it\u2019s for sale, Otto\u2019s system will drive the truck fully on freeways; the driver will take over on all other roads, as well as assist in other functions (refueling, filling out paperwork).How Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton think about autonomous trucks is in some ways a test case for their ideas about technology generally. It might reveal how they would weigh the benefits of innovation \u2014 which usually accrue diffusely to the nation at large \u2014 against the particular burdens borne by a small group (the truck drivers who might lose their jobs, in this case).Their answer might also illuminate how they would balance competing advances and losses for the economy, the labor market, health and safety and the environment. More fundamentally, their thoughts on trucks could give us a look into their deepest ideas about technology. Are they more inclined toward bold, optimistic grabs at the future, or to recoil at the potentially devastating possibilities of its being unleashed?As far as I can tell, Mr. Trump has not talked about self-driving trucks.\u201cA new truck costs $160,000 to $200,000, and they can basically only drive it nine hours a day,\u201d Mr. Ron said. With Otto\u2019s technology, the driver would be able to double his output \u2014 he could drive all day, then take a nap while the rig barrels along the road, then come back to driving.\u201cThe truck is always productive,\u201d Mr. Ron said. \u201cThey\u2019re making more money, because they can use it more. They\u2019re seeing their families more often, because they can finish their long-haul routes faster. And most importantly, they\u2019re safer.\u201dThe technology is not there yet. During a recent ride on the freeways surrounding Otto\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, an Otto driver and engineer showed me how the prototype was working. After self-driving was flipped on, the rig handled most conditions fairly well \u2014 it steered itself around bends and maintained a consistent distance from other vehicles.But about a half-dozen times during the 20-minute ride, the cab emitted a sharp beep warning the driver that it detected some trouble, and that it needed him to immediately take over. The engineer noted each of these instances; back at the office, Otto\u2019s techies will examine each incident to teach the system better tricks.For truck drivers, the benefits of automation are less certain. Kara Deniz, a spokeswoman for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, told me the union had not issued any policy decisions on automation because there were more questions than answers about the impact of self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe believe experienced, skilled drivers will be needed well into the future,\u201d she added.Several truckers I talked to were resistant to automation.\u201cThe idea that we\u2019ll go to automated trucks and then drivers will sleep while the truck drives \u2014 not a chance in hell. I would never do that,\u201d Wade Dowden, 32, who\u2019s been driving a truck for 10 years, told me while he was on the road in Houston.Mr. Dowden is no technophobe. He said easy access to live maps and mobile entertainment had made everything about driving a truck much less stressful than before. Now Mr. Dowden spends his days listening to audiobooks and podcasts, and when he\u2019s not driving, he watches Netflix and studies for a degree in transportation management.Yet he isn\u2019t ready to turn over his truck to a computer.\u201cIt would make the job not worth doing,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019re only paying a guy to drive the final miles into a city, we\u2019re certainly not going to get a raise for that.\u201dThat leads back to what Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump might say about self-driving trucks if they were asked on Monday. There are many potential policy ideas to delay, accelerate or ease this transition. They could ban self-driving trucks entirely. Or they could also institute a retraining program for drivers. Or do nothing and see what happens.Mr. Dowden, though, has no faith either will do anything meaningful to address the issue, because he thinks both are out of touch. \u201cThey just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Civil liberties groups and media organizations like Fox News, National Public Radio and The Washington Post submitted their own briefs.Microsoft\u2019s effort to rally support is part of a growing resistance by technology companies to government attempts to snoop on the electronic communications of their customers.In a statement, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company was grateful for the support from what it expected to total 80 signatories on multiple briefs by the end of the day. He noted the diversity of backgrounds of the signatories, saying, \u201cit\u2019s not every day that Fox News and the A.C.L.U. are on the same side of an issue.\u201d\u201cWe believe the constitutional rights at stake in this case are of fundamental importance, and people should know when the government accesses their emails unless secrecy is truly needed,\u201d Mr. Smith added.Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department, declined to comment.Microsoft said the secrecy orders violated the Fourth Amendment, which grants people and businesses the right to know if the government seizes or searches their property, along with the company\u2019s First Amendment right to communicate with its customers.Technology companies are concerned that secrecy orders are especially troubling in the era of cloud computing. \u201cIn contrast to a search of a home or a seizure of physical property, there may be no way for a user to detect that the provider has disclosed information stored in the account to the government,\u201d the brief filed by Amazon, Google and others said.The Microsoft lawsuit is different in that it does not center on any individual case, but instead is aimed at the legal process the government uses to keep its information requests secret.The company said such secrecy orders are becoming more frequent. In its lawsuit, Microsoft said of the more than 5,600 federal demands for customer data it received between September 2014 and March 2016, nearly half were accompanied by secrecy orders that prevented Microsoft from telling affected customers that it had turned over their information to the government.Microsoft executives have said they appreciate the necessity of secrecy orders in some cases. But they have criticized as too low the bar that prosecutors must meet to obtain a secrecy order from courts.Microsoft is also concerned about the absence of time limits on when it can disclose to customers that the government has obtained their communications. For physical searches of files and the like, most secrecy orders delay notification for a limited period of time, often one to three months.\u201cLaw enforcement officials have no practical need to keep their searches secret indefinitely, except in the rarest of circumstances, which must be supported by particularized need,\u201d read the brief filed Friday by former United States attorneys supporting Microsoft.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "JetBlue Makes Biofuels Deal to Curtail Greenhouse Gases", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJetBlue, seeking to get ahead of looming restrictions on airliners\u2019 greenhouse gas pollution, has agreed to buy more than 330 million gallons of renewable fuel over 10 years, the company said on Monday.It is one of the largest such purchase agreements yet.Under the agreement with the bioenergy company SG Preston, JetBlue would cover about 20 percent of its annual fuel use at Kennedy International Airport, its home base, with a biofuel blend. That is equivalent to 4 percent of the fuel used throughout its network, the airline said.\u201cIt\u2019s thinking long term about our biggest cost, but its primary motivation is to reduce our greenhouse gases,\u201d said Sophia Mendelsohn, JetBlue\u2019s head of sustainability. \u201cWhat we really want to do is jump-start the industry and quite frankly enable all airlines, very much ourselves included, to diversify our fuel supply.\u201dBiofuels, made from various sorts of organic matter \u2014 whether from agriculture, wood scraps or even municipal waste \u2014 have long been considered important to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transportation. United States rules for gasoline, for example, require at least 10 percent ethanol, which typically comes from corn.Airlines represent potentially easy-to-serve customers for biofuels, given the carriers\u2019 concentration around airports and their voracious energy needs. But with heavy pressure on the companies\u2019 bottom lines, the advent of more efficient planes and a period of low oil prices, the airlines \u2014 with a few exceptions \u2014 have been slow to adopt the novel and more expensive fuels.\u201cAt the end of the day, the vibe that we\u2019ve heard from the industry is, \u2018We\u2019ll use it once it\u2019s cost-competitive, we\u2019ll use it once there\u2019s enough volume,\u2019\u201d said Yuan-Sheng Yu, who leads alternative fuels research at Lux Research. \u201cThis is not an industry with the amounts of cash on hand to invest in these emerging, nonproven technologies.\u201dBut there are signs that may be changing. Last year, United began using a biofuel blend on some of its flights from Los Angeles. In recent weeks, Lufthansa tentatively agreed to buy as many as eight million gallons of fuel a year over five years from Gevo, a Colorado-based biofuel developer, Gevo announced. And Virgin Atlantic announced a successful test of a jet fuel from LanzaTech derived from waste gases from steel mills.Given the industry\u2019s global reach, devising rules to control greenhouse gas emissions has proved contentious and given rise to a regulatory patchwork that companies say could be costly, lead to safety risks and create disadvantages for airlines from different jurisdictions. An effort by the European Union to require United States planes landing in European airports to reduce emissions or pay a fee, for example, encountered so much resistance that regulators approved a partial exemption that expires next year.In recent months, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the aviation agency of the United Nations, approved one set of standards while the Obama administration began the process of writing its own last year. Environmentalists say the international restrictions, written with strong industry input, are too weak, and are pushing for more stringent standards from the Environmental Protection Agency.At the same time, the aviation industry has been looking to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions though a number of approaches, including building more efficient aircraft and supporting the development and approval of new fuels.That has been challenging, said Sean Newsum, director of environmental strategy at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, which is active around the world in helping to develop and certify biofuels for commercial use. In one of the projects this summer, with South African Airways and its Mango affiliate, 300 passengers flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town on fuel derived from tobacco grown for the purpose.\u201cThere\u2019s many different moving pieces to get this into real commercial use, all the way from the growing of the feedstock to the processing of the fuel to delivering that fuel to the airplane,\u201d Mr. Newsum said. \u201cIt takes a while for all of those processes to become stitched together in a standard way,\u201d he added, and to bring down their costs.A long-term customer agreement like JetBlue\u2019s, energy experts say, is an important step for a developer to attract financing to build a new facility \u2014 much as energy-purchase agreements by companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have allowed for the construction of solar or wind farms to help meet their electricity needs.Mr. LeTang said interest in buying biofuel was growing within the industry. Still, that is no guarantee that a project will pan out.A five-year agreement by British Airways to purchase all of the output from a facility that Solena Fuels planned to build outside London, to convert municipal solid waste to jet fuel, collapsed after Solena failed to raise enough money. It could not compete with cheap oil.At JetBlue, Ms. Mendelsohn said she worked for the better part of a year to bring the deal to fruition. She would not say how much the fuel would cost, but that, with subsidies available for biofuels, it would be competitive with conventional jet fuel.Under the agreement, JetBlue will purchase more than 33 million gallons a year of a fuel made from plant oils for at least 10 years; that fuel will be blended with 70 percent traditional jet fuel. SG Preston plans to build a refinery in Ohio to produce mainly renewable diesel and jet fuel, the first of many it hopes to develop.An article on Tuesday about JetBlue\u2019s deal to buy 330 million gallons of biofuel over 10 years from the bioenergy firm SG Preston referred incorrectly to the company\u2019s chief executive. As the article correctly noted, he is Randy Delbert LeTang, and therefore is not \u201cMr. Preston.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article described incorrectly the activity shown. An airport worker was servicing the water tank of the JetBlue aircraft; he was not refueling it.An article on Sept. 20 about JetBlue\u2019s agreement to buy 300 million gallons of renewable fuel over 10 years misidentified the company that announced a similar deal for the purchase of renewable fuels by Lufthansa, and misstated the status of the deal. It was announced by Gevo, a Colorado-based biofuel developer, not by Lufthansa. And the deal is tentative, not confirmed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Does the Messaging Service Telegram Take Privacy Too Far?", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropePARIS \u2014 The encryption of digital information is considered the best protection against hackers, snoops or potential enemies looking to poke around into private exchanges of all sorts.That is why technology experts and privacy advocates in Europe went on high alert last month when the French Ministry of the Interior suggested that it might limit encryption as part of the fight against terrorist threats.Mr. Cazeneuve named one such service: Telegram, a three-year-old messaging application, that is a favorite of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years.Telegram\u2019s vaunted privacy safeguards, involving multiple servers in different countries, are designed to prevent access to information about its users, even by the service itself.At the news conference, Mr. Cazeneuve admitted as much but claimed that French investigators, armed with a court order, had been unable to even contact \u201can interlocutor\u201d at Telegram.In response to a query on his Telegram account, Pavel Durov, co-founder of the service, batted back the widely reported French claims.\u201cWe haven\u2019t received any such request and have no idea what the French officials are after,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn any case, Telegram Secret Chats and information on them are not logged on our servers.\u201dMr. Durov\u2019s background explains his die-hard libertarian attitude on privacy. He left his native Russia in 2014 after refusing to give intelligence information about Ukrainian protesters.However, most privacy advocates agree that messaging services should cooperate with court-issued warrants, even if they are unable to provide investigators with complete information about their users.\u201cThere is an issue with Telegram,\u201d said Mounir Mahjoubi, president of the National Digital Council, an independent advisory group established by former President Nicolas Sarkozy that focuses on privacy issues. \u201cThey had done everything to make it a technological nightmare to find where their server is.\u201dAt a time of heightened public anxiety over terrorism, technology companies and privacy advocates are wary about politicians looking to mandate \u201cback door\u201d access to encrypted data.This, they say, would not only violate privacy rights but put the wider public at an even greater risk, leaving users even more vulnerable to terrorists and other criminals.Mr. Mahjoubi, for one, supports alternative approaches, such as an international network that could call on judges in individual countries to swiftly react to requests from antiterrorism investigators.These ideas also are also backed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a lobbying organization that counts Amazon, Google and Microsoft among its members.\u201cCyberspace blurs the notion of national jurisdictions, and companies are caught in the middle,\u201d said Christian Borggreen, the organization\u2019s Europe director. \u201cThe tech industry encourages like-minded nations to develop international frameworks for quicker response to law enforcement requests while respecting users\u2019 right and the rule of law.\u201dThat kind of targeted approach \u2014 aimed at criminals, not at privacy \u2014 would be more effective than a blank check for law enforcement to break open encoded messages, Mr. Mahjoubi said.\u201cI am deeply and heartily against any effort to limit encryption,\u201d he said, \u201cand I will fight my whole life against that possibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Victory for Press Freedom in 1735 Set an Important Precedent", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.More than half a century after A.J. Liebling declared that freedom of the press \u201cis guaranteed only to those who own one,\u201d the quip seems doubly out of date. For one thing, anyone with access to the internet can now be said to \u201cown one\u201d and to enjoy the freedoms of the First Amendment with abandon. At the same time, the people Liebling had in mind, owners of the press in the more institutional sense, find their guarantee of freedom less than ironclad.The enemies of unfettered journalism in the United States these days include prosecutors crying \u201cnational security\u201d in hot pursuit of leakers; a presidential candidate who vows, if elected, to \u201copen up\u201d the libel laws so that when journalists offend \u201cwe can sue them and win lots of money\u201d; and, in one bizarre case, a vengeful Silicon Valley billionaire bankrolling lawsuits aimed at driving an impertinent website out of business.Many of the questions at the heart of the matter are the same ones that have been asked since before there was a First Amendment: Are opinions protected no matter how obnoxious? Are public figures fairer game than private citizens? Is it a crime to publish material that undermines the authority of government? Is a statement libel if it\u2019s true?So Richard Kluger decided this was an apt time to revisit the story of John Peter Zenger\u2019s New-York Weekly Journal, culminating in an August 1735 courtroom drama that put those questions to the test.Kluger\u2019s last venture into the history of American journalism was \u201cThe Paper,\u201d his monumental 1986 autopsy of The New York Herald Tribune, and he brings the same gifts to this more modest book: vivid storytelling built on exacting research, a knack for animating the context and an exquisite sense of balance that honors this country\u2019s essential press freedom without romanticizing its champions.The champions of \u201cIndelible Ink\u201d are Lewis Morris and James Alexander, two colonial lawyers and power brokers whose motives are anything but pure. The context is a colonial America ruled, or more often misruled, by crown-appointed governors and swayed by mighty factions \u2014 the land barons who farm vast estates versus the merchant princes who control trade.Morris, a calculating but intemperate attorney, is a holder of large estates, and also large grudges, mostly against powerful figures who seek to thwart his ambitions. Alexander is \u201cprobably the foremost and perhaps wealthiest lawyer in New York,\u201d a longtime political adviser to Morris and a prolific wordsmith.As the central drama begins, Morris has already helped engineer the ouster of two royal governors and has locked horns with a third, William Cosby. When Cosby proves tenacious, Morris and Alexander decide to wheel in a novel piece of artillery: a newspaper.\u201cTo understate the matter, the printing trade was not much encouraged in colonial America,\u201d Kluger observes. Although imperial rules had relaxed a bit from the previous century, when a defamatory publication could subject the offender to \u201cthe amputation of the ears,\u201d the colonies had inherited British common law, which essentially defined as \u201cseditious libel\u201d anything that annoyed anyone in power. The prevailing legal text of the time declared that not only was truth not a defense against prosecution, it also compounded the offense, \u201csince the greater appearance there is of truth in any malicious invective, so much the more provoking it is.\u201d Speaking ill of a public figure, the prevailing jurisprudence added, \u201chas a direct tendency to breed in the people a dislike of their governors and incline them to faction and sedition.\u201dSomehow Morris and Alexander persuade Peter Zenger, a German-American printer, to risk everything by pushing the limits of official tolerance. Whether Zenger was moved by profit, idealism or something else is unknown, as is almost everything else about the man. Kluger resorts to a lot of \u201cwas probably\u201d and \u201cwe can only imagine\u201d and \u201cmight well have\u201d to sketch a speculative portrait of a young immigrant from the German Palatinate who takes up an apprenticeship with a printer and eventually sets up his own shop, producing religious tracts and works in German and Dutch. There is nothing in the record to suggest that he would publish \u201cAmerica\u2019s first printed expression of overt political dissent.\u201d The reason Zenger became the sole defendant and languished in jail when authorities ultimately cracked down on his little weekly is that while writers \u2014 first and foremost James Alexander, who supplied most of Zenger\u2019s content \u2014 hid behind pen names, printers were obliged by law to sign their work.The New-York Weekly Journal debuted on Nov. 5, 1733, four compact pages of gray type. The first sign that this publication was different appeared on Page 2, a lively report on an assembly election \u201cthat modern journalists would recognize as creditable reportage.\u201d Subsequent issues contained little eyewitness reporting, but increasingly bold satire and polemic aimed (though the target was not named) at Governor Cosby. The newspaper\u2019s complaints against the governor\u2019s corruption and abuse of power were often vague, undocumented and hyperbolic, including the assertion that Cosby was \u201cbut one degree removed from an idiot.\u201d Kluger makes no attempt to defend the newspaper as an ancestor of modern journalism, although you can trace a line of descent from \u00adZenger\u2019s weekly to the Gawker school.After failing repeatedly to persuade a grand jury to indict Zenger, Governor Cosby\u2019s men find a way to haul the printer into a court presided over by a Cosby crony. The judge signals his leaning \u00adearly on by disbarring Zenger\u2019s lawyers and appointing a far less experienced \u00addefender. But the Zenger defense team springs a surprise: After opening remarks, the court-appointed defender yields to a legal virtuoso, Andrew Hamilton of Philadelphia, \u201cthe most accomplished barrister in the American colonies,\u201d famed for having \u201cthe vivacity, wit and incandescent presence of a great Shakespearean actor.\u201dWhat ensues is a gripping courtroom confrontation that Kluger reconstructs mainly from the detailed notes of the defense lawyers, there being no official transcript. Alexander\u2019s strategy is daring, bordering on subversive. He concedes that \u00adZenger published the offending material, but asserts that it was no crime because the material was true. Moreover, he argues that, British common law be damned, there is a \u201cnatural right\u201d to complain about abusive rulers \u2014 to \u201cput their neighbors upon their guard against the craft or even \u00adviolence of men in \u00adauthority.\u201dThe chief justice has instructed the jurors that their role is solely to rule on the facts of the case, leaving to him the question of whether the facts add up to a crime. But the jury goes rogue and after the briefest of deliberations declares \u00adZenger not guilty.The Zenger case did not change the law; courts in Britain and the colonies continued to treat affronts to the government as criminal. But the principle that truth cannot be libel has been recognized in American common law for well over a century; and Kluger makes a convincing case that The New-York Weekly Journal and the jurors who balked at convicting Zenger 40 years before the Revolution \u201chelped implant in the public mind that open protest against an imposed and arguably unjust government was both a societal necessity and a civil right.\u201dIn an epilogue, Kluger flashes forward to the case of Edward Snowden, the intelligence insider who exposed the government\u2019s invasion of our phones and emails, to demonstrate that \u201cfree expression remains nearly as imperiled\u201d today as in the 18th century. Whatever you think of Snowden, that\u2019s a stretch. No journalist has been indicted \u2014 or silenced \u2014 for publishing Snowden\u2019s secrets. A more immediate menace to a robust press is the insatiable appetite of Google and Facebook, sucking away what\u2019s left of the advertising revenues that support aggressive reporting. But that\u2019s another book.A review on Sept. 18 about \u201cIndelible Ink: The Trials of John Peter Zenger and the Birth of America\u2019s Free Press,\u201d by Richard Kluger, misstated the legal impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan in 1964. The court ruled that a public official cannot prevail in a libel suit against a publisher without showing actual malice on the publisher\u2019s part, even if the statements in question were false and defamatory. The ruling did not in fact \u201cfully secure\u201d the \u201cprinciple that truth cannot be libel\u201d \u2014 that principle has been part of American common law for well over a century.Bill Keller, a former executive editor of The Times, is editor in chief of The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that covers criminal justice.Advertisement"}

Racism, they say, plays no part in it.At Chowchilla High School, outside Merced, one of four schools across the state affected by the Redskins ban, officials said their intentions in using the mascot were misunderstood.\u201cHere, the Chowchilla Redskins emboldens the spirit of strength, honor and respect,\u201d said Marty Piepenbrok, a community relations spokesman. \u201cThere is nothing disparaging about it whatsoever.\u201dThe school has until January to drop the mascot.Even without a broader ban, however, many schools have responded voluntarily to the concerns of Indian tribes by swapping out their Native American mascots. Others have tried to sidestep the issue by dropping just the imagery associated with the names.For Winters High School, home of the Warriors, that has meant a low-key phasing out of the school symbol depicting an Indian man in headdress.The name will stay, said Todd Cutler, the superintendent of the district outside Sacramento.

{"Headline": "36 Hours in the Cinque Terre, Italy", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementA century ago the Cinque Terre were simply five fishing villages on an unforgiving stretch of the Ligurian coast in northwestern Italy. With trains came tourism, and now throngs arrive daily to see it all: the startlingly vibrant color of the Mediterranean, the wildly rugged coastline sliced by scenic hiking trails, and the tiny towns tucked like puzzle pieces into the cliffs. The region has recovered from the mudslides and flooding of 2011 that devastated the towns of Monterosso and Vernazza, and that decommissioned trails along the famous coastal path between the other villages: Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore. But another threat still looms: over-tourism. Possible remedies? Widen the scope of your itinerary to include neighboring towns (Levanto to the north and Portovenere to the south), seek out lesser-known trails and travel off-season when crowds are thinner. The viability of this magnificent but fragile area may depend on such decisions.\nExplore street view, find things to do in the Cinque Terre and sign in to your Google account to save your map.\nA strenuous hike ought to culminate with rest and a reward, both of which can be procured at Nessun Dorma. This casual outdoor bar, which opened in 2014, occupies a landscaped terrace on a promontory overlooking Manarola\u2019s timeless vista: pastel houses perched on a cliff, fishing boats in a small harbor, tanned teenagers diving off the breakwater into the indigo sea. Claim a table in the gardenlike seating area and order a limoncino spritz, a refreshing riff on the classic that mixes the local lemon liqueur with prosecco and mint in a glass jam jar (8 euros, or about $9).While most visitors are vying for seats at the same dozen restaurants touted by seemingly every guidebook, shake the crowds by dining at a worthy newcomer in Riomaggiore. Opened last summer, Rio Bistrot is a modern osteria nestled above the village\u2019s minuscule harbor serving dishes that showcase the bounty of the local sea. At a table on the stone terrace, watch fishermen haul in the day\u2019s catch while savoring buttered toasts topped with plump anchovies from Monterosso (13 euros) and paccheri with fresh mussels from Riomaggiore (15 euros). And book in advance; this spot won\u2019t remain undiscovered for long.Vernazza is arguably the most photogenic \u2014 and popular \u2014 village, so arrive early before it\u2019s overrun with day-trippers. Pop into Batti Batti\u2019, a hole-in-the-wall focacceria, for a take-away breakfast of cheesy focaccia di Recco or pesto-slathered pizza (4 euros each). Then head to the quay to picnic while admiring the lemon-hued church, bobbing boats in the harbor and the pretty main piazza slowly coming to life. Return to Riomaggiore and follow signs for the Via dell\u2019Amore. This romantic cliff-top path, part of the Sentiero Azzurro, is closed indefinitely, but similar views can be found at A Pi\u00e8 de M\u00e0, a cafe and bar in a magnificent location near the trailhead. At a table on the terrace, high above the churning sea, try a glass of Cinque Terre wine from Walter de Batt\u00e8, a small artisanal producer of the region\u2019s floral white blend (6 euros). Prefer eating among Italians rather than in a polyglot dining room? Then reserve a table at L\u2019Articiocca, a cozy restaurant that opened in 2013 on a quiet side street in Levanto, one train stop north of Monterosso. Once seated on the patio, start with the Levanto specialty gattafin, pastalike fritters stuffed with spinach and wild herbs. Then order the trofie al pesto, twisted Ligurian pasta served in the traditional manner, with potatoes and green beans. The aromatic green sauce is prepared tableside with a well-worn mortar and pestle \u2014 a fun flourish that doubles as a free cooking lesson. Service is extremely genial but slow, so use the time between courses to sample rare craft beers produced by small Ligurian breweries, like Birra del Bracco and Genova\u2019s Maltus Faber. Dinner for two, about 70 euros. This may be the Italian Riviera, but the only Cinque Terre town with a wide swath of beach is Monterosso. In high season, rows of umbrellas in a rainbow of colors line the town\u2019s spiaggia di Fegina, each hue demarcating a different beach club. Arrive early to claim a spot on the free public beach, or pay for a sun-lounger to spend the morning relaxing in the shade of an umbrella between dips in the turquoise sea.Hundreds of steps separate the train station from the center of Corniglia, but the ascent is worth it for a truly local lunch. At Km 0, a small panino shop that opened in 2013, sandwiches and salads are composed of hyperlocal ingredients, like the Pignone panino with Ligurian sausage and fresh stracchino cheese from nearby Brugnato (5 euros). For dessert, walk down the street to Alberto Gelateria, an artisanal gelato shop where Corniglia\u2019s own products, like honey and basil, are used to create sensational flavors.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified one of the five towns of Cinque Terre.

{"Headline": "Hopes for Democracy\u2019s Spread Meet With Harsh Facts", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Democracy 2016WASHINGTON \u2014 These are tough days for enthusiasts of the world\u2019s steady march of democracy.A wave of nationalism \u2014 led by calls to raise the drawbridges against outsiders and their influence \u2014 has ushered in strongmen in places where, just a few years ago, democratic institutions seemed inevitably on the rise. Across the globe, the effects are clear: When nativism becomes a rallying call, tolerance and a willingness to compromise, the lubricants of liberal democracy, often seep away. The effects are dramatic. For a long while, American officials convinced themselves that Russia was gradually edging toward integrating itself in Western institutions, and the values they represent.But President Vladimir V. Putin has squeezed the life out of independent news media and any meaningful dissent in Russia. Increasingly, to oppose his government is to risk ending up dead.President Xi Jinping, who many in the Obama Administration thought four years ago would bring a modern, technocratic veneer to Chinese rule, and restrain its worst tendencies toward brutality, has veered in directions few in the administration predicted. The digital Great Wall is higher and thicker than ever. Newspapers and other publications have been shuttered, and his government has jailed dissidents on the vague charge of causing \u201cdisorderly\u201d debate. In Turkey, a freely elected leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, used a coup attempt against his government to execute what was clearly a preplanned purge that has cast thousands into prison, from schoolteachers to journalists. Washington has been reluctant to protest. It needs its bases in Turkey for the conflict in Syria. More than five years after the Obama administration urged President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to step down in the face of the protests, it is delivering arms and aid to his successor once removed, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a former general whose iron-fisted rule exceeds anything Mr. Mubarak ever managed to pull off. Yet Egypt\u2019s cooperation is so needed to keep a lid on the Middle East that the State Department is extraordinarily hesitant to condemn a situation in which democracy is a distant memory. Poland, the most effective of the newer members of NATO, has turned to a right-wing government, as has Hungary. In Austria, a presidential election in a few weeks could see the election of Norbert Hofer, who leads an anti-immigrant party.It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. The end of Cold War rivalries, China\u2019s growing wealth and integration with the world economy, the benefits of global trade and the internet\u2019s ability to wipe away traditional borders were supposed to make variations on the theme of democratic rule the inevitable choice.That was the meaning of \u201cThe End of History and the Last Man,\u201d Francis Fukuyama\u2019s 1992 book, which posited that the fall of the Berlin Wall was \u201cthe end point of mankind\u2019s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\u201d There are a few bright spots.In 1998, Indonesia looked like it might break apart after the fall of Suharto. Today it is an unruly but real democracy. From Africa to Latin America, there are stirrings of democratic instincts in places where they had rarely taken root. Yet ask around the world, and it is clear that the Western democracies that were supposed to be the model for a new, interconnected world look a lot less attractive than they once did. Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi deride the \u201cAmerican model\u201d as a prescription for disorder and decay. The election drama unfolding in the United States has fueled that argument, prompting many to question whether the style of democracy America preaches, for all its obvious benefits, brings out the worst instincts in an electorate.How did this happen? In a world where the internet was supposed to make everyone aware of the benefits of more direct democracy, how did the forces of order and authoritarianism roar back? How does one explain the rise of My-Country-First candidates like Donald J. Trump and the French far-right politician Marine Le Pen, both of whom have said that promoting democracy around the world is not a goal? The answers so far seem unsatisfying. Yes, the economic downturn that swept the world starting in 2007 left untold millions behind, and many have never caught up. A McKinsey Global Institute study concluded that roughly two-thirds of households in the world\u2019s wealthy countries saw their disposable income stagnate in the decade after the downturn, a sharp change from the decade before. The well-documented populist anger at elites, and the income inequality those elites represent, are often blamed for the backlash that has followed. But that is the kind of problem that working democracies are supposed to self-correct. Without question, Twitter, Facebook and the advent of mobile communications brought down dictators during the Arab Spring. It is hard to imagine the furious, seemingly spontaneous gatherings seen in Tahrir Square in Cairo and on the streets of Aleppo, Syria, without instant communications. Twitter, however, is better at starting a revolution than completing one. It can help organize a protest but not a government. That requires a set of skills that the street revolutionaries in Egypt, somewhat na\u00efvely, told Secretary of State Hillary Clinton they were uninterested in pursuing. It wasn\u2019t their job to create a new government, they told her on a visit to Egypt in the spring of 2011, not long after Mr. Mubarak was packed off to jail. She left dumbstruck, she told a reporter in her office shortly afterward.\u201cIf you don\u2019t organize, if you don\u2019t pick candidates, if you don\u2019t participate in the process, the Islamists are going to win,\u201d she recounted telling the protesters. They ignored her. Soon after the Islamists won the election, a countercoup put the generals back in charge, and now both the Muslim Brotherhood, which provided the first successor to Mr. Mubarak, and many of the protesters are locked up. Even in established democracies, the era of instant communications is having effects that few predicted. Mr. Trump has capitalized on those changes better than any politician in modern memory, brilliantly outmaneuvering 16 rivals who did not realize that the rules had changed.\u201cModern media enhances transparency, but that is a two-edged sword for democracy,\u201d said Joseph S. Nye Jr., the Harvard professor who wrote, most recently, \u201cIs the American Century Over?\u201d (He concluded that it has a lot of gas left.) \u201cMore people have information that allows them to participate, but leaders have less time and space for the deliberation and compromise that Madison believed were essential to effective democratic government.\u201d In fact, if there is a lesson of the past decade, it may be that information overload rarely translates into a political impetus to find middle ground. Mr. Trump\u2019s we\u2019ll-build-a-wall speech went viral, and people took sides. Instant video playback, and instant fact-checks, make it increasingly harder for politicians to gradually reverse positions without being called on it. While facts are available more readily than ever, they often seem to be afterthoughts. Witness the surge in Google searches in Britain about the meaning of leaving the European Union. The big surge happened the day after the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote, not before.What\u2019s clear is that Americans have to rethink the automatic assumption that the world secretly wants to replicate American-style, or even Western-style, democracies. Many do, but as Henry Kissinger noted lately, we fooled ourselves into thinking that our biggest challengers from the last century were now committed to integrating themselves into Western-designed, democratically-based institutions in this century. \u201cThe problem with the American view of Russia is that we have always thought of Russia as an incipient NATO country,\u201d Mr. Kissinger said last month at a forum in Kent, Conn. \u201cThat it would gradually slide into an orbit and accept a so-called rules-based system. But Russia has a different history and a different culture.\u201dSo do the Chinese and the Egyptians and the Turks. The leaders of those countries feel less pressure than they did a decade ago to open their societies. Democracy is hardly dead; for billions around the world, it remains a cherished dream. But the end of history, it turns out, looks more and more like another beginning.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s also a drain, sucking money out of your home. Every month, millions of Americans are forced to pay high fees to rent cable boxes. The only way this can change is if the Federal Communications Commission votes to require cable companies to make programming accessible through other devices, ones you could own outright. A vote is set for Sept. 29.Large cable and satellite companies would have two years to develop the apps and smaller cable companies would get four years. Some large cable companies, like Comcast and Time Warner Cable, already have apps for some of the competing devices. Cable companies that serve fewer than 400,000 users would be exempt. People who prefer renting cable boxes could continue doing so.Phones, computers and virtually all other electronic devices become more useful and cost less over time.

{"Headline": "Twitter Is Said to Be Discussing a Possible Takeover", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter has long positioned itself as a global town square where anyone \u2014 celebrities, politicians, athletes, and you and me \u2014 can chat in 140-character messages and find out about whatever is happening in the moment.But with that premise not drawing enough new people to the social media service, Twitter is now rethinking whether it can survive as an independent company and is exploring several strategic options.Twitter, based in San Francisco, is talking with Salesforce.com, Google and others about a possible takeover of the company, people briefed on the discussions said on Friday. The talks are in the early stages, these people said, with no guarantee that a deal will be reached. In particular, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, is resistant to selling to some of the potential acquirers, they said.Twitter is also weighing a possible revamping that could involve divestitures and layoffs, the people said. Two divisions that Twitter is considering divesting itself of are Vine, the mobile six-second video service, and MoPub, a mobile advertising business, they said. The company is working with the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen & Company on its options.For two years, Twitter has been casting about for ways to attract new users and to become a social media destination on the order of Facebook. While people initially flocked to Twitter, its new-user growth has slowed sharply as people complained about how difficult it was to use the service. At the same time, Facebook and its suite of offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger continued to outpace Twitter in user growth and profitability, while five-year-old Snapchat has become the newest darling of the social media world.Lack of growth also began to erode advertiser demand, which had remained robust even as Twitter\u2019s overall number of users stagnated at around 313 million people. Advertisers aiming for big audiences tended to choose Facebook, while those looking for younger audiences have the option of Snapchat.Twitter has endured internal turmoil and a revolving door of executives and board members. Mr. Dorsey, a co-founder who became permanent chief executive of Twitter almost a year ago, has vowed to turn it around by making it easier to use and by emphasizing real-time elements that could make it more essential to people.But after several false starts, critics are skeptical that these efforts will work.On Friday, how interested Google or Salesforce might be in buying Twitter, along with the identities of other possible bidders, became something of a parlor guessing game in Silicon Valley. Google\u2019s name has surfaced in the past as a logical buyer because of the internet search company\u2019s size and digital portfolio. Media companies have also been considered possible suitors.Why Salesforce might be interested in Twitter was a head-scratcher to some people. Salesforce is an enterprise technology company that focuses on businesses and not individuals, as Twitter does.But Salesforce has publicly expressed interest in owning a social network, which the company believes can bolster its main business of selling software and services to business clients. Many companies use Twitter to handle customer service requests and complaints, for example.Compared with its social media and internet peers, Twitter is more susceptible to a takeover because it has only one class of stock. Companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, have multiple classes of shares, which gives their founders tight control over their companies and guarantee independence.Twitter has $3.6 billion in cash on hand and $1.6 billion of debt, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. Microsoft paid a premium of nearly 50 percent for LinkedIn, although any sale of Twitter is unlikely to bring such a rich price.Leslie Picker and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That may be about to change, because of the way its local government is welcoming its robot overlords.The cars will have human overseers in the driver\u2019s seat, for now, but they are expected to operate as autonomous vehicles. And autonomy seems to be what the mayor has given Uber \u2014 he and the chief of police have ridden in the cars, but no one else in government has even seen them.\u201cIf you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet,\u201d said the mayor, basically encapsulating a concept called \u201cgreenlight governing,\u201d or letting companies do whatever they want (within reason).The hope is that this will gain the town a reputation as a robotics hub, something already plausible because of the impressive robotics engineering department at Pittsburgh\u2019s Carnegie Mellon University (which Uber once raided for talent).But fear may be another motivation. The city rode high during America\u2019s industrialization, enabling Andrew Carnegie to fund Carnegie Mellon. He also built the first of his famous public libraries in nearby Braddock, which was hit by the steel bust that set Pittsburgh back for decades.Other parts of the city have come back, in part because of the insurance and health care industries that have made Pittsburgh home. The experience of losing out from one economic cycle, however, very likely shapes how much Pittsburgh views getting in early on the next one.In that case, the towns also look for a big economic bump from sponsoring some part of our computing-intensive future, but it does not turn out that way: Data centers are exceptionally automated, with just a few highly skilled jobs, and even fewer jobs in security and maintenance that match the local skill sets.As robotics catch on, there will be even fewer positions in the data centers. Maybe the robots will be made in Pittsburgh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Backing Autonomous Cars, U.S. Tells Automakers to Figure It Out", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Obama administration\u2019s approach to hands-free driving is remarkably hands-off.The one firm requirement: Make sure those cars are safe. Otherwise, federal officials have warned, the government will exercise its right under current regulations to pull them off the road.The policy is designed to \u201ccreate a path for a fully autonomous driver with different designs than what we have on the road today,\u201d Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said at Washington news conference on Tuesday. \u201cIf you look at the policy, it provides that path.\u201dAutomakers on Tuesday welcomed the hands-off approach.\u201cYou can\u2019t get locked into one technology or approach, and it doesn\u2019t seem like they are doing that here,\u201d said Brad Stertz, director of government affairs at Audi of America, the German automaker\u2019s United States arm. \u201cThey want to have the flexibility to allow the technology to evolve and evolve in the safest way.\u201dDavid Strickland, a former administrator of the federal safety agency who is now general counsel for the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, a group that includes Ford Motor, Google and Uber, said the administration\u2019s policy set a framework that should allow manufacturers to \u201cpull this technology together in an expeditious way.\u201dDespite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.The guidelines, which stop short of formal regulations, have been more than a year in the making.All along the question of safety has hovered over the discussion, particularly as automakers and technology companies have put more test vehicles onto public roads. Google, for example, has logged roughly two million miles of testing with its driverless cars. Uber recently began using a test fleet of autonomous cars for its ride-hailing service in Pittsburgh.More intense scrutiny came this summer after the disclosure that Joshua Brown was killed in Florida when his Tesla Motors car, with its Autopilot system engaged, crashed into a tractor-trailer at highway speed.The Autopilot system, which uses cameras and radar to scan the roadway and can steer Tesla vehicles with little help from the driver, failed to recognize the truck and data showed that neither it nor Mr. Brown hit the brakes before the impact. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the crash to determine if any safety flaws exist in the Autopilot mode.The accident put a spotlight on semiautonomous systems that can take over many of the driving duties but require human drivers to remain alert and ready to take control at a moment\u2019s notice. As soon as this week, Tesla is expected to download new software onto its vehicles that will include improvements to Autopilot.And yet, several parts of the 116-page policy, address safety issues highlighted by the Tesla crash.Semiautonomous driving systems, the policy says, must take into account the fact that distracted or inattentive drivers may fail to retake control, and the systems could be considered \u201can unreasonable risk to safety and subject to recall.\u201dAfter Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.Mike Ramsey, a research director at Gartner Group who focuses on auto technology, said the Transportation Department probably did not add such statements because of the Tesla accident. But the language \u201cclearly affects\u201d the company, he said.\u201cOther companies are rolling out Autopilot-like systems, so it\u2019s not just Tesla they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said.Tesla says Autopilot is not meant to be a fully autonomous driving system, although YouTube videos have shown some owners driving with no hands on the steering wheel and performing other stunts while the system is active. Tesla cars warn drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road while using Autopilot. The company has said the new version will be even stricter in that regard.Tesla said on Tuesday that it was not ready to comment on the new federal guidelines.Whether the guidelines will become formal policy is uncertain. Automakers and any other interested parties have 60 days to comment to the Transportation Department, a period that will not end until after the presidential election on Nov. 8. A new administration could modify, rework or scrap the guidelines.But the policy received strong backing from auto safety advocates, who pointed out that more than 34,000 people died in auto-related accidents in 2015.\u201cAutonomous technology and especially driverless cars can absolutely be game-changers,\u201d Colleen Sheehy-Church, the national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, said on Tuesday. \u201cAutonomous vehicles could potentially stop most traffic deaths in our country.\u201dThe push for autonomous vehicles is also supported by those who see self-driving cars as a new means of transportation for the disabled, the elderly and others who are unable to drive.Eric A.

{"Headline": "At New York Fashion Week, a Reflection on American Style", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat is \u201cAmerican\u201d fashion? I don\u2019t mean fashion made in America \u2014 that much is obvious (though considering most high fashion in America is manufactured in Italy, that\u2019s an interesting point for discussion too). But ideologically, what does it constitute? What makes a collection, or a designer, especially \u201cAmerican?\u201d To a set of jet-lagged eyes, that seemed to be the question that occupied New York designers in their spring/summer 2017 collections.Maybe it\u2019s because this is an election year, for an election that could redefine perceptions of America, both at home and abroad. Look at how the currently unravelling saga of \u201cBrexit\u201d has transformed and polarized opinion of the United Kingdom. Is it facile to reduce Trump versus Clinton down to fashion? No, especially considering that the much-parodied emblem of the Trump campaign is a baseball cap purporting to help \u201cMake America Great Again;\u201d and that pretty much the entirety of New York\u2019s designer community \u2014 Diane von Furstenberg, Marc Jacobs, Altuzarra \u2014 has banded together to create T-shirts in support of Hillary Clinton. No one\u2019s come out for Trump quite yet \u2014 though on Wednesday night, Gucci did launch a range in their Fifth Avenue flagship store, nestled under the Trump Tower. So we got close.Perhaps that\u2019s what threw New York into an existential crisis: If you\u2019re fighting to help shape America\u2019s future, maybe it prompts you to question what \u201cAmerican\u201d really means \u2014 and how it manifests in a few yards of fabric with a four-figure price tag. American fashion is, we\u2019re so often told, commercial. It\u2019s easy. Sportswear. It\u2019s Claire McCardell in the \u201940s, with her shirtwaist dresses and flat pumps and stretch jersey swimsuits; it\u2019s the cleanliness of Roy Halston Frowick in the 70s (in work, if not in life); it\u2019s Calvin Klein (although not this season, as the brand dropped off the schedule prior to the first collection by Raf Simons, due next year). It\u2019s probably not Joseph Altuzarra\u2019s sheer stockings and flirty, froufrou skirts, and python-embroidered cherries, with their heavy doses of 1971 Yves Saint Laurent. But that was fun enough.American fashion is also an Oscar de la Renta ballgown, an Adolfo suit, the anarchic, perennially penniless Stephen Sprouse, the genius of Charles James. American fashion is multifaceted, complex, then and now. What was rewarding, in seeing designers grapple with nailing down its meaning, was their often unexpected conclusions. It wasn\u2019t all jersey. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen\u2019s The Row, for instance, which showed in the brand\u2019s chic, three-story walk-up on 71st Street, featured Keds (or The Row\u2019s expensive equivalent) and clothes in folk embroideries with chewy texture, or papery cotton like hospital gowns. If I had to cite an influence, I\u2019d say Donna Karan, in theory if not in practice: The Row makes simple but expensive stuff designed to work in tandem with women\u2019s lives.Talk about dichotomies, how about walking a block to the Frick and seeing Carolina Herrera? A stone\u2019s throw can be a world apart: She opened her collection with a denim ballgown, which sounds like the sort of thing that should be confined to a Ry Cooder-themed episode of \u201cSay Yes to the Dress,\u201d but actually looked great. Herrera also made ballgowns out of checkered fabric like tablecloths, and big fat Yankee bandbox stripes. And brocade, of course. Herrera\u2019s is a distinct subset of American style: It\u2019s the Oscar de la Renta world (which had a weak, rudderless season lead by the design team, but promises better next when Monse\u2019s Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim fill the vacant creative director position). But back to Herrera: Her ballgowns and slender evening dresses fit in perfectly in her spiritual and physical home of the Upper East Side. There were even a few shirts with exaggerated cuffs, the sort of stuff Herrera herself wears all the time, and looks so handsome in. This is American style too \u2014 uptown.I asked Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler if they felt like they were downtown designers, and they pulled a face. But they\u2019re hardly uptown. \u201cMidtown?\u201d suggested McCollough, with a heavy dose of sarcasm. Maybe just New York, which is the territory plenty of designers wish to occupy, but few straddle as effectively as Proenza Schouler. Case in point: They showed their fall/winter 2015 collection in the Marcel Breuer-designed former Whitney Museum of Art on Madison Avenue; fall/winter 2016 was in the new downtown Whitney. And for spring, their clothes mixed uptown and downtown: There was something fundamentally American about a mink coat cut with all the luxury of a bathrobe (a good thing) and with a print T-shirt wrapped around the waist (a better thing). It\u2019s an outfit you felt you\u2019d never seen before, that did something new and different with luxury. It brought that fur down to earth, and made it feel real, which is an idea so many designers are talking about across the world, but one that feels distinctly American.Hernandez and McCollough are clever designers; they like referencing clever things. American artists are a particular fetish: This collection\u2019s collaged prints of photographs \u2014 of McCollough\u2019s clenched fist alongside randomly Googled images of Greek statues (where they are going for a post-fashion week holiday) \u2014 reminded me of the work of John Baldessari. So did the brilliant colors, predominantly Yves Klein blue and Warholian Campbell\u2019s Soup red. Proenza Schouler was showing in a gallery again, so maybe those associations are inevitable.They\u2019re also clever because this collection felt decidedly, desirably commercial. Is that a dirty word? Not in America. The overriding impression of fashion week was how well American designers can do that, without it (necessarily) feeling lame. Lots of it did, of course. But I couldn\u2019t help but be wowed by Ralph Lauren, quietly nailing that See Now, Buy Now thing everyone\u2019s prattling on about. You watched the show, outside his boutique, then streamed in to see the clothes in store. And, perhaps, buy. His collection was Western-inspired, and he\u2019s making out like a bandit. How American is that?Advertisement"}

I leave.I know, I know, I am a colossal failure as Urban Avenger. And it\u2019s too bad because in New York restaurants, with their tight space and enforced proximity, it would be nice to have a few superpowers and tools. Like that transparent cylinder tossed over the bad guys in one of those Superman movies. It also trapped sound, if memory serves. Would that be sweet: Kiddies under glass, silenced. Or how about Wonder Woman\u2019s magic lasso, which forces the captive to obey her every command?\u201cYou, screaming children. You are to leave the restaurant immediately and await orders to get me a taxi. And make sure it\u2019s one where the air-conditioning works.\u201dNot that I haven\u2019t had the occasional restaurant success as a mere mortal. Once, 40 years ago, when we were in one of those Cuban-Chinese joints on Eighth Avenue where you could get dinner for $3, Herb and I firmly put our hands on an obnoxious guy and led him out of the restaurant.O.K., he was drunk \u2014 from his appearance, a career alcoholic \u2014 but it was the first time we two puny feature writers had laid hands on anyone in a confrontation, and did we feel tough! Then Herb realized that even drunken guys can be armed, and we never did that again.I do have a technique for dealing with large groups of noisy, drunken guys, although it puts back the feminist movement 50 years. It requires murmuring, which doesn\u2019t come naturally to me, so before I do it I have to take a moment and channel Eartha Kitt. Then I go over to the loudest of the men.Yes, it\u2019s sickening, but if you were at the next table, you\u2019d be sending me a drink.Then there are those intimate conversations that are so unpleasant you just want to flee, like the one Herb and I witnessed at our sushi place, which is tightly packed even by New York City standards.The evening\u2019s lout was seated next to me; a woman was opposite him. She looked worn down; if she said anything, she said it too quietly to hear. He was Captain Bligh with a mouth instead of a whip. \u201cYou never consider,\u201d he was saying loudly, and \u201cIf you had any regard for,\u201d and \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to be saying this \u2026 \u201dThe restaurant is too full to change tables, although when Herb and I try we get an understanding look from a woman seated nearby, who turns out to be a shrink.I feel Urban Avenger stirring.\u201cI want to stage an intervention,\u201d I say. \u201cYou think we could do that? Could I pass this woman a note, telling her she can do better?

Silicon Valley Buyers Aren\u2019t Deterred", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRedwood City JournalREDWOOD CITY, Calif. \u2014 Swell-looking home you\u2019ve got here. Ever think about selling it? How about to me, right now?That is increasingly the approach the house-hungry are using in Silicon Valley, where the number of homes on the market is so small that would-be buyers are driven to desperation. Their solution: seek out homes that are, in theory at least, not for sale.Sue Zweig grew up in this working-class community, back when people said it was for the newly wed and the nearly dead. Not long ago, when she was out walking her dog, she began to realize things were different. A woman pulled over, asked about houses for sale in the neighborhood and ended up spending 45 minutes poking around Ms. Zweig\u2019s living room and kitchen.Her four-bedroom house was not on the market then, and it was not on the market a year or so later when another eager buyer showed up. This time, Ms. Zweig, a nurse, and her husband, Steve Zweig, made a deal for $1.375 million, a seven-figure profit over what they had paid in 1987. They moved out of the house last year.Flushing out people before they are officially ready to sell \u2014 by a few weeks or a few years \u2014 has obvious benefits for buyers, but sellers say they can profit, too. It streamlines an expensive process that traditionally consumes many months.\u201cWe probably left money on the table,\u201d said Mr. Zweig, a retired digital printer. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t have to list it, didn\u2019t have to do open houses, didn\u2019t have to stage it.\u201dPeople of much more modest means are now echoing his tactics, even if they cannot extend his lavish terms.\u201cTechnology is making people impatient,\u201d said Steve Korn, a retired forklift facility manager who is now a real estate agent here. \u201cNo one wants a six-month slog anymore to get a new place or move on from an old place.\u201dTechnology is also fueling this boom in a more direct way. Tech companies, especially Facebook and Google, have plans to build new campuses and hire even more workers.That means even places like Redwood City, a longtime also-ran to neighbors like Atherton, Menlo Park and Palo Alto, are now hot. That\u2019s a windfall for longtime residents like the Zweigs, who moved to a coastal town 220 miles south and built a new house.Prices in their old Redwood City development have continued to soar, prompting some wishful dreams among those who remain.Michele and Mike Sweeney put a \u201cmake me move\u201d notice on their 2,060-square-foot house last year. That is a feature that the online real estate company Zillow offers to let owners solicit interest. Their demand was $1.9 million, significantly more than their house was worth.\u201cWe used to say around here, \u2018If it hits a million, we\u2019re all selling,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Sweeney, who works for a hospital. \u201cThat was not too long ago.\u201dThey were flooded with inquiries but did not make a deal. Now, according to Zillow, their house is rapidly approaching the price they wanted. \u201cI asked my son, \u2018Do you want to finish high school in Italy?\u2019\u201d Ms. Sweeney said.To entice people like the Sweeneys, who might sell under the right circumstances, some buyers and their agents are resorting to old-fashioned technologies: letters and phone calls.Colleen Foraker, a Sotheby\u2019s agent in Silicon Valley, prefers personal letters. \u201cIt acknowledges the formality and the importance of the request to a perfect stranger,\u201d she said.Her clients might have a particular neighborhood in mind, and perhaps a certain layout or yard size. Ms. Foraker sends letters to about 100 owners, describing her clients and exactly what they want. \u201cThey are looking for a spacious, newer, move-in-ready home that will accommodate energetic children, sports activities, hobbies and two large family dogs,\u201d one letter said.\u201cIn some parts of the country, you move into a house until your children are gone or you retire,\u201d Ms. Foraker said. \u201cPeople here look at their homes more as an investment. They think, \u2018If the right number comes along, I would think about what I would do next.\u2019\u201dEven in Silicon Valley, letter campaigns are still the exception rather than the rule. Ms. Foraker has done about eight in the last few years. Two succeeded. The more recent deal involved a $3 million house.\u201cThe odds are low, but this is not a community that likes to wait,\u201d said Michael Dreyfus, the owner of the Sotheby\u2019s office in Palo Alto.At least one real estate company thinks letters have an application far beyond Silicon Valley.\u201cWe decided low inventory is also a permanent condition in Denver, San Francisco, Austin, Boston, Seattle,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate company based in Seattle. With more wealth in those areas causing an influx of people, along with low interest rates, \u201cthere\u2019s no place for them all to live,\u201d he said.To shake inventory loose for its clients, Redfin will start this month to use letters to reach out to potential sellers in Denver. Local agents will work with buyers to craft targeted queries, just as Ms. Foraker does in Silicon Valley.Mr. Kelman, who says the goal is to approach 10,000 potential sellers, is frank about this being an experiment. Perhaps, as often happens during booms, the sellers might get an inflated sense of their property\u2019s worth.One Denver buyer\u2019s recent experience illustrated both the promise and the peril of these new solicitations. Charles Bogenberger, a software marketing manager, wanted to buy a condominium in the complex next to his office. His Redfin agent sent letters to the five people who owned units with four bedrooms, which was the floor plan Mr. Bogenberger wanted.Two responded. One said he would sell for $560,000 \u2014 far more than Mr. Bogenberger could pay. The other unit had been on the market but was now going to be rented. Those owners wanted $400,000. The deal will close this month.\u201cWithout the letters, I might still be a renter,\u201d Mr. Bogenberger said. And if the sellers, like their neighbors, had demanded too much? \u201cI might still be a renter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Just who registers and how many will be one of the biggest stories of the next month.This wave has probably just begun, even if it isn\u2019t yet reflected in the available voter registration data. For now, we\u2019re left to read tea leaves \u2014 and they look good for Democrats.Google trends data indicates that the searches for voter registration have surged over the last week \u2014 and that the highest rates of searches have been in disproportionately Hispanic areas.By Wednesday evening, all of the top markets for searches for \u201cregister to vote\u201d came in heavily Latino markets in Texas, California, Nevada, Arizona and Florida. The same pattern held into Thursday.Many of these markets \u2014 like those along the Rio Grande in South Texas or in California\u2019s Central Valley \u2014 have typically had the lowest turnout and registration rates in the country.It\u2019s a big reversal from last month, when registration searches were highest in the predominantly white, Northern states that typically have the highest registration and turnout.And even if it does hold, the Google Trends data doesn\u2019t prove that there will be a big surge in Hispanic registration. We\u2019ll have to wait a few weeks for updated voter registration data.But this year, newly registered voters have tended to be more Hispanic than in past years. According to data from Catalist, a Democratic firm, about 12 percent of newly registered voters were estimated to be Hispanic, versus 10 percent by the same point in 2012.In Florida, the Hispanic share of registered voters has already risen to 15.3 percent on Aug. 1 from 13.9 percent at the time of the 2012 presidential election.In 2012, the Hispanic share of registered voters increased to 13.9 percent from 13.5 between the August primary and the general election. A similar uptick would be bad news for Republicans; a bigger one would start to make Mr. Trump\u2019s path to victory in Florida look very tenuous.Advertisement"}

But Twitter\u2019s not just a valuable source of news, eyewitness accounts and reports from correspondents on the scene; it\u2019s also a place where reporters can trade information, take the public\u2019s temperature, catalyze important discussions and check the zeitgeist weather vanes.It might sometimes feel as if the great stuff is buried amid heaps of rumors, speculation and disinformation \u2014 not to mention the usual internet trivia, bigotry and snark. But Twitter users can turn to myriad guides to help them navigate the labyrinth. It\u2019s like having every sort of expert imaginable on speed dial: investigative reporters, policy wonks, renowned scholars, scientists, musicians, artists, historians, you name it \u2014 and being able to tap into their thinking and inside sources.Want up-to-the-minute updates on Trump and Hillary?

If you\u2019re a news junkie, it\u2019s a way to turn all that time spent surfing news sites into something tangible, a way to upload some of the clutter in your head.Twitter feeds can be like little magazines curated to reflect users\u2019 personal interests \u2014 literary, political, scholarly, comic or all of the above: daily newsletters that create small, personal snail trails through the vast landscape of data that is the web today. There are reporters who take you inside the action on the ground in Syria and Iraq; journalists who create powerful mini-narratives within their Twitter feeds that amplify our understanding of crucial issues \u2014 like cyberwar, constitutional debates, the refugee crisis \u2014 as events unfold over time; and artists and writers who shed light on their own work or that of others with links, photos and videos.For me, tweeting\u2019s mainly about curation. Sharing links to news and articles that help put that news in perspective. Reminding readers of important continuing stories in culture, politics, technology and foreign policy. Directing attention to some of the remarkable resources offered by institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art @metmuseum and the British Museum @britishmuseum and lesser-known sites like the speech database American Rhetoric and Open Culture @openculture (a collection of free e-books, movies, interviews, lectures and educational resources). And, above all, passing on some of the great stuff that other people have written, found or flagged.I try to provide book recommendations (not just new books, but also older titles worth revisiting), and links to author profiles and book news \u2014 like a new study showing that college students prefer print books to e-books, or a report that Google is reading hundreds of romance novels to its artificial intelligence engine to try to teach it conversation.I also try to link to older articles, books and studies that might provide some background or added perspective to the news. Links to books about the war in Iraq and the rise of ISIS that give context to this year\u2019s terrorist attacks. On the centenary of the Battle of the Somme, links to two brilliant books on World War I \u2014 Paul Fussell\u2019s \u201cThe Great War and Modern Memory\u201d and Christopher Clark\u2019s \u201cThe Sleepwalkers.\u201d With thawing United States-Cuban relations, a link to Leonardo Padura\u2019s list of top 10 Cuban novels.

The Brexit vote made me think of Barbara Tuchman\u2019s book \u201cThe March of Folly,\u201d and Claude Monet\u2019s lovely sequence of paintings of the Houses of Parliament. The Rio Olympics reminded me of Hitchcock\u2019s masterpiece \u201cNotorious\u201d and that decidedly lesser Bond movie \u201cMoonraker.\u201d And an article citing \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov\u201d as Hillary Clinton\u2019s favorite book reminded me of a picture of Lisa Simpson holding aloft a copy of Dostoyevsky\u2019s novel, which reminded me of a Tumblr site, the Lisa Simpson Book Club.Other posts are things I\u2019ve seen or recalled: photos of book-reading gargoyles; a collection of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d and \u201c1984\u201d covers; a GIF of a giant rotating sculpture in the shape of Kafka\u2019s head; a series of book-themed trompe l\u2019oeil street murals; a video clip of the famous bookstore scene with Humphrey Bogart in \u201cThe Big Sleep\u201d; photos of offbeat libraries \u2014 the traveling donkey library, the floating boat library, the vending machine library, and so on.Such odds and ends are like the jumble of stuff that accumulates in the top kitchen drawer \u2014 a far cry from important breaking news \u2014 but that\u2019s Twitter, too, in all its splendid dishevelment: a mad, noisy mix of the momentous and the ordinary, the serious, silly and surprising.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dell Gets Bigger and Hewlett Packard Gets Smaller in Separate Deals", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Michael Dell and Meg Whitman may be business competitors, but they can each claim a technology industry superlative. One has overseen one of the largest mergers in the tech industry. The other has engineered its biggest breakup.Different as they seem, both deals were in reaction to tough competition and declining markets. And so far, neither has provided a clear way for how a storied giant can survive changes like the rise of so-called cloud computing that are undermining the way they operate.On Wednesday, Mr. Dell, who 32 years ago started a personal computer business from his college dorm room, officially completed his giant $67 billion merger with EMC, a data storage company with interests in software and security. He also changed the name of his operation to Dell Technologies.Later in the day, Ms. Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, announced a sale of most of her company\u2019s software assets to a British outfit called Micro Focus for about $8.8 billion. H.P.E. also announced higher earnings in the company\u2019s most recent quarter, but a decline in revenue from the same period a year ago.Shares of H.P.E. moved down about 2 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday evening.H.P.E. itself is a $36 billion computing giant created last year from half of Hewlett-Packard, a record separation that ended one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most iconic companies and neatly mirrored Mr. Dell\u2019s move. The other half of the old company, which specializes in PC and printer sales, is now called HP Inc.With a constant mantra of building shareholder value, Ms. Whitman, who a year ago talked about growth strategies for H.P.E., has sold off big parts of the empire she took over five years ago. Last May, this involved selling off her services group, which employed 110,000 people. In an interview, Ms. Whitman said that after that sale, by the end of October, H.P.E. would have between 50,000 and 60,000 employees.\u201cWe have to understand our place in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are elements of our world that are shrinking.\u201dMr. Dell\u2019s move in the other direction has meant taking his company private, in the process taking on $33.4 billion in long-term debt at relatively little personal risk. He owns 70 percent of Dell Technologies, a company he is counting on to throw off a lot of cash to quickly repay the debt, even as the overall business computing industry shrinks.If his gambit succeeds, within a few years he could multiply by several times his personal fortune, already estimated at $18.5 billion, according to Bloomberg.Dell Technologies starts life with revenue of $74 billion and 140,000 employees, but in an interview on Wednesday Mr. Dell declined to say what those numbers might look like in two years.\u201cThings are going well on a relative basis,\u201d he said. \u201cMarket consolidation is definitely occurring.\u201dWith companies like Amazon Web Services and Google providing cloud computing services, corporations increasingly rent the use of computers they used to buy from Dell and H.P.E., for a lot less money. Other cloud companies, like Salesforce, rent software this way, something A.W.S. and Google also do.Along with the rise of mobile computing, cloud computing is radically altering the computer industry. According to IDC, global demand for traditional data storage fell 7 percent in the first quarter of this year. Server revenue fell 3.6 percent globally. Second-quarter PC sales were down 4.5 percent. In a market like that, big companies like H.P.E. and Dell can only hope for a bigger slice of a shrinking pie.Compare that with Amazon\u2019s fortunes. Since A.W.S. first disclosed its earnings in April 2015, Amazon\u2019s stock has nearly doubled, and despite a 40 percent increase in the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock market, shares of almost all the older business technology companies have barely budged.Cloud companies now get about 10 percent of all spending on business computing, and they are growing at a 30 percent annual clip, said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \u201cThat\u2019s 100 percent of the growth, maybe a little more\u201d of the whole business technology sector, he added. \u201cA year ago Meg talked about growth, but in the past six months it\u2019s all been about capital allocation and return to shareholders.\u201dCompared with many in the old guard, the H.P.E. and Dell strategies may be doing well. At least for now.Shares of H.P.E. have gained about 30 percent in the last year, largely in the last two months, as rumors spread that besides selling services and buying back shares, Ms. Whitman would sell the company\u2019s laggard software division.Pre-EMC, Dell was known mostly for PCs and computer servers. While the financial information released by the private company is limited, in the three months that ended April 29 it had revenue of $12 billion, down 2 percent. Operating income was higher, Dell said, using nonstandard accounting.Selling computers still throws off a lot of cash, which is good for paying debt. Mr. Dell said that Dell Technologies threw off $3.6 billion just in its most recent quarter. EMC also owns a software business, called Pivotal, which Mr. Dell is expected to take public soon.\u201cHe\u2019s betting that size and scale will help him gain share, not that the market will be great,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Computing, once the province of a few business tasks and consumer activities like video games, has with cloud computing attached itself to much of the world, making it possible to connect phones, tablets and sensor-equipped machines to huge computing resources.Both Dell and H.P.E. make the computers and related devices that amount to the infrastructure necessary to this new economy. Increasingly, however, the profit margins can be found above the computing guts, in particular with artificial intelligence technology that helps companies scour data to make smart decisions. Both Microsoft and IBM have invested heavily in both cloud computing and A.I.Mr. Dell said that he had spent $12.7 billion in research and development in the last three years and is gaining some A.I. technology in the EMC deal.In turn, when asked about its innovations, H.P.E. noted changes to its server and storage businesses, along with the acquisition of companies like Silicon Graphics, a high-performance computing company that peaked in the 1990s.An article on Thursday about the differing business strategies of Michael Dell and Meg Whitman misquoted Mr. Dell in one instance. Referring to the prospects of Dell Technologies, the company formed by the merger of his computer business and the data storage company EMC, he said: \u201cThings are going well on a relative basis,\u201d not \u201cThings are going well on a personal basis.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defending Against Hackers Took a Back Seat at Yahoo, Insiders Say", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Six years ago, Yahoo\u2019s computer systems and customer email accounts were penetrated by Chinese military hackers. Google and a number of other technology companies were also hit.The Google co-founder Sergey Brin regarded the attack on his company\u2019s systems as a personal affront and responded by making security a top corporate priority. Google hired hundreds of security engineers with six-figure signing bonuses, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in security infrastructure and adopted a new internal motto, \u201cNever again,\u201d to signal that it would never again allow anyone \u2014 be they spies or criminals \u2014 to hack into Google customers\u2019 accounts.Yahoo, on the other hand, was slower to invest in the kinds of defenses necessary to thwart sophisticated hackers that are now considered standard in Silicon Valley, according to half a dozen current and former company employees who participated in security discussions but agreed to describe them only on the condition of anonymity.When Marissa Mayer took over as chief executive of the flailing company in mid-2012, security was one of many problems she inherited. With so many competing priorities, she emphasized creating a cleaner look for services like Yahoo Mail and developing new products over making security improvements, the Yahoo employees said.The \u201cParanoids,\u201d the internal name for Yahoo\u2019s security team, often clashed with other parts of the business over security costs. And their requests were often overridden because of concerns that the inconvenience of added protection would make people stop using the company\u2019s products.Certainly, many big companies have struggled with cyberattacks in recent years. But Yahoo\u2019s security efforts appear to have fallen short, in particular, when compared with those of banks and other big tech companies.To make computer systems more secure, a company often has to make its products slower and more difficult to use. It was a trade-off Yahoo\u2019s leadership was often unwilling to make.In defense of Yahoo\u2019s security, a company spokeswoman, Suzanne Philion, said the company spent $10 million on encryption technology in early 2014, and that its investment in security initiatives will have increased by 60 percent from 2015 to 2016.\u201cAt Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure,\u201d she said.\u201cYahoo is already suffering. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll suffer more because of this,\u201d said Avivah Litan, a security analyst with the research firm Gartner.Ms. Mayer arrived at Yahoo about two years after the company was hit by the Chinese military hackers. While Google\u2019s response was public, Yahoo never publicly admitted that it had also been attacked.A former Google executive credited with creating the search company\u2019s simple, colorful aesthetic, Ms. Mayer turned her attention at Yahoo to beating Google at search, creating new mobile apps, and turning Yahoo into a video powerhouse with television-style broadcasts featuring big-name talent like Katie Couric.But in matters of security, Ms. Mayer, current and former employees said, was far more reactive. In 2010, Google announced it would start paying hackers \u201cbug bounties\u201d if they turned over security holes and problems in its systems. Yahoo did not do the same until three years later, after it lost countless security engineers to competitors and experienced a breach of more than 450,000 Yahoo accounts in 2012 and a series of humiliating spam attacks in 2013. Yahoo said it had paid out $1.8 million to bug hunters.In 2013, disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, showed that Yahoo was a frequent target for nation-state spies. Yet it took a full year after Mr. Snowden\u2019s initial disclosures for Yahoo to hire a new chief information security officer, Alex Stamos.Jeff Bonforte, the Yahoo senior vice president who oversees its email and messaging services, said in an interview last December that Mr. Stamos and his team had pressed for Yahoo to adopt end-to-end encryption for everything. Such encryption would mean that only the parties in a conversation could see what was being said, with even Yahoo unable to read it.Mr. Bonforte said he resisted the request because it would have hurt Yahoo\u2019s ability to index and search message data to provide new user services. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly thrilled with building an apartment building which has the biggest bars on every window,\u201d he said.The 2014 hiring of Mr. Stamos \u2014 who had a reputation for pushing for privacy and antisurveillance measures \u2014 was widely hailed by the security community as a sign that Yahoo was prioritizing its users\u2019 privacy and security.The current and former employees say he inspired a small team of young engineers to develop more secure code, improve the company\u2019s defenses \u2014 including encrypting traffic between Yahoo\u2019s data centers \u2014 hunt down criminal activity and successfully collaborate with other companies in sharing threat data.He also dispatched \u201cred teams\u201d of employees to break into Yahoo\u2019s systems and report back what they found. At competitors like Apple and Google, the Yahoo Paranoids developed a reputation for their passion and contributions to collaborative security projects, like Threat Exchange, a platform created by Yahoo, Dropbox, Facebook, Pinterest and others to share information on cyberthreats.But when it came time to commit meaningful dollars to improve Yahoo\u2019s security infrastructure, Ms. Mayer repeatedly clashed with Mr. Stamos, according to the current and former employees. She denied Yahoo\u2019s security team financial resources and put off proactive security defenses, including intrusion-detection mechanisms for Yahoo\u2019s production systems. Over the last few years, employees say, the Paranoids have been routinely hired away by competitors like Apple, Facebook and Google.Mr. Stamos, who departed Yahoo for Facebook last year, declined to comment. But during his tenure, Ms. Mayer also rejected the most basic security measure of all: an automatic reset of all user passwords, a step security experts consider standard after a breach. Employees say the move was rejected by Ms. Mayer\u2019s team for fear that even something as simple as a password change would drive Yahoo\u2019s shrinking email users to other services.\u201cYahoo\u2019s policy is that if we believe a user\u2019s password has been compromised, we lock the account until the user resets the password,\u201d Ms. Philion said.With the 500 million accounts involved in the breach disclosed last week, the stolen passwords were encrypted. Yahoo concluded the risk of misuse was low so it notified users and encouraged them to reset their passwords themselves.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Ordered to Stop Collecting Data on WhatsApp Users in Germany", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, a German regulator thinks so, too.The city of Hamburg\u2019s data protection commissioner ordered Facebook on Tuesday to stop collecting and storing data on WhatsApp users in Germany, the first time a privacy watchdog has waded into the debate. The regulator also called on the social network to delete all information already forwarded from WhatsApp on roughly 35 million German users.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Facebook said on Tuesday, after the order had been issued, that it had complied with Europe\u2019s privacy rules and that it was willing to work with the regulator to address its concerns. The Hamburg regulator has authority over Facebook\u2019s activities in Germany because the company\u2019s German subsidiary is based in the city.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.More than any other region, Europe has pushed back against American technology giants\u2019 use of people\u2019s digital information, routinely forcing companies like Google and Facebook to change their policies after they breached the European Union\u2019s tough data protection rules.In its decision on Tuesday, which would affect only WhatsApp users in Germany, the Hamburg regulator said that neither the internet messenger nor Facebook had received individuals\u2019 permission to share the information and had potentially misled people over how their data would be used in the future.The watchdog added that millions of people whose contact details had been uploaded to WhatsApp could now have that information shared with Facebook against their will, which would infringe German law.\u201cFacebook\u2019s answer, that this has merely not been done for the time being, is cause for concern that the gravity of the data protection breach\u201d will have a more severe impact, Mr. Caspar said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What if \u2018One Click\u2019 Buying Were Internetwide?", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Paying for things online can be cumbersome. Even the man who invented the web, Tim Berners-Lee, says he frequently throws up his hands.\u201cSometimes I will think that I bought something and I press the button, \u2018Buy this,\u2019 and I don\u2019t realize it didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said in a recent interview. \u201cWe are long overdue for a payments user interface for the web.\u201dResponding to the frustrations of Mr. Berners-Lee and hundreds of millions of online shoppers, the web\u2019s governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, has brought together the giants of the internet including Google, Facebook and Apple to fix the clumsiness of paying for things online.Now, a new global standard for online payments \u2014 a sort of Amazon one-click payment system for the entire internet \u2014 is being completed by the consortium and its members.Google, one of the authors of the standard, has recently introduced it in certain new versions of its Chrome browser. Other browser companies have said they intend to follow.The standard will provide a uniform way for users to input their credit cards and payment systems to any web browser so that they can be used for any purchase on the web. After the card details are entered once, they will automatically be called up as choices for all future transactions.This will be somewhat like the existing auto-fill functions that browsers have. But with the new standard, all the data fields will be filled in invisibly, requiring just one click.On the security side, rather than sending along all the credit card details, the browser will generate a one-time payment token that will avoid leaving your credit card number in countless databases around the world.Numerous efforts to modernize the payment system have failed to take off. And this one could fizzle, too, if online merchants, web browsers or consumers fail to adopt the new standard.The new standard will also face competition from the Amazons and PayPals of the world, as well as from the credit card networks, all of which want to be the primary destination for payments, rather than just one option.But payment analysts are hopeful about the new effort because it will not require consumers or merchants to use a new method of payment. Instead it will be equally open to any existing card or payment app, and it will channel them into a single place that most consumers already use \u2014 the web browser \u2014 where everything can be stored and used.\u201cInstead of simplifying the world, we have been fragmenting it into a million apps,\u201d said Eric Shea, a payments consultant at Kurt Salmon Digital. \u201cIf we can get back to that single integrated solution that everyone has on their phone and their desktop, that is the way to move forward and get adoption.\u201dDave Birch, a consultant who has been working on electronic payments for over two decades, said the web browser stood the best chance of providing a unified and more secure portal for payments.\u201cThere\u2019s a convergence going on,\u201d said Mr. Birch, who currently works for Consult Hyperion. \u201cIn the future you will have one experience \u2014 it won\u2019t matter if you are at the store or on the phone. It will pop up on your phone, you will put your thumb on it and you will be done.\u201dThe W3C project represents a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, the current giants of online payments. Both have gained business and fees with their more streamlined checkout processes.Neither company has participated in the current W3C effort and they are likely to continue to provide an alternative to customers who don\u2019t want to enter their details into their browsers.But the W3C has managed to bring in about 40 of the biggest players in online commerce, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and American Express as well as Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent.All met last week in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the specifications that they will introduce on different time frames to users around the world.In the version that Google released, when customers shopping at participating merchants hit the buy button, they are given a drop-down menu of their stored shipping addresses and credit cards.The customer can click on the address and card to be used, enter the three-digit security code on the card and hit \u201cpay now.\u201d Other browser companies may choose to use a fingerprint instead of the security code.\u201cWe wanted to remove what we jokingly call the Nascar effect of checkout, where you see five or seven logos for the different cards and payment methods you can use,\u201d said Zach Koch, the top Google executive on the project. \u201cThis is really fast, where a user can say, \u2018Tap, tap, buy.\u2019\u201dThe fees from transactions will still go to existing financial institutions like credit card companies and banks, unless customers choose a new online payment method like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. Apple Pay takes a piece of each transaction; Samsung Pay does not.But the bigger goal behind the W3C project is to create a standard, seamless and secure way to pay for things electronically in a future that will most likely include virtual reality stores, chat-based transactions and machines making payments to other machines (an autonomous car paying for a parking spot, for instance).The standard will also make it easy to include new payment methods like Bitcoin or the Chinese payment provider Tencent.\u201cThis involves quite radical changes to the way people think about payments,\u201d said Ian Jacobs, the W3C staff member leading the effort. \u201cAs a standards body it is our job to be sure it is an open playing field.\u201dThe need to create a better way to pay for things online was evident from the web\u2019s beginnings in the 1990s, Mr. Berners-Lee said. At some of the earliest meetings of the W3C, which he founded, there were discussions about creating a way to pay for things online that didn\u2019t require people to send credit card details over the internet.The failure to come up with a standard and secure way to do this led to the hodgepodge of payment screens consumers encounter today. It also made an opening for PayPal, which created a way for shoppers to pay on different sites using a single password.Mr. Birch said the main hurdle to accomplishing more seamless payments in the past was online merchants, who did not want to give up control over any part of the checkout process.But merchants have expressed increasing frustration with the high rate of abandoned online transactions and the frequency of credit card fraud.More than half of online purchases now happen on mobile phones, but Shopify has said that only 40 percent of the customers who start filling a shopping cart online finish their transactions.Shopify, which manages the online stores and checkout processes for 300,000 merchants, has been closely involved with the W3C effort and is planning to immediately offer the new standard to its merchants, as is Groupon.\u201cWe are betting a lot on it,\u201d said Jason Normore, the director of engineering at Shopify. \u201cEven though it cuts out a piece of our offering, it makes commerce better for everyone.\u201dApple will be one of the most interesting players to watch, given that it has both the Safari browser, which is part of the W3C effort, and Apple Pay, which could be seen as a competing offering.In the new operating system that Apple released last week, it is possible, for the first time, to shop online using the Safari browser and check out with Apple Pay. After hitting \u201cPay With Apple Pay,\u201d the customer is asked to provide a fingerprint on a phone, and the transaction is complete.The W3C standard will provide a similar experience on any browser \u2014 on a computer or phone \u2014 but will also allow customers to choose from any credit card or payment method they have entered into their browsers.Apple has so far been a part of the W3C group writing the standards, which will allow it to integrate non-Apple Pay choices into its browser.Mr. Berners-Lee said he hoped that more standardized payments would open up new types of online commerce that aren\u2019t possible now. He has long been interested in micropayments that would allow newspapers or small producers of content to be paid a few cents at a time, which isn\u2019t possible in a world with only credit cards.\u201cDifferent things call for different payments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are all interoperable you can separate the market for goods being sold from the payment back end.\u201dAn article on Monday about one-click shopping on the internet misstated the fee structure of one online payment method. While Apple Pay charges a fee on each transaction, Samsung Pay does not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Companies See Gold in California", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorCalifornia is the capital of American business. One out of five companies on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market hail from that state, according to my recent assessment of relevant data.The figures show that when it comes to formation of public companies, the rich states are getting richer while the rest are in slow decline.Compiling data from public filings and adding in missing data from SDC Platinum and CRSP/Compustat, databases that track headquarters information, I examined where public companies had their headquarters from 1965 through 2013. From 1965 through 1979, 10.07 percent of public companies were based in California. The number has continued to grow, so that from 2000-13, 19.46 percent of public companies had their headquarters in California.That\u2019s an astounding number. A state with 12 percent of our population now accounts for a fifth of all public companies. (In the 1970s, California was about 10 percent of the United States population.)Other states, meanwhile, are in decline. Ohio had 5.58 percent and Pennsylvania had 5.9 percent of public listings in the 1965-79 period. But from 2000 through 2013, Ohio had 2.58 percent and Pennsylvania 3.78 percent of public company headquarters.Illinois\u2019s decline was even starker, as it slid to 3.62 percent from 6.42 percent of public company headquarters. The reason for the decline may be obvious as the old manufacturing base went into decline. The appellation Rust Belt rings true to a large degree for these states as old companies disappear and are not replaced with new ones.Yet the decline is not just in the industrial Midwest. New York and New Jersey also fell. New York fell to 8.31 percent of public company listings from 11.32 percent, while New Jersey slipped to 4.53 percent from 5.62 percent.Other states have had growth. Texas rose to 10.26 percent of public companies from 8.38 percent. Massachusetts climbed to 5.12 percent from 3.95 percent. The state is home to technology and pharmaceuticals, two of the biggest growth industries in the United States.Still, the concentration of American corporate might is stark. Nearly 40 percent of all public companies are in just four states: California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas. Three of them \u2014 California, New York and Texas \u2014 account for a third of the Fortune 500.And the trend is accelerating. In the last 12 months, California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas accounted for 50 percent of all initial public offerings by operating companies, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The geographical shift reflects a changing world. The five biggest companies in the United States by market value are all technology companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 three of them with headquarters in California. Not one existed in 1965. The tech phenomenon has benefited California more than all other states, a rise that seems to be unabated.The continued emergence of biotechnology as the other main growth engine of new public company formation appears to be helping California, Massachusetts and Texas, the three states that have long held the lead in this industry.These three stand out as the winners. Why would three very different states perform so well?One might have expected that high-regulation, high-cost, high-tax states like California would decline over time as companies migrated. Texas, of course, offers a different situation. Yet it is not alone among states offering lower taxes and lower regulatory costs.And then what is one to make of Massachusetts, a relatively small state that is punching above its weight? It has regulation and taxes, and yet also business competitiveness.There is no special formula for states to be homes to companies. Instead, what appears to be going on is a winner-take-all system.California is a good example. It is a state burdened with a high tax rate, significant regulation and extreme housing costs. It is the type of place that you would think would lose business. But instead, California is winning at creating public companies. This may be because it already has a significant base of growth companies attracting yet more people to feed off the infrastructure and then create yet more new, big companies. Similar arguments can be made about Massachusetts and the natural network that its biotechnology companies and universities create.Compare this with Texas, which is known for having good hospitals and generates companies in more divergent fields. This may indeed be helped by a more business-friendly environment, but it is more likely a result of the centers that have developed in these fields.New York is increasingly the home of finance companies with a sprinkling of health care companies. But its people\u2019s skills are more associated with media, fashion, finance and consumer companies. Gone are the days when any big corporation would make New York its home because that was the place to be.This is not to say that other states are not successful in business. South Carolina and Alabama, for example, have successfully created manufacturing hubs by creating nonunion, business-friendly environments.There needs to be more study of why certain states nurture and attract public companies.For these states, the economic benefits are not just from those companies alone. There are also secondary effects. The advisers to these companies \u2014 the lawyers, the bankers \u2014 will increasingly be pulled from their New York homes, particularly to the West Coast. As the new crop of unicorns \u2014 start-ups valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 goes public, even at reduced valuations, this pull will continue and the big services that are the specialization of New York are likely to spread out even more to these other states.The country is still going West, it seems.Advertisement"}

Peeks don\u2019t come easy for Mr. Brown, who has always been more of a controlled showman than a freewheeling chef.What distinguishes Diana Henry\u2019s work isn\u2019t just the quantity of recipes she produces, but their quality and originality, particularly in the creativity of her ingredient combinations. Seasoned with Kashmiri chiles, saffron, grape must and tamarind; garnished with pomegranate seeds, fresh mint, dill and parsley; and drizzled with prodigious amounts of sour yogurt, her flavor pairings are intelligently conceived without being pretentious.Each of these books has its own clear, complete vision for what modern home cooking should look like: comforting, practical, often vegetable-focused and with a global point of view.For her latest, Fuchsia Dunlop, a British cook and food writer who has been studying Chinese cooking since the mid-1990s, dives deep into the balanced flavors of Jiangnan, the region in eastern China that includes the nation\u2019s largest city, Shanghai. The illustrator Carolyn Phillips takes a broader approach with her book, offering practical advice for cooks in the United States.The author Naomi Duguid\u2019s latest cookbook is a search for Persian cuisine, which includes stops in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran and Kurdistan.In the spirit of Judy Rogers\u2019s \u201cZuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook\u201d or Paul Bertolli\u2019s \u201cCooking by Hand,\u201d the chef Naomi Pomeroy, of the restaurant Beast in Portland, Ore., doesn\u2019t want to show off. She wants to hold your hand and take you there \u2014 \u201cthere\u201d being a land where demi-glace and souffl\u00e9s are actually cool, and where teaching is preferable to telling.The Atlanta-based chef Asha Gomez\u2019s lack of a classical cooking education is, in part, what makes this cookbook delightful. She intuits the needs and desires of the home cook; a chicken and rice dish is fancy in both name and flavor, but it dirties just one pot.Both \u201cMozza at Home\u201d from the Los Angeles chef Nancy Silverton with Carolynn Carre\u00f1o and \u201cEat in My Kitchen\u201d from Meike Peters offer skills for entertaining.The chef Marcus Samuelsson\u2019s latest cookbook maintains that Harlem contains cultural multitudes and bears out the notion with recipes like ham hocks with mustard greens, and arepas, all mixed in with exuberant portraits of neighborhood people.Produced by Sara BonisteelAdvertisement"}

So notable has been its practice that the company was called out as one of the most aggressive users of equity grants by Mark Mahaney, a veteran stock analyst with RBC Capital Markets.By comparison, LinkedIn paid out 17 percent of its revenue in stock-based grants last year, or about $510 million. Salesforce.com, which along with Google has expressed interest in buying Twitter, paid out 8 percent of sales in such packages, or $593.6 million, over the same time period.Tech companies that do not factor stock-based compensation into their preferred earnings metrics, such as Twitter, argue that such payouts are not cash and do not reflect the underlying health of core businesses.(Not all tech companies urge investors and analysts to ignore stock-based compensation. Facebook and Amazon are among those that factor in those grants as a real expense.)But a new owner would need to compensate its newest employees by either paying cash or doling out yet more equity. Ignoring those grants, particularly ones made to the most desirable employees like top engineers, is simply impossible for a buyer.Those costs have apparently not diminished the interest of some potential buyers. Shares of Twitter were up about 1 percent after Bloomberg reported that Walt Disney was working with a financial adviser to weigh a possible bid.Still, questions remain about whether Twitter is already valued too richly \u2014 its market capitalization as of Monday afternoon was more than $16 billion.

{"Headline": "U.S. Accuses Tech Firm Palantir of Bias Against Asian Engineers", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The United States Department of Labor sued Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics start-up, claiming systemic discrimination against Asian job applicants. The move again raises questions about diversity in Silicon Valley.In its suit, filed on Monday, the Labor Department claimed that Palantir\u2019s hiring processes for software engineering positions placed Asians at a disadvantage. Qualified Asian candidates were routinely eliminated during the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screening and telephone interview process, the government said. The company also relied on an employee referral system that favored non-Asian candidates.Should the suit succeed, the Labor Department has asked for an order canceling all of Palantir\u2019s current and future government contracts, which would include those with the F.B.I. and the United States Army.In a statement, Palantir denied the allegations and said that it was disappointed with the suit. \u201cThe Department of Labor relies on a narrow and flawed statistical analysis relating to three job descriptions from 2010 to 2011,\u201d the company said.The government\u2019s suit against Palantir is unusual in that the claim focuses on discrimination exhibited against Asians, who have typically been better represented at many tech companies than African-Americans or Latinos.The suit \u2014 and the proposed penalty \u2014 is a blow for Palantir, a company formed in 2004 and funded by well-known investors including Peter Thiel.Palantir\u2019s software has been credited with helping intelligence agencies find and kill Osama bin Laden. While Palantir now also counts state and local governments, financial firms and health care companies as clients, as a United States government contractor, it is subject to executive orders that prohibit hiring discrimination.\u201cIt is rare to see such blatant and obvious discrimination in a federal complaint,\u201d said Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer at Outten & Golden, a law firm that specializes in workplace fairness cases. \u201cNot because discrimination isn\u2019t common, but because companies usually make the business decision to go through the conciliation process and settle with the government.\u201dThe government said it had tried to work with Palantir to resolve the claims before the process broke down. Two government divisions unsuccessfully tried to \u201csecure Palantir\u2019s voluntary compliance\u201d with anti-discrimination laws, the suit said.The government said Palantir\u2019s behavior with Asian candidates included one example where software engineering jobs drew a pool of more than 1,160 qualified applicants. Of that number, 85 percent were Asian. Yet Palantir ultimately hired 11 Asian applicants and 14 non-Asian applicants.\u201cThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in 3.4 million,\u201d the Labor Department said in its complaint.After attempts at a settlement failed, the Labor Department filed a formal notice last October asking Palantir to show why the government should not begin enforcement proceedings related to its findings that the company had used discriminatory hiring processes.Advertisement"}

But the automaker agreed to rebuild another assembly line there to produce cars and trucks.The move will bolster overall employment in Oshawa, which currently has about 5,700 total workers, including engineering and other nonunion employees. The automaker also agreed to move production of one engine from Mexico to another Ontario plant, a provision that bucks the trade trend.The tentative deal \u201creally turned the tide of what has happened in the auto industry in this country for over a decade,\u201d said Jerry Dias, the leader of Canada\u2019s Unifor, the country\u2019s largest private sector union.In a brief statement, G.M. said that the agreement would lead to \u201csignificant new product, technology and process investments\u201d at its two Canadian factories, as well as a parts warehouse elsewhere in Ontario. The company added that it would be looking for government financing to cover some of the investment.While the deal focuses on two production lines, it has proved a battleground for the country\u2019s manufacturing. The cars and trucks produced in Canada, most of which are shipped to the United States, are a vital component of the country\u2019s exports.But the industrial heartland has been hit by the same forces reshaping manufacturing worldwide.Last year, 2.2 million cars and trucks were made in Canada, compared with 2.6 million 10 years earlier. And since the 2008 recession, new factories have largely headed toward the United States and, increasingly, Mexico.At the outset of negotiations, the union was focused on keeping jobs in Canada, rather than on traditional issues like improving wages and benefits. The carmaker was similarly clear that it would not make a decision about any investments in Canada until after the negotiations concluded.In recent years, General Motors has pulled back production in Canada.The company is gone from Windsor, Ontario, the city across the river from Detroit. Most of what was once a transmission plant there is now a pile of demolition rubble. From the site, the cylindrical towers of G.M.\u2019s world headquarters are now clearly visible.Unifor feared a similar future awaited Oshawa, where the company and its predecessors have been making cars for 108 years.The Oshawa plant has two assembly lines. One, which produces the Chevrolet Equinox, is set to close under the new deal. The other builds the Cadillac XTS, the Buick Regal and the Chevrolet Impala.A much newer G.M. plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, seems to have a comparatively secure future. It is the company\u2019s main source of the Equinox, a top-selling small sport utility vehicle, as well as of the similar GMC Terrain. That factory is covered by a separate contract that expires next year.G.M. also operates a plant that produces engines and transmissions in St. Catharines, Ontario, which Mr. Dias said also required investment from the company.Under the new labor pact, G.M. is to move some engine production to St. Catharines from Mexico. The new pact also calls for wage increases. And temporary workers will switch to full time. But, in a concession from Unifor, new employees at G.M. Canada will receive defined contribution retirement plans, rather than full pensions.After settling with G.M., Unifor will now have to deal with the clouds hanging over some factories owned by Ford Motor of Canada and FCA Canada, part of Fiat Chrysler. The Canadian manufacturing operations of Honda and Toyota are not unionized.FCA recently renovated a plant in Windsor that makes minivans, but uncertainty surrounds its former American Motors factory in the Toronto suburb of Brampton, Ontario, which produces large rear-wheel-drive cars. And while there is little near-term concern about the Ford assembly plant in Oakville, Ontario, that is not the case with an aging factory in Windsor that builds large 10-cylinder engines.Despite the settlement with G.M., Canada remains a tough sell.During the contract talks, Unifor pitched the weakness of the Canadian dollar as a potential cost advantage for American carmakers, providing a discount on spending in Canada. But companies are generally reluctant to base long-term investment plans on fluctuating exchange rates.The union also highlighted its pay system, in which workers do not reach full-scale wages for 10 years, presenting an advantage over that of American unions. But Canada is trying to find its place at a politically sensitive time when the United States wants to bring more jobs home.\u201cPolicy makers used to be focused on expanding production\u201d in Canada, said Greig Mordue, an associate professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and the former general manager of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. \u201cNow they\u2019re focused on sustaining what they\u2019ve got.\u201dCanada also can\u2019t effectively compete with Mexico anymore.Most carmakers have developed standardized manufacturing systems. So quality control and productivity remain relatively consistent in different locations, according to Mr. Mordue.Car companies can also recruit factory workers with higher skill levels than in the past, since they offer better wages than other types of manufacturers in Mexico. \u201cWhen you pay a premium, you get the best,\u201d Mr. Mordue said.G.M. provided one of the few bits of good news for Canada when it said in June that it would hire up to 750 people, mostly engineers, to work on software development and research in the country. As with Google and other tech companies, a major attraction was the University of Waterloo\u2019s highly regarded mathematics and computer science departments.But Mr. Mordue said such gains provided little consolation to less skilled factory workers facing an uncertain future. \u201cYou can\u2019t replace 7,000 production jobs with 700 software engineering jobs,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

More rivals have meant wider awareness for the overall business of online grocery ordering and delivery, he said in a telephone interview.Seizing that potential new business has become the game.\u201cThe general pressure is in the fight for new customers who haven\u2019t cast their vote yet,\u201d he said.FreshDirect operates in New York City and in Philadelphia, and the fund-raising is meant to help the company expand into new geographic markets and business lines, as well as to improve its distribution capacity.FreshDirect has also moved into new businesses. In January, it unveiled FoodKick, a service that delivers food within an hour. According to Mr. Ackerman, it is meant to cater to \u201cnonplanned instant gratification,\u201d not unlike what Instacart offers.Mr. Ackerman added that one of FreshDirect\u2019s advantages was that it had been profitable since 2010. He said sales had grown every quarter for the last 12 years, with revenue now above $600 million a year.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that we have achieved scale and profitability,\u201d Mr. Ackerman said, adding that any expansion plans would be from a \u201csolid foundation.\u201dMr. Ackerman said that FreshDirect began looking to raise additional funds about six months ago and that the company began discussions soon after with JPMorgan, whose asset management unit led the latest investment round.As part of FreshDirect\u2019s fund-raising, two JPMorgan executives \u2014 Larry Unrein, the head of the asset management unit\u2019s private equity group; and Ashmi Mehrotra, a managing director \u2014 will join the company\u2019s board.\u201cAs demand for fresh ingredients delivered to your door continues to rise, high-quality food, produce and packaged goods providers are drawing significant attention from the investment community,\u201d Mr. Unrein said in a statement, adding that FreshDirect was a \u201cforward-thinking leader\u201d in the sector.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toronto\u2019s Transit Advice for New York: Give Streetcars Their Own Lanes", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 As the streetcar crept along Queen Street West in clogged traffic through the heart of downtown, anxiety started to rise among those inside. Commuters checked the time, calculating how late they would be for work.The red-and-white trolley did not feel like rapid transit.\u201cIt\u2019s not very efficient,\u201d said Shande McPhee, who was a half-hour late for her financial-industry job on a recent morning because of worse-than-usual congestion. If only the streetcar had a dedicated lane to bypass cars, she said.Despite flare-ups of grumpiness, tens of thousands of people in Canada\u2019s largest city rely on the vehicles to get around on North America\u2019s largest streetcar system.As New York works to complete a rigorous study of the line by the fall, streetcar riders and transit experts in Toronto have repeated the same two warnings: build dedicated lanes to keep the streetcars from getting trapped in traffic and be prepared for outrage over the loss of street space and parking.In Toronto, about 250,000 riders use the city\u2019s 11 streetcar lines each day. Many of the lines run east-west on the same roadways as cars, connecting commuters to a broader network of subway and bus lines. A few routes, like the Spadina line, have their own lane separated from traffic by a raised curb.\u201cI would only take streetcars that have their own lane,\u201d Matthew Hibbert said as he rode a new Spadina streetcar on a recent afternoon. \u201cI would try to find a way to a subway if I had to take a streetcar that was in regular traffic.\u201dBut the reaction from drivers when lanes of traffic are set aside for streetcars can be politically troublesome, said Josh Colle, a Toronto city councilor and the current chairman of the Transit Commission. Years after the city added a dedicated lane on the St. Clair line, it is still a delicate topic.\u201cIt\u2019s like a holy war,\u201d Mr. Colle said in an interview at his office in City Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s more than pushback. It\u2019s vicious.\u201dLocal businesses worry they will lose customers if street parking is removed. Drivers fear fewer car lanes will make commutes more painful.Yet many Torontonians love the streetcars and delight in their elegance and nostalgia, a kind of romance that is also palpable in cities like New Orleans and San Francisco.\u201cI actually enjoy riding the streetcar more than the subway, just to be able to be outside, instead of being stuck underground,\u201d Rob Bird, an actor, said as he took the Queen line in Toronto, calling the trip \u201cserene.\u201dIn recent years, Mr. Giambrone, 39, has reinvented himself as a transit expert, working on projects in Milwaukee and Montreal.\u201cYou can Google me; it\u2019s all there,\u201d Mr. Giambrone said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone through this, and I\u2019ve learned from it.\u201dSteve Munro, a transit advocate in Toronto who has advised Mr. Giambrone in the past, said New York officials must focus on block-by-block planning for the streetcar line and listen closely to community feedback.\u201cAdam\u2019s really got his work cut out for him getting the project to a point where it\u2019s credible to the people it\u2019s going to serve,\u201d Mr. Munro said. \u201cBecause if the area it\u2019s going to go through doesn\u2019t want it, that project is going to die.\u201dMr. Giambrone, who is living near the proposed streetcar corridor on the border of Downtown Brooklyn and Fort Greene, seemed to understand the challenges ahead and was enthusiastic to begin. He said he had already walked the corridor and envisioned several rounds of public meetings.The streetcar must offer reliable service and easy connections to the subway, Mr. Giambrone said, so that people will use it as part of their commute.\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a tourist tram,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for economic development. This has to work as a transportation project.\u201dA major question is whether commuters would be able to pay one fare to use the city-run streetcar and the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s subways and buses. In Toronto, there are free transfers between all three modes, but the entire network is run by a city-led agency.As the project moves forward, Mr. Giambrone said he was confident officials would want to make it a success by integrating fares. As for whether the line might be built in stages, he said it was likely because the city could not close the entire corridor for construction all at once.Samuel I. Schwartz, a consultant for the real-estate-backed nonprofit Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector and a former city traffic commissioner, said it would be best to start with the middle part of the route, because that was where the \u201cmeat of the ridership\u201d would be. Though people will inevitably complain about the loss of parking, he said the benefits outweighed the costs.\u201cI\u2019ve worked in this city for 45 years,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said, \u201cand frankly, if God came down and proposed the Garden of Eden, people would protest that.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the location of a streetcar. It is Dundas Street West, not King Street.Advertisement"}

When sunshine fades or the wind dies down, so does the power they generate.A total reliance on renewable energy will require a major expansion of the utility\u2019s capacity to store energy for use at other times. To get there, officials said they are looking at least in part to the promise of batteries.For the moment, however, battery systems remain too costly to help integrate renewables on a large scale, government agencies say. To get around that problem, Los Angeles is counting on time.Just as solar panels have leapt in efficiency and plummeted in price, so goes the hope for batteries.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the technology get better and get less expensive with each passing year,\u201d said Mr. Bonin, the council member. \u201cSo we want to be able to sort of look forward and plan for what we think is coming.\u201dSan Francisco, hills and all, is a cyclist\u2019s city.On Monday, the editors of Bicycling magazine gave a shout-out to city leaders for making it a safer place to ride, ranking it the country\u2019s No. 2 \u201cbike city.\u201dChicago took the top spot, a triumph credited to Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s effort there to add 100 miles of bike lanes.This year, San Francisco moved up five places since the last survey in 2014.The magazine said the city had added miles of bike lanes, installed 800 new bicycle racks and experienced a surge in ridership.Other California cities were well represented down the rankings, with Oakland coming in at 21, Los Angeles 24, San Jose 26, Long Beach 28, Sacramento 37 and Thousand Oaks 49.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

As with all award-distributing endeavors, the Emmys are deeply flawed, and we must not confuse Emmy-worthiness with goodness nor its opposite with badness. But I love a spectacle, and rituals are the way we consecrate behavior to foster magical experiences within ordinary acts. Plus look at how nice everyone looks!Before the Emmys on Sunday night, though, there are two fabulous shows premiering this weekend, and Watching\u2019s movie writer, Monica Castillo, has two great movie recommendations for you.Let\u2019s all really make a go of things this weekend. Wheee.Phoebe Waller-Bridge created and stars in this British series that starts out as dark, filthy fun and deepens into a stunningly rich portrait of a complex, complicated woman.On the one hand, she has perfect British sweaters and alluring pink lipstick and a haircut that I swear will inspire 10,000 curly bobs, and she\u2019s funny and smart and seemingly irresistible to men. On the other hand, she\u2019s a wreck \u2014 and not in that \u201ctee-hee, I\u2019m just a lil girl with all this whiskey!\u201d way women are \u201cwrecks\u201d in TV shows. She\u2019s a profoundly self-sabotaging monster. The show breaks the fourth wall just often enough for cheekiness without devolving into commentary on itself, and it captures some of the unresolvable tension of adult-sibling relationships and the intoxicating thrall of intimate friendships.The more \u201cHigh Maintenance\u201d you watch, the more you\u2019ll like it, and I strongly encourage you to watch the web episodes (available on HBO streaming platforms) before watching the cable version. Lots of familiar faces reappear, and while context isn\u2019t essential, it never hurts.\u201cHigh\u201d follows a bicycle-riding weed dealer only identified as \u201cthe Guy\u201d (the show\u2019s co-creator Ben Sinclair) and his various clients \u2014 most episodes are heavier on the clients than on the Guy, but there are a few exceptions. Most of the webisodes were under 10 minutes, so this leap to HBO does push the format a little; the show compensates by having most episodes cover two clients\u2019 stories.More important than exact story structure, though, is the show\u2019s, well, vibes: It can be nakedly and straightforwardly hilarious, but it tends more to the gimlet eye \u2014 though only toward the characters who can take it. The wounded, vulnerable and downtrodden are handled with gentle care, with the encouraging gaze of a hopeful kindergarten teacher.Ever since \u201cRevenge,\u201d \u201cRinger\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl\u201d (such guilty pleasures!) ended, I\u2019ve been looking for a show that has rich people with ridiculous dramas and money problems, but haven\u2019t quite found the right one for me. Everyone tells me to watch \u201cQuantico,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d or \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder,\u201d but those are pretty \u201ceh\u201d (and I don\u2019t like medical shows). Could you please help me out? \u2014 JohnOh, I love a good rich-person soap.

Ending it on a note of near-total uncertainty, with virtually none of its major story lines resolved for either good or ill, is somehow even crueler.We learn the lethal nature of the vast hacker conspiracy\u2019s \u201cStage 2\u201d (note how its architects eschewed the more neutral \u201cPhase 2\u201d for its appropriately cancerous alternative) \u2014 blowing up the building where E Corp is warehousing all its paper records and killing everyone inside \u2014 but we don\u2019t find out if the plan went through.We catch up with on-the-lam fsociety co-founders Mobley and Trenton at the big box electronics retailer where they now work, but so does Dark Society assassin Leon; we don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll kill them before Trenton gets the chance to enact her so-crazy-it-just-might-work scheme to undo everything the 5/9 hack has done. (We don\u2019t learn what that scheme is, either.)We discover along with Darlene that the F.B.I. agent Dom DiPierro and her colleagues have fsociety\u2019s supposedly secure organization mapped out to every last low-level associate and unwitting patsy, but we aren\u2019t shown whether this knowledge breaks her resolve or strengthens it. We don\u2019t see the archvillains, the E Corp chief executive, Phillip Price, or the Dark Army overlord, Whiterose, at all.Sure, the show tosses a few crumbs our way \u2014 Cisco\u2019s dead, Darlene and Tyrell Wellick are alive, Romero was killed by a random stray bullet, Joanna Wellick\u2019s mysterious phone calls and evocative gifts are part of a campaign of vengeance by Scott Knowles, whose pregnant wife was murdered by Tyrell.But in the main, the way the final scenes before the credits and the subsequent \u201cstinger\u201d end \u2014 the world fades to black on a gutshot Elliot, gunned down by Tyrell, as his Mr. Robot persona flickers out; Manhattan plunges into darkness as Angela heads out to meet her wounded friend, who seems to have survived the shooting but about whose condition we know nothing else \u2014 stand for the rest of the episode. \u201cMr. Robot\u201d Season 2 didn\u2019t so much end as slip into darkness.A quick Google search for \u201c23 burning questions the \u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 season finale must answer\u201d or the like will indirectly indicate just how many people will be unhappy with this approach. So much of Season 1\u2019s visceral pleasures \u2014 the cyberthriller sequences, the shocking twists, the anticapitalist triumphalism, the ragtag band of losers, loners, racial minorities and emotional outcasts taking on the system and winning \u2014 were stripped away or rendered moot as Season 2 went on.But two quotes from the episode \u2014 one from a character, one from a song on the soundtrack \u2014 point the way to appreciating the season finale, and the season as a whole, for the crazily confident act of artistic self-immolation it was. The first comes from Agent DiPierro, talking to Darlene about \u201cThe Careful Massacre of the Bourgeoisie,\u201d the fake slasher movie that served as a sort of tonal Rosetta Stone for the season\u2019s horror-movie vibe. \u201cIt\u2019s not really scary, but gory,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know how those two things aren\u2019t really the same?\u201dThe implication is that while gore can be fun, fear is where greatness lies. Blowing up E Corp or taking down Price and Whiterose or ending on some similarly pyrotechnic note would have been the equivalent of empty-calorie splatter \u2014 giving us the emotional roller-coaster ride evoked by the series\u2019 constant Coney Island iconography but returning us safely to the starting point. It\u2019s better to be difficult and delay gratification; to be disturbing and relegate violence to terrifyingly irrational outbreaks of the sort visited on Cisco, Darlene and Dom by the Dark Army, or on Joanna by an enraged Scott, who beats her nearly to death, or on Elliot by Tyrell, whom he believes is a figment of his imagination until the moment he gets shot in the stomach with the gun of his distraught partner in crime.The second quote is a question, and a musical one at that. It\u2019s posed by Kenny Rogers (and his duet partner Sheena Easton, by way of original writer-performer Bob Seger) over the season\u2019s closing minutes: \u201cWe\u2019ve got tonight \u2014 who needs tomorrow?\u201d To focus solely on the answers, or lack thereof, the finale provides about the show\u2019s future is to ignore the many dark delights on offer even now. There\u2019s actor Martin Wallstrom as Wellick, a presence withheld from the screen almost entirely until this final episode, when he is called upon to unleash a lifetime of mind-warping fear, frustration, ambition and emptiness as he tearfully turns on the one man he\u2019s ever felt understands his drives.There\u2019s Brian Stokes Mitchell as Scott, in an oddly similar place of devastation and dread, sobbing and begging for forgiveness one moment, exploding in a graphically brutal assault the next. There\u2019s Stephanie Corneliussen as Joanna Wellick, a supremely loathsome cocktail of vulgarity and cruelty, who begins her meeting with Scott by graphically describing her arousal over his latest mind game and ends it with shouting how glad she is that his unborn baby died. There\u2019s Carly Chaikin and Grace Gummer as Darlene and Dom, two \u201cJersey girls\u201d who could not look and sound more exhausted by the cat-and-mouse game they\u2019ve played.There\u2019s Rami Malek as Elliot Alderson and Christian Slater as his Mr. Robot persona, and the ultrarare use of a hand-held camera, swirling around them as they argue about who was really calling the shots \u2014 as vivid an illustration of our inability to control our destructive impulses as you\u2019ll find on TV, if you stop taking the split-personality aspect so literally and see how it speaks to so much more.Would any of this be materially improved if the E Corp building were blown to bits, or if anything similarly definitive and prosaic happened? Like the singer of the song, this season finale (literally) turned out the light and (figuratively) asked us to come take its hand \u2014 a risk, but one eminently worth taking. \u201cWe\u2019ve got tonight, babe.

That gulf tells you a lot about why Snap\u2019s founder Evan Spiegel has kept his company in Venice Beach, near the ocean and studio lots that have shaped popular culture for decades.The brand\u2019s laid-back Southern California approach was first apparent in its messaging and media app Snapchat, where the messages quickly disappear.The videos are short and sweet and have become a hit with young people who are wary of Facebook and Instagram with their permanent records of social media.Just as Snap outwardly eschews the more earnest Silicon Valley ethos \u2014 technology should change the world \u2014 it has also sidestepped the biggest mistakes made by Google Glass.Glass, which was shut down as a consumer product last year, didn\u2019t show people when it was recording. Some techies didn\u2019t care, but many found it a violation of privacy.Single-use plastic bags are the shameful hallmark of a society that has become overdependent on things we don\u2019t need. Nothing we use for five minutes should end up polluting our environment for hundreds of years.\u2014 Dan JacobsonWhen plastic bags made their debut to replace the brown paper bag that sometimes would tear or become damp from produce, dairy or frozen food items, I thought this was a heaven sent idea for both merchants and customers. ... I would vote to remove the ban and allow us to use or continue to use the little, free, almost spaceless plastic bags.\u2014 Estella DavisI think it\u2019s time to get rid of plastic bags. We\u2019re just lazy and forget our $2 bags we can buy at Rite Aid and have in our trunks. I constantly forget mine but I know I wouldn\u2019t if I had to.\u2014 Liz HartThe lemon festival was a lemon.Maybe it was a light crop? There was lemon pie ($3 a slice), a stand where you could buy lemon-flavored beer, and, yes, lemonade. But that was about it, at least as far as lemony food and drink. Out of the 40-some tented booths dedicated to crafts and local businesses, only about five or six had anything to do with lemons (T-shirts, mostly).A bowl, please. And ice tea \u2014 with lemon.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C. Berkeley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Naylor: A Sun-Drenched Cubicle, but Hardly the French Riviera", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorkspaceSunshine and studentsWe\u2019re on Fifth Avenue and 16th Street, on the 15th floor, off Union Square Park, with views of the Empire State Building and the West Side. The New School has several floors in our building, and there are other schools in the area, so there are always students around. It\u2019s a nice vibe. We have an open setting with so much natural light that sometimes there\u2019s a glare on the computer screens and we have to raise and lower the blinds. But the light is great, so I\u2019ll take that.The dividers have earsWe all have standing desks but I\u2019m rarely in the office a full day. I\u2019m in meetings or out with the sales staff talking to customers, so when I\u2019m at my desk I tend to sit. Having a desk in the same space as everyone else means you hear things you might not hear in a formal setting.1. Notes on successThe papers on the wall divider are things I need to know that I don\u2019t want to memorize, such as which sales reps call on which of our digital advertisers. The green cards contain our strategy and vision. I keep the quote, \u201cHow to succeed in business by really, really, really trying,\u201d because it reminds me that you have to work. As much as I\u2019d like to think success is all talent, it\u2019s not. Hard work makes the difference.2. Birth of a companyI have a plaque that marks the creation of Hulu, which streams programs and other content to television. Hulu didn\u2019t even have a name in the beginning; it was called NewSite. At the time, I ran digital ad sales for NBC, one of Hulu\u2019s partners, and was lucky enough to be a part of the 2007 launch.Seizing the dayI\u2019m an early bird, at my desk by 7 a.m. I take the train in from New Jersey, and there are fewer commuters at that time. I can also crank away on my inbox and attack the day early.Feeding the mojoI drink water at work and eat healthy food. Water keeps you hydrated, and it\u2019s all about energy \u2014 you want to bring the right mojo to the job. I might have lunch with customers three days a week, but the other days I usually eat a salad from Chop\u2019t.3. Salute to New YorkThe glass apples belonged to my grandparents, who loved the Big Apple. One sat on my grandfather\u2019s desk when he was C.E.O. of Chemical Bank from 1973 to 1984. The other belonged to my grandmother, who served on the board of the New-York Historical Society. They say it all about New York and work. I\u2019m one of seven grandchildren and am selfishly happy I ended up with them.View of the futureIn March we launched our Hulu VR app, so Google Cardboard virtual reality headsets are passed around a lot here. You slide your smartphone into the viewer and voil\u00e0. These aren\u2019t the most sophisticated headsets on the market, but they can open people\u2019s eyes to what can happen with VR. They\u2019re a sign of where media is going.4. Gold and goalsThe gold coin is a gift from Tom Deierlein, a friend who started the TD Foundation, named after him. I\u2019m on the board. It provides aid to children affected by war in Afghanistan, and children and families of United States wounded warriors and those killed in action. The other coin is from a two-day course given by the Johnson & Johnson Human Performance Institute. It focuses you on your purpose and goals in life. The coin is a reminder to never forget your goals.The phone zoneI spend a lot of time in our conference room talking with headquarters, in Santa Monica, Calif., either with my boss, the leadership team, my direct reports or the finance group. The bookshelves are lined with some Hulu mementos and awards and some of my favorite business books. I\u2019m a member of the Television Academy and can vote for Emmy contenders, so there are also \u201cFor Your Consideration\u201d DVDs from broadcast and cable companies and online TV creators.From conferences to CannesI frequently travel to Detroit, Chicago, San Francisco and L.A., our primary sales hubs, and attend conferences of organizations like the Association of National Advertisers and the Interactive Advertising Bureau. In June, I attended the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. If you have to work, it\u2019s a good place to go.Interview conducted and condensed by Patricia R. Olsen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Pui-Wing\u2019s Week in Tech: Yahoo\u2019s Hacking, Self-Driving Cars and the Future of Twitter", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsA few things stand out to me about this attack. It\u2019s obviously terrible for everyone whose information has been breached, and it also comes at a terrible time for Yahoo, which is in the process of selling most of its assets to Verizon. What happens to that sale, now, seems in question; this sort of disclosure could affect aspects of the deal, including the price. After all, although Yahoo has long been in decline, the company still has a loyal user base that has stuck with it for email and other web services. To the extent that those people are scared away by this breach, Verizon may well want to reconsider.What do you think? Are the endless Yahoo acquisition talks going to get even more endless now?But it\u2019s unclear how that might affect the price of the deal, or if Verizon will walk away from Yahoo. Hackings now happen all the time and to almost every corporate entity. So Verizon couldn\u2019t very well build in an escape clause on a deal for an industrywide problem, though it may have some leverage to chip away at price or some other deal conditions.All I know is that a horde of lawyers and investment bankers must be getting well paid right now to figure it all out.I suspect that like me, you\u2019ve noticed a huge change in Silicon Valley recently. From Uber to Tesla to Google to Apple, much of the industry has become obsessed with cars. Where we used to talk about smartphones and apps, we now talk about electric engines, location mapping and ride sharing.I\u2019m personally gratified to see this happening; cars are expensive, inefficient and environmentally problematic, exactly the sort of big challenge that techies want to fix. But I\u2019ve also heard grumbling both inside and outside the Valley that companies here are biting off more than they can chew in attacking the auto industry. Do you agree?Did I really just say that? Eyeroll.Finally, let\u2019s talk about my favorite pastime, Twitter. Several big things happened with the slow-growing 140-character social network. First, the 140 characters got a bit looser. As of this week, when you add images, links or other multimedia elements to your tweet, they won\u2019t count against the character limit. In other words, tweets got just a bit longer.These deals are something of a strategy shift for the company. It\u2019s looking to become a kind of TV network, the place you\u2019ll turn to first when you want to watch something. I think this is a great idea. Livestreaming sports, awards shows and other news events can be a hassle today \u2014 you\u2019ve got to find a link, usually log in with your cable-company account, and then you\u2019re often presented with some slow, blurry stream that makes you tear your hair out. Twitter, thankfully, is trying to solve this. It could be pretty handy.But it also seems a little bit of an odd game plan to save the company, right?But for now at least, I don\u2019t see it. The 13-year-olds are into Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest, even Musical.ly. Twitter? Not on their radar screen.Maybe Twitter needs to try something else, like making money off how brands use it for customer service. That sounds incredibly enterprise-y, but those boring businesses are often more predictable and profitable.Google isn\u2019t surprising. We\u2019ve heard rumors for years that the search company, which has perennially failed at building social apps, is interested in the microblogging network. But an acquisition by Salesforce is a stranger idea. I don\u2019t immediately get how it would work, and there\u2019s a very high chance that a business-focused cloud company could ruin the freewheeling network. But if Salesforce thinks of some out-of-the-box way to use Twitter as a customer service and lead-generation network, that could be lucrative.Anyway, thanks for joining me! I hope you spend the weekend bracing for Mike\u2019s return. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.Advertisement"}

We\u2019re going to talk about flow moments.You\u2019re going to learn how to find a fulfilling career. You\u2019re going to learn how to better navigate life\u2019s big-moment decisions and kill your \u201cwicked problems\u201d dead.How? By training yourself to think like a designer.\u201cHow do you find the one to love \u2014 we don\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Burnett said. \u201cWe also don\u2019t give advice on weight loss.\u201dAfter nine years of teaching their secrets to future Google product managers and start-up wunderkinds, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans are opening up the curriculum to everyone. \u201cWhat do I want to be when I grow up?\u201d and \u201cAm I living a meaningful life?\u201d aren\u2019t only subjects for late-night pot-fueled dorm hangouts, the men said.\u201cThe question of \u2018What do I do with the rest of my one wild and wonderful life?\u2019 is on everyone\u2019s mind,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Mr. Burnett recalled a conversation with Stanford\u2019s dean of the engineering department, who was about to retire. \u201cHe said: \u2018Can I take your class? Because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to be now that I\u2019m not the dean anymore.\u2019\u201dMr. Burnett added: \u201cOne of the meta-narratives out there is that you should figure it out by 25, or maybe it\u2019s 27 now. Then there\u2019s the other thing of failure to launch, that millennials are slackers. Part of the permission we give people is: Reframe this. You\u2019re not supposed to have it figured out.\u201dMr. Burnett and Mr. Evans looked on as the roughly 50 Stanford students in their charge took out and read from their flow journals. Then they broke the class into discussion groups of six or seven.It was early May, and the students were in the final weeks of \u201cDesigning Your Life.\u201d Standing in the front of the room, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans began to make their way through a PowerPoint presentation.\u201cWhen did you seem the most animated, the most present?\u201d Mr. Burnett said, by way of guiding the discussion groups.Silviana Ilcus, an art history major who had completed more than 230 units at Stanford without having arrived at a firm idea of what she wanted to with her life, addressed the other members of her group.\u201cI don\u2019t have flow when I\u2019m doing art history,\u201d Ms. Ilcus said. \u201cI hate writing.\u201d The others listened patiently. \u201cMy flow was doing math,\u201d she said, seeming to have a light-bulb moment in real time. \u201cI\u2019m wondering why it didn\u2019t guide my choice of major.\u201dSitting at an outdoor campus food court after class, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans nodded in recognition after hearing of the exchange. \u201cThe course surfaces stuff that people haven\u2019t worked through yet, almost universally,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Mr. Burnett said, \u201cIt\u2019s a place to have this conversation, because nobody is asking them these questions, and they\u2019re not asking themselves.\u201dCollege students are promising empty vessels, as yet unburdened by the trade-offs and compromises that keep the rest of us up at night \u2014 say, hating your corporate job but loving the house it pays for, or wanting to fulfill your dream of backpacking across Europe with two young children in school. To make \u201cDesigning Your Life\u201d workable for people in midcareer, the professors had to do their own reframe of the curriculum.The book includes things that are not in the class, like what Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans call \u201canchor problems\u201d \u2014 overcommitted life choices that keep people stuck and unhappy. A common mistake that people make, they said, is to assume that there\u2019s only one right solution or optimal version of your life, and that if you choose wrong, you\u2019ve blown it.That\u2019s completely absurd, Mr. Evans said: \u201cThere are lots of you. There are lots of right answers.\u201dAs self-actualization messengers, the two men are an odd couple. Mr. Burnett, 59, is a self-contained, acerbic, existential atheist with an earring, while Mr. Evans, 63, is an outgoing, verbose, practicing Christian with the gray beard of a philosopher.Both are Stanford grads, and while they have accomplished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s (Mr. Burnett helped to design the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d toys and worked at Apple before becoming executive director of Stanford\u2019s design program; Mr. Evans also worked at Apple and co-founded Electronic Arts, the game company), each said his younger self would have been well served by the course.For his part, Mr. Evans struggled as a biology student, a major he chose because he had watched a Jacques Cousteau television special as a boy, and one he clung to because, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I had conscious permission to not know what I was doing.\u201dHe switched to mechanical engineering and graduated with a master\u2019s degree in the mid-\u201970s. But when an Apple recruiter called, he initially hung up, because he was bored by computers. In doing so, Mr. Evans said ruefully, he violated several principles of \u201cDesigning Your Life,\u201d among them staying open to \u201clatent wonderfulness.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re wrong, you go: \u2018Oh, computers are boring. O.K., I\u2019m going home now,\u2019\u201d Mr. Evans explained. \u201c \u2018Yes\u2019 is easy. \u2018No\u2019 is hard to come back from.\u201dMr. Burnett had an easier time on the surface, finding his way to the design program at Stanford and a lifelong vocation. Through a professor mentor, he landed a job as a toy designer and went on to greater success.But, he said: \u201cMy method was a blind walk. I didn\u2019t have any strategies. I trusted my intuition, but I worried that I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201dIn a place like Stanford, where yearly tuition is about $50,000, they thought it was worthwhile to send students into the world with practical knowledge about how to find a fulfilling job and excel at it.They began holding workshops for adults a few years ago, including for the employees of Google. The workshop and the book are an effort to take their approach beyond its cloistered campus setting.As Mr. Evans put it, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to give this thing away.\u201dIf you can get past the jargon-heavy language and Silicon Valley preciousness, many of the principles of \u201cDesigning Your Life\u201d are, in fact, helpful. Design thinking, as rendered in the book, is about treating life in a more improvisational way. It\u2019s a welcome counterbalance to the data-driven, engineering mind-set gripping the culture.Follow Mr. Burnett\u2019s and Mr. Evans\u2019s teachings, and the anxiety-ridden process of decision making suddenly seems more playful. Their method is experiential and accepts that failure is part of the process.Central to the philosophy is prototyping, a concept borrowed from how product designers work. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re thinking of changing careers. Interview someone who does the job you\u2019re considering. Better yet, ask to shadow them for a day, or work in the field on weekends. If it feels right, take it a step further; if it doesn\u2019t, move on.\u201cIt\u2019s a classic form of design,\u201d Mr. Burnett said. \u201cYou build a lot of stuff, you try a lot of stuff. But it\u2019s always less than the whole product.\u201dPrototyping big decisions like a career change or a move, meanwhile, guards against blowing up your life to rush headlong into the alluring unknown, or worse, taking no action for years, unhappily.Emma Wood, a 25-year-old Stanford graduate and a consultant at McKinsey & Company who took \u201cDesigning Your Life\u201d as an undergraduate, said the class released the pressure she felt about the life she would face after graduation.\u201cYour whole future and happiness aren\u2019t tied to this one plan working out,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can make mistakes. Failure is good.\u201dThe capstone of the Stanford class, and a key part of the book, is an assignment to come up with three \u201cOdyssey Plans\u201d that map out the next five years of your life in radically different ways.The activity is designed to reinforce the sense of multiple viable options, unlock the imagination and eliminate the attractive power of the unknown alternative.Lingtong Sun, who graduated from Stanford last year, said he continues to use the \u201cOdyssey Plan\u201d and other concepts from the class to decide his long-term career.\u201cOn the grand level, I haven\u2019t figured out what I want to do yet,\u201d said Mr. Sun, who works as a software engineer for a tech start-up in the Bay Area. \u201cBut I\u2019m more open to trying something and seeing how it goes. It\u2019s that bias toward action. You can\u2019t think your way into your future.\u201dBreaking down the system to its basic parts, as a designer would, Mr. Evans said, \u201cThere are only two things we offer in the class: ideas and tools.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf you think with these ideas rather than the ones you had before, and you use these tools, we believe your chance of building and getting what you want will go up.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Stanford University professors who teach the class Designing Your Life described incorrectly the $50,000 tuition that undergraduates at Stanford pay. That is full tuition, not in-state tuition. (Stanford is not a state university.) Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the location in California of the Alpine Inn, where the professors discussed their ideas for the course. It is in Portola Valley, not Palo Alto.Advertisement"}

A historian and biographer who was a film and theater critic for The Times of London, he writes that he became aware of the Cliburn story only when he read about the man\u2019s death in 2013.I couldn\u2019t write that paragraph without thinking about Cliburn\u2019s recording of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 1 and the corner of my parents\u2019 living room dominated by our Garrard record changer, the kind with a \u201cpusher platform\u201d for a whole stack of vinyl. That LP got heavy play in our house, and in a lot of other houses. It was the first classical recording to sell more than a million copies. \u00adCliburn\u2019s 1961 album \u201cMy Favorite Chopin\u201d was on the Billboard classical best-seller list for months.But by the time Cliff was growing up, Cliburn played less and less, and the \u00adcritics complained more and more. They said his repertoire was limited, his \u00adtechnique was superficial and he was not \u00admaturing as an artist. In 1986, Donal Henahan wrote in this newspaper: \u201cThere must be many young music listeners to whom Van Cliburn is merely a name in \u00adAmerican history, like John Philip Sousa.\u201d Nowadays, he\u2019s not even much of a name. The first time I did a search of \u201cVan Cliburn,\u201d Google shot back the primordial did-you-mean \u00adquestion: Van Claiborne?So one of Cliff\u2019s challenges is to present a basic biography of this \u201cman-child who was old when young and young when old.\u201d Cliburn\u2019s story \u2014 how he rocketed to fame by winning the first \u00adInternational Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow at age 23 \u2014 has been told before, in 16 excellent pages toward the beginning of Joseph Horowitz\u2019s \u201cThe Ivory Trade\u201d (1990) and in Howard Reich\u2019s \u201cVan \u00adCliburn\u201d (1993). But their emphasis was more on the music than on diplomacy and the Cold War. By the time Cliburn arrived in Moscow in the spring of 1958, the United States had countered the Soviets\u2019 Sputnik 1 and 2 with Explorer 1, but the psychological damage had been done. There was a space race as well as an arms race.As for the piano race, everyone assumed a Russian would win, probably 29-year-old Lev Vlassenko. But Cliburn captivated the crowds and caused a problem for the judges: Could they award him the gold medal? As Cliff writes, \u201cin a system where all decisions went through the party, there was only one way to avoid blame: Refer it upward.\u201d One of the \u00adjudges, the pianist Emil Gilels, went to the culture minister, who went to Khrushchev, who did not interfere. If the young American is the best, he said, go right ahead, give him the prize. Cliburn remains the only American pianist who has won the gold medal at the Tchaikovsky Competition.Cliff argues that \u201ca powerful new weapon exploded across the Soviet Union\u201d when Cliburn sat down at the piano \u2014 \u201clove: one man\u2019s love for music, which ignited an impassioned love affair between him and an entire nation.\u201d It was anything but illicit. Max Frankel, who as a New York Times correspondent was a witness to Cliburn\u2019s triumph, wrote later that \u201cthe Soviet public celebrated Cliburn not only for his artistry but for his nationality; affection for him was a safe expression of affection for America.\u201dLike so many subtitles, Cliff\u2019s (\u201cThe Van Cliburn Story \u2014 How One Man and His Piano Transformed the Cold War\u201d) oversimplifies a more nuanced account. Cliff did not turn up evidence that Cliburn ever passed secret diplomatic \u00addispatches back and forth; as he writes, Cliburn may have been \u201ccourted by presidents and Politburo members,\u201d but he was also \u201cwatched by the F.B.I. and K.G.B.\u201dMostly Cliburn served as a relief valve, easing the pressures his audiences felt. He did so again in 1987, when Mikhail Gorbachev went to Washington for arms-control talks with President Ronald Reagan. After a particularly difficult day, Cliburn played at the White House. When he struck up the Russian melody \u201cMoscow Nights\u201d as an encore \u2014 Raisa \u00adGorbachev wanted to hear the Tchaikovsky concerto, but there was no orchestra \u2014 Cliff writes that the evening \u201cturned into a full-throated singalong.\u201d Everyone went to bed in a much better mood.James Barron is a reporter for The Times and the author of \u201cPiano: The Making of a Steinway Concert Grand.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Vanderbilt Trades In Her Pop Star Strut for a Runway Glide", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrace NotesThe answer from the great-great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt, the railroad tycoon who in 1871 built Grand Central Depot, the first of the three stations at 42nd Street and Vanderbilt Avenue \u2014 was just as straightforward.Even so, these high-end heels were like the houses in real estate ads that say \u201cprice upon request.\u201d Kathrin Werner, an owner of Michela Rigucci and the company\u2019s chief executive, merely smiled when asked the how-much question.So, the big moment. A line from Walt Whitman came to mind: \u201cWhoever you are, I fear you are walking the walks of dreams.\u201dThe walk of Ms. Vanderbilt Costin\u2019s dreams would last about 35 seconds. The preparations took weeks. The fear was a stumble or a fall.Before she faced the crowd and the cameras at the Hammerstein Ballroom on West 34th Street, near Eighth Avenue, she worked on the sway, the swish, the swivel. Like a baseball pitcher who is sent to the minor leagues to work on mechanics, Ms. Vanderbilt Costin concentrated on basics learned as a toddler: how to put one foot in front of the other without falling down.This time around, she put grown-up thought into details like the length of her stride \u2014 people in the fashion industry say that on the runway, too short a step looks tepid and trepid. Ms. Vanderbilt Costin said she wanted to look commanding.This time, too, she had a coach, Montgomery Frazier, who dressed the personalities on MTV in its golden age. He described one of them, the V.J. Downtown Julie Brown, as \u201cmy muse\u201d as he led her to a seat in the audience before Ms. Vanderbilt Costin\u2019s half-minute-plus on the runway.\u201cI hoped Kelsey wouldn\u2019t pooh-pooh the idea\u201d of Mason\u2019s appearance in a Fashion Week show, Mr. Frazier said, \u201cand he didn\u2019t.\u201dNo one uttered the words \u201cage difference,\u201d but Ms. Vanderbilt Costin said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a little geriatric.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in my 30s,\u201d she said. Mason Grammer is 14.And she was making her start on what she said was the longest 75 feet she had ever walked, give or take a couple of yards. What she had learned from Mr. Frazier had helped.\u201cOne of the things he taught me is there\u2019s a difference between the hands-on-the-hips movement and walking with authority,\u201d Ms. Vanderbilt Costin said. \u201cThe biggest difference between a professional model and someone who\u2019s learning is how they sit in their hips. It\u2019s also a dancer\u2019s move. There are movements you can do by sitting in your hips that make you walk with less bounce, let\u2019s say, which gives a really powerful presence.\u201dSitting in your hips?\u201cWhen you first come out, as you\u2019re about to start walking, you can lean to your left or your right hip,\u201d she said. \u201cIt drops you down a little bit. As you\u2019re walking, instead of strutting, you\u2019re much more in the movement of your hips, which allows you to glide. It looks more like a dancer\u2019s walk than someone who\u2019s walking on stilts. But you have to create it.\u201dMr. Frazier said he had done some reorienting. \u201cShe was a pop artist,\u201d he said. \u201cVery different world.\u201d He said he was \u201cdressing her like New York,\u201d which was different from her past look. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a crash course in global style,\u201d he said. As for the one-foot-in-front-of-the-other thing, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s walking now with confidence.\u201dMs. Vanderbilt Costin rehearsed with seven different pairs of shoes because the Michela Riguccis she wore on Thursday were not available until Wednesday. Some of the practice shoes had \u201cthinner heels and some are bigger platforms,\u201d she said, \u201cjust to give me variety.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve said, \u2018Google me, look at my family tree and let\u2019s have a conversation,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI find it hysterical that people have nothing else to do. I just say I\u2019m the new generation of Vanderbilt women and there\u2019s so much about the women of my family that has not been highlighted.\u201dAfter the show, she rated herself as an eight. She was a harder grader than Ms. Werner, the Michela Rigucci chief executive, who said that Ms. Vanderbilt Costin had been \u201cperfect.\u201dMs. Vanderbilt Costin found a place in the lobby with good light \u2014 the better to photograph the shoes once the runway had been dimmed. A security guard stepped aside: He did not want his shadow to interfere with the photographer\u2019s work, but his eyes were where the photographer\u2019s focused, on the shoe that she showed off when she lifted her dress a few inches.The guard\u2019s eyes were also on the door, a few feet away. \u201cSomebody could chop off her leg,\u201d he said, \u201cand get away with the shoe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "IPhone 7 and Wireless Headphones: Analyzing Apple\u2019s Announcements", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Katie Benner were at the event to provide live analysis of what you need to know about the announcements, not what you don\u2019t.\u25a0 New iPhones, called the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.\u25a0 The new iPhones lack a headphone jack.\u25a0 The new iPhones have a revised home button with force sensitivity, which will vibrate to give feedback.\u25a0 The iPhones are water-resistant.\u25a0 The Plus model of the new iPhone includes a dual-lens camera to take professional-grade photos.\u25a0 A new Apple Watch, called Apple Watch Series 2, which includes GPS.\u25a0 Pok\u00e9mon Go is available for Apple Watch.\u25a0 An update on how Apple Music is performing.\u25a0 Tweaks to its iWork suite of productivity apps.So if consumers can hold off a year for the next iPhone, I\u2019d encourage them to wait. But for owners of iPhones that are at least two years old, these are going to be major upgrades \u2014 if you find a way to cope with the lack of a headphone jack.Perhaps more important, Apple was trying to cobble together a credible story for the future from these incremental moves \u2014 that a wireless world is coming and that it will be the leader in that world.The problem for Apple is that the steps along the way to achieving its goals aren\u2019t always that exciting. This is one of those years: There are lots of incremental improvements, but nothing stands out as a must-have. Someday, Apple is telling us, all these increments will add up to something unimaginably amazing. Right now, though, the moves look puzzling \u2014 we really did not get a good defense for removing the headphone jack \u2014 and we may just have to live with the confusion.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a deep love for music,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt inspires us, and it\u2019s a key part of our product experience.\u201dMr. Cook said the company had 17 million subscribers after about a year for Apple Music and added that the music service would be the \u201cpremier destination for exclusive music,\u201d nodding to the idea that the company will use its huge war chest to lock up deals with artists.Apple also announced a new version of iWork, its suite of productivity apps that rival Microsoft Office and Google\u2019s productivity apps. The tweaked version of iWork will include real-time collaboration, meaning multiple people can work on documents and presentation slides at the same time. It\u2019s good that these changes are coming to iWork, but Microsoft and Google have been offering real-time collaboration tools for years already.But Apple has lately faced more competition from rivals, especially Google, whose cheap and simple Chromebook has become one of the most-used machines at schools. For both companies \u2014 and lately for other tech rivals, including Amazon \u2014 the education market functions as a gateway. Get them early, win them for life.The gleaming white finish is in some ways a return to the past for Apple. (Remember all those white computers from the early 2000s?) But beyond that, it\u2019s always interesting when Apple discovers a new material for use in its devices. You usually notice some new process or material start in one product and then wend its way throughout the company\u2019s lineup over a few years\u2019 time. In other words, three years from now, we may have all-white, ceramic phones. A man can dream, anyway.The addition of GPS gives the Apple Watch a slight edge against Fitbit\u2019s Blaze, a comparable smartwatch that lacks GPS. But until we get to try the software, it\u2019s tough to tell how the new Apple Watch\u2019s fitness capabilities will compare to accessories from Fitbit. Fitbit\u2019s products are popular partly because the apps are so well designed for monitoring health statistics, including footsteps, calories and weight. So GPS isn\u2019t necessarily the magic bullet.Removing the port for standard headphones means users now have to connect their headphones to the iPhone through the charging port.\u201cFrom the start we designed Lightning to be a great digital audio connector,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.The update may have its detractors in the days after the announcement, but Apple has a long history of making hardware changes that the industry eventually follows, including the decision to change floppy disk sizes in the old Mac days and, more recently, the decision to take away laptop ports. Apple will include new Lightning earbuds, and an adapter, in the box.Why remove the headphone jack, a technology that people seem to like? Mr. Schiller summed it up in one word: \u201cCourage.\u201dPerhaps more important than the earbuds themselves is the wireless technology Apple is using to power them. The company is using Bluetooth, and Apple says its chips improve the technology by connecting faster and using less power. If Apple has perfected a new, proprietary way of doing this, it could prove an important innovation for lots of future wireless products, including home devices, cars and wearables.I\u2019m sure there are minor differences \u2014 the antenna band is different \u2014 but it seems too rich to call it a new design. Too rich, except for Apple.One area where I do give Apple points on the iPhone is the focus on the camera. Apple made a strategic decision a few years ago to plow a lot of development resources into the iPhone camera. That has paid off: The iPhone\u2019s camera has long surpassed most other smartphone cameras, and for many people, it\u2019s better than most stand-alone cameras. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus continue that trend. The Plus model features two cameras, which allows for super-zooming. Even the smaller phone\u2019s camera includes features to improve your snapshots. If the pictures Apple showed off are any guide, the iPhone\u2019s camera is fast closing in on all but the most high-end of cameras. Look forward to more of those \u201cShot on iPhone\u201d billboards.An earlier version of this article misstated the technology Apple is using for its wireless earbuds. It is Bluetooth, improved in a way that Apple says will make it faster and less power-hungry; it is not the case that Apple is not using Bluetooth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whom to Vote For? Employees Tend to Follow Their Leader", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhile Mr. Cook\u2019s role was as a private citizen \u2014 it was not an Apple event \u2014 the message to employees about whom he is supporting for president is clear.The influence of chief executives like Mr. Cook over employees\u2019 political leanings and donations, intentional or not, is substantial: It may not be an overstatement to suggest that a chief executive\u2019s politics may be one of the most significant factors in swaying how employees think about elections.Three business professors set out to examine \u201chow the political preferences of C.E.O.s affect their employees\u2019 campaign contributions and electoral choices.\u201d The results of the study, which looked at eight federal election cycles from 1999 to 2014 and over 2,000 companies, showed a statistically significant correlation among campaign contributions made by the chief and his or her employees as well as voter turnout. The study found that \u201cemployees direct approximately three times more of their campaign contributions to political candidates supported by their firm\u2019s C.E.O. than to otherwise similar candidates.\u201dIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, C.E.O.s and employees donate along similar party lines because they share common values and interest,\u201d think again.The study uncovered patterns that show a chief executive\u2019s influence is profound: \u201cWhen a new C.E.O. contributes to different political candidates from the ones supported by the prior C.E.O., employees tend to follow his/her lead and redirect their donations as well,\u201d wrote the professors, Ilona Babenko of Arizona State University, Viktar Fedaseyeu of Bocconi University in Italy and Song Zhang of the University of Lugano in Switzerland.There is nothing inherently wrong, in most cases, with a chief executive or employee raising money for a particular candidate or party. Mr. Cook, it is worth noting, gives to both sides of the aisle, having just hosted a separate fund-raiser for House Speaker Paul Ryan in June.But the influence of a boss\u2019s political leanings should not be underestimated. \u201cOur evidence indicates that C.E.O.s are a political force, with potentially important implications for firms they manage and for the nature of democracy,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe welfare implications depend both on whether C.E.O.s promote their own political agenda or act in the interests of their firms, and on whether the interests of the firm coincide with the interests of its employees.\u201dStill, the risks \u2013 and complex set of election laws \u2013 make political fund-raising a complicated endeavor for those in the corner office. \u201cThe potentially coercive effect of an employer\u2019s solicitation counsels in favor of avoiding the situation altogether,\u201d said Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the chief of Kalorama Partners, a Washington consulting firm. \u201cThe logical alternative \u2014 having a very strong and clear disclaimer \u2014 doesn\u2019t really work, since many employees might not believe the disclaimer, no matter how strongly it is worded.\u201dTony Fratto, a former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush who now operates a consulting firm, Hamilton Place, took issue with the idea that C.E.O.s should remain outside the political campaign arena.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that some employees feel pressure to align with the C.E.O. politically, but my experience is that in most cases both C.E.O.s and employees are overwhelmingly influenced by a candidate\u2019s views or voting record on industry issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI encourage firms to do more to inform their employees at all levels about what political leaders\u2019 records are on their key policies. I actually think that doesn\u2019t happen enough.\u201dThis election cycle, it seems that many C.E.O.s, especially on Wall Street, have chosen to be less public about whom they are supporting in the presidential race. Perhaps because of the lingering negative memories of the financial crisis or perhaps because this presidential election has turned so decidedly nasty, many executives have stayed on the sideline. In June, Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel, canceled an event at his home for Donald Trump after it was reported to be causing a firestorm among Intel employees and peers in Silicon Valley that felt Mr. Trump\u2019s policies were damaging to the industry. Mr. Krzanich later said he canceled the event because it had turned into a fund-raiser without his approval. \u201cI do not intend to endorse any presidential candidate. We are interested in engaging both campaigns in open dialogue on issues in technology,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.When it comes to presidential politics, some executives privately say they worry they could see reprisals against their business or industry if they were to actively campaign for one candidate or another.\u201cThe risk of being on the record publicly against a politician is high, particularly if that politician may take retaliatory action,\u201d said Brian Richter, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin.Clearly the influence of C.E.O.s and other senior executives\u2019 political preferences on the people working for them deserves more scrutiny. In the meantime, while it is hard to know how individuals will ultimately vote when they pull the lever in November, perhaps a new election polling data point should be the preferences of their bosses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where to Live? Ask an App", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySearching for an apartment online has long been limited to plugging in what you can afford and where you think you might want to live and then sifting through dozens of listings. But what if you don\u2019t have a neighborhood in mind? In a city as large as New York, there are probably neighborhoods you\u2019ve never heard of. And even a place you think you know can change character within just a few blocks.So many factors are involved: Is it safe? Are there good schools? Is the subway nearby? Where will I take yoga class? And don\u2019t forget the crucial but less tangible concerns: Will my family be happy here? Will we be welcome?You could end up spending hours researching school test scores, interviewing families at the local playground and besieging your friend\u2019s sister\u2019s cousin with questions about what it\u2019s like to live there.I searched for a two-bedroom for $750,000 in a quiet, green and safe residential neighborhood with restaurants, schools, car parking and a half-hour commute, preferably by subway, from The New York Times, which just happens to be the default address in the office field. In short order the site delivered a top 10 list, with Washington Heights as the No. 1 match, followed by Inwood and Harlem; Longwood and Fordham in the Bronx; Woodside, Queens; East Harlem; and Astoria, Elmhurst, and Maspeth in Queens. I could have clicked \u201cmore neighborhoods\u201d for more results.While some of those places seemed like no-brainers, there were a couple of neighborhoods I would not have considered on my own, like Longwood in the Bronx, an area I have yet to explore. But Maspeth, which lacks a subway, seemed like a stretch. Google Maps estimated the commute by bus and train would take about 50 minutes.Even with all these data points, however, it can be difficult to get a feel for what a neighborhood is like to live in. While StreetAdvisor, which offers neighborhood ratings and reviews from locals, provided some context, some areas, like Longwood, didn\u2019t have any. And some school ratings used by the site were slightly outdated, according to Greatschools.Sarunas Legeckas, a founder of PlaceILive, said the site is working to refine its results and pointed out that if the neighborhoods don\u2019t suit your fancy, you can let the site know by clicking on the X beneath the neighborhood, which will pull up a list of the reasons the neighborhood might not be right for you \u2014 such as it\u2019s too trendy, or not hip enough, or it doesn\u2019t have a great commute.\u201cWe don\u2019t claim all our results are perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a guidance tool to make you think, to make you explore and maybe point you in a new direction \u2014 like looking in Queens instead of Manhattan.\u201d As more users take the quiz and leave feedback, he added, the tool will get smarter.Bushwick, Brooklyn, for example, is described as \u201cfull of converted lofts in old industrial factories, sometimes with great access to outdoor space.\u201d The mood: \u201cEqual parts old-school Hispanic and hipster bohemian, the neighborhood is both a working-class community and the site of much creativity.\u201d Best perk: \u201cSeemingly every week, there\u2019s a new restaurant, bar, or art gallery popping up.\u201d Biggest downside: \u201cVestiges of the poverty from the 70s and 80s remain. Many buildings are rundown and pockets of crime still exist.\u201dWhile there are just 35 searchable neighborhoods compared with the 288 at PlaceILive, StreetEasy\u2019s results are presented in a rich, image-heavy format that may appeal to those less data-inclined.Selecting from StreetEasy\u2019s list of neighborhood characteristics like \u201cpet-friendly\u201d and \u201claid-back\u201d whittles down the number of places. Information on schools, while included in StreetEasy listings pages, is not mentioned in the neighborhood guides given the complexity of school zones, which can vary within a given neighborhood, said Susan Daimler, the general manager of StreetEasy, which is owned by Zillow Group, an online real estate database company.Word of mouth eventually led Mr. Leibowitz\u2019s family to Maplewood, N.J., but the process, he said, \u201cjust seemed so lacking in rigor.\u201d With hundreds of towns outside the city to choose among, all with different commutes, school systems and personalities, he added, \u201cit was hard to make sense of all these variables.\u201dPicketFencer, which Mr. Leibowitz subsequently founded, made its debut last month. New Yorkers looking to move to the suburbs can filter some 600 towns throughout New Jersey, Westchester County, Long Island and Connecticut by commute time, school ratings, affordability or walkability.Selecting a 50-minute commute from New York City, for example, school ratings of at least nine out of 10 and a walkability score of at least 70 of 100 produced nine neighborhoods, including Larchmont in Westchester County, New Hyde Park on Long Island, and Cranford, N.J., in Union County.Social content from Instagram, YouTube, Yelp and Twitter provides a snapshot of the town\u2019s personality. And there are links to descriptive articles from The New York Times and other publications. For more hand-holding, PicketFencer also offers to connect users with a real estate agent.But the site still has a way to go in terms of data context. It wasn\u2019t initially clear, for example, what kind of transportation \u2014 car, train, bus? \u2014 the commute time to New York City is based on or why one town has a walkability score of 70 and another a 90.\u201cWe definitely want to do a better job of that,\u201d Mr. Leibowitz said. Clicking an information icon to the left of the filters, he pointed out, explains that commute time is based on \u201cpublic transportation.\u201dEven with kinks that need working out, such tools help fill an information gap. Real estate agents, citing fair-housing laws that prevent them from steering people to or from certain places based on race, religion, sex, marital status and other categories, tend to sidestep many questions about neighborhoods.\u201cI totally appreciate the intent behind the law,\u201d said Frederick Warburg Peters, the chief executive of Warburg Realty in New York. \u201cBut the intense fear of offending anyone or making anyone feel possibly excluded goes to such lengths that literally we end up being able not to say anything. People ask us, \u2018Are there other young children in the building?\u2019 and we are not supposed to answer.\u201dKara I. Rakowski, a partner at the law firm Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman, said if the online tools are involved with the sale, rental and financing of dwellings, by, say, offering listings or selling advertising to brokerage firms, they could be subject to fair-housing laws. \u201cThe fact that they are providing a service to try to assist people in finding the right neighborhood that fits them is great,\u201d she said, but if the service \u201cis really encouraging or discouraging protected classes from those neighborhoods, that could be an issue for them.\u201dBecause it is a data company and does not sell or rent homes, Mr. Legeckas said PlaceILive is not in violation of fair housing laws. Other sites pointed out that they do not display data about or allow searching by any of the categories protected by fair-housing laws.Some services still rely on the human touch. Alison Bernstein is the founder of Suburban Jungle, a seven-year-old real estate advisory firm that works personally with city dwellers to find the right suburb for their lifestyle. Ms. Bernstein\u2019s territory is what no algorithm will cover, like knowing \u201cwhat the moms are wearing to drop-off,\u201d or that \u201cevery kid has a Mandarin tutor at the age of 6.\u201d\u201cThese are all intangible things that you have to live with on a daily basis,\u201d she said, \u201cand no computer program can express that to you.\u201dTo determine a match, clients are assigned a \u201csuburb strategist\u201d who is not a real estate agent and is trained to dig deep, asking, for example, \u201cwhat is your definition of a good school?\u201d Ms. Bernstein said. \u201cFor one family it might be top test scores. For other people that might be a nightmare, because they don\u2019t want a pressure cooker.\u201dOnce a town or towns has been chosen, clients are referred to real estate agents who have been vetted by Suburban Jungle, which receives a portion of the commission should the client buy a home.Bottom line: While the new tools can help focus your search and may help you uncover some neighborhoods you might have overlooked on your own, even the best data cannot substitute for the sensation of walking down a street and feeling that you are home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Could I Possibly Learn From a Mentor Half My Age? Plenty", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow on earth did I become an \u201colder worker?\u201dIt was only a few years ago, it seems, that I set out to climb the ladder in my chosen field. That field happens to be journalism, but it shares many attributes with countless other workplaces. For instance, back when I was one of the youngest people in the room, I was helped by experienced elders who taught me the ropes.Now, shockingly, I\u2019m one of the elders. And I\u2019ve watched my industry undergo significant change. That\u2019s why I recently went searching for a young mentor \u2014 yes, a younger colleague to mentor me.Wait, isn\u2019t that backward?I sought a mentor to help me develop a specific new skill \u2014 and something entirely outside my comfort zone \u2014 namely, how to use Snapchat, the smartphone-based photo and video service that is popular among teenagers and young adults. Not coincidentally, Snapchat is also being used as a newsroom tool at The New York Times to reach new readers.I didn\u2019t need to look far to find my mentor: Last year The Times\u2019s resident Snapchat expert, Talya Minsberg, 27, moved into a cubicle just a few rows from mine. Her job title alone \u2014 social strategy editor \u2014 is a clear sign of our changing world.\u201cMy job didn\u2019t exist five years ago,\u201d Talya pointed out. That\u2019s another eye opener. The job I hold, assignment editor at The Times, has existed for generations.My experience with Talya taught me far more than the basics of a new form of video storytelling (which was already asking a lot). Along the way I learned important lessons about the strengths and weaknesses of the middle-aged brain, and how learning new things can keep it in top working order. It also made me realize that organizations and individual workers could do a lot more to bridge the gaps between generations. Each age group has untapped resources that can benefit others at a different stage of life.In the beginning, I felt a little awkward about reaching out to Talya at all. A part of me felt that at my age (mid-50s) it was somehow unseemly for me to ask for help, particularly from one so young.Ms. Arbit suggested a possible reason for my awkwardness: Baby boomers tend to have to a hierarchical view of the workplace \u2014 an \u201corg chart\u201d mind-set that imagines power filtering down from the top. Millennials, by contrast, may see the office as more of a horizontal network, she said.At the same time, as a younger person conversant in the trendiest technology, Talya seemed imbued with a kind of glamour. I felt as if face-to-face communication was too old-fashioned a way to set up meetings with her. Even though she sat just a few desks away, it didn\u2019t seem right to come up to her and say, \u201cCould you meet at noon on Wednesday?\u201d the way I might easily do with an older colleague.Email seemed old-fashioned, too. So instead we set up our meetings using her preferred method: Google Calendar. To me, the practice of deciding unilaterally on an open time felt presumptuous, and to reject someone else\u2019s suggestion seemed rude. But that\u2019s not how Talya viewed it \u2014 to her, it was the most convenient way of arriving at a suitable time because the participants can view each other\u2019s calendars.In one of our early Google Calendar-arranged meetings, I informed Talya why I was asking her to teach me Snapchat: \u201cI want to be on fleek!\u201dVery slowly, Talya taught me Snapchat fundamentals. It was not easy, partly because the software is not intuitive. In fact, as Talya put it, it can be \u201creally weird and hard to understand.\u201dAs you age, your dendrites \u2014 the antennas by which neurons receive information from other neurons \u2014 begin to shrink, he said. This is especially noticeable in the prefrontal cortex, which handles higher-order brain functions like focusing, staying on task and forming long-term memories.The decline in these areas begins in your 40s and 50s and worsens from there, he said. This can make it tougher to focus. There\u2019s also more of a limit to how many thoughts people can carry in their heads simultaneously.\u201cYour mind\u2019s bandwidth is smaller,\u201d he said. \u201cYou learn at a slower rate because less information is getting in.\u201dAll of these abilities tend to be at their peak when people are in their 20s \u2014 Talya\u2019s age. Before the age of 30, people\u2019s brains possess more plasticity, meaning they can learn more easily.That sounds depressing. Isn\u2019t there any mental upside to getting older?Yes, there is, Professor Miller said. Older people tend to be more disciplined and diligent, he said, which can compensate for learning deficits. Based on their greater experience in the world, they are also very good at putting ideas and thoughts into categories \u2014 the very basis of knowledge and wisdom.It\u2019s true: \u201cThe older brain is a wiser brain,\u201d he said. But it can also get into a rut because of its lack of plasticity.The brain is like a muscle that benefits from mental exercises such as learning new things. The more you put your brain through its paces, the easier it will be to learn the next thing. \u201cIt\u2019s always important to keep yourself cognitively engaged,\u201d Professor Miller said.As Brandon McMillan, host of the TV show \u201cLucky Dog\u201d \u2014 in which he rescues a dog from a shelter and trains it before placing it in a forever home \u2014 has said: \u201cYou can teach an old dog new tricks. You just can\u2019t teach them as fast.\u201dTalya explained that each individual photo or video of a story can last up to 10 seconds. Each 10-second segment can be connected to another. A story can be as long as you want it to be, but each segment cannot exceed 10 seconds.That gives the resulting video a \u201craw, authentic\u201d feel, Talya said, which appeals to many of its acolytes. Another appeal: The stories are ephemeral and disappear after 24 hours (although you can archive them on your phone).My mentor and I set a goal of producing a Snapchat video for the official New York Times channel. But I was nervous. \u201cI don\u2019t even do video,\u201d I said.Talya was reassuring, calling it \u201cjust about the easiest video product.\u201d Once you shoot something, you either send it or delete it. \u201cThere\u2019s no editing. It\u2019s a very different way of thinking,\u201d she said.First, I began following 20 or so people and organizations, and Talya described what they do well (or poorly). Then I created some practice stories on my personal account (which had two followers), and she critiqued those.After my third, a video diary of a weekend trip to Hudson, N.Y., she pronounced me ready to \u201ctake over\u201d the New York Times Snapchat channel, with its worldwide viewership.My first Snapchat story for The Times was of a Nasdaq MarketSite opening-bell ceremony for Scripps Networks Interactive, which owns the Food Network and HGTV. My second was about a cat cafe in Brooklyn. The third was about a textiles trade show in Manhattan. Although the stories disappeared from the channel after 24 hours, we archived them, and you can see the last two online. (I neglected to save the first one \u2014 so much for being on fleek.)My Snapchat skills are far from advanced, but I think my second video is better than the first, and the third one is better than the second, thanks to Talya\u2019s mentoring. I was able to bring my decades-long journalistic experience to bear on a new technology, with mixed but promising results.It was exhilarating to see my progress \u2014 and embarrassing to witness my missteps, like putting my finger over the camera at the close of the cat cafe video. (But have you ever tried to record yourself while trying to keep a cat on your shoulder?)At times I was afraid that creating Snapchat stories required more mental energy than my shrinking dendrites could handle. It took several hours to do a two-and-a-half minute story.Before the mentorship, I had been ready to dismiss Snapchat out of hand. I came to understand that it is more creative than I realized. It\u2019s fascinating to string together photos and videos, along with captions, drawings and emojis, into a story. Snapchat\u2019s constraints \u2014 the 10-second limit to individual segments, the 24-hour existence of stories, the inability to edit \u2014 were a bracing mental challenge. They stretched me as a journalist and a person.So, the reverse mentorship was extremely beneficial, but there was one way in which it could have been better: I could have tried to mentor Talya at the same time. The best cross-generational mentorships work in both directions, Ms. Arbit of BridgeWorks said.\u201cWhat do I have to offer?\u201d I asked her, suddenly discounting three decades of career experience, which was ridiculous.But I think older workers at times do minimize their value, or their value is minimized by others, as society glamorizes the latest glittery technology. Sometimes the old way of doing things can inform and improve the new, and older workers may be the ones with the wisdom to realize this.Twitter: @phylliskorkkiAdvertisement"}

As they stuffed their pillows and blankets into a ratty rolling suitcase, they said they had been homeless since their house in Old Bridge, N.J., was foreclosed on a year ago.They had fallen behind on their mortgage.

{"Headline": "Judge Rejects Justice Department Ruling on Music Licensing", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA federal judge on Friday rejected a recent Justice Department ruling on music licensing in a move that was immediately hailed by the music industry as a major victory.In his decision, Judge Louis L. Stanton of the United States District Court in Manhattan said the Justice Department erred last month when it issued a detailed interpretation of a regulatory document known as a consent decree. The document has long governed Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI), a licensing agency that collects money whenever songs are publicly performed, including on the radio, on streaming services and in public places like restaurants and retail stores.The case concerns the side of the music business that deals with songwriters and publishers \u2014 not record companies and performers, whose work is covered by separate copyright laws.In his ruling, Judge Stanton \u2014 who monitors BMI and its compliance with its consent decree, which dates to 1941 \u2014 was unequivocal that the interpretation of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division was incorrect.\u201cNothing in the consent decree gives support to the division\u2019s views,\u201d Judge Stanton wrote.It was not immediately clear what effect the ruling would have in the long term. In a statement, BMI said that Judge Stanton\u2019s order was now the controlling interpretation of its decree. But the Justice Department can appeal the decision, and a spokesman said that the agency was reviewing the order.Also unclear was the decision\u2019s impact on Ascap, which is governed by a separate consent decree and is monitored by a different judge.As news of Judge Stanton\u2019s decision spread throughout the songwriting world on Friday, it brought a sense of relief for a side of the business that has been buffeted by the industry\u2019s move to streaming. Among the many concerns expressed about the Justice Department\u2019s statement were that songwriters would be forced to change their writing habits based on the affiliations of their collaborators \u2014 the nightmare scenario, they said, was that an Ascap writer and a BMI writer would now face perplexing hurdles to working together.If Judge Stanton\u2019s ruling stands, it should put those fears to rest, Michael O\u2019Neill, the chief executive of BMI, said in an interview on Friday.\u201cNow songwriters can go into writing rooms,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said, \u201cnot feeling like they have to bring lawyers with them.\"Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Self-Driving Cars Gain Powerful Ally: The Government", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal auto safety regulators on Monday made it official: They are betting the nation\u2019s highways will be safer with more cars driven by machines and not people.In long-awaited guidelines for the booming industry of automated vehicles, the Obama administration promised strong safety oversight, but sent a clear signal to automakers that the door was wide open for driverless cars.\u201cWe envision in the future, you can take your hands off the wheel, and your commute becomes restful or productive instead of frustrating and exhausting,\u201d said Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council, adding that highly automated vehicles \u201cwill save time, money and lives.\u201dThe statements were the most aggressive signal yet by federal regulators that they see automated car technology as a win for auto safety. Yet having officially endorsed the fast-evolving technology, regulators must now balance the commercial interests of companies including Tesla, Google and Uber with concerns over public safety, especially in light of recent crashes involving semiautonomous cars.The policies unveiled on Monday were designed to walk that line. In a joint appearance, Mr. Zients and Anthony Foxx, secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, released the first guidelines, which outlined safety expectations and encouraged uniform rules for the nascent technology. The instructions signaled to motorists that automated vehicles would not be a Wild West where companies can try anything without oversight, but were also vague enough that automakers and technology companies would not fear overregulation.The new guidelines on Monday, which stopped short of official regulations, targeted four main areas. The Department of Transportation announced a 15-point safety standard for the design and development of autonomous vehicles; called for states to come up with uniform policies applying to driverless cars; clarified how current regulations can be applied to driverless cars; and opened the door for new regulations on the technology.The 15-point safety assessment covers a range of issues, including how driverless cars should react if their technology fails, what measures to put in place to preserve passenger privacy, and how occupants will be protected in crashes. The points also include how automakers should approach the digital security of driverless vehicles, and how a car can communicate with passengers and other road users.The agency also urged driverless-car manufacturers to show how their technology is validated and how they would share data collected by the vehicles. The Department of Transportation also said it would assert its authority to recall semiautonomous and fully autonomous vehicles that it found to be unsafe.But the guidelines weren\u2019t nearly as specific as the safety requirements imposed on standard human-driven vehicles today.\u201cWe left some areas intentionally vague because we wanted to outline the areas that need to be addressed and leave the rest to innovators,\u201d said Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Tesla plans as soon as this week to download new software to its cars. The company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the new software would include improvements to Autopilot that could have avoided the fatal accident in May.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.The federal government\u2019s embrace of driverless technology has accelerated since 2013. That year, the Obama administration waded cautiously into driverless car safety for the first time by issuing some definitions for the technology and pledging more safety research. By early this year, the president had wholeheartedly taken to the technology, proposing about $4 billion in the federal budget for driverless car research and development over 10 years.Karl Brauer, senior editor at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research and valuation company, said the new guidelines struck a balance between ensuring safety as automakers develop self-driving cars and making sure the introduction of lifesaving technology is not delayed unnecessarily.\u201cWe are in this weird transition,\u201d Mr. Brauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough balance for the regulators. You want to get this technology out, but you don\u2019t want to move too quickly.\u201dCurrently, driverless cars face a patchwork of state regulations. In the last three years, about a dozen states have introduced laws that specifically address testing of driverless vehicles. Most laws require a licensed driver to be in the car.Mr. Foxx said states would continue to regulate the licensing of drivers and insurance. But he affirmed the agency\u2019s oversight of the software technology used in driverless cars.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.\u201cWhat we are trying to do is avoid a patchwork of state laws,\u201d Mr. Foxx said.Google, Uber and Lyft, through a trade association in which they are members, also hailed the guidelines. \u201cState and local governments also have complementary responsibilities and should work with the federal government to achieve and maintain our status as world leaders in innovation,\u201d said David Strickland, general counsel for the trade group, Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets.Consumer advocates said they were encouraged that the government\u2019s efforts would advance safety laws and pressure companies that have operated largely in secret. But the groups also said the guidelines might result in weaker state laws.\u201cWhat I fear is that there are some really good state regulations that might get tamped down or pre-empted,\u201d said John Simpson, a director at Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit group that has pushed for greater federal enforcement of the industry.Over all, the government\u2019s endorsement will speed up the rollout of autonomous cars, experts said, potentially within the next five years.\u201cIt helps companies by providing some cover. If a car crashes, courts may look to these guidelines to help us determine what was reasonable and not,\u201d said Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina.Large automakers in particular have made big strides in the technological development of driverless cars but have been wary of introducing those features too quickly without the backing of federal regulators.\u201cBig companies love certainty and targets that they need to aim for,\u201d said Brad Templeton, a consultant and publisher of Robocars.com.Neal E. Boudette contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Delays Vote on Cable Set-Top Boxes", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators on Thursday delayed a vote on a proposal to reshape the television market by freeing consumers from cable box rentals, putting into doubt a plan that has pitted technology companies against cable television providers.Members of the Federal Communications Commission could not agree on a set-top box proposal that requires cable operators to provide their shows and movies on alternative devices rather than just on a cable box. The plan was intended to bring more competition to the television industry and liberate consumers from an average of $231 in annual cable box fees.The proposal will still be considered for a future vote. But Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., said commissioners needed more discussions. Even late Wednesday evening, members of the F.C.C. were negotiating over disagreements and concerns over the proposal.\u201cIt was simply a matter of running out of time,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said in a news conference Thursday after the F.C.C.\u2019s planned monthly meeting.The window of opportunity for Mr. Wheeler to adopt his signature regulation on cable and satellite boxes is growing smaller. With the change of administration after the election, he is under pressure to pass through several ambitious regulations before the end of the year.Ms. Rosenworcel, in a joint statement with the two other Democrats on the five-member commission, said on Thursday morning that she supported the goal of the proposal, to create more competition in the television box market.\u201cWe are still working to resolve the remaining technical and legal issues and we are committed to unlocking the set-top box for consumers across this country,\u201d the three commissioners said.Under the proposed rules, consumers would be able to watch cable shows on devices like a Roku or Apple TV, or on no devices at all with internet-enabled televisions. Getting rid of the cable box would make finding and watching YouTube and Netflix streaming videos as easy as viewing cable programs because they would be presented in what would look like just another app.\u201cThe M.P.A.A. is pleased that the F.C.C. is taking more time, and we hope they use it to ensure any set-top box proposal remains consistent with copyright policy and avoids harming creators,\u201d said Chris Dodd, chairman of Hollywood\u2019s trade group, the Motion Picture Association of America.And recent changes made to address these concerns do \u201cnot solve the copyright, privacy, innovation and other significant concerns that were implicated in this discredited original proposal,\u201d said David Cohen, Comcast\u2019s senior executive vice president, adding that the plan \u201csuffers from the same legal infirmities.\u201dThe regulations would remove a crucial part of the cable television industry\u2019s model of forcing consumers to rent the boxes that showcase their own bundle of channels, analysts say. Making cable programming another app on a device like a TiVo would expose viewers to more streaming content that is directly competing against the paid-TV bundle.\u201cThis is the last gateway to the internet and this is a battle between open and closed platforms,\u201d said Chip Pickering, president of Incompas, a lobbying group that represents Google and Amazon in support of the plan.Backers of the plan were disappointed with the delay, which could put the proposal in jeopardy.\u201cToday\u2019s vote delay is an unequivocal loss for the tens of millions of Americans across the country who are forced to spend their hard-earned money on overpriced set-top box leases that cost them hundreds of dollars a year,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a statement on Thursday.He has said consumers have been charged a combined $20 billion a year in forced rental fees.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five or Six Things I Didn\u2019t Know About Brad Pitt, by Marlon James", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe worst kind, too. The kind who lets a plant starve to death. The evidence, at two opposing corners of his office in Beverly Hills; skeletal remnants that long gave up hope of ever being watered. He\u2019s been away for 10 months, he says. An explanation, if not exactly an excuse. Regardless, I vow to expose his plant-murdering ways because the American public deserves to know, and besides, at 52 one should take whatever notoriety one can get.I\u2019m at Plan B, the film production company Pitt co-founded in 2001 and now owns, and I\u2019ve decided to impress him with my knowledge of architecture, something he learned about while helping to rebuild the Lower Ninth Ward in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I figured I\u2019d introduce him to Shigeru Ban, famous for his Cardboard Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand, and other disaster-relief projects around the world. But there, sitting on Pitt\u2019s bookshelf, is an entire monograph of his work.Near his record player are Joe Strummer\u2019s albums with the Mescaleros, not a surprise, but also rare books on fringe culture, including Danny Lyon\u2019s \u201cThe Bikeriders,\u201d which are. This is a revelation not because Pitt is a megastar, which can lead to a certain out-of-touchness, but because he\u2019s a father, and the first thing that goes after having kids is coolness. The first thing that comes are jorts. So when he gets up to shake my hand \u2014 dressed in a white T-shirt, white jeans and a white fedora \u2014 he seems more like the Dude than a dad.\u201cWar Machine,\u201d one of his two new films out this fall, is based on \u201cThe Operators,\u201d Michael Hastings\u2019s blistering account of U.S. military command, their occasionally reckless maneuvers and the political blowback that happened when a certain decorated general \u2014 played by Pitt \u2014 let his guard way, way down. (The other movie is Robert Zemeckis\u2019s romantic assassination thriller \u201cAllied,\u201d also based on actual events.) \u201cIt\u2019s a satire on the decision makers who end up sending our young men and women to war,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the absurdity of the process, the machinery itself, the self-interest involved \u2014 and it\u2019s insanely funny, until it\u2019s not.\u201dDiscussing the thin line between tragedy and comedy leads us to talking about sadness and happiness in general, which then leads Pitt to an observation: During his frequent travels around the world he has encountered many people who seem to have no cause for happiness \u2014 and yet it\u2019s those very people, those in the most dire circumstances, who somehow manage to appear the most content. It is why, he says, people like him \u2014 people with money and time \u2014 feel so compelled to change those circumstances. Which isn\u2019t always a good thing, and he knows it. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into areas of third-world countries where people have suffered the most, but those people always seem to have the biggest laugh,\u201d he says. As a Jamaican native who has witnessed quite a few third-world missions, I tell him that sometimes our biggest laugh is directed at foreign do-gooders who really have no idea how to fix our problems. \u201cI\u2019ve been one of those at times,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to start somewhere. You start with your best intentions, understanding the world as you do. And then you get in and you see that it\u2019s much more complicated than you could possibly imagine. Our failings in foreign policy have always been to think that we can place our ideas on another culture, while not really understanding the other culture.\u201d8 PhotosBut one of the reasons I agreed to this interview was to do more than remind the world that, aw shucks, he\u2019s just a regular guy. Such a thing would be ridiculous, anyway: A Google search of his name yields roughly 45 million results; nearly 10 million pop up for \u201cBrad Pit\u201d alone. This is, after all, the guy who as a seductive thief in \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d proved there\u2019s no such thing as a small part. Someone once famously said that he is a character actor trapped in a leading man\u2019s body, which is true, but he\u2019s also the last real movie star to come out of Hollywood. I don\u2019t ask him if he likes to puzzle over his kids\u2019 homework.Instead I ask him about Brexit. \u201cMan, I never thought that would happen. Same way I can\u2019t bring myself to think that Trump will be in charge. In the simplest terms, what brings us together is good, and what separates us is bad. We have this great line in \u2018The Big Short,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says, referring to the Oscar-winning film about the global financial crisis of 2008, which he produced. \u201cWhen things are going wrong and we can\u2019t find the reason for it, we just start creating enemies.\u201d I mention that when creating those enemies, we often look no further than what\u2019s right in front of us. Gays, for example. \u201cOr illegal immigrants,\u201d he says. He keeps wondering aloud about this, not because he\u2019s all that interested in extremism, bigotry, religiosity and fear as part of an actual pathology \u2014 or Trump supporters and the religious right, for that matter \u2014 but because in another version of this story, where the movie star thing hadn\u2019t clicked and he remained stuck in his home state, that could have been his fate. \u201cComing from Oklahoma, southern Missouri, which leans more toward a Trump voice, I try to understand it.\u201d\u201cIt seems that the people who suffer the most end up betting for the party that would hurt them,\u201d he goes on. \u201cAnd so I try to understand where they\u2019re coming from.\u201d When I suggest that money has a lot to do with it \u2014 Belgium supporting Tutsi control over the Hutus, and building resentment, prompted genocide \u2014 he agrees. But a recent conversation he had with a scholar from the Brookings Institution, the Washington, D.C. think tank, sparked a different view, one where the cause of strife can\u2019t be explained by simple economics. \u201cYou gotta understand,\u201d he says, \u201cthat it\u2019s also in our DNA. Most Americans don\u2019t have time to watch CNN and Fox and Al Jazeera. They\u2019re trying to make the rent, get the kids fed, they\u2019re tired when they get home and they want to forget about everything. And so suddenly when this voice comes in \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t have to be a voice of substance \u2014 saying he\u2019s fed up with all of this, that\u2019s the part that hooks into the DNA.\u201dA fair point to consider, that our social behaviors, prejudices and even the mental process of who we choose to love or hate is rooted in biology, but how does this convince people to actually buy what Trump is selling? \u201cWhat I\u2019m most hopeful about is that we\u2019re a global neighborhood now, and we start to understand each other more and more \u2014 and yet, you see this reactionary push for isolation and separation again.\u201d Pitt shrugs, and says that he thinks a lot of people feel alone, and on a certain level, again because of his background, he knows what that\u2019s like. \u201cA Trump supporter is fighting against just about everything,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat does he even mean, take our country back? Would someone please explain that to me?\u201d Pitt looks at me, impish and totally serious at the same time. \u201cWhere\u2019d it go?\u201dLike his friend and \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d director Quentin Tarantino, Pitt\u2019s scholarship in the craft of the medium has mostly been the medium itself. More than that, film was for him a window into the world. \u201cMovies were a way out,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you live in a vacuum and suddenly you\u2019re exposed to the world, you\u2019re exposed to other cultures. And remember, this was pre-internet. This was the only lens that could show me how a kid in Brooklyn lived, a kid in Ireland, a kid in Africa.\u201dOn the topic of exotic worlds, he mentions a film he\u2019d like to make about Pontius Pilate, mostly because the script, which focuses on a mediocre Roman official stuck in the middle of nowhere with difficult people he doesn\u2019t like, makes him smile. Jesus doesn\u2019t get much screen time. \u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be for the \u2018Passion\u2019 crowd,\u201d he says, which reminds me that Mel Gibson\u2019s torture-porn epic is one of the things that drove me out of the church. Pitt bursts into laughter. \u201cI felt like I was just watching an L. Ron Hubbard propaganda film.\u201dXenu aside, Gibson movies typically do one thing really well: violence. \u201cOh, extremely well,\u201d Pitt says. \u201c\u2009\u2018Apocalypto\u2019 is a great film.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to forget that the man is 52 \u2014 if anything he\u2019s too skinny \u2014 but his children\u2019s interest in relics from the past regularly drives home the point. One of his daughters, for example, loves cassette tapes the way someone Pitt\u2019s age might have a fondness for the gramophone, or making his own daguerreotype. He\u2019s also reminded of his age on set. \u201cWhen I was making a World War II movie called \u2018Fury,\u2019 we did this boot camp for a week, and Logan Lerman, who was the youngest actor of the bunch \u2014 I think he was 21 \u2014 was given grunt detail. We gave him a watch and he had to keep track of how long it took us to eat and get in and out of our gear. One day he came to me and said the watch has stopped, and I said, \u2018You\u2019ve just got to wind it.\u2019 He came back literally 15 minutes later and said, \u2018Wait, how do you wind it?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe good thing about playing an interview slow and loose, especially when you\u2019ve caught your subject on a free day, is that you can slide into the type of half-substantial, half-trivial conversation only possible with truly friendly people. Not to say that Pitt isn\u2019t sometimes on his guard when it comes to discussing touchy subjects like income inequality and whitewashing in Hollywood. But there\u2019s a casual intimacy to the few hours we\u2019ve spent together, shooting the breeze with a rapport so easy that I keep turning the recorder back on after I assume the interview is over; him talking about falling under the spell of New Orleans, or being a \u201csucker for an underdog story,\u201d or how \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild\u201d is an amazing film that broke his heart.The bad thing about playing an interview slow and loose is that you\u2019re never sure how to end it. So I keep hanging out at his office, touring the compound and overhearing him on the phone dealing with daddy business, when I realize I\u2019m about to miss my flight. He orders me a car and walks me outside to the gate. It\u2019s not until this moment, under the glare of the California sun, that I\u2019m confronted with the absurdity of standing next to Brad Pitt, on the side of the road, waiting for an Uber.An article last Sunday about the actor Brad Pitt misstated the surname of the author of \u201cThe Operators,\u201d on which \u201cWar Machine,\u201d one of Pitt\u2019s upcoming films, is based. He was Michael Hastings, not Hasting.Marlon James won the 2015 Man Booker Prize for Fiction for his devastating third novel, \u201cA Brief History of Seven Killings.\u201d During his three-hour conversation with Brad Pitt at the actor\u2019s office in Beverly Hills, for T\u2019s Sept. 11 Men\u2019s Style issue, James avoided inquiring about Angelina Jolie Pitt or their children. Instead, he says, \u201cI wanted to know how he felt about Donald Trump, whether his architecture jones was for real and, more than anything, I wanted to know how a kid from the Bible Belt became such a liberal, pro-gay, not-so-pro-God activist.\u201dHair by Natalia Bruschi using cream pomade from Mess of Blues.

{"Headline": "A Play Timed to Trump\u2019s Candidacy Asks What If", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 A vain politician runs for the presidency, short on specifics but long on bluster, inveighing against a religious minority and promising to make America prosperous again.Sound familiar?The play, which began previews on Friday, is among scores of efforts by theaters across the United States to provoke discussion and reflection about this year\u2019s unusual election, and the unease that it has exposed. Some, like Berkeley Rep, explicitly aim to prompt discussion about Donald J. Trump, whose candidacy has alarmed many in the left-leaning theater world; others have opted to stage works in which characters grapple with issues debated during the campaign, like immigration or economic inequality.\u201cArt shouldn\u2019t fall into any kind of simplistic, didactic haranguing, and topicality is a dangerous thing, because you always get outstripped by reality,\u201d said Tony Taccone, the longtime artistic director of Berkeley Rep, and a co-author, with Bennett S. Cohen, of the new adaptation. However, he said, \u201cWith the election looming, it felt incumbent on us to respond if we could.\u201dOn a recent afternoon, the cast and crew of \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d gathered at Berkeley Rep\u2019s administrative campus in a high-ceilinged warehouse once occupied by the North Face, to run through the play one last time before moving into a downtown Berkeley theater.The designers had embraced the stars-and-stripes feel of a campaign: The set featured flags and drums and images of national parks, and the sound design included a Sousa march. Fourteen actors played nearly 50 roles, and practiced egging on the audience to cheer and jeer with the onstage pageantry.The theater printed red-white-and-blue lapel stickers bearing the play\u2019s name for patrons, meant to echo the ubiquitous \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers; leaders considered, but decided against, holding a series of related discussion programs, thinking that the culture is already saturated with election talk. The play is scheduled to close Nov. 6, two days before the election.Berkeley Rep hit upon \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d about eight months ago, when an unexpected hole opened in its fall season. Lisa Peterson, who had signed on to direct a show for Berkeley Rep, Googled the phrase \u201cit can\u2019t happen here\u201d and stumbled across the Sinclair Lewis novel, which she was not familiar with; Mr. Taccone had read the book in high school and thought it would work.The novel is about a Vermont newspaper editor, Doremus Jessup, who opposes a demagogic presidential candidate, Berzelius Windrip; it is a satirical and melodramatic cautionary tale, in which Mr. Windrip wins the election, imposes martial law and seizes control of newspapers; his regime arrests and even kills his critics.Lewis, who had already won the Nobel Prize for literature, wrote the novel against an ominous backdrop: Hitler and Mussolini were in power in Germany and Italy, and Huey Long, a senator and former governor who wielded unusual power in Louisiana, was preparing to run for the American presidency.There are some striking similarities between the campaign pitches by the fictional Mr. Windrip and the real Mr. Trump \u2014 both men were even nominated for the presidency in Cleveland. But there are significant differences: Windrip, among other things, is a Democrat (in the novel, the Republican nominee winds up fleeing to Canada to plot a rebellion) and prone to warnings against Jews; Mr. Trump, of course, is a Republican who has focused his concern on Muslims.In their new adaptation, Mr. Taccone and Mr. Cohen have sharpened the echoes. They wrote the campaign remarks by Windrip after watching stump speeches by Mr. Trump; they have one of their characters comment on the role of the news media (\u201cThe more offensive his remarks, the more papers get sold\u201d); and, in a dig at Hillary Clinton\u2019s reference to some Trump supporters as belonging to a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d a character explaining Windrip\u2019s popularity says, \u201cIt\u2019s not because they\u2019re all stupid and prejudiced and deplorable.\u201d\u201cWhat we saw as the risk was that Trump would not make it through the primaries, and the piece would feel irrelevant,\u201d Ms. Medak said. \u201cBut even if the elections ended up not being about Trump \u2014 and obviously we hoped they wouldn\u2019t be \u2014 there was something about this that felt as though it was speaking to what the American public was concerned about, regardless of who the candidate was.\u201dNoting that the 1930s adaptation by Lewis and J. C. Moffitt was presented by multiple theaters around the country, Berkeley Rep this month invited theaters, universities and libraries across the country to hold readings of the play; 30 organizations signed up in the first week.\u201cIt\u2019s an outrageous story,\u201d said Tom Nelis, the actor (last seen on Broadway in \u201cThe Visit\u201d) portraying the journalist Jessup in Berkeley. \u201cBut you can\u2019t watch it and not think it\u2019s plausible.\u201dAn article on Monday about efforts by people involved in theater around the United States to provoke discussion and reflection about the presidential election, using information from a publicist, misstated one of the two days this week when \u201cHamilton\u201d cast members are planning to register voters outside their theater. Besides Saturday, the registration will be Wednesday, not Tuesday.Advertisement"}

Our love was indestructible.Then she threatened to leave me six weeks after I had a double lung transplant.When you\u2019re being evaluated for a transplant, there are a lot of things the nurses and medical professionals tell you over and over again to drive home the significance, to make sure you\u2019re truly prepared, and probably to keep you from suing them later.There is a good chance you may die, they tell you, either during the surgery or while waiting for it. They show you pictures of how physically wracked your body is going to be in the days after the procedure. They give you documents explaining that you may die, what the cost of prescriptions will be and how high the risk of death is. They explain that you\u2019re going to be allergic to grapefruit and turtles afterward. For a while, you won\u2019t be able to lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk. And, oh yeah, death is a distinct possibility.There are also a lot of things the medical professionals don\u2019t mention: the stench of stale milk emanating from the nutritional supplements stacked in a corner of your rented bedroom, the wild mood swings, the muscle spasms, the sound an oxygen tank makes when a valve breaks at 2 a.m. (like the inside of a tornado), and what it feels like when antibiotics turn your colon into a water slide.None of the pamphlets mention the psychological toll of waiting to die or of waiting for (even grimly rooting for) someone else to die so that you can get that person\u2019s lungs. They don\u2019t explain how not to feel like a monster about that. No one tells you that the physical scars are the easy ones.My wife, Monica, knows this all intimately now, better even than I do. While I was high on anti-anxiety medications and cannabis-based appetite stimulants, she was the one who had to remain clearheaded enough to clean up after me and keep us rolling in buckets of expensive prescriptions.She didn\u2019t have the luxury of mentally checking out, the way I did. She would spend her mornings dealing with the gruesome symptoms of my death spiral, and then spend the afternoons trying to do her day job from my hospital room.Monica and I had bought a home in Albuquerque about six months before my lungs decided they no longer wanted to be lungs. There is nowhere in New Mexico where you can get a lung transplant, legally or otherwise. The local cystic fibrosis clinic worked in tandem with the transplant team at Stanford Hospital in California, summoning information and X-rays and then, when things really went off the rails, me, via emergency airlift.Monica spent the first two weeks sleeping on a cot in my tiny hospital room, both because I was a disaster and because she didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go. In between consoling me and checking in with the doctors and corralling the parents and coordinating with our friends to drive our car and all of our stuff out west (we were allowed only a single carry-on each during the airlift), Monica also had to find us a cheap apartment in one of the most expensive markets in the world before I could be even tenuously released from the hospital.We had to stay within an hour of Stanford Hospital. I wasn\u2019t going to be allowed to go back to Albuquerque unless I became significantly less almost-dead.Bills began piling higher on our makeshift dining-room table, a rickety card table from Ikea. Monica kept working, fund-raising and taking care of me. Two months later, I was on six liters of oxygen while sitting still. I could barely eat. Three months after that, my wife was bathing me like a child as I shivered and huddled in the tub trying not to have a panic attack.Monica had known about the cystic fibrosis since our third date, about the possibility of a transplant since shortly after. We had made it through some rough exacerbations and pneumonias before, argued with insurance companies and hospitals. We thought we could handle anything the transplant could throw at us.All the papers and preparation in the world, though, can\u2019t get you ready for how radically life-altering the transplant process is, how fundamentally less than human you become while waiting and wasting away. No brochure explains what that does to those watching you.Seven months after arriving in Palo Alto, we finally received the call: An organ donor of the correct size and blood type, within an acceptable distance for rapid transport, had died, and I received my double lung transplant, a nine-hour procedure that went well.Within a week of surgery, I was out of the hospital and back in our apartment with only Tylenol for the pain. We had the respiratory therapy company collect the oxygen tanks and tubes. We tossed all the nutritional supplements. Things were finally getting back to normal.Except we still couldn\u2019t go home: We needed to stay near Stanford Hospital for at least three more months. I still couldn\u2019t walk \u2014 my leg muscles had atrophied from the months of falling lung capacity and bed rest. And my new lungs still needed to be broken in. I needed physical therapy to learn to breathe again, to function as a human being.I was still only half a person.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this anymore,\u201d Monica said.Monica was a teary, snotty mess the night she blindsided me with the news that she may have to leave me if I didn\u2019t get healthier faster. It was mid-October, less than two months after the transplant.I was more terrified in that moment than I had been at any time during my hospitalizations or at any time they had to cut me open. The world itself seemed to stop. Despite the 20 pounds I had gained, the 6-foot-2 frame I had finally filled, I felt small and helpless. She was towering over me, crying, sniffling, trying to explain.She had already bought a plane ticket home.I was wearing new pajamas. I had a pile of pills on the table, a window open to the street at my back. I could hear the cars at the light: braking, stopping, going.After my mother flew in to relieve her, Monica left for New Mexico. I spent those next days and weeks feeling wounded, incensed. I tried to distract myself by building a haunted gingerbread house for Halloween but couldn\u2019t help dwelling on Monica\u2019s betrayal.\u201cHow could she?\u201d I ranted to myself, smoldering. \u201cWho does something like that?\u201d I fumed as I applied icing to the roof. \u201cDo I have to wait until Halloween to eat this?\u201d I wondered. (I was still on a lot of drugs at that point; it was hard to stay focused.)Monica and I didn\u2019t talk much while she was gone. Once I knew she was coming back, though, I began deciding what I was going to say to her, how I was going to explain how hurt and upset I was that she would simply abandon me after everything I had gone through.Every problem my waning health presented Monica had to handle twice over, worrying about me and worrying about her life after me if it all went sideways. Every time someone told me I was going to die, she had to sit there silently, taking it in.I could petulantly shrug off all the dire news and flip to the Cartoon Network, but she didn\u2019t have that option. She had to deal with the information, the issues and the repercussions, acting as nursemaid, housekeeper, chauffeur and lawyer for me \u2014 the man who was supposed to share her life, not consume it.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this anymore.\u201dHer words haunted me for weeks, but I was wrong about them. They weren\u2019t an ultimatum. They were a proclamation of defeat. Monica needed a break from doing the impossible. Her hasty retreat didn\u2019t mean she was done with me. It meant that she was as broken as I was. We had had a misunderstanding.My wife and I don\u2019t joke about how great we are anymore.

{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren: What Apple Teaches Us About Taxes", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 APPLE got a big surprise last week when the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect more than $14 billion in back taxes from the company. The global giant had been attributing billions of dollars in profits to a phantom head office, allowing it to pay a tax rate of 1 percent or lower.Both Apple and Ireland are appealing the decision, but the commission\u2019s announcement was the latest sign that multinational corporations are running out of places to hide from paying taxes. The door is now open for Congress to fix our own corporate tax code, which has allowed the biggest multinationals to shirk their obligations for decades.The Apple ruling is big, but it is only the latest international effort to end the deals that American multinationals have used to pay near-zero tax rates. The European Commission is investigating Luxembourg\u2019s tax arrangements for Amazon and McDonald\u2019s, and last year the European Court of Justice struck down tax advantages to companies and their subsidiaries selling e-books throughout Europe. Also last year, Britain enacted a new tax to target profits siphoned off by international companies \u2014 nicknamed, without much subtlety, the \u201cGoogle tax.\u201dIt\u2019s not just Europe. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20 nations are coordinating on a global effort to end the cross-border games that allow companies to avoid taxation by moving money among various subsidiaries. Multinational corporations are especially worried about losing access to Cayman Island-style tax rates in European countries where they can also get rule of law, political stability and an educated professional class of attorneys and consultants.The Treasury Department has pushed back against the European Commission over the Apple case, concerned about the impact on the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s authority. But Treasury has also finalized new country-by-country reporting requirements that could help expose the jaw-dropping variety of tax-dodging schemes multinational companies employ. At the Group of 20 summit meeting in China last weekend, President Obama reiterated his support for a cooperative global effort to end the international tax shell game.Now that they are feeling the sting from foreign tax crackdowns, giant corporations and their Washington lobbyists are pressing Congress to cut them a new sweetheart deal here at home. But instead of bailing out the tax dodgers under the guise of tax reform, Congress should seize this moment to take three crucial steps to repair our broken corporate tax code.First, Congress should increase the share of government revenue generated from taxes on big corporations \u2014 permanently. In the 1950s, corporations contributed about $3 out of every $10 in federal revenue. Today they contribute $1 out of every $10, despite their reliance on federal investments to start and expand their businesses. The National Science Foundation helped fund some of the initial work of Google\u2019s founders. Apple\u2019s consumer products still rely on technology that originated in federally funded research. To usher in the next generation of prosperous American companies \u2014 and to make the investments we need to sustain broad-based economic growth \u2014 the current generation of corporate winners must step up and pay its fair share.Second, Congress should encourage investment in jobs here in the United States. Giant corporations are pushing corporate tax reform proposals that offer a lower permanent tax rate for earnings generated abroad than earnings generated at home. That is nuts. Preferential tax treatment, either through special rates or deferred due dates, creates a huge financial incentive for American companies to build businesses and create jobs abroad rather than in the United States. Our tax code should favor jobs and businesses at home \u2014 period.Third, Congress should level the playing field for small businesses. Small companies in Massachusetts don\u2019t stash profits in the Netherlands. They can\u2019t hire a team of accountants to set up a \u201creverse hybrid mismatch\u201d to slash their taxes. This puts small businesses at a competitive disadvantage as they end up shouldering more of the burden of paying for education, infrastructure, research, the military and everything else our nation relies on to succeed.I have been pushing Congress to take these steps since I arrived in the Senate in 2013. The common refrain from Republicans who oppose these measures is that taking them would encourage American companies to flee abroad. But as other nations step up to prevent tax avoidance, that case gets weaker and weaker. And we have the leverage to tighten our tax code because these companies want what America offers: the world\u2019s wealthiest consumers, the world\u2019s best work force, the world\u2019s most reliable legal system and the world\u2019s deepest capital markets.For years, corporate tax dodgers have taken full advantage of all the benefits of being American companies, while searching out every possible way to avoid paying American taxes. Now that other leading countries are starting to get tough on tax enforcement, these tax dodgers suddenly want to move their money back to the United States. When they do, they should pay their fair share, just as working families and small businesses have been all along.Elizabeth Warren is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tech Companies Disrupted Silicon Valley\u2019s Restaurant Scene", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 It wasn\u2019t so long ago that the aroma of Moroccan spiced prawns and wood-oven pizzas wafted out to a downtown street here from the open-air patio of a once popular eatery called Zibibbo.Today that patio is behind locked doors, obscured by frosted glass. The pizza oven is gone. The formerly crowded bar has been converted into a sparsely populated start-up space of a dozen engineers, their bikes and whiteboards. After 17 years in operation, the restaurant closed in 2014. The space is now an American Express venture capital office and a start-up incubator.All told, more than 70,000 square feet of Palo Alto retail and restaurant space were lost to office space from 2008 to 2015, as the tech bubble drove demand for commercial space downtown.It is a story playing out across Silicon Valley, where restaurateurs say that staying afloat is a daily battle with rising rents, high local fees and acute labor shortages. And tech behemoths like Apple, Facebook and Google are hiring away their best line cooks, dishwashers and servers with wages, benefits and perks that restaurant owners simply cannot match.Silicon Valley technologists love to explain how they have disrupted the minutiae of daily life, from our commutes to the ways we share family photos. But along the way, they have also managed to disrupt their local restaurant industry.That may not be an issue for tech workers with access to free, farm-fresh cuisine in corporate cafeterias, but for everyone else here it is leaving a void between the takeout cuisine popping up around Palo Alto \u2014 picture bento boxes ordered on iPads at a counter \u2014 and $500 meals at high-end restaurants.\u201cRestaurants as we know them will no longer exist here in the near future,\u201d said Howard Bulka, a chef and owner of Howie\u2019s Artisan Pizza in Palo Alto and another restaurant in nearby Redwood City. \u201cPalo Alto is just too tough a row to hoe. A lot of people are looking into getting out in one piece or are thinking of leaving the business entirely.\u201dWith razor-thin profit margins, restaurateurs find they can increase wages only so much. Paying a livable wage is a struggle in Palo Alto, where the average one-bedroom apartment rents for $2,800, the same as in New York City, according to Rent Jungle. Workers have also been driven out of surrounding towns that were previously affordable, like Cupertino and San Jose, where demand from a new influx of tech workers has driven up the average cost of a one-bedroom apartment to more than $2,500.The cost to lease space in downtown Palo Alto, according to the city\u2019s planning department, is now $7.33 a square foot, up more than 60 percent from four years ago. Landlords have also put the onus of building improvements on the tenants.Palo Alto requires restaurants to pay fees for things like sidewalk improvements, tree maintenance and parking. Restaurants that lease 1,000 square feet or more must provide four private parking spaces or pay an in-lieu parking fee of $63,848 per space, for a total of $255,392 \u2014 the highest such fee in the country.Successful restaurants often pay 4 to 6 percent of gross sales in occupancy costs, which include rent and other fees like insurance and property taxes. But in Palo Alto, restaurateurs say the combination of high rents and staffing challenges has pushed their occupancy costs to 12 percent of gross sales.\u201cFrom an operating standpoint, it\u2019s crushing,\u201d Mr. Bulka said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough profitability in this. Period.\u201d\u201cHelp wanted\u201d signs are now ubiquitous, and not only among restaurants. On a recent Wednesday, a sign outside a florist read: \u201cCall our associate. We don\u2019t have enough people to run the shop here right now.\u201dUnderstaffed \u201cfast casual\u201d restaurants \u2014 frozen yogurt, cupcake and tea shops; pok\u00e9 bars; and salad stations where customers order from the counter \u2014 have replaced older mom-and-pop restaurants. Other newcomers are well-heeled chains like Nobu, the global sushi empire that announced plans to open a restaurant in Palo Alto, and Sweetgreen, the salad chain start-up that has raised $95 million in venture capital funding and can offset the costs of doing business in Palo Alto with sales from its more than 50 other locations.Not everyone is so fortunate. \u201cWe\u2019re competing more for staff than we are for guests at this point,\u201d said Craig Stoll, a James Beard Award-winning chef and co-owner with his wife, Annie Stoll, of Delfina.The Stolls own four restaurants in San Francisco and two in Silicon Valley \u2014 one in Burlingame and the other in Palo Alto. They have not been able to fully staff their Silicon Valley locations since they opened about two years ago. They used to require their line cooks to have particular experience. \u201cNow we\u2019re just selling ourselves on Craigslist, posting pictures of cooks butchering pigs, saut\u00e9ing, and good-looking waitresses to recruit staff,\u201d Mr. Stoll said.In the last year, the Stolls have lost several of their best servers and their director of operations to Twitter and Airbnb in San Francisco. To compete, the couple have been increasing pay and perks as much as possible, but they say they still often have to close off entire sections of their Silicon Valley restaurants simply because there is not enough staff to service them.Recently, they have resorted to hiring their 14-year-old daughter and her friends to step in. \u201cWe\u2019re breeding our own work force at this point,\u201d Mr. Stoll joked.Just a few blocks from Pizzeria Delfina in Palo Alto, JC Andrade, an owner of Vino Locale, a family-run wine bar, said his bar lost its previous chef to Facebook. His family increased workers\u2019 pay and now offers a 401(k) program, but Facebook and Google continue to offer his staff higher wages than Mr. Andrade said he makes as owner. Increasingly, he said, he has to beg his 15-year-old brother to pick up shifts.Last year, Brigette Lau and Chamath Palihapitiya, founders of the venture fund Social Capital, opened Bird Dog, a stylish restaurant downtown. They had backing from other Silicon Valley investors eager to bring a slice of younger, innovative and relatively affordable San Francisco-style cuisine to downtown Palo Alto.But even with Silicon Valley\u2019s backing and their own substantial means \u2014 Mr. Palihapitiya is part owner of the Golden State Warriors basketball team \u2014 Ms. Lau said operating a restaurant in Palo Alto was not for the faint of heart.\u201cI\u2019m supportive of the start-up community, but not at the expense of the community,\u201d she said.Walk around downtown Palo Alto and you will probably stumble on an enticing dining space where seasonal menus with dishes like Cuban braised pork tease passers-by. But do not try to enter without a badge. The space is Palantir Technologies\u2019 private, fully staffed, employee-only cafeteria. The privately held software company now occupies over 12 percent of the rentable commercial office space downtown, according to the research firm PrivCo.The newest options for locals include Zume Pizza in nearby Mountain View, where robots cook the pizza. Zume delivers to Palo Alto \u2014 perhaps in driverless cars in a few years.On Palo Alto\u2019s main street, adult-size robots, with screens featuring real people speaking from their homes in Bermuda or Kansas City, greet pedestrians and escort them into a Beam robot shop, which is unstaffed and empty save for the other robots selling themselves.\u201cWe joke that we\u2019re all going to end up like Beam robots,\u201d said Mr. Andrade, of Vino Locale. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before someone hands them a tray.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Sailors Needed: Robot Sailboats Scour the Oceans for Data", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALAMEDA, Calif. \u2014 Two robotic sailboats trace lawn-mower-style paths across the violent surface of the Bering Sea, off the coast of Alaska. The boats are counting fish \u2014 pollock, to be specific \u2014 with a fancy version of the fish finder sonar you\u2019d find on a bass fishing boat.About 2,500 miles away, Richard Jenkins, a mechanical engineer and part-time daredevil, is tracking the robot sailboats on a large projection screen in an old hangar that used to be part of the Alameda Naval Air Station. Now the hangar is the command center of a little company called Saildrone.At least 20 companies are chasing the possibly quixotic dream of a self-driving car in Silicon Valley. But self-sailing boats are already a real business.While they are counting fish, Saildrone\u2019s boats are also monitoring the seals that feed on the fish by tracking transponders that scientists have attached to the heads of the seals.\u201cWe can tell them what size fish they are eating and why they are going there,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, who is the chief executive and a co-founder of the company.Last summer, working with scientists and engineers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the boats skimmed along the edge of the retreating Arctic ice cap, giving scientists a detailed account of temperature, salinity and ecosystem information that would have been difficult and expensive to obtain in person.The Saildrone autonomous sailboats look a little like shrunken America\u2019s Cup racing yachts \u2014 small trimarans with hard, carbon-fiber sails.The Saildrone\u2019s carbon fiber sail acts like an aircraft wing. When air passes over it, thrust is created. The sail is stabilized by a counterweight that is placed in front of it and a tab trailing behind it that can automatically make small corrections to make sure it maintains an efficient angle to the wind. Underneath the boat are both a rudder to aid in steering and a keel, which will right the boat if it is knocked over.The big difference, of course, is that there are no sailors on board. The boats are controlled through communications satellites from the operations center here as they collect oceanographic data and monitor fish stocks and the environment.One day, they may be used for weather prediction, oil and gas industry ocean operations, or even to police illegal fishing.Mr. Jenkins has a much grander vision. He believes the missing piece of the puzzle to definitively comprehend the consequences of global warming is scientific data. He envisions a fleet of thousands or even tens of thousands of his 23-foot sailboats creating a web of sensors across the world\u2019s oceans.Vast amounts of data collected by his robots could reveal with greater detail the extent and rate at which global warming might become an existential threat to humanity and whether it is happening in decades rather than centuries.That is, if someone is willing to pay for all that. The boats are not sold \u2014 the scientists, commercial fisherman and weather predictors pay a $2,500-a-day fee per boat for the data they produce.Saildrone got its start with $2.5 million in grants from Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s executive chairman, and his wife, Wendy Schmidt. And Mr. Jenkins\u2019s company recently received $14 million in financing from three socially minded venture capital firms: Social Capital, Lux and Capricorn.\u201cMy interest in Saildrone is very practical,\u201d said Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive who is the founder of Social Capital. \u201cLet\u2019s stop arguing about what is happening, and let\u2019s measure. Once you have data and it\u2019s statistically significant and valid, then we can get to the next step, which is to find what the structural reforms are that need to happen.\u201dEach boat is packed with an armory of scientific sensors that beam data back to the control center.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much taking the earth\u2019s temperature as it is its pulse,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, a 39-year-old, tousle-haired mechanical engineer who was trained at Imperial College London.He has found willing clients in ocean scientists and engineers who previously had limited ways to collect highly specific and accurate data about the ocean surface.\u201cRichard had a great boat but no scientific sensors on it, and we had sensors but no boat,\u201d said Christian Meinig, the director of engineering at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. The scientists at the laboratory have already begun to use the boats to enhance their study of the El Ni\u00f1o warm-water pattern in the Pacific Ocean.The breakthrough for the robots was a sailboat design that Mr. Jenkins originally began pursuing when he set out to capture the world land-sailing speed record in 1999. He succeeded in 2009 in a \u201cland yacht\u201d called Greenbird that reached a speed of 126.2 m.p.h. on a dry lake bed in Southern California.To reach such a high speed and remain stable, Mr. Jenkins replaced the traditional sailboat sail with a rigid vertical carbon-fiber wing coupled with a unique stabilizer trailing behind the wing that would automatically adjust the wing faster than a human sailor could respond by pulling ropes.He has repurposed the wing to sail at slower speeds and to autonomously travel anywhere in the world. Last year, in an experiment, one of the Saildrone boats made its way from Alameda to the Equator in 42 days, collecting a wealth of ocean surface data along the way. A scientific research vessel with a large human crew would be faster, but it would cost about $80,000 a day.That researchers can move the autonomous boats \u2014 unlike the static ocean buoys that are now typically used \u2014 is significant, because it allows scientists to alter collection patterns in response to ocean conditions and interesting discoveries.\u201cA self-correcting model is really a superpowerful way of doing things,\u201d said Christopher Sabine, an oceanographer who is director of Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. \u201cFor climate modeling we need to know what\u2019s going on year-round, and to be perfectly frank, we don\u2019t like to go out into the middle of winter.\u201dSaildrone is not the only autonomous vehicle on the sea. Liquid Robotics, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., makes a boat called Wave Glider, which uses wave rather than wind action to move at more than two knots and carry up to 100 pounds of instruments.The Saildrone payload is more than twice as large, and the boat is potentially twice as fast. The sensor suite is made up of more than a dozen instruments that capture wind speeds, radiation, still and video imagery, temperature, ocean chemistry, and other data.Mr. Jenkins\u2019s contention is that a fleet of robot sensors spread across an ocean like the Pacific will make a huge difference in both weather and climate prediction. For example, a better understanding of a weather phenomenon like El Ni\u00f1o could make a difference worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cThey completely failed to see the last one coming,\u201d he said, noting that climate scientists acknowledge they don\u2019t have the spatial resolution to make accurate predictions. \u201cThey have a pressing need for more data.\u201dAn article on Monday about drone sailboats that gather research data misidentified the variety of fish being counted off the coast of Alaska by boats deployed by a company called Saildrone. The drones are counting pollock, not haddock.Advertisement"}

This was my first time driving in the United States and my first time driving an automatic car. I had asked for a manual transmission, but the rental agency didn\u2019t have one. In my country, Argentina, everyone drives a manual.After entering California on Interstate 15, I stopped to get gas, and for the first time in my life I had to put it in the tank by myself. In Argentina, a guy in a uniform always does this for you. I had to choose the fuel, but I don\u2019t know anything about fuel, and I don\u2019t know anything about cars. I just know how to drive. I thought any gas would work, and I picked one.This was also my first time traveling alone. I really needed a break. I spent my 20s building my own travel agency, and now I felt like I should travel myself and have new experiences. But a woman traveling by herself is an easy target, and I knew I had to be really careful. I was thinking about the horror stories I had heard, like the two Argentine girls who were murdered this year by two men while traveling in Ecuador. So I took precautions, like not accepting drinks from men I didn\u2019t know, not having more than one drink and not going out at night alone. I was focused on bad things that could happen to me and on people with bad intentions.A while later, getting closer to Los Angeles, there was some traffic on the highway, and I slowed down. That\u2019s when the car suddenly died. It just stopped working. I tried turning the key. Nothing.I put on the emergency lights and waved my hands at drivers. But no one stopped. I was calling the rental agency when a white woman pulled up and asked what was going on. She called 911 for me, and the operator said help was coming.It felt like a year with all those cars speeding by, but 10 minutes later an African-\u00adAmerican man named Jackson came with a tow truck and moved me off the road. I told him what was wrong.\u201cThese new cars are crap!\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all trash.\u201dI felt so frustrated, and I started to cry.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. to cry,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re human. You\u2019re allowed to cry. I cry sometimes.\u201d He was like a therapist, saying the right words for the moment.Then we sat in his truck to wait for the car-\u00adrental company. He told me about his family and showed me pictures of his sons and grandchildren and lots of car \u00adcrashes. He gave me driving tips and told me about car problems. It seemed as if the rental company had taken advantage of me by giving me a bad car.The manager left me at the airport with my suitcase and three bags. I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I asked a woman if she knew how to get to Venice Beach from there. She didn\u2019t, but she invited me to go with her and her teenage daughter in a taxi to her home in Chino Hills, and then she would drive me to the train station. I offered to pay, but she didn\u2019t let me. She was a nurse from New Zealand. She was so concerned about me. I felt as if she were my mom. When I said goodbye to them, they each gave me a hug.At the train station, I asked a policeman what train to take to Los Angeles. He was Mexican-\u00adAmerican and spoke to me in Spanish. He said a bus would be quicker, and then he carried my bags to the stop and told the driver to tell me when to get off, which he did.I wanted to take an Uber to my hotel from there, but my phone was dead. My bags were so heavy. I must have looked desperate, because a Mexican woman with a little girl offered to get a taxi for me.On the way to the hotel, I felt as if a guardian angel had taken care of me, but it was really a whole chain of people. If things had gone a different way, someone could have taken advantage of me. But life brings you the things you need, and I guess I needed to meet those people to learn how to trust more. You can\u2019t go through life thinking everyone is bad and has bad intentions. It\u2019s not true.Twelve hours after beginning what I thought was a six-hour journey, I finally arrived at my hotel.Romina Rivitti, 30, is a travel agent from Buenos Aires.

{"Headline": "Explaining the U.S. Presidential Election to China: It\u2019s Not Really Like \u2018House of Cards\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySinosphereAs Election Day approaches in the United States, the Chinese are paying closer attention to the selection of the next president.An estimated 70,000 people listen the podcasts every month. In August, Mr. You published \u201cGet Elected: A Very Short Introduction to the U.S. Presidential Election\u201d (Taihai Publishing House, Beijing) with Mr. Hua and Lin Yao, who has a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University.In an interview, Mr. You explained that the Chinese are more interested in the United States presidential election than ever, but don\u2019t always understand it.What do Chinese get wrong about the American political process?I feel that the biggest misunderstanding is that many Chinese take \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d too seriously. American politics is complicated, even for Americans. For many Chinese, it\u2019s just too confusing. So people take a shortcut. \u201cHouse of Cards\u2019\u2019 is so real for them that it filters their impressions of American politics.Another misunderstanding is derived from the negative propaganda many Chinese have absorbed over the years, that is, that American politics is controlled by money or big capitalists and that politicians are just puppets controlled by capitalists. It\u2019s possible that there are serious problems in American politics. But as far as plutocratic politics is concerned, it\u2019s not as bad as people in China imagine.On the other hand, some liberal intellectuals in China believe that the United States is good in every way. Its political system is good and its people\u2019s voices are heard. They attribute every achievement of the United States to its superior political system.I feel that many Chinese aren\u2019t really observing American politics as much as they\u2019re projecting their own biases onto American politics.Are people in China are better informed about the presidential election than four or eight years ago?We have access to far more information than we did four or eight years ago. Millions of Chinese have traveled to the United States. We have a powerful internet and social media. A large percentage of younger people speak English. But American politics is complicated. To understand it, we need to put it into context, which many Chinese can\u2019t do.What is the range of Chinese political views you see on social media comments on the podcast?Obviously Chinese political views vary. But I\u2019ve noticed that many in our audience who express their views publicly take a nationalistic stance. They look at the election from the perspective of what\u2019s best for China.Who are your listeners?What shows or topics have been the most popular with your Chinese listeners?The four most popular shows, according to Google Analytics, dealt with Obama\u2019s health care reform, guests explaining why they are against Donald Trump, spending bills and the Iowa caucuses. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that Chinese are interested in Obamacare. China is also undergoing health care reform and we want to learn lessons from the United States.As your Chinese listeners learn more about presidential politics and the American political system during this election, do they get more or less cynical?It\u2019s hard to tell. From the comments of some Trump supporters on our Zhihu account [a question-and-answer website], they are clearly angry. But I can\u2019t tell how representative they are of our audience. My personal observation is that they might be overpowering other voices by expressing themselves loudly and attacking others.But I would like to say that 2016 appears to be the beginning of a real Chinese interest in U.S. elections. The combination of a growing middle-class, more overseas experience and easier access to information have fostered more interest than I\u2019ve seen before.Second, many Chinese don\u2019t like the Democratic Party. President Truman, a Democrat, supported Chiang Kai-shek, oversaw the Korean War and interfered in China-Taiwan relations. President Kennedy, a Democrat, got involved in Vietnam. President Clinton, a Democrat, criticized China\u2019s human rights record and slowed negotiations on China entering the World Trade Organization. Meanwhile, President Eisenhower, a Republican, ended the Korean War and President Nixon, a Republican, ended the Vietnam War and initiated the normalization of Chinese-U.S. relations. Many Chinese think another Democratic president would not be favorable to China.Third, many Chinese support Trump\u2019s isolationist foreign policy. They believe that Trump would take a more pragmatic approach towards China and create new opportunities for China\u2019s rise.Advertisement"}

The novel \u2014 over 2,400 pages in its standard English translation, twice as long as \u201cWar and Peace\u201d \u2014 is told in a mere two hours and 20 minutes. Hundreds of characters have been cut, leaving just eight main figures in the final show, which runs from Saturday through Sept. 29 at San Francisco Opera.The book\u2019s many die-hard fans may not be pleased.\u201cYou can\u2019t win with this, no matter what you do,\u201d Mr. Sheng said after a recent rehearsal. \u201cPeople will love you or hate you.\u201dMr. Sheng wrote the libretto with David Henry Hwang, the Tony Award-winning playwright. Stan Lai, an acclaimed playwright and director, has staged the work, and Tim Yip, who won an Academy Award for art direction for his work on Ang Lee\u2019s film \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d has designed the sets and costumes. The opera will be sung in English and accompanied by supertitles in English and Chinese.\u201cWe wanted it to have its own authenticity as a piece of operatic storytelling,\u201d said Matthew Shilvock, San Francisco Opera\u2019s new general director. \u201cBut we also wanted it to be something that would resonate with people who grew up with and love the novel, as well.\u201dA number of Chinese-Western amalgam operas have been created in recent years. Many of these, including the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s \u201cFirst Emperor,\u201d the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cMadame White Snake\u201d and even the San Francisco Opera\u2019s \u201cThe Bonesetter\u2019s Daughter\u201d have struggled to enter the repertory.Still, Mr. Shilvock said, presenting new work \u201calso has great potential to attract excitement in a way that the standard repertory piece doesn\u2019t always.\u201dWith \u201cDream of the Red Chamber,\u201d the company is seeking to tap a growing interest in Western-style opera among Asians and Asian-Americans in the Bay Area. The production arrives eight years after San Francisco Opera\u2019s highly successful premiere run of \u201cThe Bonesetter\u2019s Daughter,\u201d based on Amy Tan\u2019s novel about a Chinese-American family.\u201c\u2018Bonesetter\u2019s Daughter\u2019 was very, very popular and it was certainly the most popular new work that we did here during my time,\u201d said David Gockley, who retired in July as the company\u2019s general director. \u201cIts success caused me to have my ear to the ground to locate another piece that would be interesting for our Chinese population.\u201dNot long after \u201cThe Bonesetter\u2019s Daughter,\u201d the Minneapolis-based Chinese Heritage Foundation approached Mr. Gockley about adapting \u201cDream of the Red Chamber.\u201d\u201cI, of course, Googled it to death,\u201d he said, \u201cand learned more about it from members of our Chinese community here in San Francisco. The response I got was that there is not a Chinese or a Chinese-American that has not grown up and had some contact with this piece in some form.\u201dMr. Gockley turned to Mr. Sheng, a composer known for his skillful synthesis of traditional Chinese and Western musical styles. Even before signing on, the Shanghai-born Mr. Sheng was already what he called a \u201cdilettante Redologist,\u201d a nickname for the literary scholars who have dedicated their lives to studying the novel. Having read the book several times \u2014 first as a teenager during the Cultural Revolution, when it was banned \u2014 he understood the scale of the task.Deciding to focus on the central love triangle, Mr. Sheng was able to persuade Mr. Hwang, who had rebuffed initial requests, to write the libretto.\u201cIn the beginning, it just seemed like there were a lot of ways we could get it wrong,\u201d Mr. Hwang said. \u201cReally, the thing that convinced me was that Bright had a vision about how to boil the story down.\u201d\u201cPlus,\u201d he added jokingly, \u201cBright grew up during the Cultural Revolution in China, and I grew up in L.A., so his will is stronger than mine.\u201dMr. Yip, the designer, who previously worked on a Chinese television adaptation of the novel, has sought to create a dreamlike effect with the sets. Painted panels rise and fall to create different patterns, like a loom \u2014 a reference to Cao Xueqin\u2019s family business, making silk brocade for the emperor.The opera revolves around the mythological Stone and Flower, who come down to earth from heaven. Stone becomes Bao Yu (in San Francisco, the tenor Yijie Shi), the spoiled heir to the wealthy Jia family, and Flower becomes Dai Yu (the soprano Pureum Jo), a sickly, poetic young woman who comes to live with the Jias after the death of her mother.Bao Yu and Dai Yu are in love, but his mother orders him to marry Bao Chai (the mezzo-soprano Irene Roberts), a beautiful heiress, to pay back the Jia family\u2019s debt to the emperor. Bao Yu is defiant, but his love for Dai Yu is ultimately thwarted in a bride swap during a climactic wedding scene. In the final sequence, Dai Yu departs in a mournful chorus: \u201cWhen spring has fled, and beauty is spent, who cares for the fallen petals? Both flower and maiden return to dust.\u201dMr. Lai, the director, said: \u201cImpermanence and the fleeting quality of life \u2014 these are things that are very Buddhist and quintessentially Chinese. The biggest challenge was expressing these kinds of ideas for a Western audience in the limited moments you have.\u201dIn March, the opera will travel to the Hong Kong Arts Festival, which co-produced the work, and may tour elsewhere in Asia. Plans are already underway to translate the libretto into the classical Chinese in which the novel was originally written.The opera may then face a tougher, more discerning audience among those even more familiar with the book, but Mr. Sheng seemed unfazed.\u201cIf you ask 10 different Redologists what the novel is about, they would give you 10 different answers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if anyone asks me what this opera is about, I\u2019ll say it\u2019s a story of a love triangle. That\u2019s it.\u201dA picture caption on Saturday with an article about the San Francisco Opera\u2019s production of \u201cDream of the Red Chamber\u201d reversed the identities of two performers.

{"Headline": "No Driver? Bring It On. How Pittsburgh Became Uber\u2019s Testing Ground", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber\u2019s unprecedented test? The answer is not much.There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don\u2019t know where the Uber cars will travel.It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley\u2019s boldest experiments \u2014 and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities.The mayor\u2019s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs \u2014 essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years.When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city\u2019s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-sharing services in 2014, Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor and the state\u2019s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh\u2019s politicians stay out of the way.The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber.But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber\u2019s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks.\u201cI feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,\u201d said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city\u2019s South Side neighborhood.\u201cThis is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that\u2019s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was \u201cfrankly surprised at how long a leash\u201d Uber got.Mr. Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and said the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal.\u201cThere is no technology that is fail-proof and there is no tech that can guarantee there won\u2019t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,\u201d he said.In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, \u201cOur work would not be possible without the support we\u2019ve received from city leaders.\u201dUber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own.By this decade, the university\u2019s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students.For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state\u2019s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed.Officials from Pennsylvania\u2019s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths.\u201cWe\u2019d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn\u2019t pursue this technology,\u201d said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.In Pittsburgh, Mr. Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Mr. Peduto\u2019s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Mr. Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Mr. Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission\u2019s proposed ban on ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Mr. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber\u2019s driverless cars.\u201cTravis\u2019s vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cWe shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.\u201dWeeks later, in a meeting with President Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Mr. Peduto urged Mr. Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh\u2019s intention to be a testing ground.Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber\u2019s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city\u2019s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers.Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber\u2019s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street.\u201cThere\u2019s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,\u201d said Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh\u2019s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so.Last month, Uber officially announced that the self-driving fleet would go into action in Pittsburgh. Mr. Peduto, who had been informed a few days earlier by Uber, sent a congratulatory text message to Mr. Kalanick. Uber\u2019s chief was in Pittsburgh at the time and invited the mayor to be the city\u2019s first driverless-car passenger.\u201cI feel fortunate that I have the ear of a C.E.O. of one of the biggest privately held companies,\u201d he said.An article on Sunday about Uber\u2019s introduction of self-driving cars to Pittsburgh misstated the surname of the city\u2019s assistant chief of police. He is Scott Schubert, not Schuster.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Salesforce Is Said to Question Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal in Europe", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe competition questions have focused on whether Microsoft\u2019s proposed deal would hinder access by people and companies to the vast collection of data held by LinkedIn. Salesforce.com has also suggested that the deal would give Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals by combining its own software services with the information held by the social network, two of the people said.The comments came in response to a questionnaire sent by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, a step that allows interested third-party companies, including competitors, to comment on prospective takeovers.Salesforce.com\u2019s concerns do not necessarily mean that Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, the region\u2019s tough antitrust chief, will open an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s purchase of LinkedIn, though on Thursday she raised her own questions about how digital data should be treated in future competition cases.Ricardo Cardoso, a European Commission spokesman, declined to comment on Salesforce.com\u2019s response to the competition questionnaire.A Microsoft spokeswoman, Jennifer Crider, declined to comment on the European Commission questionnaire, though she said the company had already received antitrust clearance in the United States and Canada and was working with other global authorities on similar approval. The company has yet to submit its LinkedIn deal to European competition authorities, but it is likely to do so by early November, at the latest.\u201cWe expect to close before the end of this calendar year,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement on Thursday.A Salesforce.com spokeswoman, Chi Hea Cho, said the company had been contacted by the European Commission as part of its review of the proposed deal. The company also made similar efforts in the United States to highlight the potential competition problems with the deal, but it failed to win over American authorities, said another person with knowledge of the matter.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, was dismissive of the complaints from Mr. Benioff\u2019s company.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to continue working to bring price competition to a C.R.M. market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices today,\u201d said Mr. Smith, using the initials for customer relationship management, the software category in which Salesforce is the leader.While Salesforce.com\u2019s criticism of the acquisition could appear to be just sour grapes after it lost out on buying LinkedIn, its questions about how Microsoft\u2019s control of data would potentially hinder rivals are gaining traction with some European officials.One possibility would be for Microsoft to combine LinkedIn\u2019s information on people\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and messaging activity on the social network with its own Office software, providing the tech giant with an advantage over rivals offering similar services. In previous statements, Microsoft said its own offerings did not overlap with LinkedIn\u2019s and that competing services like Facebook, which also collect large amounts of data, also existed.Similar data-related concerns were raised in Europe when Facebook bought WhatsApp, the messaging app, in 2014 for $19 billion. The region\u2019s authorities have been regularly criticized, particularly by European telecommunications operators, for approving that deal despite complaints that it would limit consumer choice.\u201cThe questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly, on second reference, to a Microsoft spokeswoman. Jennifer Crider is a woman.Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The smartwatch slips the latest Silicon Valley technology (a voice-activated Google search, fitness tracking, social media alerts) into a familiar line of watches that already have a proven pedigree among the style set. Indeed, over the last five years, it seems as if a chunky Michael Kors oversize watch has graced the wrist of every other female fashion professional under 30.Embracing technology is no easy thing for a fashion designer, since \u201cwe love what it does for our lives, but we don\u2019t always love how it looks,\u201d he added.But even fashion victims not predisposed to geek out over the latest Android Wear interface might appreciate the Access smartwatch as a highly versatile fashion accessory.The watch comes in two versions: the sporty black Dylan and the all-metal Bradshaw.With a swipe of the finger, users can switch between digital versions of the most popular watch faces from the analog Michael Kors line, like the Kerry, with an evening-wear-ready pav\u00e9 dial. Owners can also customize their own watch faces by selecting the color and style of the dial, hands and sub-dials to suit one\u2019s outfit.Lest anyone confuse the Access with a plain old watch that just tells time, the smartwatch also advertises its digital soul with animated dial options, featuring continuously moving images, like a glimmering cascade of gems.But where the Apple stage featured middle-age tech executives in jeans and sneakers, the Kors party left little doubt that the Access was intended as an accessory for the fashion crowd, capital F.The model and D.J. Harley Viera-Newton, wearing a floral embroidered brocade dress, laid down a thundering beat, as disco-ish satellite chandeliers glistened overhead. A broadside of camera flashes, meanwhile, greeted Zendaya, the onetime Disney star, who showed up in polka-dot trousers and navy striped top with a matching collar from Michael Kors Collection.As guests ate lobster roll appetizers and drank Champagne, one reporter asked Mr. Kors, who is no stranger to a bit of flash, to name his favorite of the Access watch\u2019s many dials.\u201cI\u2019m personally partial to diamonds falling,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cYou can never have too many diamonds.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the event where Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Series 2.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Fights Internet Directory\u2019s Transfer; Techies Say He Just Doesn\u2019t Get It", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republican from Texas does not appear to have the ability to inspire another insurgency so close to an election that will determine control of the Senate. He may not have the interest either. His technical theories about the registration of domain names \u2014 the \u201c.net\u201d and \u201c.world\u201d suffixes of internet addresses \u2014 have been discredited by engineers.But his move to block the Obama administration through a short-term spending bill needed to keep the government open past Sept. 30 demonstrates that the former Republican presidential candidate remains eager to keep his name in lights, even at the expense of his colleagues\u2019 efforts to get back to the campaign trail.\u201cI am hopeful and optimistic that leadership will follow through and protect the internet,\u201d Mr. Cruz said on Thursday, when asked if he would prevent the short-term spending measure from moving forward without his internet provision.Mr. Cruz\u2019s hobbyhorse is the administration\u2019s plan at the end of the month to transfer its oversight of domain name registrations to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a multinational private organization based in Los Angeles. Out of the United States\u2019 control, the openness of the internet would be in jeopardy, Mr. Cruz has warned, with Russia, Iran and China positioned to use their influence on Icann to determine what content appears on the web.\u201cImagine an internet run like many Middle Eastern countries, that punish what they deem to be blasphemy,\u201d Mr. Cruz warned in a Senate hearing he led earlier this week. \u201cOr imagine an internet run like China or Russia, that punish and incarcerate those that engage in political dissent.\u201dTechnologists and administration officials say Mr. Cruz simply does not understand how the web operates. The government\u2019s current job of domain name administrator is largely clerical and cannot influence editorial decisions on the web, they say.\u201cIt sounds like a fairy tale to anyone who understands how the internet works,\u201d said Andrew Sullivan, chair of the Internet Architecture Board, a nonprofit group of network engineers and tech firms such as Google and Cisco.The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said the administration is committed to meeting its Sept. 30 deadline.\u201cThe industry technology experts, business community and the largest internet companies \u2014 like Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2014 have described it as imperative that the transition move forward,\u201d he said.The issue involves the deep plumbing of the internet and the system of addresses and domain names that route traffic around the web. It highlights a broader policy struggle among nations over who should govern the internet, which may have been born in the United States but now counts 3.4 billion global users.The administration and tech firms that support the plan say Icann is a neutral body with advisers from around the world that will simply act as the keeper of the internet\u2019s master directory of domain names.\u201cAny delay would add a degree of instability and make the prospect of government control of the internet more likely, not less,\u201d said Kathryn Brown, president of the Internet Society, a nonprofit organization that advocates open internet policies.But Mr. Cruz\u2019s allies point to Icann\u2019s sketchy track record, including its chaotic 2014 expansion of domain names that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues for the group.But his leverage is diminished. While Mr. Cruz can slow passage of the spending bill, he does not have enough followers to kill it. House conservatives, while supportive of his policy goal, are interested in other issues, like halting the Syrian refugee program.\u201cThis internet issue is not on the front burner, no,\u201d said Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cThe Syrian refugee piece resonates more back home.\u201dDemocrats are far more worried about protecting money for Planned Parenthood to help fight the Zika virus, pesticide use and other matters related to Zika.Mr. Cruz does have the backing of influential Republican leaders such as Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. Last week, four House and Senate Republicans sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker asking for the administration to stop its plan.It is a twist for Mr. Cruz, a Republican who has railed against big government, to argue for more government control and less private enterprise.\u201cSince the internet\u2019s inception, the United States government has stood guard over critical internet functions,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.During the hearing on Wednesday, he interrupted and silenced one government witness who disagreed with his logic. He displayed a large poster-board exhibit with quotations from a Washington Post editorial criticizing Icann for malfeasance. Another exhibit showed a former Icann leader who went on to advise the Chinese government.At one point, Mr. Cruz warned Commerce Department employees that they would be breaking the law if they followed orders to hand over domain name administration to the organization.An article on Friday about efforts by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, to block the administration\u2019s plan to end federal oversight of the internet misstated part of the name of a government agency. It is the National Security Agency, not the National Security Administration.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Upgrades Autopilot in Cars on the Road", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla Motors, always ahead of the automotive curve, is conducting a remarkable technological feat.Starting this week and continuing in the coming days, the company is using the cellular network to beam new software to update the Autopilot driver-assistance system on approximately 70,000 of its cars. Tesla\u2019s ability to communicate with its vehicles to download major enhancements and fixes, much as Apple updates iPhones, is beyond the capability of other automakers.But then, no other automaker has an on-the-road system as experimental as Autopilot, or perhaps the need to make midcourse corrections to such a fundamental feature of its vehicles.The company has described the Autopilot update as intended to avoid the sort of errors that contributed to a Tesla owner\u2019s fatal crash in May on a Florida highway. The most evident change might be visual and audible reminders that drivers should keep their hands on the steering wheel.It is an implicit scale-back of the company\u2019s original promotion of Autopilot, introduced last October, as essentially a self-driving car system. At the time, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, said Autopilot was \u201cprobably better than a person right now.\u201dBut the company also acknowledged then that Autopilot was also only a beta system \u2014 a technical term for an experimental version. As such, the update now underway is a tacit acknowledgment that the self-driving-car experiment Tesla has been conducting on the public highways is still very much a work in progress.\u201cThey\u2019re able to take a risk and put a system out that they admit wasn\u2019t fully baked,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a research director at the Gartner Group. \u201cBut they have this ability to improve it. It\u2019s much more of a software mind-set. You get it out there and then you do software patches to fix the bugs.\u201dThe approach, Mr. Ramsey added, comes with some risk. \u201cYou have live human beings in there,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018so you can debate whether that\u2019s the best way to do it.\u201dTesla declined to comment for this article.The policy guidelines do raise concerns about semiautonomous systems that \u2014 like Autopilot \u2014 are designed to perform many of the driving duties but still require human drivers to stay alert and be ready to take control at a moment\u2019s notice. Otherwise, the technology could be considered \u201can unreasonable risk to safety and subject to recall.\u201dAnthony Foxx, secretary of transportation, said at a news conference this week that the new guidelines were not aimed at Tesla. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is still investigating the Florida accident.The question now is how just how new and improved Autopilot actually is \u2014 and whether a software download is sufficient to address what Tesla\u2019s many critics say are the inherent shortcomings of the autonomous driving system.One of those perceived drawbacks is Autopilot\u2019s assumption that an attentive driver can and will take over control of the car in the event of an emergency. Researchers at other companies at work on self-driving cars \u2014 including Ford Motor and Google \u2014 have concluded that this so-called handoff can never happen quickly enough to be fully safe.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The new Tesla software, called Version 8.0, also makes a significant change to the way Autopilot scans the road and recognizes objects. The previous version depended heavily on the forward-looking camera to sense surroundings. In the fatal Florida collision, the camera did not see a white tractor-trailer against a bright sky.The new version of Autopilot relies more heavily on the car\u2019s radar to identify other vehicles and potential obstacles, and to decide when to steer to avoid a problem or apply the brakes.The elevation of radar might seem a modest difference. But it runs counter to the widely held view that radar, while highly accurate in measuring distance, is less precise in determining the shape and size of objects.\u201cI\u2019m not completely sure how Tesla is able to recognize and classify objects\u201d with radar, said Jeremy Carlson, a senior automotive analyst at the forecaster IHS Markit. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear there are changes in the new software in the radar sensor that are doing something in a very different way.\u201dOther automakers argue that cameras are better at recognizing and classifying objects.\u201cRadar is good at telling the distance to an object but not very good at recognizing what it is,\u201d said Hideki Hada, general manager of Toyota Motor\u2019s integrated vehicle systems group in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cCameras can tell what an object is, but it\u2019s not so good at telling the distance. So you need both.\u201dDespite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.Companies at work on fully self-driving cars contend that conventional cameras and radar are not sufficient to enable a vehicle to sense and respond to its surroundings. They plan to incorporate an additional technology: a laser-powered type of radar called lidar.Tesla argues that its current technology is adequate for Autopilot\u2019s purposes. But in a Sept. 11 conference call announcing the upgrade, Mr. Musk acknowledged the challenge of using radar to identify objects.The world, he said, looks \u201cweird\u201d in radar. Metal objects, because they strongly reflect radar waves, can appear larger than they are. Wood and plastic can appear \u201cas transparent as glass.\u201d Radar sensors tend to give \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2014 instances when they think the car should brake when it actually doesn\u2019t need to.The new Autopilot software has algorithms to adjust for radar\u2019s distortions, according to Mr. Musk. And if the radar sees a large, dense, metal object \u2014 like a truck \u2014 the radar sensor can slow or brake the car, even if the camera system can\u2019t identify the object, he said.Mr. Musk predicted that the new Autopilot system was \u201creally going to be beyond what people expect\u201d and would make the Tesla Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle \u201cby far\u201d the safest cars on the road.Mr. Ramsey, the research director at Gartner, noted that Tesla was able to release Autopilot last year without having committed to a crucial engineering question \u2014 Is the radar or the camera the primary sensor? \u2014 knowing the company could modify and improve it later.\u201cThey can take a risk like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes them truly distinct from other automakers.\u201dWhether public experiments are the best approach to highway safety is another matter. \u201cI\u2019m sure they are very confident the cars are safe,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said, \u201cbut they are kind of doing trial and error.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Clear Logic in Verizon\u2019s Digital Media Venture", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneMaybe I am a Luddite. I just don\u2019t get the industrial logic behind Verizon Communications\u2019 recent $9.2 billion foray into the digital media \u201cspace,\u201d especially because the way it has chosen to compete in it is by buying Yahoo and AOL, two companies that have seen much better days.In late July, Verizon, the telephone and wireless behemoth, agreed to buy Yahoo for $4.8 billion in cash. A year or so earlier, it bought AOL for $4.4 billion in cash. The money Verizon spent is hardly material to its $220 billion market capitalization, although it is still a lot of money. And both businesses combined generate about $7 billion revenue annually.Does it still have a good handle on how to invest the nearly $50 billion in cash flow that it has generated in the last 12 months, mostly from its gigantic wireless and old-fashioned telephone businesses? Or is flailing in unknown waters in a misguided quest to get into the business of providing digital advertising, where the two biggest competitors by far are the formidable Google (market cap, $530 billion) and Facebook (market cap, $363 billion)?Both AOL and Yahoo, when that deal closes early next year, will report up the Verizon chain of command to Marni M. Walden, an executive vice president, who is a leading contender to succeed Lowell McAdam, the Verizon chief executive, when he retires. (Mr. McAdam is 62; there is no mandatory retirement age for executives at Verizon.) Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL and the man generally credited with creating Google\u2019s online advertising sales team, appears to be the executive who will run both AOL and Yahoo on a day-to-day basis for Ms. Walden.Ms. Walden\u2019s future at Verizon is likely to depend on how well she and Mr. Armstrong execute on Verizon\u2019s AOL-Yahoo strategy. At 49, she is a highflier, for sure. She was paid nearly $7 million in 2015, and along with Tami Erwin, the head of Verizon\u2019s wireless business, she is one of only two women senior executives at the company. Verizon declined to make any of its executives available to discuss the logic of the AOL and Yahoo deals.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on moving forward running the business,\u201d Bob Varettoni, the head of corporate communications, emailed me.Instead, Mr. Varettoni pointed me to previous public comments Verizon executives have made. For instance, at the time of the AOL acquisition, Ms. Walden said, \u201cWe\u2019ve begun the next chapter in our history where we intend to become the No. 1 global media technology company for creators and advertisers and consumers.\u201d\u201cOur vision is to provide customers with a premium digital experience based on a global multiscreen platform,\u201d she added.She noted that AOL was a leader in \u201cdigital content and advertising platforms\u201d and that with Verizon, the combined company \u201ccreates a scaled mobile first platform directly targeted at the global advertising industry.\u201dVerizon\u2019s public relations team also pointed me to a transcript of Verizon\u2019s second-quarter 2016 earnings call. In the call, Mr. McAdam said that thanks to the AOL deal, which also brought with it The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, Verizon has learned \u201ca tremendous amount\u201d about the video market and opportunities for future growth. As for the Yahoo acquisition, Mr. McAdam said Verizon saw \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d in the digital video marketplace, which he said was expected to reach $180 billion by 2020.Without naming them, he said that two brands \u2013 the aforementioned Google and Facebook \u2014 dominated the market and that Verizon intended to be \u201ca significant player,\u201d too. \u201cContent creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption,\u201d he said.The Yahoo acquisition will allow Verizon to be a \u201cmajor competitor\u201d in mobile media, Mr. McAdam continued. He said Yahoo brought \u201cmarket-leading content\u201d in sports, finance, news and email and expanded Verizon\u2019s \u201canalytics and ad tech capabilities\u201d and enhanced \u201cour competitive position and value proposition to advertisers.\u201d For his part, Mr. Armstrong told Mr. Gelles: \u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new. People act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future.\u201dHonestly, I don\u2019t know what any of this means. It sounds like Verizon recognizes that the growth in its wireless business, while a cash machine, has peaked and that it needs to find new opportunities. It must think it has found that opportunity by trying to take a piece of the digital advertising market away from Google and Facebook. And even if AOL and Yahoo end up with only 5 percent of the market, by 2020, that will be nearly $4 billion in new revenue for Verizon, which is still just a fraction of its $130 billion in trailing 12 months\u2019 revenue.When I was a Wall Street banker covering the telecommunications industry, I worked on a number of mergers and acquisitions deals for what is now Verizon: the merger of GTE and Bell Atlantic, which created Verizon; the creation of Verizon Wireless; and the sale of groups of Verizon\u2019s wireless assets that posed conflicts for the company. I also worked on two deals that never came to fruition: Verizon\u2019s failed attempt to buy AirTouch, a big wireless provider, and Verizon\u2019s exploration of buying WorldCom for $100 billion, before WorldCom disintegrated. In each of these deals, I always had a clear sense of the company\u2019s strategic direction and priorities.But now I\u2019m more than a little confused. Which leads me to wonder what the market makes of Verizon\u2019s acquisition of Yahoo. Verizon\u2019s stock hovered around $56 a share before it announced the widely expected Yahoo acquisition. These days the stock is hovering around $53, a decline in Verizon\u2019s market capitalization of nearly $12 billion, or three times what it agreed to pay for Yahoo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Back to School, in a New Country", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionCHAMPAIGN, Ill. \u2014 I had another fight with my daughter on a recent Saturday morning.

Do you even know what Harvard is?\u201d she yelled, before slamming the door to her room.\u201cDid you have to start up with Harvard now?\u201d asked my wife. She handed me a list of school supplies. \u201cTake the boys, I\u2019ll deal with this.\u201d\u201cWho am I even doing all this for?\u201d I mumbled to myself as I walked to the car with our two sons. I wasn\u2019t even sure what I meant by \u201call this,\u201d or when exactly I was doing it, but it\u2019s something my father used to say. Recently, I find myself repeating lines I heard from my parents as a kid.It\u2019s not that I\u2019m putting pressure on my daughter. Not at all. But she is 16, after all, and she has to realize that life is no picnic, and America is no Jerusalem. So yes, Harvard. It\u2019s a legitimate request. If I\u2019m going to pay tens of thousands of dollars I don\u2019t have for her American college education, then it might as well be Harvard. Although I\u2019d settle for any Ivy League school.To make things worse, last week she declared she wanted to be a historian. At first, I laughed, but when I realized she was serious, I was furious: \u201cHistory?! You must be joking. What exactly are you going to do with that? Write a thesis about unemployed historians in the 18th century? Is that what I\u2019m doing all this for?\u201dAs we drove off, I listened to a story on NPR about Syrian refugees who arrive here without a word of English and are given three months of aid from various organizations. After that, they\u2019re left to their own devices. But they are so thrilled to be in the land of opportunity. The teenage son of the family, who could already string together a few sentences in English, talked about how happy he was because now he was in the United States and he could be whatever he wanted \u2014 an engineer, or a doctor.\u201cDaddy, what language do you talk with Mommy?\u201d My little boy has been speaking to me exclusively in English since shortly after we came to America from Israel.\u201cWhat?\u201d I was baffled.\u201cHe thinks you\u2019re saying Arby\u2019s,\u201d my older son explained. Then he set matters straight for his little brother: \u201cMom and Dad are Arabs, not a sandwich place.\u201dI\u2019d never seen the parking lot at Target so full. Parents with little kids pushed enormous red carts around, students back from summer break were doing last-minute shopping before the semester started. I managed to locate the office supplies, but my heart sank when I studied the list my wife had given me.What on earth was a pocket folder with prongs? I thought my English was good \u2014 after all, I can give a 90-minute lecture on racism, gentrification and Middle Eastern politics. But I was stumped by \u201cfine-point black felt-tip marker.\u201dI had no idea what I was doing. I broke into a sweat, and then, faking a smile, I pretended to text a friend while, in fact, I frantically Googled the items on the list to see their pictures. If my daughter \u2014 God bless her \u2014 had been with me, she would have helped me decipher the list. But I wasn\u2019t about to call her and ask for help. As it is, she makes fun of my English and my accent.It took me two hours, but I finally figured out the school supplies. The only thing left was a backpack for my little boy who doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s an Arab.\u201cI want the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 backpack,\u201d he demanded as we stood gazing at the rows of bags.\u201cBut sweetie, it says here very clearly that it has to be a one-gallon Ziploc bag,\u201d I explained and showed him the list he couldn\u2019t even read. \u201cWe have to get a Ziploc, that\u2019s what the teacher said.\u201dI couldn\u2019t find anything called Ziploc, despite inspecting every single bag. My older son was getting desperate: \u201cDad, maybe we should ask someone?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d I insisted. I wasn\u2019t going to ask anyone. I didn\u2019t want some American sales clerk knowing I couldn\u2019t understand simple, elementary-school English. We\u2019d look for that Ziploc bag in another store. I wasn\u2019t about to let anyone think we were Middle Eastern immigrants coming here to steal jobs from honest Americans. I would not be responsible for a surge in Islamophobia over a Ziploc bag.\u201cThey don\u2019t have it here,\u201d I declared. \u201cLet\u2019s go to a different store.\u201d\u201cBut Dad, \u2018Star Wars\u2019! You promised!\u201d\u201cSorry, sweetie, it has to be a Ziploc.\u201dThey didn\u2019t have any Ziplocs at the second store either, but I did find a North Face backpack for $160, before tax. I bought it and asked for a return receipt. My daughter doesn\u2019t understand that everything has changed since we came here. She doesn\u2019t understand that her mom and I are planning to sell our apartment in Jerusalem \u2014 which we spent more than 20 years working for \u2014 so that she and her brothers can go to school. That we came here to get them away from racism and interminable war, in the hopes those don\u2019t follow us here, too.\u201cWhy is he crying?\u201d my wife asked when we got home.\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t find a Ziploc bag.\u201d\u201cDad, Ziplocs are plastic bags for the fridge,\u201d my daughter groaned, but her disdain gave way to a grin when I gave her the new backpack. \u201cThanks!\u201d\u201cJust so you know, this backpack has to last you through eight years of medical school.\u201d\u201cCome on, Dad \u2026\u201dThen I handed her another gift: a biography of Abraham Lincoln.\u201cDid you know he was a Republican?\u201d she asked.Sayed Kashua is a visiting professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the author, most recently, of \u201cNative: Dispatches From an Israeli-Palestinian Life.\u201d This essay was translated by Jessica Cohen from the Hebrew.Advertisement"}

GV, the current name of Alphabet\u2019s investment arm, invested in Uber, after all. Uber certainly benefited from working with Google\u2019s mobile operating system, and it has long used Google\u2019s maps (though it is working on its own now).But somewhere along the way, the two started to drift apart. Google has been working on a self-driving-car project for years and has been testing the vehicles on the streets of Silicon Valley. Last year, Uber hired some of the best minds in the autonomous-vehicle world from Carnegie Mellon University and created its own self-driving-car research center.And last week, Uber acquired a self-driving-truck start-up founded and heavily populated by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 former Google employees. To top it off, Uber plans to start testing self-driving Uber cars in Pittsburgh next month.Google has a history of executives who serve on the boards of companies that could soon be competitors, of course. Eric E. Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, was a member of Apple\u2019s board when his company was developing Android, a direct competitor to the Apple iPhone.

It\u2019s like making the case for a space invasion by telling people to Google \u201caliens among us.\u201dClinton does have allergies that sometimes send her off into fits of coughing. There\u2019s also a video of her tripping and being helped up by a flight attendant \u2014 an incident that seems to be what Giuliani is referring to when he says she had to be \u201clifted onto airplanes.\u201dTrump has been on this one as well. \u201cMainstream media never covered Hillary\u2019s massive \u2018hacking\u2019 or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. What\u2019s up?\u201d demanded the man whose own released medical information consisted of a four-paragraph letter that started off with \u201cTo Whom My Concern.\u201dThis is nuts, but not necessarily sexist. Trying to start rumors about an opponent\u2019s health was a staple of presidential politics long before we had a woman in the race. Ronald Reagan called Michael Dukakis an \u201cinvalid.\u201d A top Democrat discussing Reagan in 1984 said, \u201cWell, he didn\u2019t quite drool.\u201d Obama supporters tried to raise concerns about a reoccurrence of melanoma in John McCain, but McCain answered the question by releasing a huge medical report from his doctors.Actually, both of our current candidates ought to follow McCain\u2019s example.\u201cWEAK\u201dTrump likes to describe Clinton as \u201cweak.\u201d He\u2019s gone on and on about how she doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe strength or the stamina to be a good president.\u201d This is the guy who\u2019s flying around the country in a massive, super-comfy personal plane, doing an event and then flying home so he can sleep in his own bed every night.\u201cI think he projects his own weaknesses onto other people,\u201d said Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri.Nobody \u2014 at least until now \u2014 has ever accused Clinton of being short on stamina. But on this subject Trump is arguably an equal opportunity insulter. Just ask Jeb \u201clow energy\u201d Bush.DOESN\u2019T LOOK PRESIDENTIAL\u201cWe talk about presidential. Do I look presidential?\u201d Trump demanded at a rally, clearly expecting a positive answer. \u201cDo you think Hillary looks presidential? I don\u2019t think so. And I\u2019m not going to say it, because I\u2019m not allowed to say it because I want to be politically correct.\u201dRemember Rule No. 1.Sexist? Well, duh.FAILURE TO SMILEThe smile critique was most definitely sexist. Trump didn\u2019t do a whole lot of beaming at the forum himself. And it\u2019s hard to think of a male presidential candidate taking the heat for not looking cheerful enough. This is a country that once elected Calvin Coolidge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tesla and Apple Could Be Good for Each Other", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsGreat partnerships are often forged when each party enjoys a surplus of something the other needs, and there\u2019s little conflict in their ambitions. By that logic, two of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known firms, Apple and Tesla Motors, really need each other right now. An investment in Tesla by Apple in return for some of the carmaker\u2019s innovation dust might be just the ticket.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is revamping the company\u2019s approach to self-driving cars and its broader role in the future of transportation. He just fired some of the company\u2019s autonomous car team, according to The New York Times.At Tesla, the founder, Elon Musk, needs billions of dollars of capital as he ramps up the company toward its target of making 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018. He could also use an injection of corporate credibility as his proposed deal to buy his solar-panel venture SolarCity, also publicly traded, appears to be running into unanticipated headwinds.The idea of Apple acquiring Tesla in its entirety isn\u2019t new. It surfaced even before Mr. Cook poached some of Mr. Musk\u2019s engineers a year ago. That move prompted Mr. Musk to tell a German newspaper: \u201cIf you don\u2019t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.\u201d But it might not require a full purchase to address the strategic challenges of the two companies \u2014 which, arguably, are each becoming most prominent in areas where the other could fairly easily help.Mr. Musk\u2019s hurdles are the most obvious. The entrepreneur who runs the $30-odd billion Tesla is struggling to persuade investors of the merits of his plan for Tesla to acquire SolarCity. The deal, worth $2.6 billion when announced in early August, is supposed to create a \u201cvertically integrated sustainable energy company.\u201d Last week the deal was publicly panned by James S. Chanos, a prominent hedge fund manager. By the math of the all-share deal, its market-implied chances of success have been falling, too. Shares of SolarCity closed on Monday nearly 25 percent below Tesla\u2019s offer price.The acquisition and the potential conflicts it throws up are a distraction for Mr. Musk from Tesla\u2019s carmaking ambitions, not to mention from the task of proving the safety of the company\u2019s Autopilot feature after a fatal crash in May. Even if investors decide to back him in buying SolarCity, any slippage in either company\u2019s plan could hurt its ability to hit up investors for additional funding. Both need regular cash injections \u2014 over $2 billion each last year \u2014 to fund operating and capital investment outflows.Apple could easily address Tesla\u2019s capital problem by buying, say, a 20 percent stake. While dilutive to existing owners \u2014 including Mr. Musk, who owns about 21 percent \u2014 that would bring in nearly $8 billion at $215 a share, just under a 5 percent premium to Monday\u2019s market closing price.For Apple, with more than $230 billion of idle cash, the investment would be close to a rounding error. Its shareholders would probably rejoice at converting a sliver of money in the bank for a placeholder in an emerging leader in self-driving cars. Unlike a full purchase, buying a minority stake will not dilute Apple\u2019s profitability, either. The company has projected gross margins of around 38 percent in its next fiscal quarter.Now, what could Tesla do for Apple? With a market capitalization north of $600 billion, Mr. Cook\u2019s business is doing fine at the moment. Shares of the company have gained some 5 percent since the iPhone 7 was unveiled earlier this month. Pre-orders for the new handset have been robust despite reviews that largely called it an incremental advance on its predecessor. Features like wireless earbuds are novel, but hardly game-changing.Many analysts, investors and observers want Apple to develop more new products. Its last big product introduction, of watches, was a relative dud. Since the devices went on sale in April 2015, Apple\u2019s shares have fallen 8 percent, and investors fret that the company has been running short of new ideas. At the same time, shares of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, have rallied by nearly 50 percent.One area in which Alphabet appears to be further ahead is self-driving vehicles. Apple doesn\u2019t talk publicly about its plans in the car business, but earlier this month it fired dozens of staff members and closed parts of its so-called Titan project, focused on autonomous cars.Ideas are something Mr. Musk has in abundance. In addition to running Tesla and creating SolarCity, he\u2019s trying to make a going concern of space travel and freight through Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. In his spare time, he also hatched the Hyperloop, an idea to use air pressure to speed human beings through tubes at extraordinary speeds.In that respect, he resembles Steven P. Jobs. Even when Apple was in its relative infancy in 1986, its co-founder bankrolled the creation of Pixar, the animation studio. For two decades, that side project put him in conflict with some of the media companies whose content would become a key attraction for iPhone users. In 2006, a year before introducing the handset that changed the world, Mr. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney for $7.4 billion in stock; Disney put him on its board.With competition no longer an issue, Mr. Jobs became a consigliere to Disney\u2019s boss, Robert A. Iger, who told Fortune after the Apple founder died: \u201cWe would stand in front of a whiteboard and talk about ideas. And every once in a while he\u2019d come to me thinking the sky\u2019s falling apart and that our business was screwed. And I\u2019d say, \u2018Tell me how.\u2019\u201dThat sort of relationship would probably be hard to develop between a chief executive and a subordinate \u2014 one argument against Apple swallowing Tesla whole. But as a collaboration, with shared goals and running businesses that work together rather than competing for talent and customers, a functional Cook-Musk partnership might serve both companies\u2019 shareholders.As part of the deal, Apple could fold its wobbly car operations into a joint venture with Tesla, add a couple of directors to Tesla\u2019s board \u2014 helping to handle deals with the likes of SolarCity \u2014 and bring Mr. Musk onto its own. Of course, the two executives would have to be capable of playing nice. Mr. Musk might have to walk back his crack last year that Apple was the \u201cTesla graveyard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $150 Million Stairway to Nowhere on the Far West Side", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the look of the renderings officially unveiled on Wednesday morning, New York\u2019s next significant landmark may be the city\u2019s biggest Rorschach test, too.But Stephen M. Ross, the billionaire founder and chairman of Related Companies, which is developing Hudson Yards with Oxford Properties Group, has his own nickname for \u201cVessel\u201d: \u201cthe social climber.\u201d And the steep price tag Mr. Ross\u2019s privately held company is paying for Mr. Heatherwick\u2019s installation? More than $150 million.The back story of the stair-filled \u201cVessel\u201d involves two men who are in step in more ways than one: a designer known for dreaming big, and a deep-pocketed developer who will spend whatever it takes to make a statement.Currently under construction in Monfalcone, Italy, the bronzed-steel and concrete pieces that make up \u201cVessel\u201d are not to be assembled on site until next year, but on Wednesday, Related Companies rolled out the design with a Hudson Yards spectacle hosted by Anderson Cooper, with a performance by the Alvin Ailey dance troupe on a set that mimicked the multiple stairways inside \u201cVessel.\u201d The crowd of hundreds included Mayor Bill de Blasio.\u201cWe know \u2018Vessel\u2019 will be debated and discussed and looked at from every angle, and Thomas,\u201d the mayor added, addressing the architect, \u201cif you meet 100 New Yorkers, you will find 100 different opinions on the beautiful work you\u2019ve created. Do not be dismayed.\u201dOn a visit to New York this summer, Mr. Heatherwick, founder of the Heatherwick Studio in London, was eager to explain his design.\u201cWe had to think of what could act as the role of a landmarker,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething that could help give character and particularity to the space.\u201dThe design reflects Mr. Heatherwick\u2019s belief that city natives are always looking for their next workout. \u201cNew Yorkers have a fitness thing,\u201d he said. (It will test many city folk who can barely climb into their Ubers, but there will be an elevator for anyone unable to reach the top.)But Ms. Freedman had her reservations. \u201cThe bigger problem may be traffic control,\u201d she said, given that the work will be near the already crowded High Line, the tourist attraction whose northernmost segment winds around Hudson Yards. \u201cI think people will want to experience it.\u201dDespite the name \u201cPublic Square,\u201d Hudson Yards is a private development, and \u201cVessel\u201d was commissioned and approved by a committee of one: Mr. Ross, who has kept the design models in a locked cabinet in the Related offices \u2014 when not allowing brief peeks to lure commercial tenants. \u201cI have the only key,\u201d he said with a smile.When Mr. Ross began the process of finding a piece several years ago, he first turned to five artists who are known for working in public plazas \u2014 and whom he declined to name \u2014 and asked them for detailed proposals. One of the unbuilt plans cost him $500,000, he said, and another $250,000.But he was unsatisfied. \u201cBeen there, seen that,\u201d Mr. Ross said of his reaction.A Related colleague suggested Mr. Heatherwick, who had come in previously for a meeting at the company to discuss a future pavilion on the site.Mr. Heatherwick and Mr. Ross talked, and six weeks later, the designer sent a proposal. \u201cI looked at it and said, \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cIt had everything I wanted.\u201d That was in 2013.\u201cEverybody here thought I was nuts,\u201d Mr. Ross said of his colleagues\u2019 reactions.The idea of \u201cVessel\u201d as an exclamation point toward the northern end of the High Line is part of Mr. Ross\u2019s grand plan to make Hudson Yards the center of New York, despite its hard-to-reach location.\u201cThe most important place in New York is Rockefeller Center during Christmas time,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cI wanted to have a 12-month Christmas tree.\u201dOne of Mr. Heatherwick\u2019s main goals for the piece is to raise people significantly above ground level so they can see the city \u2014 and one another \u2014 in a new way.\u201cThe power of the High Line is the changed perspective on the world,\u201d Mr. Heatherwick said.The interactive feature of \u201cVessel\u201d was partly a reaction to what Mr. Heatherwick sees as previous failures in public projects: Plop art. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten used to these 1960s, 1970s plazas with obligatory big artworks plunked down,\u201d he said.\u201cVessel\u201d is only 50 feet in diameter at its base, rising to 150 feet at the top, meaning that it has a \u201csmall bum,\u201d Mr. Heatherwick said, and does not take over the plaza\u2019s ground level.The cost of the piece has ballooned from the original estimate, $75 million, Mr. Ross said. Mr. Heatherwick noted that the process of making the steel pieces was unusually complex. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an unlimited budget, but no corners have been cut,\u201d Mr. Heatherwick said, adding that \u201cVessel\u201d was sturdy enough to \u201ctake Hurricane Sandys.\u201dThe price does not appear to trouble his patron.For Mr. Heatherwick, \u201cVessel\u201d represents his firm\u2019s focus on doing innovative work for the public to enjoy. \u201cI\u2019m doing this project because it\u2019s free, and for all New Yorkers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just itching to see a thousand people on it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now let\u2019s talk about the ever-growing presence of video in our lives.As Katie Benner and Sapna Maheshwari write over two stories, short videos primarily made for viewing on mobile devices are reshaping both internet companies and much of the advertising industry.One major insight: The company seems aware of the ways that looking at things on phones change what and how people watch stuff. The platform calls for short, fast videos, and a lot of novelty in the mix.That is one reason Snapchat, which is renaming itself Snap Inc., is starting to make cool-looking glasses capable of shooting videos 10 seconds long. That short duration, along with Snap\u2019s branding itself as a place of fun ephemera, may help these glasses get past the objections Google faced with Glass, its camera for your face.Snap is a business, and it wants to sell ads to run with pretty much anything people are looking at. So do Facebook and its photo-sharing subsidiary, Instagram. Ultimately all of them, along with companies like Google\u2019s YouTube, want to draw away some of the billions of dollars now spent on television ads.But there\u2019s already trouble in that paradise.That situation worsened last week, they wrote, when Facebook said that for several years it has misstated, in a way favorable to Facebook, how much time people actually spend watching these videos.A setback, for sure, but the past is not returning, and mobile video is an increasing reality in much of our lives.

Hallelujah. Come next week, we\u2019ll be reveling in the flood of new fall shows, but for now, we\u2019ve got a three-day weekend to enjoy.Have a beautiful weekend.\u201cHigh Maintenance,\u201d now on all HBO streaming platformsWatch if you like short-story anthologies and perceptive but not cruel satire.The series stars the co-creator Ben Sinclair as \u201cthe guy,\u201d a bike-riding weed dealer who in each episode visits a different client or clients. The stories are very loosely interwoven, with some characters popping up in a few episodes, though if you miss the connections, you\u2019re not really poorer for it \u2014 it\u2019s more of a bonus.Though \u201cHigh\u201d has pot smoking as a central plot point, the show isn\u2019t at all stoner humor. It\u2019s a sometimes-wry, sometimes-poignant look at urban loneliness, and the character-building accomplished in these webisodes in just a few minutes puts plenty of feature films to shame. I have cried at episodes of \u201cHigh Maintenance.\u201d The pieces all work as stand-alones, so there\u2019s no bad place to start, although the emotional resonance works best when you watch several in a row.Watch if you like single-camera family comedies with a brain.Some people blame the cancellation of \u201cTrophy Wife\u201d on its misleading title. I prefer to blame it on the widespread global issue of people not behaving as I know they should.The 2013 ABC comedy stars Malin Akerman as the fun-loving new wife to a guy (Bradley Whitford) with three kids and two ex-wives (Marcia Gay Harden and Michaela Watkins). But the show isn\u2019t about wicked stepmothers or evil teens \u2014 everyone mostly gets along.\u201cTrophy\u201d takes a little while to find its footing, but even the sorta-lesser early episodes have plenty of appeal. If you have ever enjoyed an episode of \u201cModern Family,\u201d try \u201cTrophy Wife.\u201d If nothing else, the show gave us the wonderful Bert (Albert Tsai, now on \u201cDr. Ken\u201d), and his description of his greatest dance move, Bert-wheels: \u201cThey\u2019re like cartwheels, but with screaming.\u201dWatch if you liked previous seasons, or love France.\u201cChef\u2019s Table\u201d continues to be canonization in documentary\u2019s clothing, and the new batch of four episodes are about chefs in France \u2014 libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, hagiography.This isn\u2019t a complaint, though: I love that \u201cChef\u2019s Table\u201d goes as hard as possible on its mission to depict food and cooking as the apex of personal artistry and sensory pleasure. Sure, sometimes it\u2019s hard not to roll one\u2019s eyes a bit \u2014 we\u2019re saut\u00e9ing mushrooms here, not working in the coal mines \u2014 but every time there\u2019s a shot of someone methodically cutting through a big, pink hunk of fish, I swear my fingers genuinely, physically tingle with jealousy as I imagine how satisfying it must feel to be that good at slicing something that expensive.My wife and I are looking for a show to watch after we finish \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d or some similarly bleak drama. Something so I don\u2019t have nightmares, but hopefully, something I haven\u2019t seen before and I can get invested in.My wife and I tend to lose motivation with shows with primarily stand-alone episodes (like \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d) and need a through narrative thread to keep us going. Ideally this show is not longer than 45 minutes (although 30 would be better). We just finished \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d which filled this slot well. We\u2019re looking for something a little out of left field \u2026 \u2014 KevinIf you generally skip over teen shows, you\u2019ve been missing out. Expand your horizons! If you avoided \u201cThe O.C.\u201d or \u201cGossip Girl\u201d when they were on, this is the ideal circumstance in which to watch them. Neither needs to be watched all the way through, but the first seasons of each are magical. Both shows are chitter-chatter delights, and there\u2019s enough plot and story to keep you hooked but no lingering psychological baggage. \u201cMy Mad Fat Diary,\u201d a British teen import about a recently suicidal teen girl, is thoughtful and hilarious, and a more earnest follow-up to \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend.\u201dBut if you want a more traditional show for and about adults, try \u201cSensitive Skin.\u201dFinally, there are Ewan McGregor\u2019s motorcycle-trip documentary series \u201cLong Way Round\u201d (2004) and \u201cLong Way Down\u201d (2007). In each, McGregor and his BFF take a motorcycle trip around the world, first the \u201clong way [a]round\u201d from England to New York City, then from Scotland to South Africa. The paperwork alone is enough to keep me couch-bound, but these two seasons are equal parts charm, adventure and the worldview that most people are mostly good most of the time. Plus, unlike \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d no extended foot-lotioning sequences. That is the true palate cleanser.Roy (Michael Shannon) and his friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) kidnap Roy\u2019s son Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) from a religious cult and go on the run. Alton is able to do things that no other human can, and both the government and the cult want to use him for their own ends.Advertisement"}

If the car works as advertised, someday neither I nor anybody else will sit in the driver\u2019s seat of a car again.During my ride, most of which I spent as a passenger in Boron 6\u2019s back seat, my safety engineer proved his worth. At various moments, he had to take over the wheel and turn through intersections where locals are known to speed. When a truck driver backed out into the road illegally, he put his foot on the brake, immediately taking control of the car.If the safety engineer felt unsafe, he could at any time smack down a big red button in the center console \u2014 suspiciously similar to a seat ejector switch from a James Bond film \u2014 to disengage from self-driving mode. To turn the self-driving feature back on, he need only press a sleek steel button next to an embossed nameplate stamped on the console.If I felt unsafe as a passenger, I could also request that the driver take over the vehicle, or press a button on a screen facing the back seat that would end the ride. I also monitored the infrared environment the car had rendered from the screen, a 3-D world updating in real time, and took a selfie from a camera built into the console. After the ride, Uber texts to passengers an animated GIF of the 3-D modeled route taken, along with the selfie.But for most of the ride, I felt safe. In self-driving mode, turns and stops were near seamless, and I often had to check in with my driver to see whether he or the computer was steering the car. I did grow a bit nervous a few times when watching how close the computer drove us to cars parked on the right side of a street. Though, admittedly, that could have been my mind playing tricks on me by being more vigilant than usual about my surroundings.Raffi Krikorian, engineering director of Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center, located in the city\u2019s industrial Strip District, put it this way: \u201cPittsburgh is the double-black diamond of driving.\u201dThe challenge expressed in Mr. Krikorian\u2019s ski analogy is one that Uber has taken to heart. From the company\u2019s point of view, the self-driving vehicle operates more safely than any human driver.My driverless Uber stopped far behind cars in front of us at intersections. It stayed exactly at the speed limit \u2014 25 miles per hour where we drove \u2014 even when there was no traffic around. At one stoplight, the car waited for the green signal before turning right. The human drivers behind us were not pleased.As my ride in Boron 6 wound down \u2014 in total, I traveled roughly 20 miles in the vehicle \u2014 it was hard not to feel like a celebrity, or perhaps more like a Martian. Other motorists gawked, and a boy on a Razor scooter gaped at me from a corner, waving to his mother to come look.But how they will get rich from it remains unclear. Much of Uber\u2019s success has been based on the premise that people could share their idle cars with the public by driving during their spare time. A self-driving car obviates the need for human drivers, a clear source of tension among Uber drivers today. Company executives said self-driving cars would be only one part of Uber\u2019s business in the future, with a mix of drivers and autonomous vehicles.All of these companies face an uncertain regulatory environment for driverless vehicles that could impede the rollouts of the cars across the country.There will be delays and bugs, such as the one I encountered my first time behind the wheel when the self-driving car didn\u2019t drive itself. That\u2019s the whole point of the pilot test. The wealth of sensors and recording equipment will see what happens \u2014 warts and all \u2014 \u201cso we can learn more about what makes drivers and riders comfortable and safe,\u201d said Emily Duff Bartel, a product manager at the Advanced Technologies Center.For me, it took about 10 minutes of troubleshooting to work through the glitches, but Boron 6 eventually turned on and started driving itself. That is, after a little bit of human intervention.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when the Chinese government television news channel reported that a driver of a Tesla with autonomous features had been killed in a crash. It was reported on Wednesday, not Tuesday.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goodbye, Ivory Tower. Hello, Silicon Valley Candy Store.", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor eight years, Peter Coles had an economist\u2019s dream job at Harvard Business School.His research focused on the design of efficient markets, an important and growing field that has influenced such things as Treasury bill auctions and decisions on who receives organ transplants. He even got to work with Alvin E. Roth, who won a Nobel in economic science in 2012.But prestige was not enough to keep Mr. Coles at Harvard. In 2013, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. He now works at Airbnb, the online lodging marketplace, one of a number of tech companies luring economists with the promise of big sets of data and big salaries.Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute candy store for economists,\u201d Mr. Coles said.The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for a Ph.D. economist will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more.Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends \u2014 topics like recessions and currency exchange rates \u2014 and help their employers deal with them.But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they are studying the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging.Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft and up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of improved efficiency means more profit.At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic research scientist, is finely measuring the effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in economic behavior: What consumer actions occur coincidentally after people see ads, and what actions are most likely caused by the ads?At Airbnb, Mr. Coles is researching the company\u2019s marketplace of hosts and guests for insights, both to help build the business and to understand behavior. One study focuses on procrastination \u2014 a subject of great interest to behavioral economists \u2014 by looking at bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or months in advance? Do booking habits change by age, gender or country of origin?\u201cThey are microeconomic experts, heavy on data and computing tools like machine learning and writing algorithms,\u201d said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics.Understanding how digital markets work is getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian, Google\u2019s chief economist. But, he said, \u201cI thought it was fascinating years ago.\u201dMr. Varian, 69, is the godfather of the tech industry\u2019s in-house economists. Once a well-known professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Varian showed up at Google in 2002, part time at first, but soon became an employee. He helped refine Google\u2019s AdWords marketplace, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown on search pages, based on the words users type into Google\u2019s search engine.Google\u2019s insight was to avoid giving the best ad placement to the highest bidder. Mr. Varian worked to develop a different model for ad placement, calculating the probability that a user will click on an ad and find the ad relevant. It was a classic example of smart market design.Seeing this emerging job market, the National Association for Business Economics held its first meeting for technology company economists in April in San Francisco. Another is set for October in Silicon Valley.Academia is also starting to take notice \u2014 and adapt. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast, it\u2019s hard to keep up,\u201d said Susan Athey, an expert in the economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who is also a consultant to Microsoft.Many economics students also take computer science courses, and some major in both. But a new course this fall at Yale, called Designing the Digital Economy, seeks to blend economics and computer science in the way digital economists do at tech companies. The instructor is Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, and the course will have guest lecturers from Amazon, Pandora and Uber.The course is a pilot for curriculum change and perhaps a joint degree program focused on digital markets and their design. Dirk Bergemann, chairman of the Yale economics department, explained that economics was concerned with efficiency, prices and incentives, while computer science focused on algorithms and complexity.\u201cIn digital marketplaces, you are trying to address both sets of problems,\u201d he said.Mr. Weyl predicts that the rise of digital marketplaces in the economy is just getting underway. Uber in ride-hailing and Airbnb in room-renting, he said, may well be just the start of a redefinition of private property, made possible by digital technology.Things, according to Mr. Weyl, will increasingly be rented as services instead of owned. That is the long-term vision of driverless cars: When a vehicle just shows up on command, far fewer cars will sit in driveways. Transportation efficiency, resource consumption and industries will all be transformed, he said.The same could be true for household goods, Mr. Weyl said. One possible situation: After you use your espresso machine for breakfast, a drone comes to pick it up, and you rent it out for the day.A current market-design challenge for Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud computing services. These digital services, for example, face a peak-load problem, much as electric utilities do.How do you sell service at times when there is a risk some customers may be bumped off? Run an auction for what customers are willing to pay for interruptible service? Or offer set discounts for different levels of risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working on that now.To answer such questions, economists work in teams with computer scientists and people in business. In tech companies, market design involves not only economics but also engineering and marketing. How hard is a certain approach technically? How easy is it to explain to customers?\u201cEconomics influences rather than determines decisions,\u201d said Preston McAfee, Microsoft\u2019s chief economist, who previously worked at Google and Yahoo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Designing a Custom-Made Creative Family", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe designer Arthur Arbesser in his home studio in Milan.MILAN \u2014 The Milanese midcentury Luigi Caccia Dominioni building, nestled in a quiet residential neighborhood that is traditionally home to the Milano Bene, the wealthy, conservative members of society, may bear little physical resemblance to Andy Warhol\u2019s silver-painted Manhattan loft that came to be known as the Factory.But the Italian fashion designer Arthur Arbesser has created in this space, leased from a friend and shared with the Finnish photographer Henrik Blomqvist, a kind of 21st century version of the Factory, where its members work, play and create together.\u201cThis is a city dominated by its longstanding fashion families, but I\u2019ve created an alternative family,\u201d Mr. Arbesser said.In an increasingly fluid fashion world, it may well be a template for the future of Italian design. \u201cA five-minute telephone call with someone that intellectually stimulates you is far better than a Google search,\u201d said Marco de Vincenzo, Mr. Arbesser\u2019s friend and a fellow designer.Although the radical Italian design groups of the 1950s and \u201960s, like Superstudio and Archizoom \u2014 and later, Memphis \u2014 have been well documented, the idea of such collective fashion endeavors is relatively new to Milan. It makes Mr. Arbesser, wrote Franca Sozzani, the editor of Italian Vogue, in an email, a \u201cnew group aggregator.\u201dAs to that group \u2014 well, they were all there at his apartment for drinks one balmy Sunday evening this month.Mariuccia Casadio, an actual Warhol Factory alum, writer and contemporary art curator, arrived in an Arbesser knit with an arrow motif and a lilac-tinged coiffure. The Russian model Nastya Shershen, one of the designer\u2019s many muses, came wearing track shorts and toting her one-month-old daughter, Chloe.Dorian Stefano Tarantini, a suave punk nightclub impresario who is now the designer known as Dorian Gray, was in black leather. He runs his own high-end streetwear label, Malibu 1992, and composes the Arbesser show music. He was alongside Ilenia Corti, a softly spoken, raven-haired jewelry designer with a whimsical line called Vernissage, holding court on Mr. Arbesser\u2019s newly purchased Superstudio Sofo sofa.Ms. Corti has designed a jewelry collection for Mr. Arbesser that will be shown during his runway presentation on Sunday. And, \u201cshe\u2019s also very present in the Milanese night scene,\u201d Mr. Arbesser whispered.Nearby was Fabio Cherstich, the director who was in the midst of a production called \u201cFigaro! Opera Camion,\u201d to be performed from the back of a truck in Palermo, Sicily. Mr. Arbesser said he was an opera nerd when he was growing up in Vienna: \u201cI would buy a standing ticket for, like, 20 shillings and stand for three hours to guard my position.\u201dAnd there was Selva Barni, a sleek brunette, who curated an exhibition at the Palazzo Reale, \u201cHo Visto Un Re\u201d (\u201cThe King and I\u201d), that features Mr. Arbesser\u2019s work.Converted into a vast exhibition hall, the space includes a walkway more than 260 feet long that will be the museum\u2019s new entrance \u2014 and on Sunday, would be Mr. Arbesser\u2019s runway.\u201cIt\u2019s a little scary,\u201d Mr. Arbesser said back in his home. \u201cI look at the size of it and I think maybe I\u2019m better off showing in a disused garage as a small brand. I mean, Gucci could show there.\u201dMr. Cipelletti, who persuaded the museum\u2019s director to reject bids from larger fashion houses, ensuring that Mr. Arbesser got the space, dismissed his friend\u2019s concerns. \u201cArthur\u2019s work fits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the same visual conversation, appreciate the same brutalist lines and layers of time. He\u2019s not going to cover it up and transform it into something else.\u201d\u201cLuca is the ultimate perfectionist,\u201d responded Mr. Arbesser, later saying that there were times when the architect had pushed him to achieve a level of perfection he felt unable to achieve. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m just like, \u2018Give me a break.\u2019 \u201dAt 34, Mr. Arbesser is still considered a young designer in the industry. He moved to Milan after graduating from Central Saint Martins in London, and began his career with a seven-year stint designing women\u2019s wear at Armani before striking out on his own in 2013.His clean designs \u2014 uniform-inspired tailoring, geometric knitwear and quirky prints \u2014 may appear serendipitous and offhand, but he painstakingly mines his inspirations for content. Or so noted his friend, the critic Marco Sammicheli, while lounging on a dining chair. \u201cProgress depends on crossing borders and exiting one\u2019s comfort zone,\u201d he said.Like, for example, going to the weekend place in Portofino that Mr. Cipelletti shares with Paola Clerico. (Her well-heeled appearance belies her somewhat subversive curatorial practice, which focuses on site-specific installations such as \u201cCase Chiuse,\u201d an Italian metaphor for brothel that literally translates as \u201cclosed house,\u201d an initiative that exhibits artworks in private spaces.) But their house was in \u201cthe other Portofino\u201d \u2014 far from the hype, a steep wooded hill above the perfectly coiffured bay below, where they often flee to regroup and brainstorm future projects.\u201cYou\u2019re alone with wild boars up there,\u201d Mr. Arbesser said. \u201cThe last time we stayed there, a very charming lady dressed in cargo pants and a T-shirt turned up. It was only after she left we found out it was the Duchess of Westminster [Natalia Grosvenor].\u201dMr. Arbesser admits that he finds the worlds of design and architecture easier to navigate than the fashion crowd. \u201cThey tend to be more humble, more open,\u201d he said. The exception to both is Mr. Arbesser\u2019s partner of 10 and half years, Fabio Giglio, whom he met dancing at a club during the Salone del Mobile in Milan, and who bears a startling resemblance to the character Kramer in \u201cSeinfeld.\u201dHe\u2019s a doctor who specializes in bone marrow transplants at a university hospital in the city, Mr. Arbesser said, but also \u201che\u2019s very good at public relations.\u201d Hence Mr. Giglio\u2019s self-appointed role as dispenser of prosecco and cashews before dinner.\u201cI think he enjoys the change of scenery now and again,\u201d Mr. Arbesser said. Especially because, fodder for creativity though it may be, not a single frame of the evening ends up on Instagram.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Hacking at Yahoo Means for Verizon", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the kind of phone call no chief executive wants to make \u2014 or receive \u2014 in the middle of a multibillion-dollar deal.But Ms. Mayer had some unexpected bad news. She caught up with Mr. McAdam and Marni Walden, a rising star at Verizon who is expected to oversee the Yahoo business after the deal is complete, by phone, according to people briefed on the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Yahoo recently discovered that at least 500 million of its user accounts had been breached by hackers two years ago, well before the two companies began talks. Yahoo and law enforcement officials were scrambling to unwind the intrusion.After calling Mr. McAdam and Ms. Walden, Ms. Mayer phoned Tim Armstrong, who leads the AOL business at Verizon and will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo, according to the people briefed on the conversation. Again, the news was not good.The calls set off a flurry of questions at Verizon \u2014 How could this possibly have happened? Who was behind it? Why is it only becoming known now? Could this jeopardize the deal? \u2014 but also the sounding of an alarm and the deployment of a triage team to assist Yahoo.The telecom giant directed its online security experts, including Chandra McMahon, Verizon\u2019s chief information security officer, to do their own investigation of the hack. And they enlisted the help of Verizon\u2019s security division, part of its enterprise solutions business, which helps companies defend against and manage hacks.Now, just a few days after Verizon learned of the breach, it is contending with the ramifications of what is believed to be the largest hack of a single company. Even as Verizon tries to assess the damage at Yahoo and prevent further security intrusions, the scope of the hack and the potential fallout \u2014 including the possibility of a costly class-action lawsuit \u2014 are inevitably prompting renewed scrutiny of a deal that was intended to transform the telecom behemoth into a digital media powerhouse.Simple tips to follow if you think your personal information online has been exposed to hackers.For now, Verizon has given no indication of whether the breach will affect its plans to acquire Yahoo. On Friday, the company declined to provide a comment beyond a statement it issued on Thursday, in which it said it would evaluate the situation \u201cas the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities.\u201dOn Friday, Yahoo said, \u201cOur investigation into this matter is ongoing and the issues are complex.\u201dThe effort is complicated because the sales proceedings between Verizon and Yahoo are at an early stage. Though teams from the two companies were already working together on integration plans, Verizon does not yet own Yahoo. As a result, Verizon does not have direct access to the Silicon Valley company\u2019s servers to conduct its own investigation.In late July, after the Verizon deal was announced, Yahoo became aware of a claim that about 280 million of its user credentials had been hacked, according to a person briefed on the specifics, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Yahoo started an investigation but could not substantiate the claim, this person said. It was not clear on Friday whether Yahoo had made Verizon aware that it was looking into this claim in July.During the course of that investigation, Yahoo learned of the more severe breach, which it has said it believes was state-sponsored. Yahoo has not yet said exactly when it realized how large the intrusion was, leaving open the question of whether Ms. Mayer and her team waited to notify Verizon of the hack. Yahoo is now working with outside security consultants and said its investigation was continuing.Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College Law School, said Verizon had two main options if it decided to use the hack as leverage in setting the terms of the deal.\u201cThey could say, \u2018This thing is huge. We want to walk away from the transaction,\u2019\u201d he said. Were Verizon to try to claim that the breach was so severe it was grounds to terminate the deal, it would have to prove that the hack amounted to a material adverse effect on the value of Yahoo.Such claims can be difficult to prove in court. According to Mr. Quinn\u2019s reading of the merger document for the deal, Verizon would most likely have to prove that certain high-level Yahoo employees were aware of the severity of the hack before the deal was agreed upon, and intentionally withheld that information.More likely, Mr. Quinn said, Verizon could pressure Yahoo to renegotiate the terms of the deal.\u201cThey go to court, or threaten to go to court, and renegotiate the price,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can be a very winning strategy.\u201dFind out which parts of your identity may have been stolen in major hacking attacks over the last four years.Like any big company contemplating an acquisition, Verizon performed due diligence on Yahoo before it agreed to the deal. It was not immediately clear, however, how seriously it took security issues during that process.But Verizon would have known that Yahoo has a history of breaches. In 2012, Yahoo said that more than 450,000 user accounts had been hacked.\u201cWith this concerted action and a series of high-profile strikes on businesses including eBay, Target and Yahoo, the risks of cyberattack are evident,\u201d they wrote.\u201cYet as the global economy recovers and deal activity rises,\u201d the report continues, \u201cincreasing awareness of cyber-risk has not resulted in meaningful changes\u201d to the mergers and acquisition process.Those motivations are unlikely to have changed in the course of two months. But it remains unclear whether this new information has made Yahoo a less desirable acquisition target.Some of Verizon\u2019s executives have indicated they may be up to the challenge of a big hack. In a recent talk at Penn State University, Ms. McMahon, the telecom company\u2019s chief information security officer, suggested that she relished the cat-and-mouse game between hackers and companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Conscience of the Contrarian Voter", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI met Gary Johnson, the somewhat-surging Libertarian Party candidate for president, years ago in one of those beautiful Western settings full of mostly awful people at the time \u2014 that is, lobbyists and various sycophants who attach themselves to any gathering of power.He was then the Republican governor of New Mexico, a rare politician with a glib sense of humor, rolling his eyes as his fellow Western politicians sucked up to bolo-tied suits from the oil industry. We talked mostly about marathons and mountains; he\u2019s run the 26-mile race in under 3 hours, and climbed the apex of the planet, Mount Everest, as well.I liked him instantly. And as I\u2019ve followed him since then, my regard for Johnson has grown. Now that he\u2019s running for president, and polling at 15 percent or better in at least 15 states, would I ever vote for him?Not a chance. And this was before he blanked out on national television on Thursday in a question about Syria. Johnson favors many things a thoughtful independent could agree with \u2014 a less interventionist foreign policy, an end to the insanity of the drug war, calling out Donald Trump for his racism. And he favors many bad things: no immediate action to counter climate change, health care cuts to the most vulnerable, repealing Wall Street regulations.A voter of conscience, in a normal year, could go for Johnson and feel O.K. about it. But this year, in a tight election, any vote by an independent or a Democrat for Johnson could burden that citizen with a lifetime of guilt for handing the world over to Trump. His presidency could \u201clead to the end of civilization,\u201d as his own ghostwriter, Tony Schwartz has said.Commendably, Johnson has stopped using pot during his run for the White House. \u201cI want to be completely on my game,\u201d he says. But too often, he offers the stoner shrug when asked what he stands for, saying you should just Google him. When you Google him, you\u2019re likely to find something about pot and Googling him.That\u2019s not a serious campaign. But again, I find Johnson personally refreshing, as he showed with his reaction to the Syria gaffe, saying that his response had removed \u201cany doubt that I\u2019m human.\u201d And I\u2019m assuming that Johnson is taking away slightly more votes from Hillary Clinton than from Trump. But if you\u2019re leaning toward Trump, by all means make the switch to the affable Gary Johnson.Well then, what about Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate? She\u2019s polling in the low single digits, but she still might get more votes than the 2.9 million that Ralph Nader received in 2000. You remember those Nader voters who insisted there was no difference between Al Gore and George W. Bush. The world is a far sadder, far more tragic place, in part because the Naderites helped to tip the balance to a man who, like Trump, is cocksure of only one thing \u2014 his ignorance. Forget about the mess of Florida. In just one state, New Hampshire, the Nader vote was enough to give the presidency to Bush.Stein said she would put Edward Snowden in her cabinet, because, I guess, there would then be no state secrets at all! Her running mate, Ajamu Baraka, has called President Obama an \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d Stein is a protest candidate, recently arrested for protesting. It\u2019s an honorable role, and I wish her well in future protests.I get that a majority of Americans think the current two-party system is failing us. Clinton is not inspiring. Trump is a monster who lies the way some people clear their throat. But if you want failure, give Trump the White House. If the global emergency of climate change is your issue, as it certainly is for many Stein supporters, your Green Party vote may be just enough to ensure that the man who calls climate change a hoax hastens the end of nature as we know it. You may feel good about it; the planet will not.I asked Bill McKibben, who may one day win a Nobel Prize for his decades of alarm-sounding about life-altering changes to Earth, what a progressive drawn to a third-party candidate should do.\u201cMy thinking is that the point of elections is not to find a savior,\u201d said McKibben, who was a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders. What matters is the movement toward change, he said. But this year is different. Trump \u201cis bad in a unique (in American presidential history) way that scares me to the marrow.\u201dAnd that\u2019s the crucial point. Trump should scare anyone with a brain and a heart. Just this week, he showed again how far he would move the United States to the dark side, gushing about his soul mate Vladimir Putin, and dreaming of a plunder force under our flag, stealing oil from the Mideast. In years to come, every American voter will be held to account for what they did in 2016. There\u2019s no free pass.Advertisement"}

Computer Vision Can\u2019t Do It All Yet", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJitendra Malik, a researcher in computer vision for three decades, doesn\u2019t own a Tesla, but he has advice for people who do.\u201cKnowing what I know about computer vision, I wouldn\u2019t take my hands off the steering wheel,\u201d he said.The Tesla accident in May, researchers say, was not a failure of computer vision. But it underscored the limitations of the science in applications like driverless cars despite remarkable progress in recent years, fueled by digital data, computer firepower and software inspired by the human brain.Researchers are training computers to recognize actions and behaviors.Today, computerized sight can quickly and accurately recognize millions of individual faces, identify the makes and models of thousands of cars, and distinguish cats and dogs of every breed in a way no human being could.Yet the recent advances, while impressive, have been mainly in image recognition. The next frontier, researchers agree, is general visual knowledge \u2014 the development of algorithms that can understand not just objects, but also actions and behaviors.Computing intelligence often seems to mimic human intelligence, so computer science understandably invites analogy. In computer vision, researchers offer two analogies to describe the promising paths ahead: a child and the brain.The model borrowed from childhood, many researchers say, involves developing algorithms that learn as a child does, with some supervision but mostly on its own, without relying on vast amounts of hand-labeled training data, which is the current approach. \u201cIt\u2019s early days,\u201d Dr. Malik said, \u201cbut it\u2019s how we get to the next level.\u201dIn computing, the brain has served mainly as an inspirational metaphor rather than an actual road map. Airplanes don\u2019t flap their wings, artificial intelligence experts often say. Machines do it differently than biological systems.If successful, the outcome could be a breakthrough in computer vision and machine learning in general, Dr. Poggio said. \u201cTo do that,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need neuroscience not just as an inspiration, but as a strong light.\u201dThe big gains in computer vision owe much to all the web\u2019s raw material: countless millions of online photos used to train the software algorithms to identify images. But collecting and tagging that training data have been a formidable undertaking.ImageNet, a collaborative effort led by researchers at Stanford and Princeton, is one of the most ambitious projects. Initially, nearly one billion images were downloaded. Those were sorted, labeled and winnowed to more than 14 million images in 22,000 categories. The database, for example, includes more than 62,000 images of cats.Vast image databases like ImageNet have been employed to train software that uses neuron-like nodes, known as neural networks. The concept of computing neural networks stretches back more than three decades, but has become a powerful tool only in recent years. \u201cThe available data and computational capability finally caught up to these ideas of the past,\u201d said Trevor Darrell, a computer vision expert at the University of California, Berkeley.Just how far neural networks can advance computer vision is uncertain. They emulate the brain only in general terms \u2014 the software nodes receive digital input and send output to other nodes. Layers upon layers of these nodes make up so-called convolutional neural networks, which, with sufficient training data, have become better and better at identifying images.Or take a fluid scene like a dinner party. A person carrying a platter will serve food. A woman raising a fork will stab the lettuce on her plate and put it in her mouth. A water glass teetering on the edge of the table is about to fall, spilling its contents. Predicting what happens next and understanding the physics of everyday life are inherent in human visual intelligence, but beyond the reach of current deep learning technology.Recognizing situations enriches computer vision, but the ImSitu project still depends on human-labeled data to train its machine learning algorithms. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still very, very far from visual intelligence, understanding scenes and actions the way humans do,\u201d Dr. Farhadi said.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but the pace of improvement is getting us there,\u201d said Gary Bradski, a computer vision scientist who has worked on self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait years and years until some semblance of intelligence arrives, before we have self-driving cars that are safer than human drivers and save thousands of lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is New York Ready for Solar Power?", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySolar power in New York City may finally be having its moment.The upfront cost for installing solar panels on a single-family house runs between $20,000 and $50,000, but federal, state and city incentives and tax credits can cut that cost in half, said David Sandbank, the director of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority\u2019s NY-Sun initiative, and homeowners say that once solar panels are up and running, monthly energy bills can fall by as much as 85 percent.Most of the city\u2019s existing solar projects are on single-family houses on Staten Island, but townhouse owners in Brooklyn are getting on board, and owners of apartment buildings in the Bronx and Queens are also starting to consider ways to harness the sun\u2019s power.\u201cSolar was a niche market in New York in 2009,\u201d Mr. Sandbank said. \u201cNow you have major commitments from government officials that have made solar more affordable.\u201dAnn Schaetzel, 70, a filmmaker, and Richard Barber, 63, a TV producer and editor, recently converted their two-family home in Gowanus, Brooklyn, to solar power, after being inspired by a neighbor who installed solar photovoltaic panels on his roof a few years ago. \u201cI never thought I could afford it,\u201d Ms. Schaetzel said.Ms. Schaetzel purchased a 4.25 kilowatt solar system, which was up and running in March, with 14 solar panels perched on her rooftop. The average system for a home in New York City is about 6.5 kilowatts. The installers determined the optimal size for Ms. Schaetzel\u2019s home based on her monthly bills.Ms. Schaetzel\u2019s electricity bill in August was $36.10 for a service connection charge to Con Edison, a fraction of the $250.19 bill she paid in August 2015. The connection to Con Edison is required since owners must use the utility\u2019s grid to push back any excess power their solar system produces, and also to have access to electricity if, say, there\u2019s a run of bad weather.Solar panels occasionally short circuit and need replacing. Most solar panels come with a 25-year manufacturer\u2019s warranty but generally require little maintenance. Ms. Schaetzel said her 14-panel system cost $27,225, which was cut to $6,925 after incentives, credits and rebates.It took Ms. Schaetzel about two years from her first meeting to get her solar system connected, but policy changes have trimmed that time frame to about a year, said Christopher Neidl, the director of the Here Comes Solar program at Solar One.Tria Case, the director of sustainability at the City University of New York, said that coordination between government entities, utilities and installers has been \u201cstreamlined so it would be easier for folks to enter the solar process.\u201dMrs. Tornquist said that Samara Levine, the firm\u2019s managing director, helped demystify what can be a complicated topic. Ms. Levine explained the billing system, known as net metering, through which homeowners can be credited for any excess energy they feed back to the electric grid.Mrs. Tornquist said it was important to understand her new meter, which counts backward if more energy is produced by the solar panels than is used in the house.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that our meter runs backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if I see the meter start to run forward, I start turning off our lights.\u201dThe 40 panels on the roof cost the couple about $53,000, and they paid about $5,000 upfront. They received $11,200 back, thanks to federal, state and city incentives and tax credits. The couple decided to take out two loans to pay off the rest of the bill. One loan is from the state energy authority and is paid at the same time as their monthly Con Ed bill, totaling less than $200 per month.Mrs. Tornquist said the electricity bill averaged about $320 per month before they went solar. After the system was installed in May 2015, the bills dropped to $18 a month during the summer and about $50 a month during the winter.Solar power first took off in Staten Island, Long Island and Westchester County, largely because many residents own houses with large pitched roofs that face south, optimal conditions for generating the most kilowatts. It hasn\u2019t been as easy for homeowners in more built-up areas. Shade from neighboring buildings is the most limiting factor, and many solar installers are not interested in setting up systems on small flat roofs, according to Mr. Neidl.\u201cThe large national installers would see a small roof on Google Maps and they would say: small system, big hassle, no thank you,\u201d he said.The New York City Fire Department requires a clear path of six feet from the perimeter of the roof, as well as from all doors, skylights and hatches, so firefighters have enough room for themselves and their equipment. That limits the amount of usable space on a typical townhouse with a 20-by-45-foot roof.\u201cThe city\u2019s stringent fire codes are the reason the solar market hasn\u2019t gotten bigger here,\u201d Mr. Mandler said. That said, installers have come up with some innovative solutions.Mr. McKee said fire codes limit the typical rowhouse to about 16 roof panels, but a canopy system can more than double the number of panels by elevating the panels over the roof, thus using most of the building\u2019s footprint. He said he now installs about eight canopy systems a month and expects to double his business over the next year.Owners of apartment buildings are also eyeing the sun. Jac Zadrima, a principal of Genesis Realty Group in the Bronx, placed solar systems on 21 of the 40 rental buildings the company owns. He estimates that he saves about $6,000 to $10,000 per building a year, and said that savings helps maintain other building operations.\u201cWhen you\u2019re maintaining an older housing stock, a maintenance issue is never minor,\u201d he said, \u201cso it\u2019s nice to have that extra money to offset a good portion of your common-area costs.\u201dSimilarly, after spending $1.7 million to install solar systems on nine rental buildings in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, Daniel Benedict, the founder of Benedict Realty Group, estimated that the investment will have paid for itself in about five years.\u201cSolar is great for long-term owners,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m saving 70 percent on my annual electricity bill.\u201dThe 552 panels across the four buildings that make up the firm\u2019s Alpine Apartments in Jackson Heights, Queens, generate about 157,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. Between January and August, the Con Ed bill for the buildings\u2019 common areas totaled $5,334, significantly less than the $18,850 he paid during the same period last year before he went solar.The organization has urged several Housing Development Fund Corporation co-ops in the neighborhood to go solar, but convincing people to spend money for future savings is difficult. \u201cMany of these buildings don\u2019t have much in reserves, so boards are hesitant to take out loans,\u201d he said.Mr. Southworth understands the struggle: When he was president of his co-op board, it took him over a year to obtain shareholder approval, install a solar system and switch meters at his own building in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.\u201cIt was a lot of collaboration, which included many informal chats in the hallways,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s an identity. We are known as that Sunset Park solar co-op.\u201dA cover article last Sunday about solar energy in New York City misidentified the program through which Ann Schaetzel and four other homeowners formed a solar purchasing group. It is Here Comes Solar, organized by Solar One, a nonprofit \u2014 not the city\u2019s Solarize NYC, organized by Brooklyn Community Board 6 and Solar One. The article also misstated the electricity generated by the 552 solar panels at the Alpine Apartments in Jackson Heights, Queens. It is about 157,000 kilo-watt-hours per year, not 157,000 kilowatts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Choice Beyond Cable Box Rentals? It May Hinge on a Swing Voter", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it turns out the biggest threat to the plan, which the F.C.C. is expected to vote on Thursday, is a low-profile Democratic commissioner within the agency itself.\u201cI\u2019m going to be very candid here that I have some problems,\u201d Ms. Rosenworcel said in a Senate hearing this month when asked for her opinion on the cable box proposal.Her remarks immediately reverberated across the communications and tech industries, which both have huge stakes in the outcome of the vote, as a sign the plan could be in trouble. The proposal needs a majority vote to pass before going into effect in two years.\u201cThis was a very significant moment, and she is in a very important position because so much is at stake,\u201d said Chip Pickering, president of Incompas, a lobbying group that represents Google and Amazon and supports the plan.The cable box proposal, introduced in January by the F.C.C.\u2019s chairman, Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, would open up the set-top box market by forcing cable and satellite companies to put their television programming on third-party devices instead of on cable boxes. That would let people more easily combine streaming services and cable channels on one device, like a Roku or Apple TV, or on no device at all through internet-enabled television sets. Cable customers would still be able to rent a box from their provider, if they prefer.At the same time, tech companies like Google and Amazon, among others, stand to gain if the plan is passed because they want a stronger foothold in living room technology.All of this puts Ms. Rosenworcel on the hot seat.\u201cAll eyes will focus on Commissioner Rosenworcel, whose views will likely decide the fate of the proposal,\u201d Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, wrote in a recent report about the set-top box plan. \u201cThis is the first time in her career she will be seen as the deciding vote in an issue of this visibility.\u201dMs. Rosenworcel, a native of Hartford, Conn., and a graduate of Wesleyan University and the New York University School of Law, spent a dozen years on telecom issues as an aide to two Democratic senators and as a staff member for a Democratic commissioner at the F.C.C. before being appointed to the agency in 2012. Ms. Rosenworcel, 45, is viewed as an official with a keen sense of the pulse of Silicon Valley.\u201cShe has a tremendous record of public service and has focused attention to the needs of consumers and vulnerable populations,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit public interest group that supports the cable box proposal.When it comes to voting on F.C.C. issues, Ms. Rosenworcel has nearly always stuck with her Democratic colleagues, including on net neutrality in 2015 and on a subsidy to provide broadband to low-income households this year.But she has dissented on some issues and questioned orders brought by Mr. Wheeler, including in 2014, when the F.C.C. chairman proposed allowing cellphones in planes. Ms. Rosenworcel said the idea would be a burden for passengers.With the cable box plan, Ms. Rosenworcel\u2019s concerns hinge on what she views as what may be too much meddling by the F.C.C. in the private agreements between cable providers and device makers. However, consumer groups say the F.C.C. needs to play an oversight role in those licensing deals to ensure fairness. In an emailed statement last week, she said she believed that the market for costly set-top boxes required reform. But she said the cable box proposal needed to be revised to comply with copyright and licensing laws that would not give the F.C.C. outsize power.\u201cI just don\u2019t think we have the authority\u201d to get so involved in the licensing agreements, Ms. Rosenworcel said at the Senate hearing this month.Ms. Rosenworcel is separately in the spotlight for her renomination to the F.C.C. Because of partisan squabbling in Congress, her reconfirmation has been delayed for 15 months.In the last days before the vote, members of Ms. Rosenworcel\u2019s and Mr. Wheeler\u2019s offices have been meeting to negotiate revisions to the portions of the plan that she opposes. Mr. Wheeler has already made some changes to the proposal to pacify cable and satellite companies over their control of programming.Mr. Wheeler\u2019s office declined to comment ahead of the vote this week.Ms. Rosenworcel, when asked how she will vote on Thursday, has demurred.\u201cIt\u2019s time to move beyond clunky and costly set-top boxes,\u201d she wrote in an email last week. \u201cThat\u2019s why I fully support the objective here. Now we need to find a way to make this work under the law we have.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Fashion Week, Google Gets a New Look", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFront RowSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It seems to escalate every catwalk season. First one brand does it. Then another. Then another ups the ante. It happens in New York, London, Milan and Paris.And now even a nonsocial network, Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google and the elephant in the digital room, is looking to get in the game. Starting Thursday and running for the duration of fashion weeks, Google is experimenting with search carousels created and curated by catwalk brands, sitting front and center atop Google\u2019s usual list of links generated by a computer algorithm.The result will allow the brands themselves to manage what consumers see first when, say, they plug the term \u201cMarc Jacobs\u201d or \u201cBurberry\u201d into their search engines. It will give the companies a lot more control over people\u2019s reactions to their products \u2014 and their productions.Early this week, a search for \u201cMarc Jacobs\u201d in San Francisco generated links that included the brand\u2019s official website and the designer\u2019s Wikipedia page. It also fetched Mr. Jacobs\u2019s latest Twitter posts and the location of a nearby doctor with the same name. During the coming fashion weeks, however, the same search is expected to generate photos from Mr. Jacobs\u2019s show, messages from the designer about inspirations for his collection and behind-the-scenes videos of models and makeup artists preparing for the show. For brands on a see-now-buy-now show schedule, Google will allow people to shop for the latest looks directly from the search page.This experimental approach is meant to allow users to hear directly from participants during major events, a company spokesman said. Google did this in January for a Republican presidential primary debate on Fox News. A search for \u201cFox News debate\u201d yielded candidates\u2019 own videos, answers to questions they weren\u2019t asked and rebuttals.Since a Google search is often the first stop for people casually interested in a subject, this allows brands to \u201cgo front and center with the most aspirational vision of their products,\u201d said Maureen Mullen, the chief strategy officer for L2, a research and advisory firm for consumer brands.It\u2019s clear then what designers gain from these searches. But what\u2019s in it for consumers? And what about Google?Having designers play a role in what people see in searches \u201cbrings fashion week to life in a new way,\u201d said Cameron McKnight, a product manager at Google. In theory, it allows creators to communicate their own visions more directly, rather than relying on third-party interpretation, be it from critics or retailers.But this approach calls into question the integrity of Google search results. What happens when what brands want on a search page conflicts with providing the best search results? Google said that brand results would only appear during fashion weeks, and would not affect the links summoned by the algorithmic search. \u201cIt will supplement the existing search results,\u201d said Rami Banna, a Google product manager.As for Google, special events like fashion weeks build a loyal and engaged audience, a must for advertisers. (Brands do not pay to participate in the initiative.) \u201cFor any of these platforms, it\u2019s important to command the attention of fashion and luxury brands, because they are the ultimate arbiters of taste,\u201d said Ms. Mullen of L2.Indeed, Google\u2019s experiment will make the company competitive in wooing the fashion industry, pitting it against such platforms as Instagram, which has been particularly effective in casting itself as fashion\u2019s friend.Ms. Chen and her team work with models, designers and stylists, providing tips on the best ways to use Instagram. For example, she advises designers that a finished runway look shouldn\u2019t be just one Instagram post; it could be five posts: the inspiration board, the different materials, the models getting ready, a slow-motion video of the models wearing the clothes, and the finished look.As a result, L2 found that Instagram accounted for 97 percent of social media engagement (measured by likes and comments) during February\u2019s fashion weeks.The question now is, when researchers measure September\u2019s social media engagement, will Google have changed all that?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worst of the Trumps", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a presidential campaign often inhabits the gutter it\u2019s not easy to establish its low point.We\u2019ve seen Donald Trump vilify Muslims, Mexicans and women. We\u2019ve seen him indulge airy suggestions that rifle-bearing Americans might like to shoot Hillary Clinton. We\u2019ve seen him belabor the lie that President Obama was not born in the United States \u2014 until he recanted. For Trump, the low road to the White House is paved with boorishness. But perhaps his son Donald Trump Jr. set the nadir this week when he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles.A caption accompanying a photograph of the candy said: \u201cIf I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That\u2019s our Syrian refugee problem.\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted, \u201cThis image says it all.\u201dWhere to begin? With the fact that human beings are not Skittles? With the fact that after more than five years of war 4.8 million Syrians are refugees and 6.1 million are internally displaced and Trump Jr., even with his coddled New York existence, can surely make the calculation that this amounts to almost 2.5 million more human beings than live in the five boroughs?With the fact that you do not flee your home because you have a choice (like choosing between Skittles and M&Ms after a Manhattan dinner party) but because you no longer have one? With the fact that, according to a Cato Institute study of refugees admitted to the United States between 1975 and 2015, the chance of an American being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion? With the fact that Syrians want to work, make a living, put their kids in decent schools, and recover their dignity, just like the rest of us?Or perhaps with the fact that comparing Syrians to Skittles carries echoes of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher comparing Jews to mushrooms in a popular children\u2019s book that posited the ticklish dilemma of how to distinguish poisonous toadstools from edible fungus; and has a mother saying to her son Franz:\u201cYes, my child! Just as a single poisonous mushroom can kill a whole family, so a solitary Jew can destroy a whole village, a whole city, even an entire Volk.\u201dWe all know, even the Trumps know, that the door into the United States was closed to desperate European Jews trying to escape the Holocaust.If I may be pardoned for extending an awful analogy, I\u2019d suggest to the Trumps that a better caption would read: \u201cIf I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three of them would turn out to be Sergey Brin, Elon Musk and Pierre Omidyar, would you take a handful?\u201dThe co-founder of Google, co-founder of Tesla, and founder of eBay were all immigrants. Steve Jobs\u2019 biological father was a Syrian immigrant. In fact, earlier this year, the National Foundation for American Policy found that 51 percent of the country\u2019s start-up companies valued at over $1 billion had at least one immigrant founder. A study by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a coalition of governors and business leaders, found that in 2013 more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies, including seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable brands, were started by immigrants or their children.The strength of the United States is its creative churn. In contrast to European states, it is hard-wired to reinvention through immigration. When Trump traffics in fear about immigrants, whether Muslim or Mexican, he guts America of its greatness and turns his back on its singular idea.The American response to the Syrian crisis has been paltry \u2014 almost 12,000 refugees admitted since the war began, or 0.25 percent of the total. Part of the slowness has come from the rigor of the vetting process. But what do the Trumps care? They are concerned with just one message: Muslim equals danger.Let\u2019s see now. Trump\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was a German immigrant. He arrived in the United States in October 1885. For decades, the family lied: They said he hailed from Sweden. In his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump says his grandfather \u201ccame here from Sweden as a child.\u201d The family historian, John Walter, explained that Trump\u2019s father, Fred, \u201chad a lot of Jewish tenants and it wasn\u2019t a good thing to be German in those days.\u201dMake up stories: It\u2019s the Trump way. So here was a German-American posing as a Swedish-American opting not to rent to African-Americans.Friedrich Trump, the immigrant, was young. He was penniless. He came not from Sweden but from Bismarck\u2019s recently formed nation state in the middle of a turbulent Europe. A U.S. immigration officer allowed him into the United States in 1885 \u2014 not a decision without risk.But an American decision taken in the spirit the Trumps now trample with cavalier untruth and vile innuendo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Murder Case Nags at a Reporter\u2019s Mind, Before and After It Goes to Trial", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCANTON, N.Y. \u2014 The first time I heard the name Nick Hillary was last summer, during the August doldrums that often envelop Albany \u2014 my primary beat \u2014 and my brain, after a long legislative session.The occasion was a quick email from Michael Luo, the investigations editor for The Times\u2019s Metro section.\u201chey jesse,\u201d it read. \u201chave you heard abt this thing? it looks pretty interesting.\u201d (Mike, like myself, has ambivalent feelings about capitalization in emails.)The thing in question was a tip from Michael Winerip, Metro\u2019s master of all things criminal justice, who spun a very quick tale of a man, perhaps falsely accused of a murder that occurred in October 2011, in Potsdam, a small village in upstate New York. (\u201cUpstate,\u201d in this instance, may not quite do it justice; Potsdam is 30 miles from the Canadian border, at least 3\u00bd hours from Albany and truly impossible to quickly get to from \u2026 basically, anywhere.)But \u2014 and this would be the first of many buts \u2014 the prosecution also pointed out that there were some serious wobbles in his alibi, which leaned on his daughter and a good friend (not exactly impartial observers, they note), and a common-sense, if knotty, question at the heart of the case: If Nick Hillary didn\u2019t do it, then whodunit?Murder cases and mysteries are manna for journalists, combining reporters\u2019 natural curiosity with the type of intrigue that makes readers, well, want to read. (And want to watch: The Garrett Phillips murder has attracted the attention of several network newsmagazines, as well as HBO.) Trials are even better: police accounts, sworn depositions and surveillance videos; emotional testimony and legal maneuvers; speeches from the bench and plentiful \u201cobjections!\u201d \u2014 this wealth of solid material provides more than enough for a daily story.Of course, having so much to work with \u2014 weeping witnesses, legal clashes, etc. \u2014 can also be overwhelming, as can finding the right mix of prosecution claims and defense rebuttals. And such a surfeit doesn\u2019t provide any sense of certainty, either of the outcome of the trial, or \u2014 more troubling, sometimes \u2014 the truth.But it left hanging the question that readers \u2014 and this reporter \u2014 wanted to have answered: What happened in the end? It would take months to learn more, during which time I bore back into Albany, all the time checking my Google alerts for word of developments out of Potsdam (or Canton, the St. Lawrence county seat where the trial is being held). As the fifth anniversary of the crime approached and a September trial date codified, it seemed that justice would be served; it just wouldn\u2019t be served hot.The case against Nick Hillary, which finally began with opening arguments a week ago Monday, is a perfect example of a circumstantial argument: The state doesn\u2019t have fingerprints, DNA or any solid forensic evidence at all linking Mr. Hillary to the crime. There\u2019s video that suggests he may have followed Garrett, there are accounts of his obsession, there are questions about whether he sometimes lied to investigators. But there\u2019s no smoking gun.Every piece of evidence has been examined and critically dissected by the defense team, led by a pair of high-profile New York City lawyers: Norman Siegel and Earl Ward. (The prosecution has its own heavy hitter: Onondaga County district attorney William Fitzpatrick, the recent president of the National District Attorneys Association.) So choosing how to evaluate the evidence and how to weigh its importance is a constant calculation and, to be honest, an inexact one.The same goes for testimony offered by witnesses. Each swears to tell the truth, but several, both for the prosecution and the defense, have also had moments when discrepancies have arisen between what they said in the past \u2014 to the police \u2014 and what they say now. Others \u2014 including Mr. Hillary and those on his side \u2014 have said on several occasions that they can\u2019t recall details about events in the days around, and on the day of, the murder. Does that discredit them? Are they dissembling? Or are their recollections, like all of ours, merely fallible and sometimes faulty?In a sign of the intensity of the proceedings, Ms. Phillips collapsed in court, during testimony from a neighbor about the attack on her grandson. That one of those who rushed to tend to her was Mr. Hillary\u2019s sister \u2014 a nurse from Brooklyn \u2014 made it an even more electric scene. It is hard not to be moved in such moments, and finding the balance between sympathy and serious analysis of what\u2019s being alleged \u2014 particularly for a father, like me, of an 11-year-old boy \u2014 is complicated.As this suggests, there are also undeniable emotional issues at play, in large part because of the subject matter: Garrett Phillips was murdered, in cold blood, with someone\u2019s hands. He was a good kid, by all accounts: rambunctious, funny and all-too-alive. To die in such a way is unfathomable, as is the pain suffered by the family Garrett left behind.That family \u2014 grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, and Ms. Cyrus herself \u2014 is certain that Mr. Hillary is the killer. But they have been wary of a press corps that they feel has sided with Mr. Hillary\u2019s claim of racial bias, and generally do not speak to reporters. The prosecution has also declined to comment, citing a gag order on discussing evidence set by a judge in 2015.The defense has held daily post-court briefings with the media \u2014 a large and growing contingent as the case continues to draw attention. Mr. Hillary attends those briefings, standing alongside his team, usually unsmiling but also seemingly unafraid. He doesn\u2019t comment much, but when he does he sometimes repeats his mantra that he is \u201c100 percent innocent.\u201dThere is only one person who actually has to decide whether this is true: Judge Felix J. Catena, who is overseeing the bench trial. (Mr. Hillary opted for this after jury selection had begun and 10 white jurors had been selected.) The defense rested on Wednesday, a day after the prosecution. Closing arguments are due Thursday, though no decision is expected until next week.But leaving the case behind isn\u2019t so easy. It nags the mind, even when the trial is done for the day. It has divided people in St. Lawrence County \u2014 some ardently believe that Mr. Hillary is guilty, others that he stands wrongly accused. The rift is so deep here that I\u2019ve taken to saying that, no matter the verdict, the case will never really be solved for some people. There will always be those who think justice was done, or undone, in the courtroom in Canton.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big Carmakers Merge, Cautiously, Into the Self-Driving Lane", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWhen General Motors starts selling a new Cadillac sedan next year, it plans to equip the car with G.M.\u2019s answer to Tesla Motors\u2019 Autopilot.Like Autopilot, G.M.\u2019s SuperCruise feature will be designed to steer a car for long stretches of highway driving, pass other vehicles, brake for traffic, speed up and change lanes \u2014 all with minimal effort by the driver.There is one thing the G.M. system will force drivers to do, though, that Tesla\u2019s system does not: keep their eyes on the road.Unlike Tesla, G.M. has chosen to place a camera, near the rearview mirror, that monitors the driver\u2019s actions.Along with other mainstream automakers cautiously rolling out Autopilot-like capabilities, G.M. is unwilling to assume that human drivers will \u2014 or even can \u2014 be trusted to remain safely engaged in the vehicle\u2019s operation.The big carmakers hope to avoid the criticism that has enveloped Tesla\u2019s Autopilot \u2014 that the driver-assistance technology can lull the person behind the wheel into a mind-wandering sense of false security.\u201cThrough the driver\u2019s eyes, you can detect his or her level of attention,\u201d Mark Reuss, G.M.\u2019s executive vice president for global product development, said in July at an auto technology conference in Detroit.The monitoring system, which analyzes images of the drivers\u2019 eyes and head to tell if they are looking forward, will notice if drivers are drowsy, looking down at their cellphones or have turned to reach into the rear seat.If the driver does not turn back to the road after a few seconds, warning tones and lights go off. If the driver does not respond, SuperCruise can slow or stop the car, Mr. Reuss said.Audi, the German luxury carmaker, plans to add similar driver-monitoring technology next year when an upgraded version of its driver-assistance technology is offered in the 2018 A8 sedan.\u201cThe car will see the driver\u2019s condition and be able to say, \u2018O.K., you\u2019re paying attention and alert,\u2019 and then it can be engaged,\u201d said Brad Stertz, Audi\u2019s director of government affairs.As an added safeguard, the G.M. and Audi systems will work only on divided highways whose curves and exits have been plotted on digital maps, which enables cars to track their precise location on the road and on the three-dimensional surrounding terrain. The systems will also recognize objects like overpasses and road signs.Outside those digitally mapped areas \u2014 on winding country roads, say, or uncharted city streets \u2014 G.M.\u2019s SuperCruise and Audi\u2019s Traffic Jam Pilot will not operate.Such precautions are intended to prevent the kind of accident that has put Tesla and Autopilot under heavy scrutiny in the last few months.In May, the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed when his car collided with a tractor-trailer crossing a state highway in Florida. Autopilot was operating at the time and failed to recognize the white truck against a bright sky. Neither Autopilot nor the 40-year-old driver, Joshua Brown, hit the brakes.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating to see if flaws exist in Autopilot, but Tesla has said the accident was at least partly a case of operator error.Even as G.M., Audi and other carmakers seek to adopt some of the capabilities of Autopilot, many experts say the concept has a basic flaw \u2014 the so-called handoff problem. These critics say too many experiments have shown that a person behind the wheel of a car that seems to be driving itself simply cannot respond quickly enough to take over in the instant the unexpected happens and the technology is not equipped to handle it.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.That is why at least one major automaker, Ford Motor, and Google have each said they would skip driver-assistance systems and focus on future, fully self-driving cars that require no human intervention.\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to have proper driver engagement,\u201d said Raj Nair, Ford\u2019s chief technical officer.Tesla, in contrast, is intent on sticking with the Autopilot approach but improving it.When Tesla introduced Autopilot last fall to much fanfare, the Silicon Valley company appeared to leap ahead of conventional automakers that have decades more experience in developing automobiles.The system and the way Tesla distributed it \u2014 by beaming software updates wirelessly to cars already on the road \u2014 fostered the impression that Silicon Valley, with its charge-ahead mind-set, was reinventing the auto industry for the digital age, while leaving the plodding, old-line carmakers behind.The contrast between Tesla\u2019s approach and the more cautious pace taken by traditional automakers reflects a \u201cclash of philosophies,\u201d said Amin Kashi, director of automated driving assist systems and automated driving at Mentor Graphics, which helps automakers design electronics systems.Mr. Kashi has experience in both worlds. He worked at Ford for 14 years before moving to Silicon Valley, and he has been at Mentor since April.Established automakers take a more conservative view of new technology and tend to have their own engineers refine and test it until it works as intended. The companies also typically hold clinics where they watch customers try new technologies to make sure it is easy to use and to discover how some might misuse it.\u201cSometimes, maybe, they are too careful,\u201d Mr. Kashi said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I didn\u2019t like at\u201d at Ford.Mr. Kashi said he was impressed by how quickly Tesla was able to speed ahead with Autopilot. Still, he said that while the \u201cnegative press\u201d Tesla has received over the Florida accident focused on \u201ccustomer misuse\u201d of Autopilot, it also shows the need to make sure customers understand the technology\u2019s limitations.Tesla warns drivers that Autopilot is not meant to be a fully autonomous system. When Autopilot is activated, the dashboard screen and audio alerts remind drivers to remain engaged and keep their hands on the steering wheel.But many Tesla owners, including Mr. Brown, the driver killed in Florida, have posted videos on YouTube showing it is possible to go several minutes without looking at the road or holding the wheel.Mercedes-Benz has just introduced a semiautomated driver-assist system in the new 2017 E-Class sedan that is similar to Autopilot but forces drivers to have their hands on the wheel more frequently. On an open highway, with few cars on the road, the system, Drive Pilot, might allow hands-free driving for up to a minute, said Bart Herring, general manager of product management at Mercedes-Benz USA. But in traffic, it sets off alarms after only a few seconds.\u201cWe love big leaps, but we don\u2019t make those until they\u2019re ready for prime time,\u201d Mr. Herring said.Audi has even further restrictions. The system it plans to release next year is meant to work only up to 35 miles per hour, to relieve the driver in stop-and-go traffic. Not until the next version, expected by 2020 or 2021, will the Audi system operate at highway speeds.\u201cWe feel it\u2019s important to walk along with customers as they get used to the technology,\u201d Mr. Stertz said.Both the Audi system and G.M.\u2019s SuperCruise also use radar sensors, cameras and lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 to read the road and identify vehicles and pedestrians.Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, has said the company does not think lidar is necessary for a semiautonomous driving system like Autopilot. On Wednesday, he posted a Twitter message promising a software upgrade that would include improvements to Autopilot \u201cprimarily through advanced processing of radar signals.\u2019\u2019Many experts say lidar is better at identifying objects than radar. But it is more costly and does not see as far in front of the car as radar, a Tesla spokeswoman, Alexis Georgeson, said.Other big automakers are following an even more cautious pace than G.M., Audi and Mercedes. Honda and Toyota offer systems with radar, cameras and automatic braking that are intended to mitigate or prevent accidents. And a steering capability keeps their cars from drifting out of their lanes. But Honda and Toyota stop short of letting their cars drive themselves.\u201cWe have to be clear about the technology\u2019s limitations,\u201d said Jim Keller, a chief engineer at Honda R&D Americas. \u201cCustomers will find situations where the system won\u2019t work as they think it will, and there will be consequences.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sufi Sect of Islam Draws \u2018Spiritual Vagabonds\u2019 in New York", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a leafy block of West 72nd Street, a Muslim Sufi order meets each Thursday evening, squeezing into Abdul Latif\u2019s three-bedroom apartment. You don\u2019t have to know Mr. Latif, born John Healy, to attend. Raised in the Yorkville neighborhood on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, he greeted his guests in Arabic with a thick New York accent, inviting them to sit on the floor.A group of about 10 beloveds, as they call one another, then stood and locked hands, forming a circle. Mr. Latif, 57, weaved around the ring, leading the chants in unison, including the 99 sacred names of God and prayers of adoration.The participants \u2014 mostly American-born converts to Islam \u2014 squeezed their eyes shut; some gently swayed, letting themselves be carried away by the rhythmic mantras. The pace of the chants quickened, one man stamped his feet, another wept silently, and after 30 minutes the beloveds were captivated and perspiring.Sufis call this practice zikr and see it as a way of connecting with God and elevating themselves through communal meditation. Worshipers frequently lose themselves in a spinning frenzy, as with the well-known whirling dervishes.The Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, a civil liberties organization, issued a statement that said, \u201cOur nation is most secure when we remain united and reject the fear-mongering and guilt by association often utilized following such attacks.\u201dAnnmarie Agosta, who grew up in an Italian-American family in Brooklyn and became a Sufi in 2009 after exploring Paganism, Wicca and Buddhism, seemed to agree with this statement. \u201cI feel a deep responsibility to stand for the true message of Islam, which is peace, tolerance, and compassion,\u201d Ms. Agosta said. \u201cThis is the message of Sufism.\u201d As a lesbian advocate for gay rights and a member of a congregation in TriBeCa, she led a service to honor those killed in the Orlando, Fla., massacre this summer.Many Americans anxious about domestic terrorism, however, are not interested in the nuances of various branches of Islam. And paradoxically, Sufis are often shunned by conservative Islam \u2014 the sect is dismissed as a diluted version of the faith, prioritizing the esoteric over the orthodox.\u201cSufism has never been embraced by mainstream Islam,\u201d said Daisy Khan, founder of the Women\u2019s Islamic Initiative in Spirituality and Equality and one-half of the couple who in 2010 sought to open a community center in Lower Manhattan, mislabeled the \u201cground zero mosque.\u201dFor Ms. Khan, the ethereal buzz of Sufism is its great appeal, a faith that is \u201cbeyond the realm of this world,\u201d dealing with the \u201csupernatural, the magical and love.\u201d\u201cDespite bad press,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople are still becoming Muslim and Sufi.\u201dIt is an interesting time to choose to become a Sufi.Before he became a beloved among Mr. Latif\u2019s group on the Upper West Side, Bjorn Bolinder had come to New York from Minnesota with dreams of performing on Broadway. His father was a Baptist minister, and his childhood consisted of regular church services and Sunday school. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel connected to the divine there,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no experience of joy or aliveness.\u201d He began seeking religion for himself in his mid-20s and came across Sufism through self-help spirituality books and a healing therapist.Mr. Bolinder, now 39, described an early spiritual moment as a downpour of light so bright that he had to open his eyes to double-check that the room lighting had not changed. \u201cI suddenly realized that maybe this is God, not whatever I learned in church,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like a completely different person. It was just so beautiful.\u201dTall and blond, Mr. Bolinder doesn\u2019t dress in a way that identifies him as a Sufi or a Muslim, although he occasionally thumbs his prayer beads on the subway. But having a Sufi name makes him part of a spiritual community. Five years after his \u201ccoming out as a Sufi,\u201d he said, his parents are supportive, and his father has even taken a Sufi course on Jesus, who appears as a prophet in the Quran.\u201cI feel sad for Muslims who don\u2019t acknowledge Sufism as part of the breadth of the divine,\u201d Mr. Bolinder said. \u201cWe are all one. They\u2019re missing out.\u201dSufism cuts across all sects of the faith. \u201cYou can be a Shia or a Sunni or any type of Muslim and still be a Sufi,\u201d said James W. Morris, professor of Islamic thought and history at Boston College.Often caricatured as kumbaya hippies, Sufis seek divine love and connection, but their practices encompass strict worldly rules and commitments: long services, dawn and night prayers, rigorous meditation and frequent fasting \u2014 in addition to the common Islamic practices of five daily prayers, the hajj pilgrimage and abstention from alcohol.Sufis cluster into tarikas, or spiritual orders, that are headed by a grand sheikh who may live in Cairo, but are led day to day by a local sheikh who could live in Queens.Discussing that growth, Khalid Latif, chaplain of the Islamic Center at New York University, said that in the city, \u201cthere\u2019s an absence of spirituality and stillness,\u201d and that even in times of heightened anxiety in the West about Muslims, the center saw a steady stream of the curious. He said that for many Americans, Sufism was an appealing first step.Tourists and shoppers in TriBeCa could easily miss the discreet blue plaque on a three-story building on West Broadway between a tavern and a brasserie. It reads, \u201cDergah Nur Ashki Jerrahi Sufi Order.\u201d Inside is where New Yorkers are most likely to encounter whirling dervishes.Visitors, once they have removed their shoes, enter a prayer hall with a high ceiling and ornate green and gold Arabic calligraphy spelling out the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s name decorating the walls. Books and prayer rugs are strewed about, and a table is laden with sweet Turkish tea and dates. A woman\u2019s voice drifts across the hall, performing the public call to prayer \u2014 a role traditionally reserved for men.Wearing a flowing white gown, her hair half-wrapped in a blue turban, Sheikha Fariha completes the call to prayer and summons the group\u2019s members to stand side by side, avoiding the more orthodox Islamic practice of positioning men up front.Sheikha Fariha gives few interviews, and she declined to speak to a reporter, but her longtime secretary, Abdul Rahim, answered questions about the congregation. A female sheikh shouldn\u2019t be viewed as unusual, said Mr. Rahim, who was born Thomas Rippe and grew up in Brooklyn. \u201cWe don\u2019t put an emphasis on women; we emphasize equality,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think of it as a certain kind of maturity.\u201dThe order has no dress code and no rules on sexual orientation. Indeed, the order is so liberal that some members don\u2019t even label themselves as Muslims.This kind of unorthodox approach, said Marcia Hermansen, director of the Islamic world studies program at Loyola University Chicago, is both the root of Sufism\u2019s appeal and its weakness. Charismatic leaders like Sheikha Fariha have spurred Sufism\u2019s growth in America, she said, with New York in particular attracting \u201cloosey-goosey liberal Sufism.\u201dAnd yet for all its liberal trappings, Sufism cannot be detached from Islam. \u201cSufism isn\u2019t just a label you wear; it\u2019s a state of being,\u201d said John Andrew Morrow, an Islam scholar and author. \u201cYou can\u2019t pick and choose parts of Islam, and you can\u2019t mislead sincere people, drawing them into Sufism without telling them this is fundamentally linked to Islam.\u201dPart of this problem, he said, is the American tradition of \u201cspiritual vagabonds.\u201d\u201cThey bounce around from one spiritual tradition to another,\u201d he said, \u201clike going to a buffet.\u201dLike the Shadhili group on the Upper West Side, Jerrahi members participate in long zikr services; theirs last until the wee hours. During a recent session, members formed a sitting circle, perched on low wooden stools and placed their hands on their hearts, swaying as they sang a communal tune. One man lightly tapped out a beat on a Persian drum; another young woman passed around a hymnbook, in English, so that newcomers could sing along.A few late worshipers trickled in and joined the circle, hastily removing their shoes and respectfully bowing in the direction of Sheikha Fariha, who had the bearing of a slightly bossy school principal. During the service, one man discreetly made to leave the room. Her eyes tightly closed, legs crossed and back straight, Sheikha Fariha snapped, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d The man jumped at being noticed and sheepishly replied, \u201cTo the restroom.\u201d She dismissed him with a wave of her hand without ever opening her eyes.Sitting on the floor of the main prayer hall was Juliet Rabia Gentile, 36, who has belonged to this order for more than a decade. \u201cI was always interested in Sufi culture: music, dance, art and the works of the Persian poets Rumi and Hafez,\u201d Ms. Gentile said. \u201cIt was definitely more of a cultural rather than spiritual interest at first.\u201dHer upbringing in New York City was Christian. \u201cInitially, my family thought I was experimenting and it would probably go away after a couple of years,\u201d she said. \u201cCertain friends were surprised I\u2019d become a Muslim, especially post-9/11.\u201dThe group\u2019s female leadership was a lure for Ms. Gentile, who is proud that American Sufism has cultivated an atmosphere of acceptance. \u201cOur sheikha is an unusual product of American religious freedoms,\u201d she said.But she is also aware that Sufis are in a difficult position, both within Islam and within American culture. \u201cSufis nowadays are under attack and called heretics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic given all the Islamophobia, there\u2019s been a surge of growth of interest. People just want to understand.\u201dMs. Gentile doesn\u2019t wear the headscarf outside the Dergah. \u201cI can sense that the vibe here is changing,\u201d she said. \u201cAmericans have reached heightened paranoia in the two years since ISIS emerged. People are becoming irrational.\u201dShe said her fellow New Yorkers were less likely to be swayed by panic. But she is nonetheless wary. \u201cFear is a strong drug,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protecting Humans and Jobs From Robots Is 5 Tech Giants\u2019 Goal", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive major technology companies said Wednesday that they had created an organization to set the ground rules for protecting humans \u2014 and their jobs \u2014 in the face of rapid advances in artificial intelligence.The organization has been created at a time of significant public debate about artificial intelligence technologies that are built into a variety of robots and other intelligent systems, including self-driving cars and workplace automation.The industry group introduced a set of basic ethical standards for engineering development and scientific research that its five members have agreed upon.In a conference call on Wednesday, five artificial intelligence researchers representing the companies said they thought the technology would be a major force in the world for social and economic benefits, but they acknowledged the potential for misuse in a wide variety of ways.They said their effort was not intended to be an enforcement organization to force technology companies into self-regulation. Rather, they want to foster \u201cpublic understanding\u201d and set \u201cbest practices\u201d for work in artificial intelligence.\u201cWe passionately believe in the potential for it to transform in a positive way our world,\u201d said Mustafa Suleyman, head of applied A.I. for DeepMind, an artificial intelligence development company acquired by Google in 2014. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s critical now to start to think about new models of engagement with the public, new models of collaboration across the industry and new models of transparency around the work that we do.\u201dThe group released eight tenets that are evocative of Isaac Asimov\u2019s original \u201cThree Laws of Robotics,\u201d which appeared in a science fiction story in 1942. The new principles include high-level ideals such as, \u201cWe will seek to ensure that A.I. technologies benefit and empower as many people as possible.\u201dNevertheless, at least one of the tenets implies that the companies realize they could be drawn into sticky ethical situations, and it calls on engineers to oppose the use of artificial intelligence technology in weapons or other tools that could be used to violate human rights.\u201cWith the hyperbole about A.I. over the last two to four years, there have been concerns in an echo chamber of anxiety that the government itself will be misinformed,\u201d said Eric Horvitz, managing director for Microsoft Research.The researchers said they were talking with other companies like Apple and research laboratories like the new nonprofit research group OpenAI about participating in their organization.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "BlackBerry Abandons Its Phone", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHALIFAX, Nova Scotia \u2014 Stepping away from its signature product, BlackBerry will no longer make its own smartphones, the device it once defined.BlackBerry\u2019s market share long ago collapsed to single digits in North America and Europe, despite the introduction of a new operating system and the company\u2019s decision to make phones based on the Android operating system from Google.The abandoning of the phone business that made BlackBerry a household name is a major step in a strategy begun by John S. Chen, the executive chairman and chief executive, to turn the money-losing company into a software and wireless device security business. When Mr. Chen joined BlackBerry almost three years ago, he made it clear that the fast-declining phone business was living on borrowed time.\u201cWe have decided to discontinue all the handset hardware development,\u201d Mr. Chen said Wednesday on a conference call for analysts. \u201cWe believe that this is the best way to drive profitability in the device business.\u201dWith the move, BlackBerry follows the lead of several other technology companies, notably Nokia, which have turned into software businesses. Mr. Chen, however, must now demonstrate that he can generate offsetting revenue.BlackBerry\u2019s initial responses to the iPhone, which was released in 2007 and was the handset that made software the dominant feature of smartphones, were plagued with technical bugs and poor performance. The arrival of Android phones from a variety of manufacturers, most notably Samsung, rapidly accelerated the decline of BlackBerry\u2019s phone business.After a series of delays, BlackBerry 10, an operating system that was a more effective competitor, did not appear until early 2013. But iPhones and Android phones were well-established by that time, and the new operating system was met with indifference from consumers and app developers.This year, Mr. Chen suggested that BlackBerry was continuing to make phones largely at the request of some of its large software customers, a group that includes branches of the United States military as well as law enforcement agencies.On the conference call on Wednesday, he dismissed those concerns and said, while offering no details, that other companies would provide chips and other hardware to meet those customers\u2019 needs.He also acknowledged that BlackBerry software on Android phones was not as secure as its BlackBerry 10 offerings. Mr. Chen promised, though, without offering a schedule, that BlackBerry would \u201ctake Android up to the same level of security as BB10.\u201dBlackBerry has the option of reselling the phones carrying its brand name and made by BB Merah Putih in Indonesia throughout the rest of the world. But Mr. Chen said the company had decided not to exercise that option. As a result, he said, sales of BlackBerry phones outside Indonesia will finish before the end of February 2017, the close of the company\u2019s fiscal year.Mr. Chen said other companies had shown interest in licensing BlackBerry\u2019s trademark and its software, but he offered no specifics or indication of whether such deals were likely.In the short term, the shutdown will most likely add to a crucial problem facing BlackBerry: declining revenue. The company said on Wednesday that phones accounted for 30 percent of its revenue during its second fiscal quarter, which ended Aug. 31. Sales of about 400,000 phones generated revenue of $105 million and a loss of $8 million.Despite growth in its software, BlackBerry\u2019s overall sales of $334 million during the quarter were well below the $490 million posted during the same period last year. The company lost $372 million during the quarter after accounting for substantial write-downs.BB Merah Putih, which is led by PT Tiphone Mobile Indonesia, that country\u2019s largest wireless carrier, will pay licensing fees and royalties to BlackBerry, Mr. Chen said.In recent years, BlackBerry has cut thousands of jobs and closed several operating centers, including one in this city, over the last three years. A company spokeswoman declined to discuss any future layoffs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Allo\u2019s Tryout: 5 Days With Google\u2019s Annoying Office Intern", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYou may now have more messaging apps than you have close friends.\u201cHaving more apps than close friends doesn\u2019t help, as something will have to go,\u201d Mr. Dunbar said in an email, though he noted that the various messaging apps serve different purposes. Younger people are shying away from chatting on Facebook, for example, to have more private conversations on apps like WhatsApp.With that backdrop in mind, I tested Allo for five days and compared it with the apps that are most similar to it: Google Hangouts, Apple iMessage and Facebook Messenger.After weighing the pros and cons, my advice is that people can hold off on downloading Allo, largely because its artificially intelligent assistant was unhelpful. But if Allo matures, users will probably want to ditch the Hangouts app.First, some context about Allo. Google announced the app in May, aiming to highlight the company\u2019s push into artificial intelligence. Its older chat app, Hangouts, will remain, but Google will emphasize that product\u2019s use as a videoconferencing and messaging app for businesses.To understand how Allo works, it\u2019s easiest to think of the app\u2019s A.I. assistant as an office intern who is lurking in the background, eager to chime in. The assistant analyzes messages you have typed or dictated and, when appropriate, springs into action with automatically generated phrases you can choose to reply with or suggestions for Google searches that may help accomplish tasks.When you\u2019re having a conversation with another person, for example, the assistant suggests ways it can help. Saying \u201cWant to see a movie tonight?\u201d prompts the assistant to offer a Google search for movie showtimes or to reply with suggestions like \u201cSure, what time?\u201d or \u201cNot really.\u201dHere is where Allo became frustrating for me. Asking an assistant to search \u201cmovie showtimes tonight\u201d should load a list of movies and corresponding showtimes. Instead, Google\u2019s assistant shows a list of movies without showtimes; only after tapping on a film can you ask for times.Sometimes that doesn\u2019t even work. Asking for showtimes for the movie \u201cSnowden\u201d loaded movies playing at a movie theater called UA Snowden Square Stadium 14. Not helpful \u2014 unless, of course, you live in Columbia, Md.Allo also tries to guess what your written response might be to certain types of phrases, questions or photos. With photos, the app occasionally identifies what\u2019s inside the photo to generate a suggested reaction. So when you receive a photo of a dog, Allo loads responses like \u201cadorable.\u201dThis feature ran into several problems. When I sent a picture to a friend of my cat sitting inside my car, Allo suggested this response to the friend: \u201cWhat a cute car!\u201d (Sorry, Allo, but my Prius is the opposite of cute.)For now, Allo\u2019s artificial assistance feels limited. So if I were a manager seeking an assistant, I probably wouldn\u2019t hire Allo. But I would politely tell the candidate to reapply after getting more experience.Each messaging app has its own purpose, but Allo has the most in common with Facebook Messenger, iMessage and Google Hangouts. That\u2019s because all four are capable of adding some personality with stickers and emojis.So I tested Messenger, iMessage and Hangouts against Allo to determine their pros and cons. The highlights:\u25a0 iMessage, Hangouts and Messenger work on mobile devices and computers. Allo works only on Android and iOS mobile devices, though Google plans to expand Allo to computers later.\u25a0 iMessage and Messenger support third-party apps, adding features like sending money to friends within messages. Google has no plans to support outside apps in Allo.\u25a0 Messenger has more sticker packs than Allo, which has only about 25.\u25a0 IMessage stickers are more fun to use. In iMessage, stickers can be placed on top of messages and photos \u2014 add a cartoon mustache to your selfie, for example. On Allo, stickers can be sent only as stand-alone messages.\u25a0 The Hangouts app is very much like Allo, without the half-baked assistant. Allo has more entertaining stickers, including a muscular yellow bull that appears to be twerking. The big difference between the two is that the Hangouts app relies primarily on your contacts list linked to a Google Mail account, whereas Allo pulls contacts from your device\u2019s phone book.The upshot: iMessage and Messenger have more features than Allo. There are two major features missing from Allo: the ability to chat using a computer and using third-party apps and games to do more within messages.With Allo, Google has the opportunity to stand out by offering superior artificial intelligence. Neither Messenger nor Allo has great A.I. yet, but Google\u2019s assistant has a better start.Finally, there is privacy to consider. It\u2019s tough to say how Allo will fare in terms of security until encryption experts take a close look at the app.Here\u2019s what we know so far: By default, Apple\u2019s iMessage service is end-to-end encrypted, which means a message is encrypted when it is sent from your device and remains encrypted when it passes through Apple\u2019s server and reaches the recipient. Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger both lack end-to-end encryption, so at some point when messages pass through their servers, they can see your messages.Allo has end-to-end encryption turned off by default because its server needs to see the messages to work its A.I. magic. However, Allo includes a mode called Incognito with full encryption enabled, which people can use for private conversations, similar to a private mode on a web browser. But, of course, the A.I. features do not work in Incognito.So Allo is a step ahead of Hangouts and Messenger for privacy. But by default (and by design), it is not as secure as iMessage.I recommend waiting for Allo to become available on computers and for its A.I. to become smarter. At the moment, Allo\u2019s assistant will waste more time than it saves when it comes to helping you make plans, and it will probably make conversations more awkward.Google said it was still improving and refining its algorithms, and Allo\u2019s assistant will get better over time.Once Allo\u2019s assistant matures, the Hangouts app will become redundant and you\u2019ll be able to delete it from your device. The catch, of course, is that Allo\u2019s A.I. won\u2019t become sophisticated until more people use it and share feedback.For now, if I really need help, I\u2019m going to request a competent intern.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Because Punk Still Rocks", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionI wasn\u2019t even born then. My first close-up encounter with punk was nearly a quarter-century later.Though born in New York, I had spent much of my childhood in Lahore, Pakistan. But in 2000, aged 16, my family moved from that bustling metropolis of millions to suburban Boston. At my Lexington high school, my new classmates fell in two groups: those who ostracized me because of my accent and those who didn\u2019t. My luck changed when some upperclassmen who were in punk bands heard that I played bass guitar, and invited me to a hard-core punk gig.The audience was whiter even than the crowd at my high school, but perhaps foolishly, I found it less intimidating. My accent didn\u2019t matter: I didn\u2019t have to talk to anyone. The rowdy, rammed show reminded me of overcrowded buses and the mosh of traffic in Lahore. I wasn\u2019t scared to jostle my way through the pit.It was the final gig of a band called Class Action, and the singer handed me the microphone during a song. I don\u2019t remember the garbled string of words I shouted into it, but he must have liked it enough because he kept passing me the mike.I was captivated by this charming quality of punk: There was no barrier between performer and audience. I couldn\u2019t sleep that night for all the electricity in my brain. Punk\u2019s kaleidoscopic swirl of noise, aggression and attitude must have been what grabbed that first generation of teenagers in dreary 1970s Britain who fell in love with the music.Boston\u2019s punk scene was a pressure cooker, and soon after my initiation, I witnessed outbreaks of real violence. Hard-core and punk shows in the Northeast became plagued by a gang called the F.S.U. (two of its initials are expletives). The gang\u2019s original goal was to purge punk of white-power skinheads, but eventually the F.S.U. was just about the violence. Under cover of the chaos of the mosh pit, gang members would set upon their unsuspecting victims.I had my run-in with the F.S.U. in 2005. At a gig at the Cambridge Elks Lodge, I was knocked out by a punch to the back of the head and kicked on the ground.When I came to, I remember making blurry eye contact with a white punk kid mouthing, \u201cGo.\u201d I drove home with a dislocated shoulder. I was bummed: I missed the headliner that night, Blitz.Getting beat up made me question my relationship to punk rock; I learned to fear the mosh pit. It also made me search out spaces where I could listen to the music but not be the only person of color in a room full of violent white guys. I started reading the liner notes on albums more carefully, to make sure I wasn\u2019t listening to white nationalist boneheads.I began, in other words, to look for punk that looked like me.There were American bands that sustained me, like the Fearless Iranians From Hell, from San Antonio. In the wake of the 1983 American Embassy bombing in Lebanon, which was attributed to the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah, Iranian-Americans felt a wave of suspicion fall on them. The Fearless Iranians answered that fear and loathing with blistering thrash-hardcore albums.I finally reclaimed punk in full when, in 2006, I formed a band with a guy I\u2019d met at my mosque and some other local Desi kids (Desi is a word of South Asian origin that refers to someone from the subcontinent). We called ourselves the Kominas, which is Urdu for \u201cthe scoundrels.\u201dFive years after Sept. 11, I still was figuring out how to deal with Islamophobic interactions. I never knew what to say; the snappy comeback always came to me too late. I wrote that experience into a Kominas song, \u201cSharia Law in the USA.\u201d The opening lines are: \u201cI am an Islamist, I am the Antichrist.\u201d (My take, if you like, on the the Sex Pistols\u2019 war cry from \u201cAnarchy in the U.K.\u201d: \u201cI am an Antichrist, I am an anarchist.\u201d)It\u2019s a provocation, not a program; it\u2019s all about shedding the advice from our parents to censor ourselves. As the Sex Pistols knew, being repulsive to your elders is a punk prerequisite.Today, their gigs are just as big as any hardcore basement show. A very different crowd goes to the reunion shows of the old punk bands I first fell for, and you hear some fans rage about \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201dBut I\u2019ve decided not to let a fear of violence or a sea of white faces intimidate me. Some nights after these gigs, I still can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the old electricity and because my foot is tapping along to songs with 300 beats per minute, or whether it\u2019s being an anxious Muslim American.Punk rock is older, but it\u2019s not your granddaddy\u2019s punk. The battles within the scene run parallel to the country\u2019s wider culture wars. What I\u2019ve learned is that in the war to make punk more inclusive, punk itself is the best weapon.Advertisement"}

A select group of American fashion folk, in Paris for the women\u2019s wear collections, had gathered to watch the first presidential debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton. There were deep leather armchairs, mood lighting and an exceptional French chardonnay. More than half the people in the room were in their pajamas, though no one had been to bed.\u201cThere was never any doubt in my mind that I would stay up tonight. This is just too important, and there is too much at stake when it comes to the outcome of this race,\u201d said Michael Carl, the fashion market director of Vanity Fair magazine, who had organized the night a few days before while he was at the Milan shows. \u201cYes, we are exhausted given the show schedule, but it is absolutely worth it. It is so important to stay connected and feel part of the conversation, especially when we are far from home.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t the only one who thought so. And from the array of whoops and boos (and the occasional peal of laughter, which ricocheted down the hotel\u2019s white marble hallways), it was clear from the start whose side the attendees were on.\u201cShe looks presidential, doesn\u2019t she? I think she looks fantastic,\u201d said Joseph Errico, the fashion director at Nylon magazine. Clad in an oversize Supreme T-shirt with \u201cWhatever\u201d emblazoned across the front, he scrolled through Instagram looking at some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s earlier outfit choices with Rebecca Ramsey, the style director of the Cut, who sported comfy black and white loungewear.While they liked Mrs. Clinton\u2019s bright red Ralph Lauren pantsuit, they were less complimentary about Mr. Trump\u2019s cornflower blue tie.\u201cHe looks like a used-car salesman,\u201d Ms. Ramsey said, though both noted that the Republican candidate had toned down the deep tan that had become one of his style signatures over the last few months.Neither had thought twice about staying up until the early hours. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t managed to stay up all night in Paris for a party before,\u201d Mr. Errico said, snacking on olives. \u201cBut I wanted to watch it in real time, and form my own opinions on what unfolded. I didn\u2019t want to wake up and have to wade through a deluge of everyone else\u2019s opinions and edits, six hours later.\u201dAs the night wore on Kate Lanphear, the former editor in chief of Maxim magazine, who was tapped this month by Google to lead its new Fashion Week search product, became the official fact-checker for the party, leaping to grab her phone every few minutes, furiously tapping at it, then declaring her findings to the room.The Vanity Fair fashion and style director, Jessica Diehl, made a bleary-eyed cameo in white Charvet pajamas, husband in tow. And there was mention of another election-focused event on the fashion schedule this week: a cocktail fund-raiser co-hosted by Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of American Vogue, and Huma Abedin, vice chairwoman of the Clinton campaign, at the Sonia Rykiel boutique in Paris, with a private dinner to follow elsewhere, hosted by Lauren Santo Domingo.Texts started to trickle through from friends who had set their alarms to watch also, but chose to do so from their beds. \u201cShe killed it,\u201d Laura Brown, editor in chief of InStyle, wrote in an email after tweeting continually through the night.At 5:15 a.m. the debate wrapped up, and so did the party. Anthony Vaccarello\u2019s debut at Yves Saint Laurent was taking place a mere 14 hours later, and no one wanted to miss it. But as Mr. Carl padded up to bed, he couldn\u2019t resist a final word.\u201cI\u2019m with her,\u201d he said, yawning, of Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe are all with her.

Gather their every keystroke, sound, message and location? That will cost you $650,000, plus a $500,000 setup fee with an Israeli outfit called the NSO Group. You can spy on more people if you would like \u2014 just check out the company\u2019s price list.Now, internal NSO Group emails, contracts and commercial proposals obtained by The New York Times offer insight into how companies in this secretive digital surveillance industry operate. The emails and documents were provided by two people who have had dealings with the NSO Group but would not be named for fear of reprisals.The company is one of dozens of digital spying outfits that track everything a target does on a smartphone. They aggressively market their services to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. The industry argues that this spying is necessary to track terrorists, kidnappers and drug lords. The NSO Group\u2019s corporate mission statement is \u201cMake the world a safe place.\u201dTen people familiar with the company\u2019s sales, who refused to be identified, said that the NSO Group has a strict internal vetting process to determine who it will sell to. An ethics committee made up of employees and external counsel vets potential customers based on human rights rankings set by the World Bank and other global bodies. And to date, these people all said, NSO has yet to be denied an export license.But critics note that the company\u2019s spyware has also been used to track journalists and human rights activists.\u201cThere\u2019s no check on this,\u201d said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. \u201cOnce NSO\u2019s systems are sold, governments can essentially use them however they want. NSO can say they\u2019re trying to make the world a safer place, but they are also making the world a more surveilled place.\u201dThe NSO Group\u2019s capabilities are in higher demand now that companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are using stronger encryption to protect data in their systems, in the process making it harder for government agencies to track suspects.The cyberarms industry typified by the NSO Group operates in a legal gray area, and it is often left to the companies to decide how far they are willing to dig into a target\u2019s personal life and what governments they will do business with. Israel has strict export controls for digital weaponry, but the country has never barred the sale of NSO Group technology.Since it is privately held, not much is known about the NSO Group\u2019s finances, but its business is clearly growing. Two years ago, the NSO Group sold a controlling stake in its business to Francisco Partners, a private equity firm based in San Francisco, for $120 million. Nearly a year later, Francisco Partners was exploring a sale of the company for 10 times that amount, according to two people approached by the firm but forbidden to speak about the discussions.The company\u2019s internal documents detail pitches to countries throughout Europe and multimillion-dollar contracts with Mexico, which paid the NSO Group more than $15 million for three projects over three years, according to internal NSO Group emails dated in 2013.\u201cOur intelligence systems are subject to Mexico\u2019s relevant legislation and have legal authorization,\u201d Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThey are not used against journalists or activists. All contracts with the federal government are done in accordance with the law.\u201dZamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said that the sale of its spyware was restricted to authorized governments and that it was used solely for criminal and terrorist investigations. He declined to comment on whether the company would cease selling to the U.A.E. and Mexico after last week\u2019s disclosures.For the last six years, the NSO Group\u2019s main product, a tracking system called Pegasus, has been used by a growing number of government agencies to target a range of smartphones \u2014 including iPhones, Androids, and BlackBerry and Symbian systems \u2014 without leaving a trace.Among the Pegasus system\u2019s capabilities, NSO Group contracts assert, are the abilities to extract text messages, contact lists, calendar records, emails, instant messages and GPS locations. One capability that the NSO Group calls \u201croom tap\u201d can gather sounds in and around the room, using the phone\u2019s own microphone.Pegasus can use the camera to take snapshots or screen grabs. It can deny the phone access to certain websites and applications, and it can grab search histories or anything viewed with the phone\u2019s web browser. And all of the data can be sent back to the agency\u2019s server in real time.In its commercial proposals, the NSO Group asserts that its tracking software and hardware can install itself in any number of ways, including \u201cover the air stealth installation,\u201d tailored text messages and emails, through public Wi-Fi hot spots rigged to secretly install NSO Group software, or the old-fashioned way, by spies in person.Much like a traditional software company, the NSO Group prices its surveillance tools by the number of targets, starting with a flat $500,000 installation fee. To spy on 10 iPhone users, NSO charges government agencies $650,000; $650,000 for 10 Android users; $500,000 for five BlackBerry users; or $300,000 for five Symbian users \u2014 on top of the setup fee, according to one commercial proposal.You can pay for more targets. One hundred additional targets will cost $800,000, 50 extra targets cost $500,000, 20 extra will cost $250,000 and 10 extra costs $150,000, according to an NSO Group commercial proposal. There is an annual system maintenance fee of 17 percent of the total price every year thereafter.What that gets you, NSO Group documents say, is \u201cunlimited access to a target\u2019s mobile devices.\u201d In short, the company says: You can \u201cremotely and covertly collect information about your target\u2019s relationships, location, phone calls, plans and activities \u2014 whenever and wherever they are.\u201dAnd, its proposal adds, \u201cIt leaves no traces whatsoever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Talking to Vehicle Technology Companies", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant has been talking with McLaren, the automaker known for its Formula One racecars, about an investment in the company, according to two people briefed on the talks who asked to remain anonymous because the discussions were confidential.Apple is also in talks with Lit Motors, a San Francisco start-up that has developed an electric self-balancing motorcycle, about a potential acquisition, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Apple has already hired several former Lit Motors engineers.Even as many Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Tesla and Uber, have embarked on electric and driverless car initiatives, Apple has kept quiet. Yet internally, it has pursued a car project, called Project Titan, which has had ups and downs in leadership and direction. The layoffs at the project this month came after the appointment of an Apple veteran, Bob Mansfield, to take over the effort.Inside Apple, employees recently described the company\u2019s efforts to build a car as a project lacking vision and in complete disarray. The recent layoffs, followed by Apple\u2019s pursuit of talent and expertise from outside companies, are part of the company\u2019s effort to \u201creboot\u201d the project, said people with knowledge of the layoffs.Apple declined to comment, as did Lit Motors. Wayne Bruce, a spokesman for McLaren, said in an emailed statement that the company was \u201cnot in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.\u201dBut McLaren did not deny having had conversations with Apple. In a phone call, Mr. Bruce added: \u201cThe nature of our business means we regularly have conversations with all sorts of parties, but those conversations remain confidential. We\u2019re not in a position to confirm or deny any previous conversation.\u201dA partnership with McLaren would allow Apple to tap into the carmaker\u2019s high-end automotive technology, forged by years of building Formula One racecars and selling sports cars topping $1 million.For years, McLaren has been recognized as an innovator in automotive technology. As one example, the company pioneered the use of a single device to control a car\u2019s engine, transmission and electrical systems.McLaren\u2019s sales are steadily growing, but the company\u2019s bet on research took a bite from its profit. In 2015, McLaren, which is backed by private shareholders, sold 1,654 cars, five more than the year before. Its profit slid 64 percent to about $7 million, from $19.4 million in 2014, in part because of increased spending on research.Unlike a more traditional automaker, McLaren does not have a large car production business to protect and could tap Apple\u2019s resources to make its technology available to the masses \u2014 if Apple decides to move forward with building its own automobile.An acquisition of Lit Motors could also help Apple rethink its strategy with building an electric car and bring engineering talent into the company.Mark Scott contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Real Estate Executive to Take the Helm at Governors Island", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe cone-shape island, a former military base in New York Harbor, has 40 acres of new parkland, including the Hills, which are four newly sculpted knolls rising up to 70 feet and offering views of the Statue of Liberty.While many New Yorkers are familiar with the outsize recreational role the island has come to play in the life of the city, they may not realize that it is also envisioned as a giant economic engine.When the city took control of the island from the state in 2010, it inherited not only huge areas of potential parkland, but also nearly a million square feet of historic buildings and ample acreage for new construction.The city pledged to eventually open the island to the public year round \u2014 currently it is open only during the summer \u2014 and to create a 24/7 environment with cultural organizations, for-profit companies, educational institutions and hotels.Advocates of open space believe the two visions of Governors Island \u2014 as a large playground and a commercial nexus \u2014 can easily coexist and are even necessary for the island to thrive. They hailed the selection of Mr. Samuelian, who is an architect and planner.Adrian Benepe, a former city parks commissioner, called Mr. Samuelian \u201can ideal candidate,\u201d given the mandate for Governors Island, which is \u201cto figure out compatible uses that will also generate substantial revenue\u201d to make the island self-supporting.\u201cHe cares about good design and has experience interacting with the public sector,\u201d added Mr. Benepe, the director of city park development at the Trust for Public Land. \u201cHe also happens to be a very effective and nice guy.\u201dA Brooklyn native, Mr. Samuelian formerly worked in the Department of City Planning, where he helped redevelop Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He is an assistant professor of architecture at Cooper Union, his alma mater, and has a master\u2019s of architecture in urban design from Harvard.Mr. Samuelian said the city would soon move ahead with plans for the historic structures and new commercial space.The existing buildings once housed Army and Coast Guard operations. They range in style from Victorian to Georgian Revival to \u201cthe classic New England campus style,\u201d including the handsome brick houses along Colonels\u2019 Row, Mr. Samuelian said.The two sites for new development, at the southern end of the island, can accommodate up to five million square feet of space. The commercial development, he insisted, would not come at the expense of the new parkland.\u201cAll of the development needs to enhance the public space,\u201d Mr. Samuelian said. \u201cWe have created a fantastic new public park that New Yorkers are just getting to know and love. I want to ensure that nothing we do will have a deleterious effect on what is there.\u201dCurrently, about a quarter of the historic buildings are occupied. Tenants include the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School, a public high school; the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Arts Center; the National Park Service, which oversees 22 acres of the island; and the Trust for Governors Island.One new tenant that has agreed to occupy a cluster of historic buildings is a European day spa, QC Terme, which will have three outdoor pools.What the island will not include are permanent homes. \u201cIt\u2019s in the deed restriction not to have full-time residential development, and I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Mr. Samuelian said. \u201cHaving institutional, cultural and hospitality uses is a way to make sure the island is truly public.\u201dBut, to be successful, those additional tenants will need year-round public access to the island. That, in turn, will require much more frequent ferry service, which is costly. Trust officials will not say when exactly the island would be available to the public 365 days a year.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a chicken-and-egg thing,\u201d Mr. Samuelian said. \u201cYou need more ferry service to justify more activity, and you need more activity to justify more ferries. My goal is to be open year-round as soon as possible.\u201dIt is also not clear who will oversee all the new development. Mr. Samuelian said the city might choose to name a \u201cmaster developer\u201d for the future commercial space. Other options for the city include enlisting multiple developers or overseeing construction itself.Mr. Samuelian, who has served on the board of the Friends of Governors Island, is confident that people will see the island as a place of employment as well as recreation.He, for one, is looking forward to working on Governors Island. Having run the New York City Marathon three times, Mr. Samuelian said he planned to bring his running shoes when he starts there this month.\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful and flat,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have a shower in the office.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Make a Dash for It", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplaySUNDAY PUZZLE \u2014 I thought this Sunday puzzle provided a good balance of no-brainers and headscratchers, and a theme that was smart and inventive without being too abstruse.Today\u2019s theme was \u201cMake a Dash for It\u201d and called for hyphens in several definitions that could be read in two ways. Thus \u201cTroupe of lesser known actors?\u201d played on A-lister and Rat Pack and gave us \u201cB-LISTER PACK.\u201d \u201cSchmaltz in kids\u2019 films?\u201d clued for emotions safe for all audiences, G-RATED CHEESE, and so on. My favorite turn of phrase was CHICKEN CO-OPS; I got seriously challenged by PHOENIX A-Z and was duly impressed by AMERICAN GOT HI-C. MOVING A-SIDE and LO-CAL HERO filled out the bottom half of the puzzle. The down clues used the hyphen as well, which must have increased the difficulty in construction.20A: \u201cForgo\u201d can mean many things, including ESCHEW, one of my favorite words of all time, a word I learned as a child (for some odd and possibly crossword-related reason) in relation to avoiding those who go \u201cAchoo!\u201d I only related it to this definition after some crosses.31A: The only way I was getting \u201cI TOO\u201d for this clue was from the crosses. Even after solving, I gave the wrong Hughes credit; \u201cI, Too\u201d is by Langston, not Ted.57: A simple clue, really, \u201cLike bibs and aprons\u201d. But I saw it early, and, given the context of the puzzle, determined that there had to be a hyphen in there somewhere. Nope \u2013 just TIED ON.91A: If you didn\u2019t already know that there was an \u201cR.V. camper\u2019s org.\u201d known as KOA, it was a bit of a headscratcher. I\u2019m still a bit perturbed, honestly, that the letters stand for \u201cKampgrounds of America.\u201d The fill also evokes the word koan to me, and here\u2019s one for you: I know someone in Ohio who lives in his camper (kamper?) full-time. In the winter, though, he parks it in a warehouse that belongs to a friend of his, to keep it out of the bad weather. He lives in a camper inside of a warehouse. There is your koan.13D: \u201cSmacks hard\u201d didn\u2019t lend itself to SWAT for me for the longest time. I know, I know there\u2019s a Sultan of Swat and in that case Swat wasn\u2019t a gentle rebuff either, but I got a bit stuck on this corner combination. I blame the trick clue there, which was one of my last fills on the grid.14D: Ibid. At one point I had MY BAD, at one point I had AH \u2014 NO. It just took me a while and now I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see UH-OH right away, although \u201cThat is \u2026 not looking good\u201d doesn\u2019t instantly lend itself. Tricky clue for a short phrase, in my opinion.57D: \u201cDevices preventing off-hour openings of vaults\u201d really rang no bells for me and I hit this clue before too many crosses. In my mind\u2019s eye, a bank vault will always look like something in an old heist movie and there will always be someone who looks like Jason Statham leaning against it. Please don\u2019t kill my dreams, technology and TIME LOCKS.64D: \u201cOfferings to hitchhikers\u201d was one of the gimmes I started with: RIDES, of course. And so it remained until three-quarters through, as I tried to contort a variety of answers to accommodate until LIFTS became the equally obvious, just more correct answer.97D: \u201cSo funny!\u201d So funny that I was convinced the trick across word was LOWCAL something or other and this answer had to be HAW HAW.But how was that going to work and maybe there was yet another trick where you hyphenate and \u2026 abbreviate? Eh. I got it after a bit. HA-HA on me.As it happens, the seed answer that inspired this theme hit the cutting-room floor. I remember feeling pretty giddy about finding \u201cTHE S-WORD IN THE STONE,\u201d which made me think of someone with a sick sense of humor leaving a profane epitaph. In my first submission, that evolved into \u201cS-WORD SWALLOWER,\u201d a person clued as catching themselves before cussing. But alas, Will Shortz wasn\u2019t keen on this hyphenation. Admittedly, you often see it undashed as \u201cS WORD,\u201d so not exactly strong theme material.Regardless, I\u2019m proud of finding the solid set of seven sneakily-hyphenated words that made the cut. My favorite of the bunch is probably \u201cB-LISTER PACK,\u201d since it evokes a kind of lesser-cool Brat Pack.Trickiest part was wrangling the dashed Down answers that cross the themers at the hyphens. I tried to stay away from less lively possibilities (I\u2019m looking at you, I-BAR and NON-U), while keeping the surrounding fill as smooth as possible.Hope you enjoyed it!I like this type of puzzle that lends itself to the imagination of other examples in the theme. What did you think?An earlier version of this column suggested that the poem \u201cI, Too\u201d was written by Ted Hughes. The author was Langston Hughes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Donald Trump Got Wrong on Stop-and-Frisk", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkAmong the senseless beatings inflicted on reality during the presidential debate on Monday night was the discussion of New York City\u2019s stop-and-frisk tactics.Donald J. Trump attributed a nonexistent increase in murder to actions that never happened, namely, the ending of the stop-and-frisk practice by, variously, \u201ca judge, who was a very against-police judge,\u201d and the \u201ccurrent mayor.\u201dThis was multilayered fiction.Murder declined. A judge did not end stop-and-frisk. Neither did the current mayor.By the way, did more blood run in the street?No, less blood did.In the same period, stops were down by about 97 percent, said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the department.During the debate, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, alluded to a few of these numbers. Mr. Trump, her Republican opponent, started shouting.\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Mr. Trump interjected. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\u201cMurders are up, all right,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou check it.\u201dMapping and charting the decline of a controversial police practice.All right, as Mr. Trump said, let\u2019s check it.Frisks went down. So has murder, a steady decline that has continued, with slight annual variations, through this year.In the word-fact-salad-spinner used by Mr. Trump, those details land upside down. Also, he repeated a more common mistake about the decline of the stop-and-frisk tactics, attributing it to a federal judge hearing a class-action lawsuit against the city, and to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, who succeeded Mr. Bloomberg in 2014.\u201cIt was terminated by the current mayor,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Actually, no.Last year, the city police conducted 22,939 stops, or about 63 a day. So stop-and-frisk was not terminated by Mr. de Blasio, or by anyone else for that matter. It\u2019s true that the use of the tactic has declined. During the mayoralty of Mr. Bloomberg, the number of reported stops skyrocketed, but then was scaled back as the city faced pressure from the class-action litigation, brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.\u201cBut stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the debate. \u201cTremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\u201dHundreds of thousands of innocent people were being stopped every year so that the city could arrest tens of thousands for having weed.Applied almost exclusively to minorities, the stop-and-frisk tactics in New York became an elephantine government project that wasted time and money, degrading both to the personhood of the men and women who were stopped and to the professionalism of the people doing the stopping.It was poor social hygiene, not defensible as a matter of law or as effective law and order.As Mr. Trump said, it was \u201ctremendous beyond belief.\u201dJust so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Rethinking Strategy on Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is rethinking what it plans to do about self-driving cars, just as other big tech companies appear ready to plow ahead with competing efforts.In a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.The job cuts are the latest sign of trouble with Apple\u2019s car initiative. The company has added resources to the project \u2014 code-named Titan \u2014 over the last two years, but it has struggled to make progress. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort.Apple is not the only big tech company pursuing autonomous driving technology. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has tested self-driving cars on the road for years, but its focus has been on designing the underlying software and systems to make that technology work. Tesla has a self-driving feature within its cars that has come under scrutiny in recent months after a fatal accident was connected to its use.Separately, Uber, in a limited test in Pittsburgh next week, plans to start picking up passengers in self-driving cars. Last month, Uber also acquired the start-up Otto for about $700 million, a purchase that brought with it some of the top minds in robotics and autonomous technology.And automakers like Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have all said they expect to put a number of self-driving vehicles on the road in five years or less.But Apple has stood out from the others mainly \u2014 as is often the case with the company \u2014 for its secrecy. Apple has never acknowledged that it is working on a car, though Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said the automotive industry is undergoing a drastic change and, earlier this year, he seemed to confirm the existence of the car project at its annual shareholders meeting.\u201cDo you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren\u2019t sure what was going to be downstairs?\u201d Mr. Cook said at the meeting. \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be Christmas Eve for a while.\u201dApple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a \u201creboot\u201d of the car project, the people briefed on it said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Electric cars rely not on the internal combustion engine, but on technologies more prevalent in the consumer electronics world: batteries, sensors and software. In addition, self-driving cars could change the traditional notions of public transportation and car ownership.Apple started looking seriously into building an electric car about two years ago. It expanded the project quickly, poaching experts in battery technology and so-called machine vision, as well as veterans from the automobile industry.The team also pulled in staff members from other divisions across Apple, growing to more than 1,000 employees in about 18 months. But as the project grew rapidly, it encountered a number of problems, and people working on it struggled to explain what Apple could bring to a self-driving car that other companies could not, according to the people briefed on the project.Steven Zadesky, a longtime Apple employee initially charged with heading the car effort, left the company for personal reasons this year. His departure opened the door for Mr. Mansfield, who worked closely with Apple\u2019s co-founder, Steve Jobs, but left the company\u2019s executive team in 2013.He had all but retired from Apple except for the occasional visit to the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. He was coaxed into coming back to oversee the project, which could represent a new market for Apple as sales of its flagship iPhone are slowing.Apple has also made some headway in the space. The company has a number of fully autonomous vehicles in the middle of testing, using limited operating routes in a closed environment, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s plans. Like other companies in the space, that technology is likely a number of years away from seeing mainstream consumer use, they added.Katie Benner and Mike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

My America is about the freedom to make choices, pursue your dreams and use your skills as entrepreneurs. It is about having more choices than just red versus blue.Americans want to be able to choose a president who is capable of reason, of learning from failures, and of telling them the truth, even when it hurts. Most of all, they want to choose a president who will adhere to the Constitution and will make government live within its means.I\u2019m offering that choice. I wasn\u2019t part of the presidential debate on Monday, but as Americans listened in dismay to the so-called major parties\u2019 candidates, Google searches for \u201cGary Johnson\u201d skyrocketed.We don\u2019t deny that there are very real tensions on the fringes, and we can\u2019t simply ignore those tensions. But when it comes down to the basics, most Americans really aren\u2019t that far apart.Our kids are better educated than ever before. Our technology enables entrepreneurship and transparency. Our military is second to none, as it should be. But our two-party political system is an entirely different story. Hyper-partisanship may be entertaining, but it\u2019s a terrible way to try to run a country. We\u2019re the alternative \u2014 and we\u2019re the only ticket that offers Americans a chance to find common ground.Some would call us social liberals. I\u2019ve been vocal in criticizing the disparity in the treatment of black Americans by the police. I want reform in our criminal justice and sentencing systems. \u201cThree strikes\u201d laws and mandatory minimums have put the United States among the world leaders in incarceration. Treating drug use and abuse as crimes, rather than health issues, has put far too many Americans behind bars.What would government be like in a Johnson administration? First, we would begin the conversation about the size of government by submitting a real balanced budget. Every government program would have to justify its expenditures, every year. Cuts of up to 20 percent or more would be on the table for all programs, including military spending. Changes to Social Security and Medicare must also be considered.As governors, we balanced our budgets and reduced taxes: I cut taxes 14 times; Bill Weld did so 21 times in his six years leading Massachusetts. It just requires commitment and certainty.Second, we would protect the Constitution and civil liberties and stop treating immigration as a bad thing. In the difficult case of abortion, I support a woman\u2019s right to choose. I\u2019ve long supported civil liberties, including marriage equality and freedom from mass surveillance.Given the way it has served as both a launching pad and a crash-landing site for Republican presidential prospects, immigration was strangely absent from Monday\u2019s debate. Neither the Republican-controlled Congress nor President Obama has done anything to fix the dysfunctional immigration system. Deporting millions of noncriminal undocumented immigrants and building a wall, as Mr. Trump proposes, are ludicrous ideas.A majority of Americans can actually agree on a solution. We would allow those immigrants who are here without documents, but with otherwise clean records, to come forward, pay taxes, undergo a background check and legally reside in the United States. We\u2019d eliminate categories and quotas on immigration, and border enforcement would be devoted to keeping out real criminals and would-be terrorists.Third, we would offer free trade to all nations, but limit military intervention to when our nation is attacked. We would honor all treaty obligations and pursue strategic alliances that made our country safer.Mrs. Clinton wants to continue a muddled mix of intervention, regime change and bombing campaigns. That approach brought us Syria, Iraq, Libya and failed nation-building in Afghanistan. Our troops and the American people deserve clear objectives, with a well-drawn distinction between defense and futile interventions. And our troops deserve authorization from Congress for their activities overseas, an important detail that has fallen by the wayside.The same common-sense attitude applies to trade and diplomacy. Our ticket is the only one to support free trade. The goal is to enhance prosperity and peace without sending our young people to war.Less than six weeks before Election Day, independents and, particularly, young voters are increasingly turning to Bill Weld and me as reasonable, rational and experienced candidates. We are the party that can break the partisan gridlock which for too long has kept real solutions out of reach.Gary Johnson, the governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003, is the Libertarian Party nominee for president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tech Giants Are Devising Real Ethics for Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, science-fiction moviemakers have been making us fear the bad things that artificially intelligent machines might do to their human creators. But for the next decade or two, our biggest concern is more likely to be that robots will take away our jobs or bump into us on the highway.Now five of the world\u2019s largest tech companies are trying to create a standard of ethics around the creation of artificial intelligence. While science fiction has focused on the existential threat of A.I. to humans, researchers at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and those from Amazon, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft have been meeting to discuss more tangible issues, such as the impact of A.I. on jobs, transportation and even warfare.Tech companies have long overpromised what artificially intelligent machines can do. In recent years, however, the A.I. field has made rapid advances in a range of areas, from self-driving cars and machines that understand speech, like Amazon\u2019s Echo device, to a new generation of weapons systems that threaten to automate combat.The specifics of what the industry group will do or say \u2014 even its name \u2014 have yet to be hashed out. But the basic intention is clear: to ensure that A.I. research is focused on benefiting people, not hurting them, according to four people involved in the creation of the industry partnership who are not authorized to speak about it publicly.One main concern for people in the tech industry would be if regulators jumped in to create rules around their A.I. work. So they are trying to create a framework for a self-policing organization, though it is not clear yet how that will function.\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that there should be no regulation,\u201d said Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the authors of the Stanford report. \u201cWe\u2019re saying that there is a right way and a wrong way.\u201dWhile the tech industry is known for being competitive, there have been instances when companies have worked together when it was in their best interests. In the 1990s, for example, tech companies agreed on a standard method for encrypting e-commerce transactions, laying the groundwork for two decades of growth in internet business.The authors of the Stanford report, which is titled \u201cArtificial Intelligence and Life in 2030,\u201d argue that it will be impossible to regulate A.I. \u201cThe study panel\u2019s consensus is that attempts to regulate A.I. in general would be misguided, since there is no clear definition of A.I. (it isn\u2019t any one thing), and the risks and considerations are very different in different domains,\u201d the report says.One recommendation in the report is to raise the awareness of and expertise about artificial intelligence at all levels of government, Dr. Stone said. It also calls for increased public and private spending on A.I.\u201cThere is a role for government and we respect that,\u201d said David Kenny, general manager for IBM\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence division. The challenge, he said, is \u201ca lot of times policies lag the technologies.\u201dA memorandum is being circulated among the five companies with a tentative plan to announce the new organization in the middle of September. One of the unresolved issues is that Google DeepMind, an Alphabet subsidiary, has asked to participate separately, according to a person involved in the negotiations.Separately, Reid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn who has a background in artificial intelligence, is in discussions with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab to fund a project exploring the social and economic effects of artificial intelligence.Both the M.I.T. effort and the industry partnership are trying to link technology advances more closely to social and economic policy issues. The M.I.T. group has been discussing the idea of designing new A.I. and robotic systems with \u201csociety in the loop.\u201dThe phrase is a reference to the long-running debate about designing computer and robotic systems that still require interaction with humans. For example, the Pentagon has recently begun articulating a military strategy that calls for using A.I. in which humans continue to control killing decisions, rather than delegating that responsibility to machines.\u201cThe key thing that I would point out is computer scientists have not been good at interacting with the social scientists and the philosophers,\u201d said Joichi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times. \u201cWhat we want to do is support and reinforce the social scientists who are doing research which will play a role in setting policies.\u201dThe Stanford report attempts to define the issues that citizens of a typical North American city will face in computers and robotic systems that mimic human capabilities. The authors explore eight aspects of modern life, including health care, education, entertainment and employment, but specifically do not look at the issue of warfare. They said that military A.I. applications were outside their current scope and expertise, but they did not rule out focusing on weapons in the future.The report also does not consider the belief of some computer specialists about the possibility of a \u201csingularity\u201d that might lead to machines that are more intelligent and possibly threaten humans.\u201cIt was a conscious decision not to give credence to this in the report,\u201d Dr. Stone said.Advertisement"}

Google told partner companies on the project that senior management decided to rethink the initiative as part of a consolidation of its hardware operations, said one of the people.A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Reuters earlier reported the move to shutter the project.It\u2019s the latest sign of Google\u2019s attempts to bring more financial discipline to a company that had long encouraged ambitious projects without much thought to profitability. Last year, the company moved to a holding company structure, separating the profitable advertising business from the money-losing \u201cmoonshots.\u201d By forcing those projects to report losses publicly, the thinking was that it would help to rein in never-ending investment.The project also suffered from some organizational upheaval. It was part of Google Advanced Technology and Projects, known internally as ATAP, a group headed by Regina Dugan, the former director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Ms. Dugan left Google to spearhead a similar group at Facebook.This led many observers to speculate that Project Ara was dead, but Google said at its developers conference in May that it was moving forward with plans to get the customizable phone in the hands of customers by 2017.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A High-Stakes Bet: Turning Google Assistant Into a \u2018Star Trek\u2019 Computer", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtGoogle is one of the most valuable companies in the world, but its future, like that of all tech giants, is clouded by a looming threat. The search company makes virtually all of its money from ads placed on the World Wide Web. But what happens to the cash machine if web search eventually becomes outmoded?That worry isn\u2019t far-fetched. More of the world\u2019s computing time keeps shifting to smartphones, where apps have supplanted the web. And internet-connected devices that may dominate the next era in tech \u2014 smartwatches, home-assistant devices like Amazon\u2019s Echo, or virtual reality machines like Oculus Rift \u2014 are likely to be free of the web, and may even lack screens.But if Google is worried, it isn\u2019t showing it. The company has long been working on a not-so-secret weapon to avert its potential irrelevance. Google has shoveled vast financial and engineering resources into a collection of data mining and artificial intelligence systems, from speech recognition to machine translation to computer vision.But Google has much grander aims for the Assistant. People at the company say that Sundar Pichai, who took over as Google\u2019s chief executive last year after Google was split into a conglomerate called Alphabet, has bet the company on the new tech. Mr. Pichai declined an interview request for this column, but at Google\u2019s developer conference in May, he called the development of the Assistant \u201ca seminal moment\u201d for the company.If the Assistant or something like it does not take off, Google\u2019s status as the chief navigator of our digital lives could be superseded by a half-dozen other assistants. You might interact with Alexa in your house, with Siri on your phone, and with Facebook Messenger\u2019s chatbot when you\u2019re out and about. Google\u2019s search engine (not to mention its Android operating system, Chrome, Gmail, Maps and other properties) would remain popular and lucrative, but possibly far less so than they are today.The Assistant, in Google\u2019s most far-out vision, would always be around, wherever you are, on whatever device you use, to handle just about any informational task.Consider this common situation: Today, to book a trip, you usually have to load up several travel sites, consult your calendar and coordinate with your family and your colleagues. If the Assistant works as well as Google hopes, all you might have to do is say, \u201cO.K., Google, I need to go to Hong Kong next week. Take care of it.\u201dBased on your interactions with it over the years, Google would know your habits, your preferences and your budget. It would know your friends, family and your colleagues. With access to so much data, and with the computational power to interpret all of it, the Assistant most likely could handle the entire task; if it couldn\u2019t, it would simply ask you to fill in the gaps, the way a human assistant might.Computers have made a lot of everyday tasks far easier to accomplish, yet they still require a sometimes annoying level of human involvement to get the most out of them. The Assistant\u2019s long-term aim is to eliminate all this busywork.If it succeeds, it would be the ultimate expression of what Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, once described as the perfect search engine: a machine that \u201cunderstands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want.\u201dAt this point, a few readers may be recoiling at the potential invasion of autonomy and privacy that such a machine would necessitate.The Assistant would involve giving ourselves over to machines more fully. We would trust them not just with our information but increasingly with our decisions. Many people are already freaked out by what Google, Facebook and other tech companies know about us. Would we be willing to hand over even more power to computers?Those are important questions, but they are also well down the road. For now, the more pressing question for the Assistant is: Will it even work?Google has technological advantages that suggest it could build a more capable digital assistant than others have accomplished. Many of the innovations that it has built into its search engine \u2014 including its knowledge graph database of more than a billion people, places and things, and the 17 years it has spent trying to understand the meaning of web queries \u2014 will form the Assistant\u2019s brain.Google has also been one of the leaders in machine learning, the process that allows computers to discover facts about the world without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is at the heart of a number of recent advances, including Google Photos\u2019 uncanny capacity to search through your images for arbitrary terms (photos of people hugging, for instance).\u201cWe are in the process of transforming into a machine-learning company,\u201d Jeff Dean, who is in charge of Google Brain, the company\u2019s artificial intelligence project, told me this year. For each problem Google solves this way, it gets better at solving other problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a boulder going downhill gathering more momentum as it goes,\u201d Mr. Dean said.That\u2019s an amazing technological feat. But as Brian pointed out, it\u2019s also pretty useless. Why does your friend care if you know his dog\u2019s a Shih Tzu?This gets to a deeper difficulty. The search company might have the technical capacity to create the smartest assistant around, but it\u2019s not at all clear that it has the prowess to create the friendliest, most charming or most useful assistant. Google needs to nail not just Assistant\u2019s smarts, but also its personality \u2014 a new skill for Google, and one that its past forays into social software (Google Plus, anyone?) don\u2019t speak highly of.\u201cWhen I was trying to book a movie, it didn\u2019t really narrow things down for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there were some times it was wrong. I asked it to show me my upcoming trip, and it didn\u2019t get that.\u201dOf course, it\u2019s still early. Mr. Sullivan has high hopes for the Assistant. It would be premature to look at the technology today and get discouraged about its future, especially since Google sees this as a multiyear, perhaps even decade-long project. And especially if Google\u2019s future depends on getting this right.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Concern Over Colin Powell\u2019s Hacked Emails Becomes a Fear of Being Next", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A panicked network anchor went home and deleted his entire personal Gmail account. A Democratic senator began rethinking the virtues of a flip phone. And a former national security official gave silent thanks that he is now living on the West Coast.The digital queasiness has settled heavily on the nation\u2019s capital and its secretive political combatants this week as yet another victim, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, fell prey to the embarrassment of seeing his personal musings distributed on the internet and highlighted in news reports.\u201cThere but for the grace of God go all of us,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman for President Obama who now works in San Francisco. He said thinking about his own email exchanges in Washington made him cringe, even now.\u201cSometimes we\u2019re snarky, sometimes we are rude,\u201d Mr. Vietor said, recalling a few such moments during his time at the White House. \u201cThe volume of hacking is a moment we all have to do a little soul searching.\u201dThe latest hack could well spur a new rash of email deletions across the country as millions of people scan their sent mail for anything compromising, humiliating or career-destroying. It adds to the sense that everyone is vulnerable.The soul searching is happening with a special urgency in Washington, where email accounts burst with strategies, delicate political proposals, gossipy whispers and banal details of girlfriends, husbands, bank accounts and shopping lists.A television news anchor said that producers and staff members at her network had jokingly agreed at a morning news meeting to issue blanket apologies to one another if their emails were ever made public.She said Mr. Powell\u2019s emails had revealed him, a normally stoic public official, to be just as gossipy as everyone else, and added that the gossip, not classified information, was what people feared becoming public.On Capitol Hill, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, said the news of Mr. Powell\u2019s hacked emails had him thinking that Senator Chuck Schumer\u2019s never-ending use of an old-fashioned flip phone \u201cmakes more sense than ever.\u201d\u201cI think more and more people are realizing that there isn\u2019t a thing you can say in an email that isn\u2019t likely to be hackable or discoverable at some later point,\u201d Mr. Durbin said, lamenting his own complacency.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, shrugged off the news. \u201cI haven\u2019t worried about an email being hacked since I\u2019ve never sent one,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cI\u2019m, like, ahead of my time.\u201dBut for another network anchor in Washington, who declined to be named for fear of becoming an even more prominent hacking target, the Powell disclosures led to a long night Wednesday that involved saving a few personal emails and then deleting his entire account. Everyone, he said, has sent emails they would not want released, including innocent messages that could be misinterpreted.Washington may be behind other big cities in learning that lesson. Bankers on Wall Street have favored very brief emails since their conversations were splashed across front pages because of lawsuits filed after the financial crisis. In 2010, Goldman Sachs executives used the acronym \u201cLDL,\u201d for \u201clet\u2019s discuss live,\u201d when a conversation turned at all sensitive.Similar precautions have been common in Silicon Valley since a 2009 Chinese state cyberattack on servers at Google and other tech companies. In Hollywood, a breach at Sony Pictures in 2014 spilled out gossipy secrets and persuaded film crews, actors and executives alike to adopt security measures they once considered paranoid. Studios have turned to a new class of companies with names like WatchDox that wrap screenplays with encryption, passwords and monitoring systems that can track who has access to confidential files.\u201cIt has, without question, affected what I say in writing,\u201d said Jordan Roberts, a writer and director whose credits include the coming comedic drama \u201cBurn Your Maps.\u201d The Sony hack gave him \u201ca personal pause button that hopefully spares me future potential embarrassment for the sake of a quick and pithy and frequently unfounded, and almost always unnecessary, insult,\u201d he said.Joe Quenqua, who runs the entertainment practice at the DKC public relations firm, said by email that everyone thinks twice before shooting off an email. \u201cMight it make for some more banal email exchanges? A bit less gossipy?\u201d he wrote. \u201cSure, but it\u2019s so simple: Better safe than sorry.\u201dRichard Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX, said: \u201cI used to be a little more tolerant of what others say in email. That ended.\u201dIn some countries outside the United States, there has long been a more cautious approach to electronic communications. In Pakistan, politicians often agree to speak to reporters in person only after removing phone batteries or covering the microphones with a pillow. Many in the Middle East have migrated to more secure services like Telegram or Signal.Many Americans have learned the hard way. Aaron E. Carroll, a pediatrician and research professor at Indiana University, discovered the dangers after writing a newspaper article defending artificial sweeteners that prompted health groups to demand his university emails. The groups hoped to prove links between Dr. Carroll and companies that make sugary drinks and snacks.\u201cIt totally devastated me,\u201d Dr. Carroll said on Thursday. \u201cI was freaking out, not because I did anything wrong \u2014 all of a sudden, I was panicked about what have I said that was inappropriate or that could be taken out of context.\u201dDr. Carroll, who said he had no connection to any food companies, engaged in a \u201cscorched earth\u201d policy in the weeks after his emails were handed over to the health groups. He deleted just about everything off his university email account and now clears out the account regularly.\u201cI\u2019m a little more careful now. I\u2019ll just walk down the hall instead of sending a long email,\u201d he said, though he added that he still sent personal and work messages on the same account for convenience. \u201cIt has not changed my daily habits of email as much as you might think.\u201dThat was also a sentiment on Capitol Hill, where some treated the prospect of a Powell-like hack lightly.Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri said he was already a \u201clate adopter\u201d when it came to email because he never thought it was secure. He said he had been careful not to rely heavily on email when he was in charge of wrangling votes for Republicans in Congress.\u201cI think that a lot of people are now finding out why that should have been the case for lots of other people,\u201d Mr. Blunt said.Mr. Durbin, asked if he was worried enough to scour through his sent mail, sighed and shook his head.\u201cOh, no,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russians will have to read it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a messaging service.

Even when Yahoo addressed the problem, and hired a well-regarded head of security, it resisted doing things that had become common at the likes of Google, like fully encrypting messages. Taking those kinds of steps can make it a hassle to index content for searches.Maybe Yahoo wanted to put resources elsewhere. Or maybe it wanted to seem young and fun, without the grinding responsibilities of security.

{"Headline": "Making Video Ads That Work on Facebook\u2019s Silent Screen", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingTHE GEICO commercial that made its premiere this summer seemed like a standard 30-second television ad. It features two men building sand castles on a pristine beach with their children. \u201cGuess what I just did?\u201d one of the men asks. \u201cBuilt a sand castle?\u201d the other responds. \u201cHa \u2014 no. I switched to Geico and got more,\u201d the first man says.But another version of that ad was created by the Martin Agency, which worked on the commercial for Geico. This one was half as long, with text that popped up as the men spoke, and the word \u201cGeico\u201d appeared after six seconds.The goal: to make the ad understandable to people who viewed it on Facebook without sound.\u201cFor a lot of our clients, Facebook is a very important platform, so thinking about how it\u2019s going to play out there without sound is coming into the discussion earlier and earlier in the process,\u201d said Neel Williams, a creative director at the Martin Agency, which has also repurposed TV Chips Ahoy commercials for Facebook.Advertising is a medium that has long relied on the hummable jingle, the memorable catchphrase and the familiar voice-over to connect with its audience. Now, as technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat hustle for a bigger cut of television marketing dollars by adding videos, they have been working to show advertisers that their videos can be just as effective, even if they are played on mute or are viewed for just a few seconds. With advertisers seeking to reach an increasingly fractured and fickle audience, the challenges of presenting ads on platforms that are not one-size-fits-all are sure to be much discussed at Advertising Week, a top industry gathering that begins Monday in Manhattan.Even before Facebook drew criticism for that metric, advertisers were charting new territory with sound on Facebook. Facebook has visited the Martin Agency \u201cseveral times\u201d to share tips on how to tailor ads effectively, Mr. Williams said, and it has emphasized the importance of catching a user\u2019s attention in the first three seconds of a video, at which point it officially counts as a view.\u201cIf you\u2019re a creative person, this is an extraordinary time to be in the opening chapters of quite an extraordinary development platform,\u201d said Mark D\u2019Arcy, chief creative officer of Facebook\u2019s Creative Shop, which helps companies tailor their ads to the social network.\u201cYou can\u2019t elicit the same amount of emotion as when you have sound and visual working together,\u201d said Julian Cole, head of communications planning at BBDO.Even as such ads have been shortened or created anew for the web, particularly for mobile devices, where Facebook says 75 percent of its video views occur, sound has remained on in apps like YouTube and Snapchat.\u201cWhen people are watching on YouTube, they have earbuds in and the volume up,\u201d said Kellie Judge, senior vice president of global media partnerships at Amplifi, the central investment division of the ad agency Dentsu Aegis Network.\u201cWith Facebook and Twitter, people are scrolling a feed with the volume off. The distinction we\u2019ve been talking more and more about is not just creating for television versus in-feed, but how it\u2019s so different from other video,\u201d she said.It is difficult to tell brands they need to tailor their ads for each platform \u2014 not to mention pay TV-like dollars to place them there \u2014 without proof of their effectiveness, so \u201cFacebook and Twitter are doing a ton of research in that space to combat the advertiser hesitation,\u201d Ms. Judge said.In the United States, television still commands 72 percent of all video viewing time and television advertising still accounts for about 36 percent of all video-related revenue, according to Activate, a consulting firm for tech and media companies.\u201cPeople are less willing to sit through an online ad than a 30-second TV commercial,\u201d said Michael J. Wolf, managing director at Activate. \u201cMost online video ads get about six seconds of play before they are skipped.\u201dJoe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group, said the lack of sound was a factor that made it hard to assess the value of online video advertising against traditional TV commercials.\u201cIt\u2019s not that this is not valuable. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d Mr. Marchese said. \u201cTV dollars would flood into online if online impressions were the same thing as TV impressions, meaning 100 percent of the screen, the sound very likely on, and all 30 seconds viewed.\u201dFor its part, YouTube said that ad recall was more than three times higher among people exposed to video ads that could be seen and listened to compared with video ads that could only be seen, citing a study of more than 1,400 mobile-ad campaigns.\u201cSound ensures that users are getting the most robust and comprehensive exposure to our film as possible,\u201d said Doug Neil, executive vice president of digital marketing at Universal Pictures.Imran Khan, Snapchat\u2019s chief strategy officer, went so far as to say that \u201cads that play without sound are more like a moving banner.\u201dStill, it\u2019s hard to argue with the sheer size of Facebook and how much time people spend there.

Here\u2019s what you need to know before setting off on your first Google trip.It\u2019s All-Inclusive (Only if You Use Gmail)After setting up the app using your Gmail account, you can create your first trip \u2014 simply search for the destination city and put in your dates. If you\u2019re hitting multiple cities, you can add those as well.If the app has enough of your data, you may already have the trip listed. In that case, you do not have to create a new one, just jump into the existing trip and make changes as you see fit.It\u2019s a Data-SaverYou\u2019ve probably already saved some dough by using the offline feature on Google Maps.You can do the same here by downloading each trip to your phone. And all the information will be accessible even if you\u2019re not connected to the internet or to cellular service. You won\u2019t need to eat into your data with Google Trips, or be stuck if your vacation is in a remote location with no cell service.Using the app with a data or Wi-Fi connection does have a few perks. If the weather takes a turn for the worse, the app will suggest indoor activities. It\u2019ll also show whether a place is open or closed in real time. But you\u2019re not missing much in offline mode.It\u2019s Customizable If you\u2019re strapped for time, the suggested Day Plans seem to have something for everyone. But you can also customize each recommended plan by adding or deleting stops, or create one from scratch.The app will also suggest places to visit based on what it knows about you (which, by now, is a lot). It had Fenway Park on the top of my \u201cFor You\u201d list, since it has rightfully concluded that I\u2019m a baseball fan. Then again, \u201cBoston With Kids\u201d was another suggested Day Plan and I don\u2019t have any of those.It\u2019s Kind of CreepyBefore you create your first trip, you\u2019ll see some of your previous trips that you didn\u2019t even share. That\u2019s because it has already pulled in information from your Gmail account, so it knows which hotels you stayed in and where you rented a car from and stores this information under Reservations. This could be useful if you plan on returning some day. But if you\u2019d rather not have the stroll down memory lane, you can delete previous trips quite easily.It\u2019s also not perfect. Occasional suggestions miss the mark. Also, I recently returned from a weekend away and it had this week blocked off for me as a trip to New York, which is where I live.It\u2019s FreeThere is no fine print here. As long as you don\u2019t consider the fact that Google now has a new way of using your data as a price to pay, there is no monetary charge for using the app. This is significant if you compare it to similar travel apps like TripIt, which costs $49 per year for its premium service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Middle-Grade Adventure Teems With Schooners, Frigates and Brigs", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChildren\u2019s BooksNowadays, kids fantasize about running away to sea about as much as they dream of joining the circus. But there\u2019s a wonderful moment in Kate Milford\u2019s new middle-grade novel, \u201cThe Left-Handed Fate,\u201d that could make even the most Minecraft-addicted landlubber want to get on board. The setting is the Chesapeake Bay in 1812. An English sea captain\u2019s daughter named Lucy Bluecrowne and a scientist in training named Max Ault sit high above deck in the crosstrees of a schooner. While Max clings to the mast, Lucy balances on a spar, fluttering her legs \u201clike a child on a swing\u201d while all around them, \u201cthe rigging sighed as the wind played on the ropes like fingers on guitar strings.\u201d What modern child could resist? The tall ship is a swaying, bobbing, hundred-foot-high jungle gym, an ocean away from helicopter parents.Milford is a master at creating intricate worlds infused with an element of the fantastical. One of the many pleasures of her Edgar Award-winning novel \u201cGreenglass House\u201d was the rich depiction of its eponymous setting: a ramshackle smuggler\u2019s hotel in the fictional seaside town of Nagspeake. For the setting of \u201cThe Left-Handed Fate,\u201d Milford concocts a captivating portrait of 19th-century sloops and brigs with their lamp-lit captain\u2019s quarters, copper-bound sea chests and late-night snacks of biscuits and sherry. Her seascape is also peppered with odd supernatural phenomena, like unexplained bursts of electricity and \u201cphilosophic\u201d iron that slithers as if alive. This world has a seductive, fairy-tale quality \u2014 Patrick O\u2019Brian\u2019s Captain Aubrey series as seen through the lens of Hayao Miyazaki.And like a classic Miyazaki film, Milford\u2019s story features precociously talented young protagonists struggling against dark forces. The novel begins as the Left-Handed Fate, the British privateer commanded by Lucy\u2019s father, heads toward Baltimore on a mysterious mission. Max has commissioned the ship in search of three pieces of an ancient mechanical engine rumored to be the only weapon capable of defeating Napoleon. The French are also looking for it, and even more unnervingly, there\u2019s a phantom-like ship hounding the Fate, crewed by figures in all-black uniforms and dark spectacles. Before long, Lucy\u2019s father is killed and Lucy and Max are forced to serve under a well-meaning but insecure United States Navy officer named Oliver Dexter who\u2019s all of 12 years old. Lucy and Max must persuade Oliver \u2014 a commodore\u2019s son who feels like \u201cthe very least useful person aboard\u201d \u2014 to help them hunt for the weapon that could change the course of the war.One of Milford\u2019s strengths is her faith in her readers\u2019 ability to figure stuff out, and her obsessions with history, folklore and mechanical contraptions give her brainiac fans plenty to chew on. But in this case, she\u2019s gone a little overboard. Like an overdesigned boat burdened by too many gadgets, the opening chapters of \u201cThe Left-Handed Fate\u201d are a bit of a slog, with an excess of characters, arcane terminology and puzzles within puzzles. It\u2019s hard to lose yourself in the gorgeous scenery when you need to Google something every few pages (what the heck\u2019s the difference between a corvette, a frigate, a brig, a sloop and a schooner?).But just when you might be tempted to toss the book overboard, our scrappy gang pulls into port at Nagspeake \u2014 the setting for \u201cGreenglass House\u201d more than a century later. In this trippy city, where \u201cmetal moves of its own will and entire streets sometimes turn up in different places,\u201d the story starts to hum. Milford ramps up the cloak-and-dagger escapades. Through her three heroes, she also sensitively explores the complexities of loyalty, duty and leadership in a way young readers will relate to. We also meet one of the most memorable middle-grade characters in recent memory: the Mad Spinster, a spidery-looking weaver with indigo-hued fingers, lips \u201cstained a purple-red wine color\u201d and a loom that may have answers to the book\u2019s \u00admysteries.Though it may be overwrought in its complications, it\u2019s impossible not to admire \u201cThe Left-Handed Fate\u201d for its epic scope, joyful evocation of life on the high seas and suspenseful mystery. As the Mad Spinster sighs, \u201cThere are so few truly wonderful puzzles to be had these days.\u201d Here, at least, is one.Catherine Hong, a contributing editor at Elle Decor, blogs about children\u2019s books at \u00admrslittle.com.Advertisement"}

No More iPhone Headphone Jack?", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo understand this story it helps to go over the Andreessen Horowitz back story. The firm was founded in 2009 as a new kind of V.C. Rather than just give start-ups money, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, storied tech entrepreneurs, would also help companies with hiring, communications and other functions that young firms need. The model has been widely copied and hailed as game-changing, and A16Z, as the firm is known, is now recognized as one of the Valley\u2019s elite investors.But apparently its returns don\u2019t match its reputation. The Journal said other top V.C.s had made a lot more money for their investors. Two funds raised by Sequoia Capital last decade have returned eight times their investors\u2019 money, and its 2010 fund is up 5.5 times. Benchmark\u2019s 2011 fund has rung up returns of 11 times\u2019 investors\u2019 money. A16Z, by comparison, is at around two times its investors\u2019 money so far. That\u2019s better than a lot of other venture firms, but not earth-shattering.I think the Journal story is ultimately a small stain on the firm\u2019s reputation, but it won\u2019t deter the firm from raising another giant fund in another year or two. And, um, entrepreneurs will probably still accept the millions of dollars that A16Z wants to give them. So this is more about pride than it is dollars. And if there\u2019s one way to get under a venture capitalist\u2019s skin, it\u2019s to ding their egos. (Same goes for me, too.)Given your general inability to discuss anything intelligently, Mike, I thought it would be a good idea to invite an expert Apple watcher to help us out.So, Dai, tell us: Is Apple\u2019s event next week going to be as boring as we\u2019ve all been hearing for months?That said, boring doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be meaningful changes. Take Touch ID. When it came out, people weren\u2019t losing their mind over it, but I think it\u2019s significantly improved the iPhone experience and it\u2019s allowed for things like Apple Pay. Step by step, little by little, a lot of boring announcements culminate into interesting things.I realized at some point that nothing could beat that initial change of your TV, which once weighed as much as an N.F.L. lineman, becoming sleek enough to mount on a wall.

{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Software Is Booming. But Why Now?", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This is the year artificial intelligence came into its own for mainstream businesses, at least as a marketing feature.Salesforce chose this date to pre-empt Oracle, the world\u2019s largest business software company, which on Sunday evening began its annual customer event in San Francisco. High on Oracle\u2019s list of new features: real-time analysis of enormous amounts of data. Oracle calls its product Oracle A.I.There are big pushes in A.I. in agriculture, manufacturing, aviation and pretty much every other sector of the economy.It\u2019s all very exciting, the way great possibilities are, and clearly full of great buzzwords and slogans. But will other companies see any value in all this or understand if A.I. has value for them?\u201cNo one really knows where the value is,\u201d said Marc Benioff, co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cI think I know \u2014 it\u2019s in helping people do the things that people are good at, and turning more things over to machines.\u201dMr. Benioff wasn\u2019t selling Einstein\u2019s capabilities short. He was talking about the long-term value of artificial intelligence, which is passing through a familiar phase \u2014 a technology that is strange and new, that sometimes overpromises what it can do and is headed for uses not easily seen at the start.Cloaked inside terms like deep learning and machine intelligence, A.I. is essentially a series of advanced statistics-based exercises that review the past to indicate the likely future, or look at current customer choices to figure out where to put more or less energy.Perhaps a better question than \u201cWhat is the value?\u201d of this explosion of advanced statistics is \u201cWhy now?\u201d That shows both the opportunity and why many companies are scared about missing out.Much of today\u2019s A.I. boom goes back to 2006, when Amazon started selling cheap computing over the internet. Those measures built the public clouds of Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, among others. That same year, Google and Yahoo released statistical methods for dealing with the unruly data of human behavior. In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone, a device that began a boom in unruly-data collection everywhere.Suddenly, old A.I. experiments were relevant, and money and cheap data resources were available for building new algorithms. Ten years later, computing is cheaper than ever, companies live online and in their phone apps, and sensors are bringing even more unruly data from more places.Amazon, Google and the rest have exceptional A.I. resources for sale, but many older companies are wary of turning their data over to these upstarts. That, along with fear of a competitor getting on top of A.I. first, is a big motivation for some to try things out.Salesforce is selling Einstein as a system that can work predictive magic without having to look at your data, in what Mr. Benioff calls a \u201cdemocratizing\u201d move that will create millions of A.I. users who are not engineers.He said this on his way to attend a series of customer focus groups around the country, however \u2014 strong evidence that customers don\u2019t get it yet, even if they\u2019re willing to try it.\u201cThere\u2019s fear of Google and Microsoft controlling everything, and there\u2019s a desire to apply A.I. to anything that\u2019s digital,\u201d said Michael Biltz, managing director of Accenture\u2019s technology vision practice. \u201cPeople are going to have to experiment, most likely first on pain points like security and product marketing.\u201dHow will we know when the A.I. revolution has taken hold? A technology truly matures when it disappears. We don\u2019t marvel at houses with electricity now, or the idea of driving to work at 60 miles an hour. We can say \u201cphone\u201d and mean a hand-held computer with NASA-level processing power and a professional-quality camera for taking selfies with our drones.A.I. is probably heading for the same places, invisibly sorting through lots of data everywhere to continuously update and automate most of our lives. Goodness knows what the weird new tech thing will be about at that point.Advertisement"}

Far from reasonable, it\u2019s been estimated by the Main Street Alliance that the proposed holiday rate would be a $20 billion gift to Apple.With their nearly unlimited access to capital and ability to buy in bulk, industry giants like Apple already hold a competitive edge over small to mid-sized businesses, which can\u2019t afford to hire high-priced tax accountants and lawyers to devise tax avoidance schemes.To level the playing field for Main Street businesses, Congress must act to end deferral, stop incentivizing offshoring of revenues with tax holidays, and hold all companies accountable to pay what they owe when they owe it.DEBORAH FIELDPortland, Ore.The writer, a small-business owner and former accountant, is a member of the Main Street Alliance.To the Editor:I find it infuriating that Apple, Microsoft, Google and many other highly successful so-called American companies have found legal ways to avoid paying anywhere close to a fair share of taxes on their profits. Their executives and shareholders win and the rest of us lose.I find it even more infuriating when pharmaceutical companies play the same tax avoidance game, but also jack up the prices of essential and unique medications by several hundred percent, and expect taxpayers to foot the bill through federal insurance programs.How many ordinary Americans are disadvantaged by these practices \u2014 people who are not earning the big bonuses and dividends generated by these practices, but rather have to pay the increased taxes to cover them? Come on, Congress, do something. At least pretend you represent the people.DON CARLSONBostonTo the Editor:Apple and other companies are only doing what our laws and those of their host countries abroad allow them to do. The problem, as you point out, lies with our own tax laws and enforcement. A way forward would be to apply basic accounting principles to reformulate our tax policies. These include:1. Profits should generally be taxed in the country in which business is conducted and profits are generated.2. Profits should be taxed in the year in which they are generated.3. Like individual American citizens, American businesses should be taxed at home each year on their combined \u201cworldwide\u201d income.4. Corporations should be entitled to an offsetting American credit for taxes paid to foreign countries if we have bilateral tax treaties with those countries. This should allow us to modify our current deferral policy of profits not taxed until repatriated.To further discourage tax inversion and offshore profit harboring, we must review our own tax rates and make them more competitive with other nations, while also persuading countries like Ireland that are members of the World Trade Organization not to adopt a very low-rate, tax haven or \u201cpirate\u201d status.CHERIAN THACHENKARYAtlantaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford\u2019s Driverless Car Plan: Embrace Tech and Go Slow", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 Raj Nair, the development chief leading Ford Motor\u2019s effort to build self-driving cars, concedes that he does not know what caused the fatal May accident in which the driver of a Tesla Model S sedan, operating in Autopilot mode, crashed into a tractor-trailer crossing a roadway in Florida.But Mr. Nair has given considerable thought to the circumstances \u2014 a truck turning left into traffic and a partially automated vehicle traveling at highway speed, leaving little room for miscalculation. He has pictured the car\u2019s camera looking ahead and struggling to make out a white truck against an overcast sky, its forward-looking radar beam possibly shooting under the truck\u2019s trailer.The conclusion he has drawn: The current state of even semiautonomous driving technology isn\u2019t quite ready to take on such a complex traffic situation. That is why Ford, which on Monday demonstrated its own approach to self-driving vehicles, said it was convinced by its decade of research to take a go-slow approach.\u201cWe\u2019ve not been able to do that with cameras and radar,\u201d Mr. Nair said of Autopilot. \u201cNot to the safety level we would be comfortable for introducing that into production.\u201dThe company provided the first public demonstration of the fleet of self-driving cars it is building at its sprawling engineering campus here, about 10 miles west of Detroit. Ford allowed reporters, analysts and other guests to take a ride in some of the 10 white Fusion sedans it has outfitted so far with tens of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of radar; lidar, a kind of radar based on laser beams; cameras; computer chips and other gear.Mr. Nair on Monday acknowledged that systems like Autopilot that use radar and cameras \u201ccertainly have prevented accidents.\u201dDespite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.But before cars can take over most of the driving for humans, more is needed, in Mr. Nair\u2019s view. That in particular includes lidar and high-definition digital maps that will help automated cars distinguish between overhead signs and an obstacle such as a tractor-trailer. Neither of those technologies are available with Tesla\u2019s system.\u201cWe believe lidar and a high-definition map are required,\u201d Mr. Nair said.During Monday\u2019s demonstrations, while Ford engineers sat in the driver\u2019s seat with hands off the steering wheel and feet off the pedals, the cars piloted themselves over a short, 10-minute loop, stopping when necessary for pedestrians, stop lights and intersections.During this reporter\u2019s demonstration ride, the Fusion came to a stop at a crosswalk. After a group of pedestrians had passed, the car began to edge forward but then hit its brakes again. Well off to the left, perhaps 10 feet from the crosswalk, a straggler was hurrying to catch up to the group. The car\u2019s lidar had spotted the man and the car sensed he was likely to dart into the road \u2014 and he did.\u201cThat\u2019s the benefit of lidar,\u201d said James McBride, a Ford engineer. Since radar looks forward, it might not notice a potential obstacle like a pedestrian entering from the side. But lidar scans across a wide field of vision, and is capable of picking up key details of an object, not just its shape, Mr. McBride said.\u201cLidar can make out the fingers on a pedestrian\u2019s hand,\u201d he said.Google, too, is incorporating lidar into its self-driving cars.The Ford cars used in the demonstration were outfitted with bulky lidar systems mounted on their roofs. Within about a month, though, the company plans to assemble self-driving Fusions with two lidar units that will be slightly larger than hockey pucks.Ford expects its experimental fleet of self-driving cars to grow to 30 by the end of the year, and it expects to have three times that number by the end of 2017.By 2021, the company has vowed to start production of a driverless car, with no steering wheel, and have it in use by a ride-hailing company in an Uber-like service.Advertisement"}
