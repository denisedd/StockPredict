{"Headline": "Venture Communism: How China Is Building a Start-Up Boom", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANGZHOU, China \u2014 In Dream Town, a collection of boxy office buildings on the gritty edge of this historic city, one tiny company is developing a portable 3-D printer. Another takes orders for traditional Chinese massages by smartphone. They are just two of the 710 start-ups being nurtured here.Anywhere else, an incubator like Dream Town would be a vision of venture capitalists, angel investors or technology stalwarts. But this is China. The Chinese Communist Party doesn\u2019t trust the invisible hand of capitalism alone to encourage entrepreneurship, especially since it is a big part of the leadership\u2019s strategy to reshape the sagging economy.Which is why the government of Hangzhou \u2014 a former royal capital that has been a major commercial hub for more than a millennium \u2014 built Dream Town and lavishes resources on start-ups. The businesses here get a slate of benefits like subsidized rent, cash handouts and special training, all courtesy of the city.Chemayi, which offers car repair services through a smartphone app, is staying rent-free at Dream Town for three years and is applying for as much as $450,000 in subsidies from city authorities to help pay salaries and buy equipment.\u201cFrom the central government all the way down to local governments, we have seen a lot of warm support,\u201d said Li Liheng, co-founder and chief executive of Chemayi.For much of China\u2019s long economic boom, young people flocked to manufacturing zones for jobs making bluejeans or iPhones. But today China is trying to move beyond just being the world\u2019s factory floor. Policy makers want the next generation to find better-paying work in modern offices, creating the ideas, technologies and jobs to feed the country\u2019s future growth.Premier Li Keqiang frequently calls for \u201cmass entrepreneurship.\u201d In March at the National People\u2019s Congress, he bragged that 12,000 new companies were founded each day in 2015.The entrepreneurial embrace comes with lots of financial support. Across the country, officials are creating investment funds, providing cash subsidies and building incubators.\u201cWithout these kinds of subsidies, you only rely on private money, and you wouldn\u2019t see so many technology start-ups happening today,\u201d said Ning Tao, a partner at Innovation Works, a venture capital fund in Beijing. \u201cWithout quantity, you cannot have quality.\u201dBut the heavy spending is adding to worries about an inflating bubble in the world of China\u2019s tiniest companies. Along with the government funds, venture capital money is flooding the country. About $49 billion in deals were made last year, making China second only to the United States, according to the accounting firm Ernst & Young.Some economists and entrepreneurs are concerned that the government is helping fuel a frenzy that might ultimately result in failed businesses, wasted resources and financial losses. Just one city, Suzhou, near Shanghai, has announced it will open 300 incubators by 2020 to house 30,000 start-ups.Beijing\u2019s policy makers have a long history of giving favored companies easy access to loans and subsidies to propel certain industries, with both good and bad consequences. Though that tactic lubricated the nation\u2019s industrialization, it also contributed to the excess that has buried the country in empty apartment blocks, mothballed cement plants and sputtering steel mills \u2014 all of which threaten the economy\u2019s stability.\u201cI think the subsidies shouldn\u2019t be a long-term policy,\u201d Jin Xiangrong, an economist at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, said of the start-up support programs. \u201cThey can lead to overcapacity like the kind we see now in China\u2019s manufacturing sector, which is largely a result of government support.\u201dHangzhou city officials turned down requests for interviews.At Dream Town, Mr. Li, 39, frets more about his own business. He got the initial idea for Chemayi in 2009 after a car accident. To find a trustworthy mechanic, he searched online, asked friends for advice and visited repair shops.But Mr. Li found it difficult to judge who was reliable. A car culture \u2014 and all the services that come with it \u2014 is relatively new in China.Aiming to fill the information void, he and three friends set up Chemayi in 2013 with 5 million renminbi (currently $750,000) of their own money. For an annual fee, Chemayi sends out staff members to help fix flat tires, paint scratches or repair broken-down engines.\u201cHenry Ford is gone for so many years, but we are still driving his cars,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cI felt that I also must pursue a cause that will persist after I\u2019m gone.\u201dChemayi beat out more than two dozen other start-ups for a coveted space in Dream Town in a 2014 competition. Another co-founder, Ouyang Feng, delivered a 40-minute presentation to a panel of judges who peppered him with questions about Chemayi\u2019s business model and future prospects. The provincial governor watched over the grilling.In the end, the committee awarded Chemayi a three-foot golden key that symbolically opened the doors to Dream Town.Chemayi now has 284 employees in four cities, with plans to reach 1,000 by the end of the year. Mr. Li said his company had raised $22 million in private money and turned a profit of about 10 million renminbi last year.\u201cA lot of Chinese people want to be successful. They want to initiate change through innovation,\u201d Mr. Li said in his spacious corner office, while fussing with a traditional Chinese wooden tea-making set. \u201cThat is a formidable power.\u201dHangzhou is a natural center for China\u2019s start-up fever. After China embraced capitalist reform in the 1980s, Zhejiang province, of which Hangzhou is the capital, emerged as a leading base for the export industries that fueled the country\u2019s rapid growth. Factories pumped out products like socks and plastic Christmas trees.Now that zeal for commerce is being channeled into technology start-ups. Hangzhou is home to China\u2019s most famous internet company, the e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has become a training ground for would-be entrepreneurs.The neighborhoods near Alibaba\u2019s sprawling campus, once a poorly developed area on the city\u2019s outskirts, now make up a budding tech center with newly built office parks like Dream Town, dominated by ambitious college graduates, angel investors and venture capitalists. The local restaurants have become hangouts to exchange ideas and gossip over fried squid and stewed pork and eggs.Feng Xiao is typical of this new breed. Mr. Feng, 39 and a Hangzhou native, spent 11 years at Alibaba, mainly in sales and marketing.\u201cThere is a Chinese proverb, \u2018The soil is too rich,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feng said. Alibaba \u201coffered you a lot of opportunities. It was easy to have a sense of success. But I wanted to be able to start from scratch.\u201dHis start-up was born in Alibaba\u2019s cafeteria, where he ate meal after meal. \u201cI really missed Mom\u2019s cooking,\u201d he said. He figured that many other people, trapped working for long hours far from home, felt the same.Mr. Feng and two other Alibaba employees left their jobs in 2014 and opened a food delivery service, Mishi. Their plan was to connect people willing to prepare homemade meals with on-the-go professionals who were too busy to cook. They set up shop in a friend\u2019s empty house, decorated with secondhand furniture and photos from home.Along with raising $19 million from private investors, Mishi caught the eye of the Hangzhou city government. In 2014, district officials awarded Mishi 5 million renminbi to help pay the bills. Its rent in a Hangzhou office park is also subsidized.\u201cThe most important thing on the part of the government is whether they are open\u201d to new types of businesses, Mr. Feng said. \u201cWe are glad to see they are aggressively supporting us.\u201dHangzhou represents what Chinese leaders see as the nation\u2019s economic future. The country used to generate astronomical growth rates by depending heavily on low-cost exports and extremely high investment in apartment towers, factories and highways. China built so many steel mills that it can produce 10 times as much steel as the United States.But today, costs are rising, eating away at the competitiveness of many export industries. The long investment boom has saddled the economy with too many factories and a mountain of debt.Instead, policy makers are encouraging a shift to new growth engines, like services and high tech. The entrepreneurial focus is providing an economic boost for Hangzhou.The city\u2019s gross domestic product rose 10.2 percent in 2015, compared with the 6.9 percent national growth rate. Hangzhou\u2019s service sector, which includes many start-ups, was the main engine of that strong performance, surging 14.6 percent.\u201cThe Chinese know that state-owned enterprises are not going to employ everybody,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at GGV Capital, a venture capital firm that operates in both Silicon Valley and China. \u201cThey need young people to create jobs for themselves, so they are encouraging them to try something new.\u201dMishi, the food delivery start-up, has created 100 full-time jobs, and has bolstered the incomes of more than 10,000 home chefs.Cai Liangen, a retired businessman turned Mishi cook, learned about the start-up when a marketing team visited his apartment complex seeking to enlist new chefs.Last November, he and his wife began making local specialties in their kitchen, including a sliced pork dish prepared with \u201cmy mother\u2019s secret recipe,\u201d Mr. Cai said. They now receive 40 orders a day and earn 5,000 renminbi a month, increasing their total income 70 percent.\u201cWe do it because we love to cook,\u201d Mr. Cai said, \u201cbut the money is good to have, too.\u201dAfter submitting a 10-page proposal in 2014 to join a Hangzhou incubator, Ai Binke sat nervously before a committee of tech industry executives who questioned his future prospects. His software company, Yun Ran Internet of Things, had only four employees, and its business deals had been small. But his start-up, Mr. Ai explained to the committee, had great potential.That was sufficient for the judges to award him 100,000 renminbi in subsidies. The bulk, roughly 70 percent, was instantly transferred into his corporate bank account. \u201cAs long as you run projects that are encouraged by the Hangzhou government, you can get the subsidies,\u201d said Mr. Ai, 29. \u201cIt\u2019s not very difficult.\u201dLocal governments around China are spending heavily on start-ups. In Shenzhen, authorities are offering to subsidize up to 70 percent of rent for \u201ccreative\u201d start-ups. Local officials in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu are setting up a 200 million renminbi \u201centrepreneurship and innovation development fund\u201d and promising subsidies of up to 5 million renminbi.Officials in Guangdong province in China\u2019s south will cover part of a start-up\u2019s losses. Even the lesser-known city of Yingtan, in an area of Jiangxi province mainly known for its ancient Taoist temples, is planning to build an incubator.Hangzhou\u2019s government has been one of the more active. Officials are forming a venture capital fund of 4.7 billion renminbi , with contributions from companies, according to the city\u2019s website. This year, Hangzhou announced that it would give 100 million renminbi annually to help start-ups pay expenses.But governments historically have a spotty record of using state-directed money to generate business success stories.In China, government efforts to assist new businesses have often led to waste and excess. Too much investment pours into favored industries, spawning poorly conceived projects in areas like hotels and solar panels. By trying to spur start-ups, the state is also engaging in a high-risk business that even for the most experienced venture capitalist is prone to produce more failures than successes.Hangzhou officials are trying to avoid such pitfalls. At Dream Town, the financial aid is often linked to a start-up\u2019s performance. The amount of free rent depends on how much private capital a company can raise. Cash handouts are tied to revenue targets or top-selling apps.Government officials also enlist professionals to help allocate the city\u2019s money. The committee that judges applicants to Dream Town is usually made up of tech executives, financiers and academics.Ye Feng, a manager at another incubator who has sat as a judge on three occasions, said she quizzed the contenders on their technology, business plan and even product pricing.Usually about 30 start-ups appear at each competition. No more than four make the cut to enter Dream Town. \u201cThe competition is quite fierce,\u201d Ms. Ye said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to make a decision.\u201dBut some in Hangzhou fear that the government is doling out too much money, and it is flowing to start-ups with weak business plans and feeble prospects. Mr. Ai of Yun Ran said that two neighbors also received city subsidies. One, a robotics start-up, failed to attract private capital and closed, while the other, a mobile game company, is struggling to stay afloat as its business withers.The government money, Mr. Ai said, often cannot replace the private capital necessary for start-ups. \u201cWithout financing, it would be very hard for them to survive,\u201d he said.Owen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What if \u2018One Click\u2019 Buying Were Internetwide?", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Paying for things online can be cumbersome. Even the man who invented the web, Tim Berners-Lee, says he frequently throws up his hands.\u201cSometimes I will think that I bought something and I press the button, \u2018Buy this,\u2019 and I don\u2019t realize it didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said in a recent interview. \u201cWe are long overdue for a payments user interface for the web.\u201dResponding to the frustrations of Mr. Berners-Lee and hundreds of millions of online shoppers, the web\u2019s governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, has brought together the giants of the internet including Google, Facebook and Apple to fix the clumsiness of paying for things online.Now, a new global standard for online payments \u2014 a sort of Amazon one-click payment system for the entire internet \u2014 is being completed by the consortium and its members.Google, one of the authors of the standard, has recently introduced it in certain new versions of its Chrome browser. Other browser companies have said they intend to follow.The standard will provide a uniform way for users to input their credit cards and payment systems to any web browser so that they can be used for any purchase on the web. After the card details are entered once, they will automatically be called up as choices for all future transactions.This will be somewhat like the existing auto-fill functions that browsers have. But with the new standard, all the data fields will be filled in invisibly, requiring just one click.On the security side, rather than sending along all the credit card details, the browser will generate a one-time payment token that will avoid leaving your credit card number in countless databases around the world.Numerous efforts to modernize the payment system have failed to take off. And this one could fizzle, too, if online merchants, web browsers or consumers fail to adopt the new standard.The new standard will also face competition from the Amazons and PayPals of the world, as well as from the credit card networks, all of which want to be the primary destination for payments, rather than just one option.But payment analysts are hopeful about the new effort because it will not require consumers or merchants to use a new method of payment. Instead it will be equally open to any existing card or payment app, and it will channel them into a single place that most consumers already use \u2014 the web browser \u2014 where everything can be stored and used.\u201cInstead of simplifying the world, we have been fragmenting it into a million apps,\u201d said Eric Shea, a payments consultant at Kurt Salmon Digital. \u201cIf we can get back to that single integrated solution that everyone has on their phone and their desktop, that is the way to move forward and get adoption.\u201dDave Birch, a consultant who has been working on electronic payments for over two decades, said the web browser stood the best chance of providing a unified and more secure portal for payments.\u201cThere\u2019s a convergence going on,\u201d said Mr. Birch, who currently works for Consult Hyperion. \u201cIn the future you will have one experience \u2014 it won\u2019t matter if you are at the store or on the phone. It will pop up on your phone, you will put your thumb on it and you will be done.\u201dThe W3C project represents a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, the current giants of online payments. Both have gained business and fees with their more streamlined checkout processes.Neither company has participated in the current W3C effort and they are likely to continue to provide an alternative to customers who don\u2019t want to enter their details into their browsers.But the W3C has managed to bring in about 40 of the biggest players in online commerce, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and American Express as well as Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent.All met last week in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the specifications that they will introduce on different time frames to users around the world.In the version that Google released, when customers shopping at participating merchants hit the buy button, they are given a drop-down menu of their stored shipping addresses and credit cards.The customer can click on the address and card to be used, enter the three-digit security code on the card and hit \u201cpay now.\u201d Other browser companies may choose to use a fingerprint instead of the security code.\u201cWe wanted to remove what we jokingly call the Nascar effect of checkout, where you see five or seven logos for the different cards and payment methods you can use,\u201d said Zach Koch, the top Google executive on the project. \u201cThis is really fast, where a user can say, \u2018Tap, tap, buy.\u2019\u201dThe fees from transactions will still go to existing financial institutions like credit card companies and banks, unless customers choose a new online payment method like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. Apple Pay takes a piece of each transaction; Samsung Pay does not.But the bigger goal behind the W3C project is to create a standard, seamless and secure way to pay for things electronically in a future that will most likely include virtual reality stores, chat-based transactions and machines making payments to other machines (an autonomous car paying for a parking spot, for instance).The standard will also make it easy to include new payment methods like Bitcoin or the Chinese payment provider Tencent.\u201cThis involves quite radical changes to the way people think about payments,\u201d said Ian Jacobs, the W3C staff member leading the effort. \u201cAs a standards body it is our job to be sure it is an open playing field.\u201dThe need to create a better way to pay for things online was evident from the web\u2019s beginnings in the 1990s, Mr. Berners-Lee said. At some of the earliest meetings of the W3C, which he founded, there were discussions about creating a way to pay for things online that didn\u2019t require people to send credit card details over the internet.The failure to come up with a standard and secure way to do this led to the hodgepodge of payment screens consumers encounter today. It also made an opening for PayPal, which created a way for shoppers to pay on different sites using a single password.Mr. Birch said the main hurdle to accomplishing more seamless payments in the past was online merchants, who did not want to give up control over any part of the checkout process.But merchants have expressed increasing frustration with the high rate of abandoned online transactions and the frequency of credit card fraud.More than half of online purchases now happen on mobile phones, but Shopify has said that only 40 percent of the customers who start filling a shopping cart online finish their transactions.Shopify, which manages the online stores and checkout processes for 300,000 merchants, has been closely involved with the W3C effort and is planning to immediately offer the new standard to its merchants, as is Groupon.\u201cWe are betting a lot on it,\u201d said Jason Normore, the director of engineering at Shopify. \u201cEven though it cuts out a piece of our offering, it makes commerce better for everyone.\u201dApple will be one of the most interesting players to watch, given that it has both the Safari browser, which is part of the W3C effort, and Apple Pay, which could be seen as a competing offering.In the new operating system that Apple released last week, it is possible, for the first time, to shop online using the Safari browser and check out with Apple Pay. After hitting \u201cPay With Apple Pay,\u201d the customer is asked to provide a fingerprint on a phone, and the transaction is complete.The W3C standard will provide a similar experience on any browser \u2014 on a computer or phone \u2014 but will also allow customers to choose from any credit card or payment method they have entered into their browsers.Apple has so far been a part of the W3C group writing the standards, which will allow it to integrate non-Apple Pay choices into its browser.Mr. Berners-Lee said he hoped that more standardized payments would open up new types of online commerce that aren\u2019t possible now. He has long been interested in micropayments that would allow newspapers or small producers of content to be paid a few cents at a time, which isn\u2019t possible in a world with only credit cards.\u201cDifferent things call for different payments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are all interoperable you can separate the market for goods being sold from the payment back end.\u201dAn article on Monday about one-click shopping on the internet misstated the fee structure of one online payment method. While Apple Pay charges a fee on each transaction, Samsung Pay does not.Advertisement"}

The company, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, is selling part of its China business to Alibaba\u2019s mobile-payments affiliate and a private-equity firm run by Fred Hu, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs China. They bring valuable technology skill and connections. It is a better deal than usual for so-called cornerstone investors, but may pay off for Yum\u2019s coming spinoff.Mr. Hu\u2019s Primavera Capital and Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Financial, which operates Alipay, are investing $410 million and $50 million in Yum China. In return, they will together receive 4.3 percent to 5.9 percent of the company. That implies a wide valuation of $8.5 billion to $11.6 billion for the enterprise. Their final stakes will depend on where Yum China\u2019s shares trade when they are listed separately, a flotation planned for next month.However things shake out, the new owners will buy in at an 8 percent discount to other shareholders. Standard anchor investors usually come in at a fixed value rather than a floating one linked to the market price. To secure brand names like Mr. Ma and Mr. Hu, after losing other potential backers, Yum was a little more flexible, throwing in warrants for more shares, too.Ant\u2019s e-commerce knowledge could help Yum compete in a market where consumers increasingly make transactions on phones. The two companies already are talking about collaborating, with Ant touting its big data capabilities and ways to shorten lines at KFC.Yum also secured other beneficial restrictions. For example, Primavera and Ant are not permitted to own more than one-fifth of Yum China. The new investors may have secured a tasty deal for themselves and may also give the coming sale a little extra flavor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I.P.O. for Postal Savings Bank of China Gets Help From Beijing", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s biggest banks are struggling with a slowing economy, rising bad debts and shrinking profits.So to raise more than $7 billion in the world\u2019s largest new share sale in two years, a stodgy Chinese bank has sought a little help from its friends.But only a fraction of those shares will be held by nongovernment investors, as Chinese state-run companies have already pledged to buy up most of them.The big I.P.O. is shining a light on the practice, called cornerstone investing, of inviting big investors to buy up large chunks of shares before a company goes public. Though it is less common in other markets, it has been increasingly used by Chinese state firms going public in Hong Kong, where government-controlled companies purchase growing numbers of shares to ensure a smooth offering.Banks tend to go along with the practice because it helps get deals done, but it has come under criticism in the past because it can give plugged-in investors preferential access to new offerings.Postal Savings Bank declined to comment.On the face of it, the I.P.O. recalls a period a decade ago, when an initial wave of offerings by China\u2019s biggest state banks on overseas stock markets resulted in megalistings attracting eager investors among foreign funds and Wall Street banks.Optimism about China\u2019s banks soared with the country\u2019s double-digit economic growth rates, and lenders like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and the Bank of China surpassed traditional names like Citigroup and Bank of America to become the biggest banks in the world by market value.That enthusiasm has been replaced by an increasing wariness of problems with China\u2019s traditional growth model, which relied heavily on state-directed investment to support economic growth. That led to mountains of debt and rampant industrial overcapacity in areas like mining, steel making and other manufacturing businesses.Shares in China\u2019s big banks now trade at less than the reported value of their assets \u2014 a signal that investors do not believe the banks\u2019 books or that they expect more problem loans will crop up.With Postal Savings Bank, more than 75 percent of the shares in the bank\u2019s I.P.O. were presold to so-called cornerstone investors, big buyers that get priority by promising not to sell their stakes for six months. All six cornerstone investors in the deal are entities affiliated with the Chinese government.That state support included about $2 billion from China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation and investments from Shanghai\u2019s main port operator, a regional airline operator and the country\u2019s main power grid company.The postal bank I.P.O. comes amid a relative lull in big listings in Hong Kong. And the deals that have gone through have increasingly relied on cornerstones \u2014 a sign that underlying demand from retail or small investors may be lackluster.For example, cornerstone investors accounted for nearly 80 percent of the shares offered in the June listing of CDB Leasing, a state-backed aircraft leasing company. Last month, Everbright Securities, a state-controlled brokerage, sold nearly 70 percent of its I.P.O. to cornerstones.Last year, cornerstone investors accounted for a record 41 percent of all I.P.O.s in Hong Kong, according to figures from Dealogic, a financial data provider. The previous high was 36 percent in 2012, a difficult year for new listings.Cornerstones last year bought almost $14 billion worth of the $33.6 billion in shares sold through 49 new listings in the city, according to Dealogic.The growing influence of cornerstones in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny, but so far regulators and lawmakers have taken a relatively hands-off approach.\u201cOne undesirable side effect of I.P.O. cornerstone investment is that it takes the pricing process further away from the normal market forces and may have a distortive effect on the company\u2019s market value,\u201d the council wrote in its recommendations.To date, Hong Kong regulators have not moved to limit cornerstone investing. A spokesman for the stock exchange said on Wednesday that it had researched the issue and \u201cfound no conclusive evidence that cornerstone investments narrow the shareholder base.\u201d He added that after last year\u2019s review, the listing committee \u201cdecided that no additional regulation is warranted at this stage.\u201dPostal Savings Bank agreed to sell 12.1 billion shares at 4.76 Hong Kong dollars each, near the bottom of the market range. The offering was helped along by an unusually high number of underwriters \u2014 26 banks in total worked on the deal.Emily Feng contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
