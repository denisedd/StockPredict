Facebook might, too. WhatsApp could have to follow tougher telecom standards.A new set of rules, expected to be unveiled by European Union officials on Wednesday, is likely to put new pressure on American tech companies.Europe calls it consumer protection. Silicon Valley calls it protectionism.In some ways, they are both right.The aim? To give the bloc\u2019s roughly 500 million consumers unfettered access to services like movie streaming, online shopping and cloud computing, no matter where they live. At the same time, the proposals would force some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies to comply with stringent competition, privacy and copyright rules.For many executives from American tech companies, such plans, which will still take years to come into effect and which will be subject to intense lobbying, feel like another round of protectionism. And while Europe\u2019s policy makers balk at these claims, the fact that Google, Facebook and Microsoft, among others, will be the most affected by the digital revamp has again highlighted how much Europeans rely on American tech when using digital services in their daily lives.The plans to be announced by the Brussels-based European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, include:The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u25a0 Providing financial incentives to telecom operators like Deutsche Telekom and Orange to invest in the region\u2019s mobile and broadband networks. Operators may be given greater control over their internet infrastructure, potentially restricting competitors\u2019 use of these networks. Companies say such limits are needed to guarantee a return on the billions of dollars of digital investment. Consumer groups argue that it may lead to higher prices.Europe\u2019s proposals, which could still be subject to last-minute changes before being published, were confirmed by six people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the reforms had not yet been made public.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact of life that most innovative companies come from the West Coast,\u201d said Andrej Savin, an internet governance professor at the Copenhagen Business School. \u201cThe proposals coming from Brussels definitely have the American companies in mind.\u201dWith a roughly 90 percent market share, Google\u2019s search engine in Europe is more dominant than it is in the United States, where Microsoft\u2019s Bing service still holds its own.

{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Challenge to Government Secrecy Wins Dozens of Supporters", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Dozens of allies threw their weight behind Microsoft on Friday in a case that challenges law enforcement\u2019s use of secrecy orders to cloak its pursuit of digital communications in investigations.Amazon, Google, Snapchat, Salesforce and several others filed a brief on Friday in support of Microsoft in its case against the United States Justice Department, while Apple, Mozilla and others made their own filing. Civil liberties groups and media organizations like Fox News, National Public Radio and The Washington Post submitted their own briefs.Microsoft\u2019s effort to rally support is part of a growing resistance by technology companies to government attempts to snoop on the electronic communications of their customers.In a statement, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company was grateful for the support from what it expected to total 80 signatories on multiple briefs by the end of the day. He noted the diversity of backgrounds of the signatories, saying, \u201cit\u2019s not every day that Fox News and the A.C.L.U. are on the same side of an issue.\u201d\u201cWe believe the constitutional rights at stake in this case are of fundamental importance, and people should know when the government accesses their emails unless secrecy is truly needed,\u201d Mr. Smith added.Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department, declined to comment.Microsoft said the secrecy orders violated the Fourth Amendment, which grants people and businesses the right to know if the government seizes or searches their property, along with the company\u2019s First Amendment right to communicate with its customers.Technology companies are concerned that secrecy orders are especially troubling in the era of cloud computing. \u201cIn contrast to a search of a home or a seizure of physical property, there may be no way for a user to detect that the provider has disclosed information stored in the account to the government,\u201d the brief filed by Amazon, Google and others said.The Microsoft lawsuit is different in that it does not center on any individual case, but instead is aimed at the legal process the government uses to keep its information requests secret.The company said such secrecy orders are becoming more frequent. In its lawsuit, Microsoft said of the more than 5,600 federal demands for customer data it received between September 2014 and March 2016, nearly half were accompanied by secrecy orders that prevented Microsoft from telling affected customers that it had turned over their information to the government.Microsoft executives have said they appreciate the necessity of secrecy orders in some cases. But they have criticized as too low the bar that prosecutors must meet to obtain a secrecy order from courts.Microsoft is also concerned about the absence of time limits on when it can disclose to customers that the government has obtained their communications. For physical searches of files and the like, most secrecy orders delay notification for a limited period of time, often one to three months.\u201cLaw enforcement officials have no practical need to keep their searches secret indefinitely, except in the rarest of circumstances, which must be supported by particularized need,\u201d read the brief filed Friday by former United States attorneys supporting Microsoft.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does the Messaging Service Telegram Take Privacy Too Far?", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropePARIS \u2014 The encryption of digital information is considered the best protection against hackers, snoops or potential enemies looking to poke around into private exchanges of all sorts.That is why technology experts and privacy advocates in Europe went on high alert last month when the French Ministry of the Interior suggested that it might limit encryption as part of the fight against terrorist threats.Mr. Cazeneuve named one such service: Telegram, a three-year-old messaging application, that is a favorite of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years.Telegram\u2019s vaunted privacy safeguards, involving multiple servers in different countries, are designed to prevent access to information about its users, even by the service itself.At the news conference, Mr. Cazeneuve admitted as much but claimed that French investigators, armed with a court order, had been unable to even contact \u201can interlocutor\u201d at Telegram.In response to a query on his Telegram account, Pavel Durov, co-founder of the service, batted back the widely reported French claims.\u201cWe haven\u2019t received any such request and have no idea what the French officials are after,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn any case, Telegram Secret Chats and information on them are not logged on our servers.\u201dMr. Durov\u2019s background explains his die-hard libertarian attitude on privacy. He left his native Russia in 2014 after refusing to give intelligence information about Ukrainian protesters.However, most privacy advocates agree that messaging services should cooperate with court-issued warrants, even if they are unable to provide investigators with complete information about their users.\u201cThere is an issue with Telegram,\u201d said Mounir Mahjoubi, president of the National Digital Council, an independent advisory group established by former President Nicolas Sarkozy that focuses on privacy issues. \u201cThey had done everything to make it a technological nightmare to find where their server is.\u201dAt a time of heightened public anxiety over terrorism, technology companies and privacy advocates are wary about politicians looking to mandate \u201cback door\u201d access to encrypted data.This, they say, would not only violate privacy rights but put the wider public at an even greater risk, leaving users even more vulnerable to terrorists and other criminals.Mr. Mahjoubi, for one, supports alternative approaches, such as an international network that could call on judges in individual countries to swiftly react to requests from antiterrorism investigators.These ideas also are also backed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a lobbying organization that counts Amazon, Google and Microsoft among its members.\u201cCyberspace blurs the notion of national jurisdictions, and companies are caught in the middle,\u201d said Christian Borggreen, the organization\u2019s Europe director. \u201cThe tech industry encourages like-minded nations to develop international frameworks for quicker response to law enforcement requests while respecting users\u2019 right and the rule of law.\u201dThat kind of targeted approach \u2014 aimed at criminals, not at privacy \u2014 would be more effective than a blank check for law enforcement to break open encoded messages, Mr. Mahjoubi said.\u201cI am deeply and heartily against any effort to limit encryption,\u201d he said, \u201cand I will fight my whole life against that possibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "African Elephant Population Dropped 30 Percent in 7 Years", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe African elephant population is in drastic decline, having shrunk about 30 percent from 2007 to 2014, according to a survey published this week.The deterioration is accelerating: Largely because of poaching, the population is dropping 8 percent a year, according to the Great Elephant Census, which was released on Wednesday.Patricia Awori, an official with the African Elephant Coalition, said, \u201cThese numbers are shocking for elephants across the continent.\u201d She added, \u201cIt proves that an urgent, cohesive, Africa-wide approach is required to save them.\u201dStarting in early 2014, teams of researchers fanned out across Africa in several dozen airplanes covering nearly 290,000 miles in a quest to sample the continent\u2019s elephant population. They counted about 352,000 savanna elephants along the way, accounting for 93 percent of all those remaining in the 18 countries surveyed. More than half live in Botswana and Zimbabwe.The researchers also counted elephant carcasses, finding an estimated 12 for every 100 living elephants \u2014 an unsustainable level \u2014 suggesting that the continent\u2019s population is in decline. The count was compared with historical data to estimate the change since 2007, a turning point for the elephant population, which had grown over the previous dozen years.David Banks, the Nature Conservancy\u2019s Africa program director, said: \u201cWe knew that the situation was bad on the ground, but the results are worse than expected.\u201d He added, \u201cEven if poaching is stopped cold right now, it\u2019ll take decades for populations to recover.\u201dIn some cases, human encroachment appears to have forced elephants to adapt their behavior. This year, an elephant named Morgan and fitted with a GPS tracking collar surprised the researchers when he entered war-torn Somalia from Kenya and managed to live. They credited his survival to the fact that he moved mostly by night, resting in thick bush during the day.But Morgan\u2019s story is just one hopeful tale. The researchers maintain that elephants can\u2019t survive without stronger conservation efforts.\u201cWorrying won\u2019t save elephants,\u201d said Cristi\u00e1n Samper, the president and chief executive of the Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cEnactment of solutions will, and we know the solutions: strong governance, funding for rangers and closing down ivory markets among them.\u201dTo raise awareness, Mr. Allen\u2019s Vulcan Productions is releasing two movies this year, a feature documentary on the ivory trade and the true story of a baby elephant born into a rehabilitation program in Botswana.\u201cWe have been making desperate cries to the world that all is not well for the African elephant across the continent and feel sad that the results vindicate our position,\u201d Paul Udoto, a spokesman for Kenya Wildlife Service, said of the census.\u201cIt\u2019s another golden chance for the world to unite and give elephants a new lease on life and save them from the inexorable descent into extinction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Is Said to Be Discussing a Possible Takeover", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter has long positioned itself as a global town square where anyone \u2014 celebrities, politicians, athletes, and you and me \u2014 can chat in 140-character messages and find out about whatever is happening in the moment.But with that premise not drawing enough new people to the social media service, Twitter is now rethinking whether it can survive as an independent company and is exploring several strategic options.Twitter, based in San Francisco, is talking with Salesforce.com, Google and others about a possible takeover of the company, people briefed on the discussions said on Friday. The talks are in the early stages, these people said, with no guarantee that a deal will be reached. In particular, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, is resistant to selling to some of the potential acquirers, they said.Twitter is also weighing a possible revamping that could involve divestitures and layoffs, the people said. Two divisions that Twitter is considering divesting itself of are Vine, the mobile six-second video service, and MoPub, a mobile advertising business, they said. The company is working with the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen & Company on its options.For two years, Twitter has been casting about for ways to attract new users and to become a social media destination on the order of Facebook. While people initially flocked to Twitter, its new-user growth has slowed sharply as people complained about how difficult it was to use the service. At the same time, Facebook and its suite of offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger continued to outpace Twitter in user growth and profitability, while five-year-old Snapchat has become the newest darling of the social media world.Lack of growth also began to erode advertiser demand, which had remained robust even as Twitter\u2019s overall number of users stagnated at around 313 million people. Advertisers aiming for big audiences tended to choose Facebook, while those looking for younger audiences have the option of Snapchat.Twitter has endured internal turmoil and a revolving door of executives and board members. Mr. Dorsey, a co-founder who became permanent chief executive of Twitter almost a year ago, has vowed to turn it around by making it easier to use and by emphasizing real-time elements that could make it more essential to people.But after several false starts, critics are skeptical that these efforts will work.On Friday, how interested Google or Salesforce might be in buying Twitter, along with the identities of other possible bidders, became something of a parlor guessing game in Silicon Valley. Google\u2019s name has surfaced in the past as a logical buyer because of the internet search company\u2019s size and digital portfolio. Media companies have also been considered possible suitors.Why Salesforce might be interested in Twitter was a head-scratcher to some people. Salesforce is an enterprise technology company that focuses on businesses and not individuals, as Twitter does.But Salesforce has publicly expressed interest in owning a social network, which the company believes can bolster its main business of selling software and services to business clients. Many companies use Twitter to handle customer service requests and complaints, for example.Compared with its social media and internet peers, Twitter is more susceptible to a takeover because it has only one class of stock. Companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, have multiple classes of shares, which gives their founders tight control over their companies and guarantee independence.Twitter has $3.6 billion in cash on hand and $1.6 billion of debt, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. Microsoft paid a premium of nearly 50 percent for LinkedIn, although any sale of Twitter is unlikely to bring such a rich price.Leslie Picker and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The city rode high during America\u2019s industrialization, enabling Andrew Carnegie to fund Carnegie Mellon. He also built the first of his famous public libraries in nearby Braddock, which was hit by the steel bust that set Pittsburgh back for decades.Other parts of the city have come back, in part because of the insurance and health care industries that have made Pittsburgh home. The experience of losing out from one economic cycle, however, very likely shapes how much Pittsburgh views getting in early on the next one.In that case, the towns also look for a big economic bump from sponsoring some part of our computing-intensive future, but it does not turn out that way: Data centers are exceptionally automated, with just a few highly skilled jobs, and even fewer jobs in security and maintenance that match the local skill sets.As robotics catch on, there will be even fewer positions in the data centers.

{"Headline": "Dell Gets Bigger and Hewlett Packard Gets Smaller in Separate Deals", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Michael Dell and Meg Whitman may be business competitors, but they can each claim a technology industry superlative. One has overseen one of the largest mergers in the tech industry. The other has engineered its biggest breakup.Different as they seem, both deals were in reaction to tough competition and declining markets. And so far, neither has provided a clear way for how a storied giant can survive changes like the rise of so-called cloud computing that are undermining the way they operate.On Wednesday, Mr. Dell, who 32 years ago started a personal computer business from his college dorm room, officially completed his giant $67 billion merger with EMC, a data storage company with interests in software and security. He also changed the name of his operation to Dell Technologies.Later in the day, Ms. Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, announced a sale of most of her company\u2019s software assets to a British outfit called Micro Focus for about $8.8 billion. H.P.E. also announced higher earnings in the company\u2019s most recent quarter, but a decline in revenue from the same period a year ago.Shares of H.P.E. moved down about 2 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday evening.H.P.E. itself is a $36 billion computing giant created last year from half of Hewlett-Packard, a record separation that ended one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most iconic companies and neatly mirrored Mr. Dell\u2019s move. The other half of the old company, which specializes in PC and printer sales, is now called HP Inc.With a constant mantra of building shareholder value, Ms. Whitman, who a year ago talked about growth strategies for H.P.E., has sold off big parts of the empire she took over five years ago. Last May, this involved selling off her services group, which employed 110,000 people. In an interview, Ms. Whitman said that after that sale, by the end of October, H.P.E. would have between 50,000 and 60,000 employees.\u201cWe have to understand our place in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are elements of our world that are shrinking.\u201dMr. Dell\u2019s move in the other direction has meant taking his company private, in the process taking on $33.4 billion in long-term debt at relatively little personal risk. He owns 70 percent of Dell Technologies, a company he is counting on to throw off a lot of cash to quickly repay the debt, even as the overall business computing industry shrinks.If his gambit succeeds, within a few years he could multiply by several times his personal fortune, already estimated at $18.5 billion, according to Bloomberg.Dell Technologies starts life with revenue of $74 billion and 140,000 employees, but in an interview on Wednesday Mr. Dell declined to say what those numbers might look like in two years.\u201cThings are going well on a relative basis,\u201d he said. \u201cMarket consolidation is definitely occurring.\u201dWith companies like Amazon Web Services and Google providing cloud computing services, corporations increasingly rent the use of computers they used to buy from Dell and H.P.E., for a lot less money. Other cloud companies, like Salesforce, rent software this way, something A.W.S. and Google also do.Along with the rise of mobile computing, cloud computing is radically altering the computer industry. According to IDC, global demand for traditional data storage fell 7 percent in the first quarter of this year. Server revenue fell 3.6 percent globally. Second-quarter PC sales were down 4.5 percent. In a market like that, big companies like H.P.E. and Dell can only hope for a bigger slice of a shrinking pie.Compare that with Amazon\u2019s fortunes. Since A.W.S. first disclosed its earnings in April 2015, Amazon\u2019s stock has nearly doubled, and despite a 40 percent increase in the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock market, shares of almost all the older business technology companies have barely budged.Cloud companies now get about 10 percent of all spending on business computing, and they are growing at a 30 percent annual clip, said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \u201cThat\u2019s 100 percent of the growth, maybe a little more\u201d of the whole business technology sector, he added. \u201cA year ago Meg talked about growth, but in the past six months it\u2019s all been about capital allocation and return to shareholders.\u201dCompared with many in the old guard, the H.P.E. and Dell strategies may be doing well. At least for now.Shares of H.P.E. have gained about 30 percent in the last year, largely in the last two months, as rumors spread that besides selling services and buying back shares, Ms. Whitman would sell the company\u2019s laggard software division.Pre-EMC, Dell was known mostly for PCs and computer servers. While the financial information released by the private company is limited, in the three months that ended April 29 it had revenue of $12 billion, down 2 percent. Operating income was higher, Dell said, using nonstandard accounting.Selling computers still throws off a lot of cash, which is good for paying debt. Mr. Dell said that Dell Technologies threw off $3.6 billion just in its most recent quarter. EMC also owns a software business, called Pivotal, which Mr. Dell is expected to take public soon.\u201cHe\u2019s betting that size and scale will help him gain share, not that the market will be great,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Computing, once the province of a few business tasks and consumer activities like video games, has with cloud computing attached itself to much of the world, making it possible to connect phones, tablets and sensor-equipped machines to huge computing resources.Both Dell and H.P.E. make the computers and related devices that amount to the infrastructure necessary to this new economy. Increasingly, however, the profit margins can be found above the computing guts, in particular with artificial intelligence technology that helps companies scour data to make smart decisions. Both Microsoft and IBM have invested heavily in both cloud computing and A.I.Mr. Dell said that he had spent $12.7 billion in research and development in the last three years and is gaining some A.I. technology in the EMC deal.In turn, when asked about its innovations, H.P.E. noted changes to its server and storage businesses, along with the acquisition of companies like Silicon Graphics, a high-performance computing company that peaked in the 1990s.An article on Thursday about the differing business strategies of Michael Dell and Meg Whitman misquoted Mr. Dell in one instance. Referring to the prospects of Dell Technologies, the company formed by the merger of his computer business and the data storage company EMC, he said: \u201cThings are going well on a relative basis,\u201d not \u201cThings are going well on a personal basis.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The tables give insight to opportunities in another profession or location.Increasing earnings power, becoming debt-free and finding a rewarding career takes \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 work. Unlike in generations past, getting to where you want to be doesn\u2019t always involve a straight line. In fact, 65 percent of school-aged children will be in careers we've never heard of, says Robert Park, head of career strategy and professional development at SoFi, a student loan refinancing company. That makes planning a career path even more challenging.As a result of these constant changes, the average American will embark on five different careers throughout their lifetime, Park says, which could include a number of jobs. He says he\u2019s already on his fourth career \u2014 he was in the military, then went into law, followed by consulting, and now he\u2019s in the career talent space, where he says he\u2019s found his rhythm.Money certainly comes into play, though it\u2019s not necessarily about a job with the highest paycheck. It\u2019s about earning enough for your lifestyle, which can depend on the city you live in, your cost of living, the size of your family and much more. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018What do you want to obtain that\u2019s important to you?\u2019\u201d says Park. \u201cFrom there, you have to target the occupations that satisfy your intrinsic motivators and leverage your strengths. Use your natural aptitude, but at the same time, find something that has earnings potential.\u201dIan Shakil, co-founder of Augmedix, a startup that helps doctors take better notes by streaming appointments to a third-party, also tapped into the financial company's vast network of experts. Like Stojcic, he was mired in student loan debt from an MBA at Stanford and went to the company to refinance his loans before discovering its career counseling offerings.SoFi\u2019s peer and mentorship networks allowed him to meet other technology entrepreneurs, seasoned and early-stage, as well as investors. \u201cIt was cool to be with a similar cohort of recent graduates and early-stage entrepreneurs,\u201d he says. \u201cI made valuable connections, and the mentors helped me make difficult business decisions and gave me guidance.\u201dWhile a lot goes into developing a successful career, there are some things you can do to help you get a head start.Having someone to talk to about where you want to go and what you want to do can go a long way in putting your on the right career path.Having someone to talk to about where you want to go and what you want to do can go a long way in putting your on the right career path.While you don't have to develop a 20-year plan, having a five-year outlook can help you decide what jobs will get you to where you want to be.While you don't have to develop a 20-year plan, having a five-year outlook can help you decide what jobs will get you to where you want to be.Money isn't everything, but thinking about what you'd like to earn for your lifestyle will help you narrow down your career options.Money isn't everything, but thinking about what you'd like to earn for your lifestyle will help you narrow down your career options.The happiest workers are the ones who are doing something that's meaningful to them.The happiest workers are the ones who are doing something that's meaningful to them.While it\u2019s never fun to be in debt, Shakil and Stojcic know that they will pay it off, and perhaps more importantly, that it will pay off. They also know that every career milestone, be it a new job, a raise or, in Shakil\u2019s case, more company growth, comes with a lifestyle improvement. Whether that\u2019s a better place or the ability to live in a more costly city \u2014 earning more has helped them achieve their goals.It\u2019s been an especially rewarding ride for Stojcic, who went from fearing for her life to building a successful career at one of the world\u2019s most well known companies. \u201cI\u2019m doing something I love,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I look back the last 15 years and the grit and grind it took, I can't help but be proud and feel accomplished.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "What if \u2018One Click\u2019 Buying Were Internetwide?", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Paying for things online can be cumbersome. Even the man who invented the web, Tim Berners-Lee, says he frequently throws up his hands.\u201cSometimes I will think that I bought something and I press the button, \u2018Buy this,\u2019 and I don\u2019t realize it didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said in a recent interview. \u201cWe are long overdue for a payments user interface for the web.\u201dResponding to the frustrations of Mr. Berners-Lee and hundreds of millions of online shoppers, the web\u2019s governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, has brought together the giants of the internet including Google, Facebook and Apple to fix the clumsiness of paying for things online.Now, a new global standard for online payments \u2014 a sort of Amazon one-click payment system for the entire internet \u2014 is being completed by the consortium and its members.Google, one of the authors of the standard, has recently introduced it in certain new versions of its Chrome browser. Other browser companies have said they intend to follow.The standard will provide a uniform way for users to input their credit cards and payment systems to any web browser so that they can be used for any purchase on the web. After the card details are entered once, they will automatically be called up as choices for all future transactions.This will be somewhat like the existing auto-fill functions that browsers have. But with the new standard, all the data fields will be filled in invisibly, requiring just one click.On the security side, rather than sending along all the credit card details, the browser will generate a one-time payment token that will avoid leaving your credit card number in countless databases around the world.Numerous efforts to modernize the payment system have failed to take off. And this one could fizzle, too, if online merchants, web browsers or consumers fail to adopt the new standard.The new standard will also face competition from the Amazons and PayPals of the world, as well as from the credit card networks, all of which want to be the primary destination for payments, rather than just one option.But payment analysts are hopeful about the new effort because it will not require consumers or merchants to use a new method of payment. Instead it will be equally open to any existing card or payment app, and it will channel them into a single place that most consumers already use \u2014 the web browser \u2014 where everything can be stored and used.\u201cInstead of simplifying the world, we have been fragmenting it into a million apps,\u201d said Eric Shea, a payments consultant at Kurt Salmon Digital. \u201cIf we can get back to that single integrated solution that everyone has on their phone and their desktop, that is the way to move forward and get adoption.\u201dDave Birch, a consultant who has been working on electronic payments for over two decades, said the web browser stood the best chance of providing a unified and more secure portal for payments.\u201cThere\u2019s a convergence going on,\u201d said Mr. Birch, who currently works for Consult Hyperion. \u201cIn the future you will have one experience \u2014 it won\u2019t matter if you are at the store or on the phone. It will pop up on your phone, you will put your thumb on it and you will be done.\u201dThe W3C project represents a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, the current giants of online payments. Both have gained business and fees with their more streamlined checkout processes.Neither company has participated in the current W3C effort and they are likely to continue to provide an alternative to customers who don\u2019t want to enter their details into their browsers.But the W3C has managed to bring in about 40 of the biggest players in online commerce, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and American Express as well as Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent.All met last week in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the specifications that they will introduce on different time frames to users around the world.In the version that Google released, when customers shopping at participating merchants hit the buy button, they are given a drop-down menu of their stored shipping addresses and credit cards.The customer can click on the address and card to be used, enter the three-digit security code on the card and hit \u201cpay now.\u201d Other browser companies may choose to use a fingerprint instead of the security code.\u201cWe wanted to remove what we jokingly call the Nascar effect of checkout, where you see five or seven logos for the different cards and payment methods you can use,\u201d said Zach Koch, the top Google executive on the project. \u201cThis is really fast, where a user can say, \u2018Tap, tap, buy.\u2019\u201dThe fees from transactions will still go to existing financial institutions like credit card companies and banks, unless customers choose a new online payment method like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. Apple Pay takes a piece of each transaction; Samsung Pay does not.But the bigger goal behind the W3C project is to create a standard, seamless and secure way to pay for things electronically in a future that will most likely include virtual reality stores, chat-based transactions and machines making payments to other machines (an autonomous car paying for a parking spot, for instance).The standard will also make it easy to include new payment methods like Bitcoin or the Chinese payment provider Tencent.\u201cThis involves quite radical changes to the way people think about payments,\u201d said Ian Jacobs, the W3C staff member leading the effort. \u201cAs a standards body it is our job to be sure it is an open playing field.\u201dThe need to create a better way to pay for things online was evident from the web\u2019s beginnings in the 1990s, Mr. Berners-Lee said. At some of the earliest meetings of the W3C, which he founded, there were discussions about creating a way to pay for things online that didn\u2019t require people to send credit card details over the internet.The failure to come up with a standard and secure way to do this led to the hodgepodge of payment screens consumers encounter today. It also made an opening for PayPal, which created a way for shoppers to pay on different sites using a single password.Mr. Birch said the main hurdle to accomplishing more seamless payments in the past was online merchants, who did not want to give up control over any part of the checkout process.But merchants have expressed increasing frustration with the high rate of abandoned online transactions and the frequency of credit card fraud.More than half of online purchases now happen on mobile phones, but Shopify has said that only 40 percent of the customers who start filling a shopping cart online finish their transactions.Shopify, which manages the online stores and checkout processes for 300,000 merchants, has been closely involved with the W3C effort and is planning to immediately offer the new standard to its merchants, as is Groupon.\u201cWe are betting a lot on it,\u201d said Jason Normore, the director of engineering at Shopify. \u201cEven though it cuts out a piece of our offering, it makes commerce better for everyone.\u201dApple will be one of the most interesting players to watch, given that it has both the Safari browser, which is part of the W3C effort, and Apple Pay, which could be seen as a competing offering.In the new operating system that Apple released last week, it is possible, for the first time, to shop online using the Safari browser and check out with Apple Pay. After hitting \u201cPay With Apple Pay,\u201d the customer is asked to provide a fingerprint on a phone, and the transaction is complete.The W3C standard will provide a similar experience on any browser \u2014 on a computer or phone \u2014 but will also allow customers to choose from any credit card or payment method they have entered into their browsers.Apple has so far been a part of the W3C group writing the standards, which will allow it to integrate non-Apple Pay choices into its browser.Mr. Berners-Lee said he hoped that more standardized payments would open up new types of online commerce that aren\u2019t possible now. He has long been interested in micropayments that would allow newspapers or small producers of content to be paid a few cents at a time, which isn\u2019t possible in a world with only credit cards.\u201cDifferent things call for different payments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are all interoperable you can separate the market for goods being sold from the payment back end.\u201dAn article on Monday about one-click shopping on the internet misstated the fee structure of one online payment method. While Apple Pay charges a fee on each transaction, Samsung Pay does not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Companies See Gold in California", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorCalifornia is the capital of American business. One out of five companies on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market hail from that state, according to my recent assessment of relevant data.The figures show that when it comes to formation of public companies, the rich states are getting richer while the rest are in slow decline.Compiling data from public filings and adding in missing data from SDC Platinum and CRSP/Compustat, databases that track headquarters information, I examined where public companies had their headquarters from 1965 through 2013. From 1965 through 1979, 10.07 percent of public companies were based in California. The number has continued to grow, so that from 2000-13, 19.46 percent of public companies had their headquarters in California.That\u2019s an astounding number. A state with 12 percent of our population now accounts for a fifth of all public companies. (In the 1970s, California was about 10 percent of the United States population.)Other states, meanwhile, are in decline. Ohio had 5.58 percent and Pennsylvania had 5.9 percent of public listings in the 1965-79 period. But from 2000 through 2013, Ohio had 2.58 percent and Pennsylvania 3.78 percent of public company headquarters.Illinois\u2019s decline was even starker, as it slid to 3.62 percent from 6.42 percent of public company headquarters. The reason for the decline may be obvious as the old manufacturing base went into decline. The appellation Rust Belt rings true to a large degree for these states as old companies disappear and are not replaced with new ones.Yet the decline is not just in the industrial Midwest. New York and New Jersey also fell. New York fell to 8.31 percent of public company listings from 11.32 percent, while New Jersey slipped to 4.53 percent from 5.62 percent.Other states have had growth. Texas rose to 10.26 percent of public companies from 8.38 percent. Massachusetts climbed to 5.12 percent from 3.95 percent. The state is home to technology and pharmaceuticals, two of the biggest growth industries in the United States.Still, the concentration of American corporate might is stark. Nearly 40 percent of all public companies are in just four states: California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas. Three of them \u2014 California, New York and Texas \u2014 account for a third of the Fortune 500.And the trend is accelerating. In the last 12 months, California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas accounted for 50 percent of all initial public offerings by operating companies, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The geographical shift reflects a changing world. The five biggest companies in the United States by market value are all technology companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 three of them with headquarters in California. Not one existed in 1965. The tech phenomenon has benefited California more than all other states, a rise that seems to be unabated.The continued emergence of biotechnology as the other main growth engine of new public company formation appears to be helping California, Massachusetts and Texas, the three states that have long held the lead in this industry.These three stand out as the winners. Why would three very different states perform so well?One might have expected that high-regulation, high-cost, high-tax states like California would decline over time as companies migrated. Texas, of course, offers a different situation. Yet it is not alone among states offering lower taxes and lower regulatory costs.And then what is one to make of Massachusetts, a relatively small state that is punching above its weight? It has regulation and taxes, and yet also business competitiveness.There is no special formula for states to be homes to companies. Instead, what appears to be going on is a winner-take-all system.California is a good example. It is a state burdened with a high tax rate, significant regulation and extreme housing costs. It is the type of place that you would think would lose business. But instead, California is winning at creating public companies. This may be because it already has a significant base of growth companies attracting yet more people to feed off the infrastructure and then create yet more new, big companies. Similar arguments can be made about Massachusetts and the natural network that its biotechnology companies and universities create.Compare this with Texas, which is known for having good hospitals and generates companies in more divergent fields. This may indeed be helped by a more business-friendly environment, but it is more likely a result of the centers that have developed in these fields.New York is increasingly the home of finance companies with a sprinkling of health care companies. But its people\u2019s skills are more associated with media, fashion, finance and consumer companies. Gone are the days when any big corporation would make New York its home because that was the place to be.This is not to say that other states are not successful in business. South Carolina and Alabama, for example, have successfully created manufacturing hubs by creating nonunion, business-friendly environments.There needs to be more study of why certain states nurture and attract public companies.For these states, the economic benefits are not just from those companies alone. There are also secondary effects. The advisers to these companies \u2014 the lawyers, the bankers \u2014 will increasingly be pulled from their New York homes, particularly to the West Coast. As the new crop of unicorns \u2014 start-ups valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 goes public, even at reduced valuations, this pull will continue and the big services that are the specialization of New York are likely to spread out even more to these other states.The country is still going West, it seems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Airgas Was Finally Sold, for $10 Billion Instead of $5 Billion", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig shareholders do not always play nice.They strip away founders\u2019 responsibilities. They side with activist hedge funds. They vote for takeovers even when a board is resisting.Those are the types of shareholders that Peter McCausland encountered toward the end of his three-decade reign at the industrial gas distributor Airgas. By 2015, he could not take it anymore. He searched globally for a buyer.\u201cThe whole system is rigged toward transactions and turnover,\u201d Mr. McCausland said in a recent interview about the contentious battle for his company.\u201cI was spending a lot of time finding a buyer for a company that I didn\u2019t really want to sell,\u201d Mr. McCausland, 66, said.Sell he did. Air Liquide, based in Paris, acquired Airgas in May for $143 a share in a deal worth more than $10 billion. That was double the final bid of $70 a share that another company, Air Products & Chemicals, offered six years ago in one of the most bitterly fought hostile takeover battles.Mr. McCausland\u2019s critics had said he was too \u201centrenched\u201d in rejecting Air Products\u2019 proposals, but in the end, he sold for twice the value.Wall Street law firms now hold up Airgas as one of the best arguments for management\u2019s right to defend its company. Business schools around the country are seeking to turn the tale into a case study.In an unusually candid interview at his 450-acre property about 15 miles northwest of Philadelphia, Mr. McCausland explained what it was like to run a big, public company and how he decided to sell it.Mr. McCausland does not look like a corporate revolutionary. Known for his affinity for bow ties, he now wears a pink dress shirt, khakis and no socks in retirement.He lives in Florida but spends much of his time on his farm, just 10 miles away from Airgas\u2019s headquarters in Radnor, Pa. His wife, Bonnie, and son and daughter, both in their 30s, help tend to the dozens of sheep, horses and exotic cows with markings that resemble panda bears\u2019 on the estate.Among his first purchases was a company called Wolverine Gas Products, partly owned by Air Products. As part of the deal, Air Products would supply the gas, and Mr. McCausland\u2019s company would buy it in bulk, put the gas into cylinders and deliver those to customers.Soon after, Air Products started circumventing the contract by pushing up prices, Mr. McCausland said. In turn, Mr. McCausland built two air-separation plants to \u201csend them a warning.\u201d The tension heightened after Airgas bought Air Products\u2019 struggling packaged gas business in 2002 and managed to quickly turn it around.Air Products, which is based in Allentown, Pa., declined to comment for this article.The clash between the two Pennsylvania-based industrial gas foes peaked in the summer of 2009, when Mr. McCausland received a call from the chief executive of Air Products, who wanted to buy Airgas.\u201cBy going hostile, you end up accentuating whatever bad blood was already there,\u201d said Michael Harrison, a chemicals analyst with Seaport Global Securities, a brokerage firm.Airgas had two major defenses in its bylaws. The first was a so-called poison pill, which prevented anyone from acquiring more than 15 percent of the company without the directors\u2019 approval.Airgas also had a staggered board, meaning that only three directors (out of 11) were eligible for election each year. That meant Air Products needed to neutralize the pill by obtaining a majority of the board. And to achieve a majority of the board quickly, it needed to find a way to move Airgas\u2019s annual meetings closer together.Air Products asked Airgas shareholders to vote to move the annual meeting to January from September, so Air Products could nominate six directors in a four-month window.Mr. McCausland pleaded with shareholders to take his side, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. A majority of Airgas investors voted Mr. McCausland and two others off the board, replacing them with Air Products\u2019 nominees. Shareholders also voted to move up the next annual meeting.The two companies battled it out in Delaware Chancery Court in a case Mr. McCausland\u2019s lawyers gave him a slim chance of winning. At the same time, Air Products continued to increase its offer price.Despite the long odds, Mr. McCausland prevailed, by winning on appeal at the Delaware Supreme Court. The case preserved the ability of companies to defend themselves against hostile takeovers, without input from shareholders.The ruling was \u2014 and remains \u2014 controversial.\u201cThe court\u2019s case allowing the indefinite use of the poison pill for this purpose established an unfortunate precedent,\u201d said Lucian A. Bebchuk, director for the Program on Corporate Governance at Harvard Law School. \u201cThere is significant empirical evidence indicating that, on the whole, the current expansive use of takeover defenses is detrimental to the interests of shareholders and the economy.\u201dIn the end, Mr. McCausland stepped down as president and chief executive but held the post of executive chairman.Last year, Airgas was confronted with another challenge, when the activist investor Elliott Management emerged as a shareholder.Soon after Elliott acquired its stake, Mr. McCausland said he got a phone call from Air Products\u2019 new chief executive, Seifi Ghasemi. Mr. Ghasemi told him they had to meet, saying that \u201cit was an emergency.\u201dAt their meeting, Mr. Ghasemi said, \u201cElliott is going to destroy you. They say they have Fidelity with them,\u201d Mr. McCausland recalled. The message was that Fidelity Investments, and potentially other large investors, wanted a sale, so Mr. McCausland had better move quickly and sell to Air Products.Elliott declined to comment for this article.Not long afterward, over a dinner with Mr. McCausland, Mr. Ghasemi pulled out a banker\u2019s pitchbook to discuss an all-stock, zero-premium offer. He ripped out a page showing there was an 86 percent overlap between shareholders of Airgas and Air Products, meaning he could take the offer directly to Airgas investors, who would be inclined to accept (and would not want to pay a rich price because it would be coming out of their pockets).Mr. McCausland did not want to sell, but he really did not want to be forced into what he perceived to be a bad deal. So he sought what he hoped would be a better buyer before Air Products went public with the offer. He met with Koch Industries, Linde, ChemChina, Praxair and Air Liquide.The French company made an all-cash offer, which was announced on Nov. 17. Only five out of 17,000 Airgas jobs were lost integrating the two companies. Mr. McCausland netted almost $1 billion from his stake in the company.For those shareholders who invested at the time of Airgas\u2019s initial public offering in 1986, the company returned 13,000 percent. And in May, when Airgas\u2019s shares were last traded, Mr. McCausland got one last jab against his decades-old rival: His stock closed a dollar higher than Air Products\u2019.But like many entrepreneurs in his position, it was still hard to let go.\u201cWould I have been happier just becoming nonexecutive chairman and staying involved with Airgas? I think I probably would,\u201d he said. \u201cBut under the circumstances, we got the best result.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Katie Benner were at the event to provide live analysis of what you need to know about the announcements, not what you don\u2019t.\u25a0 New iPhones, called the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.\u25a0 The new iPhones lack a headphone jack.\u25a0 The new iPhones have a revised home button with force sensitivity, which will vibrate to give feedback.\u25a0 The iPhones are water-resistant.\u25a0 The Plus model of the new iPhone includes a dual-lens camera to take professional-grade photos.\u25a0 A new Apple Watch, called Apple Watch Series 2, which includes GPS.\u25a0 Pok\u00e9mon Go is available for Apple Watch.\u25a0 An update on how Apple Music is performing.\u25a0 Tweaks to its iWork suite of productivity apps.So if consumers can hold off a year for the next iPhone, I\u2019d encourage them to wait. But for owners of iPhones that are at least two years old, these are going to be major upgrades \u2014 if you find a way to cope with the lack of a headphone jack.Perhaps more important, Apple was trying to cobble together a credible story for the future from these incremental moves \u2014 that a wireless world is coming and that it will be the leader in that world.The problem for Apple is that the steps along the way to achieving its goals aren\u2019t always that exciting. This is one of those years: There are lots of incremental improvements, but nothing stands out as a must-have. Someday, Apple is telling us, all these increments will add up to something unimaginably amazing. Right now, though, the moves look puzzling \u2014 we really did not get a good defense for removing the headphone jack \u2014 and we may just have to live with the confusion.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a deep love for music,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt inspires us, and it\u2019s a key part of our product experience.\u201dMr. Cook said the company had 17 million subscribers after about a year for Apple Music and added that the music service would be the \u201cpremier destination for exclusive music,\u201d nodding to the idea that the company will use its huge war chest to lock up deals with artists.Apple also announced a new version of iWork, its suite of productivity apps that rival Microsoft Office and Google\u2019s productivity apps. The tweaked version of iWork will include real-time collaboration, meaning multiple people can work on documents and presentation slides at the same time. It\u2019s good that these changes are coming to iWork, but Microsoft and Google have been offering real-time collaboration tools for years already.But Apple has lately faced more competition from rivals, especially Google, whose cheap and simple Chromebook has become one of the most-used machines at schools. For both companies \u2014 and lately for other tech rivals, including Amazon \u2014 the education market functions as a gateway. Get them early, win them for life.The gleaming white finish is in some ways a return to the past for Apple. (Remember all those white computers from the early 2000s?) But beyond that, it\u2019s always interesting when Apple discovers a new material for use in its devices. You usually notice some new process or material start in one product and then wend its way throughout the company\u2019s lineup over a few years\u2019 time. In other words, three years from now, we may have all-white, ceramic phones. A man can dream, anyway.The addition of GPS gives the Apple Watch a slight edge against Fitbit\u2019s Blaze, a comparable smartwatch that lacks GPS. But until we get to try the software, it\u2019s tough to tell how the new Apple Watch\u2019s fitness capabilities will compare to accessories from Fitbit. Fitbit\u2019s products are popular partly because the apps are so well designed for monitoring health statistics, including footsteps, calories and weight. So GPS isn\u2019t necessarily the magic bullet.Removing the port for standard headphones means users now have to connect their headphones to the iPhone through the charging port.\u201cFrom the start we designed Lightning to be a great digital audio connector,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.The update may have its detractors in the days after the announcement, but Apple has a long history of making hardware changes that the industry eventually follows, including the decision to change floppy disk sizes in the old Mac days and, more recently, the decision to take away laptop ports. Apple will include new Lightning earbuds, and an adapter, in the box.Why remove the headphone jack, a technology that people seem to like? Mr. Schiller summed it up in one word: \u201cCourage.\u201dPerhaps more important than the earbuds themselves is the wireless technology Apple is using to power them. The company is using Bluetooth, and Apple says its chips improve the technology by connecting faster and using less power. If Apple has perfected a new, proprietary way of doing this, it could prove an important innovation for lots of future wireless products, including home devices, cars and wearables.I\u2019m sure there are minor differences \u2014 the antenna band is different \u2014 but it seems too rich to call it a new design. Too rich, except for Apple.One area where I do give Apple points on the iPhone is the focus on the camera. Apple made a strategic decision a few years ago to plow a lot of development resources into the iPhone camera. That has paid off: The iPhone\u2019s camera has long surpassed most other smartphone cameras, and for many people, it\u2019s better than most stand-alone cameras. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus continue that trend. The Plus model features two cameras, which allows for super-zooming. Even the smaller phone\u2019s camera includes features to improve your snapshots. If the pictures Apple showed off are any guide, the iPhone\u2019s camera is fast closing in on all but the most high-end of cameras. Look forward to more of those \u201cShot on iPhone\u201d billboards.An earlier version of this article misstated the technology Apple is using for its wireless earbuds. It is Bluetooth, improved in a way that Apple says will make it faster and less power-hungry; it is not the case that Apple is not using Bluetooth.Advertisement"}

But that doesn\u2019t mean it seems real when it actually happens.\u201cI went out on the street, and ran into a friend,\u201d Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins continued. \u201cI had him look at my cellphone, just to confirm that the call had been real.\u201dThis year\u2019s winners of the MacArthur fellowships, awarded for exceptional \u201coriginality, insight and potential,\u201d and publicly announced on Thursday, include writers, visual artists, scientists, nonprofit organization leaders and others, who are chosen at a moment when the recognition and money \u2014 a no-strings-attached grant of $625,000 distributed over five years \u2014 will make a difference.\u201cWe want to give people new wind against their sails,\u201d said Cecilia A. Conrad, a managing director of the foundation and the leader of the fellows program.If there\u2019s a detectable theme to the group, it might be a willingness to cross borders and to work in the cracks among existing genres, disciplines and institutions.The MacArthur Fellowship, awarded since 1981, is one of the most prestigious prizes in the United States. Potential fellows are nominated by a shifting group of anonymous experts in various fields, then further winnowed by a committee of about 12 people, whose names are not released. The award has come to be known as the \u201cgenius\u201d grant, a term that tends to provoke annoyance at the foundation.\u201cWhat we\u2019re really focused on is creativity,\u201d Ms. Conrad said. \u201cGenius is a state, but creativity is an activity: It\u2019s stuff you\u2019re doing.\u201dThe new fellows also include people working outside the spotlight, in fields that barely existed when they were starting out.\u201cMy whole career, it\u2019s always been, \u2018What is the next, biggest question?\u2019\u201d Dr. Basting said. \u201cWith this fellowship, I can ask, \u2018What\u2019s the 15th question?\u2019\u201d\u201cIn technology, we tend to think of creativity as meaning futuristic, large, expensive things,\u201d Dr. Thies said. \u201cWith my work, it\u2019s the other way around.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re very good friends,\u201d Dr. Newman said. \u201cThey told me before she knew.

She had a TV career, but that has long since petered out, and she now feels marooned in status-conscious Seattle. Her husband, Joe, a celebrated hand surgeon, is much more famous than she is. (In one of Eleanor\u2019s best paranoid fantasies, Joe performs surgery on a Russian billionaire who has turned the disco on his yacht into an operating room. All goes well until a switch malfunctions and dumps glitter into the billionaire\u2019s open wound.) They have a son, Timby, who attends the monstrous Galer Street School, with which \u201cBernadette\u201d had such evil fun.Ms. Semple has challenged herself by making the whole book unfold in a single day. It\u2019s a day that begins with a mantra, from which \u201cToday Will Be Different\u201d takes its title: Today Eleanor will radiate calm. (Does that tell you enough about her usual days?) Today she will initiate sex with Joe. (Ditto.) She will wear yoga clothes only for yoga and will actually perform some kind of yogalike activities. (Wanna bet?) And \u201cKindness and self-control will abound.\u201dWith the ideas of possible infidelity and a wife too busy babysitting to go snooping, some novelists might consider their plotting work done. But Ms. Semple, diabolical screwball that she is, is just warming up.The one-day premise does not prevent her from traveling through time and space. So a lot of the book has to do with the Flood Girls, about whom Eleanor was writing a graphic memoir. When she was the star animator for a hit TV show, she tossed off a few pages about the sisters Eleanor and Ivy and their famous mother, an actress who died of cancer. She even sold this to an agent, who was highly enthusiastic about it. Never mind that the Flood Girls date back so far that Timby knows nothing about them and the agent now works in a cheese shop in Nyack, N.Y. Eleanor does have a sister named Ivy. And a lot of the book is about Ivy\u2019s strange life in New Orleans.This is an extreme tangent. It leads Ivy across the Styx into an exaggerated Southern elite culture in which the self-proclaimed toast of Mardi Gras society is more pathetic than grand, and is ready made for Ms. Semple\u2019s skewering. The rules of this social set are so extreme that the sisters\u2019 bond is nearly ruptured by a misplaced container of ice cream at an engagement party.Speed bumps notwithstanding, Ms. Semple is an immensely appealing writer, and there\u2019s something universal in her heroine\u2019s efforts to get a handle on a life spinning out of control. We may not all have long-lost sisters who live in the most crazily status-obsessed corners of the South, but we surely know what she means about waking up each dawn with new resolve that melts by midmorning. The Sisyphean poignancy to this book gives it a heft that \u201cBernadette\u201d lacked, even if it\u2019s also rougher around the edges.\u201cToday Will Be Different\u201d ends on a wonderful grace note from Timby, who has spent most of the book playing straight man to his mother. In the simplest way, Timby\u2019s line provides all the sweetness, confidence and optimism that Eleanor has been trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to give herself on a daily basis. So if the kid\u2019s got it, there\u2019s hope for his mother, after all. Maybe she just didn\u2019t know where to look.And Ms. Semple\u2019s descriptions of Seattle continue to be priceless. It would be overly generous to say that she has a love-hate relationship with the place. She has a gimlet eye for everything from the \u201cblue-badged Amazon squids, every morning squirting by the thousands from their studio apartments onto my block\u201d to the local art scene, as funded by the local tech billionaires. And the hellish blackberry brambles are back. Ms. Semple\u2019s Seattle wouldn\u2019t seem right without them.Today Will Be DifferentBy Maria SempleIllustrated. 259 pages.

{"Headline": "Salesforce Is Said to Question Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal in Europe", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe competition questions have focused on whether Microsoft\u2019s proposed deal would hinder access by people and companies to the vast collection of data held by LinkedIn. Salesforce.com has also suggested that the deal would give Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals by combining its own software services with the information held by the social network, two of the people said.The comments came in response to a questionnaire sent by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, a step that allows interested third-party companies, including competitors, to comment on prospective takeovers.Salesforce.com\u2019s concerns do not necessarily mean that Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, the region\u2019s tough antitrust chief, will open an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s purchase of LinkedIn, though on Thursday she raised her own questions about how digital data should be treated in future competition cases.Ricardo Cardoso, a European Commission spokesman, declined to comment on Salesforce.com\u2019s response to the competition questionnaire.A Microsoft spokeswoman, Jennifer Crider, declined to comment on the European Commission questionnaire, though she said the company had already received antitrust clearance in the United States and Canada and was working with other global authorities on similar approval. The company has yet to submit its LinkedIn deal to European competition authorities, but it is likely to do so by early November, at the latest.\u201cWe expect to close before the end of this calendar year,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement on Thursday.A Salesforce.com spokeswoman, Chi Hea Cho, said the company had been contacted by the European Commission as part of its review of the proposed deal. The company also made similar efforts in the United States to highlight the potential competition problems with the deal, but it failed to win over American authorities, said another person with knowledge of the matter.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, was dismissive of the complaints from Mr. Benioff\u2019s company.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to continue working to bring price competition to a C.R.M. market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices today,\u201d said Mr. Smith, using the initials for customer relationship management, the software category in which Salesforce is the leader.While Salesforce.com\u2019s criticism of the acquisition could appear to be just sour grapes after it lost out on buying LinkedIn, its questions about how Microsoft\u2019s control of data would potentially hinder rivals are gaining traction with some European officials.One possibility would be for Microsoft to combine LinkedIn\u2019s information on people\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and messaging activity on the social network with its own Office software, providing the tech giant with an advantage over rivals offering similar services. In previous statements, Microsoft said its own offerings did not overlap with LinkedIn\u2019s and that competing services like Facebook, which also collect large amounts of data, also existed.Similar data-related concerns were raised in Europe when Facebook bought WhatsApp, the messaging app, in 2014 for $19 billion. The region\u2019s authorities have been regularly criticized, particularly by European telecommunications operators, for approving that deal despite complaints that it would limit consumer choice.\u201cThe questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly, on second reference, to a Microsoft spokeswoman.

{"Headline": "A Robot May Be Training to Do Your Job. Don\u2019t Panic.", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPreoccupationsOver the last two decades, machines have indeed usurped many human jobs in industries like manufacturing, hospitality, transportation and customer service. But here\u2019s what I find interesting: We hang our hats on the idea that there are certain professions, such as teaching and caregiving, in which humans could never be replaced by robots because of the level of personal interaction required.\u201cStarting in the mid-\u201900s, due to better computer hardware and algorithms, we made some major leaps forward in deep learning,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAs a result, we\u2019re now developing emotional computing and software programs that are aware of our moods and intentions and are able to respond accordingly.\u201dFor example, I might be fuming at my desk, punching out an irate email to an inconsiderate client. Through text analysis or facial expression recognition, a program on my laptop could identify the high level of emotion, understand what\u2019s about to happen, and warn me to take a breather before I send something I\u2019ll regret.Affective computing and emotional awareness in software are likely to come into common use sooner than in robotics. So can we stop worrying that humanoid robots will take our jobs as, let\u2019s say, health workers?The widespread adoption of social robotics in the workplace faces a host of potential problems, including a lack of infrastructure and power requirements, deficient awareness of surroundings, and public resistance. Eventually, though, the moment will come when machines possess empathy, the ability to innovate and other traits we perceive as uniquely human. What then? How will we sustain our own career relevance?I think the only way forward is to look at artificial intelligence developments as an opportunity rather than a threat. We need the mind-set that success is no longer about our level of knowledge but about our level of creative intelligence. If we accept the process of lifelong learning, in which we adapt to new ways of working as technology improves, we\u2019ll always find roles that take advantage of our best qualities.Maybe I\u2019m overly optimistic, but I also believe that behind every highly intelligent machine will be humans who help build it, train it, distribute it, advise it and repair it when things go wrong. And until (unless?) machines acquire consciousness, they\u2019ll have trouble mastering the most complex aspects of human behavior \u2014 many of which we still don\u2019t understand. I can\u2019t, for example, imagine a machine that, without human guidance or input, knows the perfect way to motivate a team of disparate human personalities that has just received bad news.Mr. Yonck agrees. \u201cSocial robots will interact with people, not just replace them,\u201d he said. \u201cHuman and machine will partner to provide products and services in ways we haven\u2019t before \u2014 each providing its own strengths.\u201dPersonally, I look forward to the day when my work-from-home job isn\u2019t quite so lonely because Jibo is keeping me company.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Clear Logic in Verizon\u2019s Digital Media Venture", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneMaybe I am a Luddite. I just don\u2019t get the industrial logic behind Verizon Communications\u2019 recent $9.2 billion foray into the digital media \u201cspace,\u201d especially because the way it has chosen to compete in it is by buying Yahoo and AOL, two companies that have seen much better days.In late July, Verizon, the telephone and wireless behemoth, agreed to buy Yahoo for $4.8 billion in cash. A year or so earlier, it bought AOL for $4.4 billion in cash. The money Verizon spent is hardly material to its $220 billion market capitalization, although it is still a lot of money. And both businesses combined generate about $7 billion revenue annually.Does it still have a good handle on how to invest the nearly $50 billion in cash flow that it has generated in the last 12 months, mostly from its gigantic wireless and old-fashioned telephone businesses? Or is flailing in unknown waters in a misguided quest to get into the business of providing digital advertising, where the two biggest competitors by far are the formidable Google (market cap, $530 billion) and Facebook (market cap, $363 billion)?Both AOL and Yahoo, when that deal closes early next year, will report up the Verizon chain of command to Marni M. Walden, an executive vice president, who is a leading contender to succeed Lowell McAdam, the Verizon chief executive, when he retires. (Mr. McAdam is 62; there is no mandatory retirement age for executives at Verizon.) Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL and the man generally credited with creating Google\u2019s online advertising sales team, appears to be the executive who will run both AOL and Yahoo on a day-to-day basis for Ms. Walden.Ms. Walden\u2019s future at Verizon is likely to depend on how well she and Mr. Armstrong execute on Verizon\u2019s AOL-Yahoo strategy. At 49, she is a highflier, for sure. She was paid nearly $7 million in 2015, and along with Tami Erwin, the head of Verizon\u2019s wireless business, she is one of only two women senior executives at the company. Verizon declined to make any of its executives available to discuss the logic of the AOL and Yahoo deals.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on moving forward running the business,\u201d Bob Varettoni, the head of corporate communications, emailed me.Instead, Mr. Varettoni pointed me to previous public comments Verizon executives have made. For instance, at the time of the AOL acquisition, Ms. Walden said, \u201cWe\u2019ve begun the next chapter in our history where we intend to become the No. 1 global media technology company for creators and advertisers and consumers.\u201d\u201cOur vision is to provide customers with a premium digital experience based on a global multiscreen platform,\u201d she added.She noted that AOL was a leader in \u201cdigital content and advertising platforms\u201d and that with Verizon, the combined company \u201ccreates a scaled mobile first platform directly targeted at the global advertising industry.\u201dVerizon\u2019s public relations team also pointed me to a transcript of Verizon\u2019s second-quarter 2016 earnings call. In the call, Mr. McAdam said that thanks to the AOL deal, which also brought with it The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, Verizon has learned \u201ca tremendous amount\u201d about the video market and opportunities for future growth. As for the Yahoo acquisition, Mr. McAdam said Verizon saw \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d in the digital video marketplace, which he said was expected to reach $180 billion by 2020.Without naming them, he said that two brands \u2013 the aforementioned Google and Facebook \u2014 dominated the market and that Verizon intended to be \u201ca significant player,\u201d too. \u201cContent creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption,\u201d he said.The Yahoo acquisition will allow Verizon to be a \u201cmajor competitor\u201d in mobile media, Mr. McAdam continued. He said Yahoo brought \u201cmarket-leading content\u201d in sports, finance, news and email and expanded Verizon\u2019s \u201canalytics and ad tech capabilities\u201d and enhanced \u201cour competitive position and value proposition to advertisers.\u201d For his part, Mr. Armstrong told Mr. Gelles: \u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new. People act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future.\u201dHonestly, I don\u2019t know what any of this means. It sounds like Verizon recognizes that the growth in its wireless business, while a cash machine, has peaked and that it needs to find new opportunities. It must think it has found that opportunity by trying to take a piece of the digital advertising market away from Google and Facebook. And even if AOL and Yahoo end up with only 5 percent of the market, by 2020, that will be nearly $4 billion in new revenue for Verizon, which is still just a fraction of its $130 billion in trailing 12 months\u2019 revenue.When I was a Wall Street banker covering the telecommunications industry, I worked on a number of mergers and acquisitions deals for what is now Verizon: the merger of GTE and Bell Atlantic, which created Verizon; the creation of Verizon Wireless; and the sale of groups of Verizon\u2019s wireless assets that posed conflicts for the company. I also worked on two deals that never came to fruition: Verizon\u2019s failed attempt to buy AirTouch, a big wireless provider, and Verizon\u2019s exploration of buying WorldCom for $100 billion, before WorldCom disintegrated. In each of these deals, I always had a clear sense of the company\u2019s strategic direction and priorities.But now I\u2019m more than a little confused. Which leads me to wonder what the market makes of Verizon\u2019s acquisition of Yahoo. Verizon\u2019s stock hovered around $56 a share before it announced the widely expected Yahoo acquisition. These days the stock is hovering around $53, a decline in Verizon\u2019s market capitalization of nearly $12 billion, or three times what it agreed to pay for Yahoo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Whole Trump-Clinton Election Could Probably Just Be Held in Pennsylvania", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceWith her polling lead slipping, Hillary Clinton still has Pennsylvania as a firewall \u2014 for now.He also discussed the potential importance of the ground game, the perceived failure of betting markets in predicting \u201cBrexit\u201d and the ethics of live forecasting on Election Day, among other topics. Here\u2019s the lightly edited text of our email exchange.It has been the state to put Hillary Clinton over 270 electoral votes, should she win all of the other more likely states for her. Conversely, it\u2019s also the state that would put Trump over the hump, if he wins all of the states that are more likely for him.Every day, I run 100,000 simulations of the election. I use the probability of each state going for Clinton or Trump, then I mix that with a correlation matrix that defines the relationships between the states. And every day since late July, Pennsylvania has been the state that most frequently is won by the candidate who wins the election. Currently, there are just 6 percent of scenarios where Clinton wins Pennsylvania but loses the election, and just 3 percent of scenarios where Clinton loses Pennsylvania and wins the election.Since Pennsylvania is more secure for the Clinton camp than other swing states, it\u2019s unlikely that Clinton loses Pennsylvania and wins either Florida or Ohio or other states to make up for the necessary electoral votes. And Trump could take Florida and Ohio and North Carolina, and go over the top with some other combination of swing states. But Pennsylvania is his most likely route.What I will be looking for in Pennsylvania over the next few weeks is simple: polls in Pennsylvania; polls in Ohio, which have similar demographics (and a lot of polling); and national polls that correlate heavily among the key swing states.Furthermore, I will be paying special attention to the crosstabs of national polls that focus on key swing demographics for Pennsylvania, when available and reliable, including white women. Beyond the polling for the presidential election, the ups and downs of the Pennsylvania Senate race could be important. The Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, currently enjoys a slight lead, and that get-out-the-vote campaign will heavily overlap with Clinton\u2019s.Further, we will learn more soon about ad buys and get-out-the-vote operations in the state. Currently Clinton enjoys a comfortable margin in both categories. If they make a difference \u2014 and if they ever make a difference it will be this year with a massive disparity in both advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts \u2014 it should give Clinton a slight advantage over the polling average.While there are certainly surprises that could influence the race, the first debate looms very large as the last major set piece for Trump to make a move. The second and third debates are generally too late. Of course, the election is won on the state level, not the national level, but movements in national polls correlate heavily with state movement.I do not think too much about Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina, because if Clinton wins these states she has certainly won the entire election. The only thing I worry about there is how the tightness affects Clinton or Trump\u2019s ability to wage advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts in other key swing states.There is a complex relationship between the swing states that I model considering three things: the likely correlated impact of any major events or shocks in the days before Election Day (the correlated impact would be very high); the likely correlated errors between the polling and Election Day outcome (reasonably high); and the likely correlation of random chance on Election Day that affects voting (i.e., rain or shine, and this is not as high of correlation).The fact that the probability of victory for Clinton in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania continues to be a few percentage points above her probability of winning the election reflects a very high correlation between the states in both how events could impact all of the states and the sizes and correlation of any potential polling error.By the way, it is amazing that pundits spend so much time talking about how different this election is, how unique this election is, but the statisticians are looking at the same map and basically taking out Virginia and putting in Pennsylvania. Four years ago it was: Romney must take Florida, Ohio and Virginia. This year it is: Trump must take Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.To answer your question directly, I am not compelled to buy or sell Clinton contracts (that pay off $1 if she wins) at $0.70 . Of course, that is because I trust my model.The company spearheading the effort, VoteCastr, plans real-time projections of presidential and Senate races in Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It plans to publish a map and tables of its projected results on Slate, the online newsmagazine.I am not concerned about how the Slate-Votecastr plan will affect voting. Voting is a major cost for many Americans with hourly wage jobs. Those people who choose to get registered and vote are pretty committed to voting. They are more likely going to fixate on any projection that rationalizes voting than a particular projection that unmotivates them.If Slate reports the election is tight, people will use that to rationalize their decision to vote. If Slate reports that Clinton is winning, Clinton supporters will use that to rationalize winning big. And Trump\u2019s supporters will turn to Fox News to confirm that Trump still has a strong chance and needs them more than ever. That is why Karl Rove was still predicting a Romney victory to the very end; he knew that some people just needed someone to convince them that it was worth the investment to stay in line to vote.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.A smart reading of polling data is a prediction on who will vote and how they will vote. The \u201cWho Will Vote\u201d question, how polling translates into votes, is influenced by the get-out-the-vote operations (and the related voter-suppression efforts). Normally we assume these have a very low net effect, as both campaigns are pouring millions of dollars into states to get the marginal voters out to the voting locations. There is strong empirical evidence that this will not be the case this year. And if markets see that late in the cycle, with both spending and the results of early voting, they will assume that Clinton could be one to two percentage points better than her polling average.How can prediction markets deal with this problem? Should there be reason to worry that markets will again be slow to accept new information?To answer your more precise question, there is certainly a growing phase as traders learn about how and how quickly new information is absorbed into the markets. The more established the markets become, the less I worry about trader inefficiency.I am unconcerned about the market being slow to incorporate new information in the presidential election. Information is coming from many sources, and traders have a healthy feeling that they are the smart money trading against the dumb money. I am also very pleased at the measured responses prediction markets have given to major events, relative to most poll-based forecasts.Traders respond to the restrictions and fees by over-wagering on long shots, slightly distorting the prices from the underlying values. I correct for this, as best I can, on PredictWise, but it is unfortunate that the C.F.T.C.\u2019s restrictions limit both the overall involvement and efficient involvement of traders.In addition to providing accurate predictions that we use to understand politics, prediction markets are valuable tools for me (and others) to learn about financial markets. Distorted incentives make that more difficult. Further, can you imagine a world where average Americans invested in prediction markets the way they do in fantasy sports? It would be great to see people researching and rooting at the debates as much as they do each weekend for the N.F.L. We should encourage access to prediction markets.I should emphasize that should the election be held today, Clinton would be above 90 percent to win it. The uncertainty is that the election is held on Nov. 8, 2016, not today, and Trump still has time to close the race. There are still lingering questions and events that will be resolved.But she is around three points up in the national polls, and six points up or more in enough states to carry the Electoral College. Combine that polling lead with a larger advertising budget and get-out-the-vote apparatus that should help her perform well in reference to the polling. It would be a catastrophic polling failure if the election were held today and she lost.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goodbye, Ivory Tower. Hello, Silicon Valley Candy Store.", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor eight years, Peter Coles had an economist\u2019s dream job at Harvard Business School.His research focused on the design of efficient markets, an important and growing field that has influenced such things as Treasury bill auctions and decisions on who receives organ transplants. He even got to work with Alvin E. Roth, who won a Nobel in economic science in 2012.But prestige was not enough to keep Mr. Coles at Harvard. In 2013, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. He now works at Airbnb, the online lodging marketplace, one of a number of tech companies luring economists with the promise of big sets of data and big salaries.Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute candy store for economists,\u201d Mr. Coles said.The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for a Ph.D. economist will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more.Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends \u2014 topics like recessions and currency exchange rates \u2014 and help their employers deal with them.But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they are studying the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging.Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft and up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of improved efficiency means more profit.At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic research scientist, is finely measuring the effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in economic behavior: What consumer actions occur coincidentally after people see ads, and what actions are most likely caused by the ads?At Airbnb, Mr. Coles is researching the company\u2019s marketplace of hosts and guests for insights, both to help build the business and to understand behavior. One study focuses on procrastination \u2014 a subject of great interest to behavioral economists \u2014 by looking at bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or months in advance? Do booking habits change by age, gender or country of origin?\u201cThey are microeconomic experts, heavy on data and computing tools like machine learning and writing algorithms,\u201d said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics.Understanding how digital markets work is getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian, Google\u2019s chief economist. But, he said, \u201cI thought it was fascinating years ago.\u201dMr. Varian, 69, is the godfather of the tech industry\u2019s in-house economists. Once a well-known professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Varian showed up at Google in 2002, part time at first, but soon became an employee. He helped refine Google\u2019s AdWords marketplace, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown on search pages, based on the words users type into Google\u2019s search engine.Google\u2019s insight was to avoid giving the best ad placement to the highest bidder. Mr. Varian worked to develop a different model for ad placement, calculating the probability that a user will click on an ad and find the ad relevant. It was a classic example of smart market design.Seeing this emerging job market, the National Association for Business Economics held its first meeting for technology company economists in April in San Francisco. Another is set for October in Silicon Valley.Academia is also starting to take notice \u2014 and adapt. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast, it\u2019s hard to keep up,\u201d said Susan Athey, an expert in the economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who is also a consultant to Microsoft.Many economics students also take computer science courses, and some major in both. But a new course this fall at Yale, called Designing the Digital Economy, seeks to blend economics and computer science in the way digital economists do at tech companies. The instructor is Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, and the course will have guest lecturers from Amazon, Pandora and Uber.The course is a pilot for curriculum change and perhaps a joint degree program focused on digital markets and their design. Dirk Bergemann, chairman of the Yale economics department, explained that economics was concerned with efficiency, prices and incentives, while computer science focused on algorithms and complexity.\u201cIn digital marketplaces, you are trying to address both sets of problems,\u201d he said.Mr. Weyl predicts that the rise of digital marketplaces in the economy is just getting underway. Uber in ride-hailing and Airbnb in room-renting, he said, may well be just the start of a redefinition of private property, made possible by digital technology.Things, according to Mr. Weyl, will increasingly be rented as services instead of owned. That is the long-term vision of driverless cars: When a vehicle just shows up on command, far fewer cars will sit in driveways. Transportation efficiency, resource consumption and industries will all be transformed, he said.The same could be true for household goods, Mr. Weyl said. One possible situation: After you use your espresso machine for breakfast, a drone comes to pick it up, and you rent it out for the day.A current market-design challenge for Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud computing services. These digital services, for example, face a peak-load problem, much as electric utilities do.How do you sell service at times when there is a risk some customers may be bumped off? Run an auction for what customers are willing to pay for interruptible service? Or offer set discounts for different levels of risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working on that now.To answer such questions, economists work in teams with computer scientists and people in business. In tech companies, market design involves not only economics but also engineering and marketing. How hard is a certain approach technically? How easy is it to explain to customers?\u201cEconomics influences rather than determines decisions,\u201d said Preston McAfee, Microsoft\u2019s chief economist, who previously worked at Google and Yahoo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Gave Four Good Pollsters the Same Raw Data. They Had Four Different Results.", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nYou\u2019ve heard of the \u201cmargin of error\u201d in polling. Just about every article on a new poll dutifully notes that the margin of error due to sampling is plus or minus three or four percentage points.But in truth, the \u201cmargin of sampling error\u201d \u2013 basically, the chance that polling different people would have produced a different result \u2013 doesn't even come close to capturing the potential for error in surveys.Polling results rely as much on the judgments of pollsters as on the science of survey methodology. Two good pollsters, both looking at the same underlying data, could come up with two very different results.How so? Because pollsters make a series of decisions when designing their survey, from determining likely voters to adjusting their respondents to match the demographics  of the electorate. These decisions are hard. They usually take place behind the scenes, and they can make a huge difference.We decided to share our raw data with four well-respected pollsters and asked them to estimate the result of the poll themselves.Here\u2019s who joined our experiment:Here\u2019s what they found:Well, well, well. Look at that. A net five-point difference between the five measures, including our own, even though all are based on identical data.  Remember: There are no sampling differences in this exercise. Everyone is coming up with a number based on the same interviews.Their answers shouldn't be interpreted as an indication of what they would have found if they had conducted their own survey. They all would have designed the survey at least a little differently \u2013 some almost entirely differently.But their answers illustrate just a few of the different ways that pollsters can handle the same data \u2013 and how those choices can affect the result.So what\u2019s going on? The pollsters made different decisions in adjusting the sample and identifying likely voters. The result was four different electorates, and four different results.There are two basic kinds of choices that our participants are making: one about adjusting the sample and one about identifying likely voters.Pollsters usually make statistical adjustments to make sure that their sample represents the population \u2013 in this case, voters in Florida. They usually do so by giving more weight to respondents from underrepresented groups.  But this is not so simple.There are two basic ways that our participants selected likely voters:The participants split across all these choices.Their varying decisions on these questions add up to big differences in the result. In general, the participants who used vote history in the likely-voter model showed a better result for Mr. Trump.At the end of this article, we\u2019ve posted detailed methodological choices of each of our pollsters.  Before that, a few of my own observations from this exercise:\u2022 These are all good pollsters, who made sensible and defensible decisions. I have seen polls that make truly outlandish decisions with the potential to produce even greater variance than this.\u2022 Clearly, the reported margin of error due to sampling, even when including a design effect (which purports to capture the added uncertainty of weighting), doesn\u2019t even come close to capturing total survey error. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t report a margin of error in our original article.\u2022 You can see why \u201cherding,\u201d the phenomenon in which pollsters make decisions that bring them close to expectations, can be such a problem. There really is a lot of flexibility for pollsters to make choices that generate a fundamentally different result. And I get it: If our result had come back as \u201cClinton +10,\u201d I would have dreaded having to publish it.\u2022 You can see why we say it\u2019s best to average polls, and to stop fretting so much about single polls.Finally, a word  of thanks to the four pollsters for joining us in this exercise. Election season is as busy for pollsters as it is for political journalists. We\u2019re grateful for their time.Below, the methodological choices of the other pollsters.Mr. Franklin approximated the approach of a traditional pollster and did not use any of the information on the voter registration file. He weighed the sample to an estimate of the demographic composition of Florida\u2019s registered voters in 2016, based on census data, by age, sex, education, gender and race. Mr. Franklin\u2019s likely voters were those who said they were \u201calmost certain\u201d to vote.Mr. Ruffini weighted the sample by voter file data on age, race, gender and party registration. He next added turnout scores: an estimate for how likely each voter is to turn out, based exclusively on their voting history. He then weighted the sample to the likely turnout profile of both registered and likely voters \u2013 basically making sure that there were the right number of likely and unlikely voters in the voter file. This is probably the approach most similar to the Upshot/Siena methodology, so it is not surprising that it also is the closest result.Long story short: They built a model that tries to figure out what characteristics predict support for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump based on many of the same variables used for weighting. They then predicted how every person in the state would vote, based on that model. It's the same approach we used to make the pretty dot maps of Florida. The likely electorate was determined exclusively by vote history, not self-reported voice choice. They included 2012 voters \u2013 which is why their electorate has more black voters than the others \u2013 and then included newly registered voters according to a model of voting history based on registration.The sample was weighted to state voter file data for party registration, gender, race and ethnicity. They then excluded the people who said they were unlikely to vote. These self-reported unlikely voters were 7 percent of the sample, so this is the most permissive likely voter screen of the groups. In part as a result, it\u2019s also Mrs. Clinton\u2019s best performance. In an email, Ms. Omero noted that every scenario they examined showed an advantage for Clinton.Advertisement"}

The new artificial intelligence and research group at Microsoft will have more than 5,000 employees.Microsoft also said that one of its top executives, Qi Lu, has left the company to recuperate from a serious bicycling accident that occurred several months ago. Once he recovers, Mr. Lu will continue to act as an adviser to Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, and Bill Gates, its co-founder, Mr. Nadella said in an email to company employees Thursday.The creation of a new group at Microsoft with a focus on artificial intelligence was already planned, but the departure of Mr. Lu \u2014 a respected computer scientist who spent a decade at Yahoo \u2014 affected the shape of the new organization. In addition to Microsoft\u2019s Office products and other applications, Mr. Lu oversaw Bing, which is part of the new artificial intelligence and research group.\u201cMicrosoft is really betting the company on A.I.,\u201d Harry Shum, the Microsoft executive vice president who will oversee the new group, said in a phone interview.Technology companies are making deep investments in artificial intelligence, seeing it as a key ingredient in the emergence of everything from self-driving vehicles to devices that can identify faces. Microsoft has been particularly vocal in the last year about the importance of artificial intelligence to its future.It is investing heavily to improve virtual assistants like Cortana that can answer verbal questions and proactively perform tasks and it plans to weave more intelligent functions into all of its products, including Skype and Office.The company is sometimes criticized by investors for not producing enough commercial successes from its vaunted research organization. The structure of the new organization will tighten the link between its researchers and products already on the market today.\u201cWe see need to accelerate the cycle from developing research technology to eventually shipping technology to our customers,\u201d Mr. Shum said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Compete With Mobile, Sony Tailors PlayStation to Next-Generation TVs", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew video game consoles are normally introduced every six or seven years, a far cry from the smartphone business, where more capable models debut every year or so.Taking inspiration from the pace of innovation in the mobile industry, Sony on Wednesday announced a more powerful version of its PlayStation 4 that would display games at higher resolutions, among other big improvements to image quality.The new PlayStation 4 Pro, introduced at an event in New York, is aimed at the growing segment of the television market buying so-called 4K high-definition television sets, which jam millions more pixels into their displays for much sharper images. The new console will also present games using another technology called high dynamic range, or H.D.R., which offers big improvements in color and other image enhancements.The PlayStation 4 Pro will cost $400 and goes on sale Nov. 10. Sony also announced a new, slimmer version of its base model of PlayStation 4 that will sell for $300 starting on Sept. 15.Andrew House, chief executive of Sony\u2019s video game division, said in a phone interview that Sony\u2019s decision to release the PlayStation 4 Pro was influenced by the speed of change in the mobile industry, which has come to rival consoles for the attention of gamers. The first PlayStation 4 came out in 2013.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we didn\u2019t wait seven years before we started to innovate and tried something new?\u201d Mr. House asked, referring to the time between the introductions of the PlayStation 4 and its predecessor, the PlayStation 3.Sales of 4K television sets have surged as prices have come down and models have proliferated. In the second quarter, the average price of 4K televisions was down 29 percent from a year earlier, to $877, the research firm IHS Markit Technology estimates. H.D.R. is a newer feature on 4K television sets that generally adds a premium of 20 to 30 percent to the price, according to Paul Gagnon, an IHS analyst.About 55 million 4K televisions will be sold worldwide this year, but only about 3.5 million will include H.D.R., Mr. Gagnon estimates. \u201cIn a couple years, we expect there won\u2019t be many TVs sold over 50 inches that aren\u2019t 4K,\u201d he said.The availability of video that exploits 4K sets has been improving, but it is still limited. Streaming video services from Amazon and Netflix are among the early adopters of the technology for their original programming.Microsoft, Sony\u2019s primary rival in the console market, announced its own 4K-capable Xbox One console this year, with the code name Project Scorpio. But that system will not be available until next year\u2019s holiday season.Sony already has a comfortable lead in the console market, having sold more than 40 million of the PlayStation 4. Microsoft no longer reveals sales figures for the Xbox One.Game developers will need to adapt their existing PlayStation 4 games to take advantage of the better image quality of the new Sony console, and update them over the internet. New installments of best-selling games like Call of Duty by Activision and Battlefield by Electronic Arts will support the PlayStation 4 Pro\u2019s better image quality when they go on sale, the publishers said.Joost van Dreunen, chief executive of SuperData Research, a game research firm, says he thinks Sony could persuade 10 to 20 percent of existing PlayStation 4 owners to buy the new model, along with people who mainly play games on PCs.\u201cThis sets them up for another three to five years,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Rather, they want to foster \u201cpublic understanding\u201d and set \u201cbest practices\u201d for work in artificial intelligence.\u201cWe passionately believe in the potential for it to transform in a positive way our world,\u201d said Mustafa Suleyman, head of applied A.I. for DeepMind, an artificial intelligence development company acquired by Google in 2014. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s critical now to start to think about new models of engagement with the public, new models of collaboration across the industry and new models of transparency around the work that we do.\u201dThe group released eight tenets that are evocative of Isaac Asimov\u2019s original \u201cThree Laws of Robotics,\u201d which appeared in a science fiction story in 1942. The new principles include high-level ideals such as, \u201cWe will seek to ensure that A.I. technologies benefit and empower as many people as possible.\u201dNevertheless, at least one of the tenets implies that the companies realize they could be drawn into sticky ethical situations, and it calls on engineers to oppose the use of artificial intelligence technology in weapons or other tools that could be used to violate human rights.\u201cWith the hyperbole about A.I. over the last two to four years, there have been concerns in an echo chamber of anxiety that the government itself will be misinformed,\u201d said Eric Horvitz, managing director for Microsoft Research.The researchers said they were talking with other companies like Apple and research laboratories like the new nonprofit research group OpenAI about participating in their organization.Advertisement"}

The new owner would then have to give them cause to stay, which in the tech world usually involves some kind of world-changing mission that also makes them even richer.Another prospect, of course, is that no one buys Twitter, in which case its market value is likely to revert to something like Thursday\u2019s price.

But for the next decade or two, our biggest concern is more likely to be that robots will take away our jobs or bump into us on the highway.Now five of the world\u2019s largest tech companies are trying to create a standard of ethics around the creation of artificial intelligence. While science fiction has focused on the existential threat of A.I. to humans, researchers at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and those from Amazon, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft have been meeting to discuss more tangible issues, such as the impact of A.I. on jobs, transportation and even warfare.Tech companies have long overpromised what artificially intelligent machines can do. In recent years, however, the A.I. field has made rapid advances in a range of areas, from self-driving cars and machines that understand speech, like Amazon\u2019s Echo device, to a new generation of weapons systems that threaten to automate combat.The specifics of what the industry group will do or say \u2014 even its name \u2014 have yet to be hashed out. But the basic intention is clear: to ensure that A.I. research is focused on benefiting people, not hurting them, according to four people involved in the creation of the industry partnership who are not authorized to speak about it publicly.One main concern for people in the tech industry would be if regulators jumped in to create rules around their A.I. work. So they are trying to create a framework for a self-policing organization, though it is not clear yet how that will function.\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that there should be no regulation,\u201d said Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the authors of the Stanford report. \u201cWe\u2019re saying that there is a right way and a wrong way.\u201dWhile the tech industry is known for being competitive, there have been instances when companies have worked together when it was in their best interests. In the 1990s, for example, tech companies agreed on a standard method for encrypting e-commerce transactions, laying the groundwork for two decades of growth in internet business.The authors of the Stanford report, which is titled \u201cArtificial Intelligence and Life in 2030,\u201d argue that it will be impossible to regulate A.I. \u201cThe study panel\u2019s consensus is that attempts to regulate A.I. in general would be misguided, since there is no clear definition of A.I. (it isn\u2019t any one thing), and the risks and considerations are very different in different domains,\u201d the report says.One recommendation in the report is to raise the awareness of and expertise about artificial intelligence at all levels of government, Dr. Stone said. It also calls for increased public and private spending on A.I.\u201cThere is a role for government and we respect that,\u201d said David Kenny, general manager for IBM\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence division. The challenge, he said, is \u201ca lot of times policies lag the technologies.\u201dA memorandum is being circulated among the five companies with a tentative plan to announce the new organization in the middle of September. One of the unresolved issues is that Google DeepMind, an Alphabet subsidiary, has asked to participate separately, according to a person involved in the negotiations.Separately, Reid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn who has a background in artificial intelligence, is in discussions with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab to fund a project exploring the social and economic effects of artificial intelligence.Both the M.I.T. effort and the industry partnership are trying to link technology advances more closely to social and economic policy issues. The M.I.T. group has been discussing the idea of designing new A.I. and robotic systems with \u201csociety in the loop.\u201dThe phrase is a reference to the long-running debate about designing computer and robotic systems that still require interaction with humans. For example, the Pentagon has recently begun articulating a military strategy that calls for using A.I. in which humans continue to control killing decisions, rather than delegating that responsibility to machines.\u201cThe key thing that I would point out is computer scientists have not been good at interacting with the social scientists and the philosophers,\u201d said Joichi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times. \u201cWhat we want to do is support and reinforce the social scientists who are doing research which will play a role in setting policies.\u201dThe Stanford report attempts to define the issues that citizens of a typical North American city will face in computers and robotic systems that mimic human capabilities. The authors explore eight aspects of modern life, including health care, education, entertainment and employment, but specifically do not look at the issue of warfare. They said that military A.I. applications were outside their current scope and expertise, but they did not rule out focusing on weapons in the future.The report also does not consider the belief of some computer specialists about the possibility of a \u201csingularity\u201d that might lead to machines that are more intelligent and possibly threaten humans.\u201cIt was a conscious decision not to give credence to this in the report,\u201d Dr. Stone said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A High-Stakes Bet: Turning Google Assistant Into a \u2018Star Trek\u2019 Computer", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtGoogle is one of the most valuable companies in the world, but its future, like that of all tech giants, is clouded by a looming threat. The search company makes virtually all of its money from ads placed on the World Wide Web. But what happens to the cash machine if web search eventually becomes outmoded?That worry isn\u2019t far-fetched. More of the world\u2019s computing time keeps shifting to smartphones, where apps have supplanted the web. And internet-connected devices that may dominate the next era in tech \u2014 smartwatches, home-assistant devices like Amazon\u2019s Echo, or virtual reality machines like Oculus Rift \u2014 are likely to be free of the web, and may even lack screens.But if Google is worried, it isn\u2019t showing it. The company has long been working on a not-so-secret weapon to avert its potential irrelevance. Google has shoveled vast financial and engineering resources into a collection of data mining and artificial intelligence systems, from speech recognition to machine translation to computer vision.But Google has much grander aims for the Assistant. People at the company say that Sundar Pichai, who took over as Google\u2019s chief executive last year after Google was split into a conglomerate called Alphabet, has bet the company on the new tech. Mr. Pichai declined an interview request for this column, but at Google\u2019s developer conference in May, he called the development of the Assistant \u201ca seminal moment\u201d for the company.If the Assistant or something like it does not take off, Google\u2019s status as the chief navigator of our digital lives could be superseded by a half-dozen other assistants. You might interact with Alexa in your house, with Siri on your phone, and with Facebook Messenger\u2019s chatbot when you\u2019re out and about. Google\u2019s search engine (not to mention its Android operating system, Chrome, Gmail, Maps and other properties) would remain popular and lucrative, but possibly far less so than they are today.The Assistant, in Google\u2019s most far-out vision, would always be around, wherever you are, on whatever device you use, to handle just about any informational task.Consider this common situation: Today, to book a trip, you usually have to load up several travel sites, consult your calendar and coordinate with your family and your colleagues. If the Assistant works as well as Google hopes, all you might have to do is say, \u201cO.K., Google, I need to go to Hong Kong next week. Take care of it.\u201dBased on your interactions with it over the years, Google would know your habits, your preferences and your budget. It would know your friends, family and your colleagues. With access to so much data, and with the computational power to interpret all of it, the Assistant most likely could handle the entire task; if it couldn\u2019t, it would simply ask you to fill in the gaps, the way a human assistant might.Computers have made a lot of everyday tasks far easier to accomplish, yet they still require a sometimes annoying level of human involvement to get the most out of them. The Assistant\u2019s long-term aim is to eliminate all this busywork.If it succeeds, it would be the ultimate expression of what Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, once described as the perfect search engine: a machine that \u201cunderstands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want.\u201dAt this point, a few readers may be recoiling at the potential invasion of autonomy and privacy that such a machine would necessitate.The Assistant would involve giving ourselves over to machines more fully. We would trust them not just with our information but increasingly with our decisions. Many people are already freaked out by what Google, Facebook and other tech companies know about us. Would we be willing to hand over even more power to computers?Those are important questions, but they are also well down the road. For now, the more pressing question for the Assistant is: Will it even work?Google has technological advantages that suggest it could build a more capable digital assistant than others have accomplished. Many of the innovations that it has built into its search engine \u2014 including its knowledge graph database of more than a billion people, places and things, and the 17 years it has spent trying to understand the meaning of web queries \u2014 will form the Assistant\u2019s brain.Google has also been one of the leaders in machine learning, the process that allows computers to discover facts about the world without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is at the heart of a number of recent advances, including Google Photos\u2019 uncanny capacity to search through your images for arbitrary terms (photos of people hugging, for instance).\u201cWe are in the process of transforming into a machine-learning company,\u201d Jeff Dean, who is in charge of Google Brain, the company\u2019s artificial intelligence project, told me this year. For each problem Google solves this way, it gets better at solving other problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a boulder going downhill gathering more momentum as it goes,\u201d Mr. Dean said.That\u2019s an amazing technological feat. But as Brian pointed out, it\u2019s also pretty useless. Why does your friend care if you know his dog\u2019s a Shih Tzu?This gets to a deeper difficulty. The search company might have the technical capacity to create the smartest assistant around, but it\u2019s not at all clear that it has the prowess to create the friendliest, most charming or most useful assistant. Google needs to nail not just Assistant\u2019s smarts, but also its personality \u2014 a new skill for Google, and one that its past forays into social software (Google Plus, anyone?) don\u2019t speak highly of.\u201cWhen I was trying to book a movie, it didn\u2019t really narrow things down for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there were some times it was wrong. I asked it to show me my upcoming trip, and it didn\u2019t get that.\u201dOf course, it\u2019s still early. Mr. Sullivan has high hopes for the Assistant. It would be premature to look at the technology today and get discouraged about its future, especially since Google sees this as a multiyear, perhaps even decade-long project. And especially if Google\u2019s future depends on getting this right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Software Is Booming. But Why Now?", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This is the year artificial intelligence came into its own for mainstream businesses, at least as a marketing feature.Salesforce chose this date to pre-empt Oracle, the world\u2019s largest business software company, which on Sunday evening began its annual customer event in San Francisco. High on Oracle\u2019s list of new features: real-time analysis of enormous amounts of data. Oracle calls its product Oracle A.I.There are big pushes in A.I. in agriculture, manufacturing, aviation and pretty much every other sector of the economy.It\u2019s all very exciting, the way great possibilities are, and clearly full of great buzzwords and slogans. But will other companies see any value in all this or understand if A.I. has value for them?\u201cNo one really knows where the value is,\u201d said Marc Benioff, co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cI think I know \u2014 it\u2019s in helping people do the things that people are good at, and turning more things over to machines.\u201dMr. Benioff wasn\u2019t selling Einstein\u2019s capabilities short. He was talking about the long-term value of artificial intelligence, which is passing through a familiar phase \u2014 a technology that is strange and new, that sometimes overpromises what it can do and is headed for uses not easily seen at the start.Cloaked inside terms like deep learning and machine intelligence, A.I. is essentially a series of advanced statistics-based exercises that review the past to indicate the likely future, or look at current customer choices to figure out where to put more or less energy.Perhaps a better question than \u201cWhat is the value?\u201d of this explosion of advanced statistics is \u201cWhy now?\u201d That shows both the opportunity and why many companies are scared about missing out.Much of today\u2019s A.I. boom goes back to 2006, when Amazon started selling cheap computing over the internet. Those measures built the public clouds of Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, among others. That same year, Google and Yahoo released statistical methods for dealing with the unruly data of human behavior. In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone, a device that began a boom in unruly-data collection everywhere.Suddenly, old A.I. experiments were relevant, and money and cheap data resources were available for building new algorithms. Ten years later, computing is cheaper than ever, companies live online and in their phone apps, and sensors are bringing even more unruly data from more places.Amazon, Google and the rest have exceptional A.I. resources for sale, but many older companies are wary of turning their data over to these upstarts. That, along with fear of a competitor getting on top of A.I. first, is a big motivation for some to try things out.Salesforce is selling Einstein as a system that can work predictive magic without having to look at your data, in what Mr. Benioff calls a \u201cdemocratizing\u201d move that will create millions of A.I. users who are not engineers.He said this on his way to attend a series of customer focus groups around the country, however \u2014 strong evidence that customers don\u2019t get it yet, even if they\u2019re willing to try it.\u201cThere\u2019s fear of Google and Microsoft controlling everything, and there\u2019s a desire to apply A.I. to anything that\u2019s digital,\u201d said Michael Biltz, managing director of Accenture\u2019s technology vision practice. \u201cPeople are going to have to experiment, most likely first on pain points like security and product marketing.\u201dHow will we know when the A.I. revolution has taken hold? A technology truly matures when it disappears. We don\u2019t marvel at houses with electricity now, or the idea of driving to work at 60 miles an hour. We can say \u201cphone\u201d and mean a hand-held computer with NASA-level processing power and a professional-quality camera for taking selfies with our drones.A.I. is probably heading for the same places, invisibly sorting through lots of data everywhere to continuously update and automate most of our lives. Goodness knows what the weird new tech thing will be about at that point.Advertisement"}

Far from reasonable, it\u2019s been estimated by the Main Street Alliance that the proposed holiday rate would be a $20 billion gift to Apple.With their nearly unlimited access to capital and ability to buy in bulk, industry giants like Apple already hold a competitive edge over small to mid-sized businesses, which can\u2019t afford to hire high-priced tax accountants and lawyers to devise tax avoidance schemes.To level the playing field for Main Street businesses, Congress must act to end deferral, stop incentivizing offshoring of revenues with tax holidays, and hold all companies accountable to pay what they owe when they owe it.DEBORAH FIELDPortland, Ore.The writer, a small-business owner and former accountant, is a member of the Main Street Alliance.To the Editor:I find it infuriating that Apple, Microsoft, Google and many other highly successful so-called American companies have found legal ways to avoid paying anywhere close to a fair share of taxes on their profits. Their executives and shareholders win and the rest of us lose.I find it even more infuriating when pharmaceutical companies play the same tax avoidance game, but also jack up the prices of essential and unique medications by several hundred percent, and expect taxpayers to foot the bill through federal insurance programs.How many ordinary Americans are disadvantaged by these practices \u2014 people who are not earning the big bonuses and dividends generated by these practices, but rather have to pay the increased taxes to cover them? Come on, Congress, do something. At least pretend you represent the people.DON CARLSONBostonTo the Editor:Apple and other companies are only doing what our laws and those of their host countries abroad allow them to do. The problem, as you point out, lies with our own tax laws and enforcement. A way forward would be to apply basic accounting principles to reformulate our tax policies. These include:1. Profits should generally be taxed in the country in which business is conducted and profits are generated.2. Profits should be taxed in the year in which they are generated.3. Like individual American citizens, American businesses should be taxed at home each year on their combined \u201cworldwide\u201d income.4. Corporations should be entitled to an offsetting American credit for taxes paid to foreign countries if we have bilateral tax treaties with those countries. This should allow us to modify our current deferral policy of profits not taxed until repatriated.To further discourage tax inversion and offshore profit harboring, we must review our own tax rates and make them more competitive with other nations, while also persuading countries like Ireland that are members of the World Trade Organization not to adopt a very low-rate, tax haven or \u201cpirate\u201d status.CHERIAN THACHENKARYAtlantaAdvertisement"}
