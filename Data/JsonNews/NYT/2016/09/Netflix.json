{"Headline": "For the Debaters: What Shall We Do About the Tech Careening Our Way?", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtHere\u2019s a question I\u2019m hoping comes up at Monday\u2019s presidential debate: Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump, what would you do about self-driving trucks?That sounds goofy, but it\u2019s big league. The self-driving truck is an 18-wheeled trick question barreling toward us from an uncertain future. In testing how Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton might respond to the not-too-distant possibility of trucks that drive themselves, we might get at something most political debates fail to address: how the candidates are weighing the costs and benefits of rapid, unpredictable and transformative technological change.But it wouldn\u2019t all be rainbows. At least at first, the autonomous technology wouldn\u2019t be perfect. Errors and bugs, perhaps fatal ones, might spark politically damaging fear and outrage. In the long run, if the trucks prove successful and our logistics infrastructure adjusts to accommodate them, they could begin to displace the three million Americans (mostly men) who now drive trucks for a living, not to mention truck stops and the small towns that depend on them.There would be deeper issues to consider: The threat of hacking, the narrowing economic control over a vital lane of national commerce, and a growing detachment from America\u2019s ineffable, often irrational love affair with the open road.Though less than a year old, Otto has a fleet of six trucks now constantly driving across California to test its technology, which the company aims to sell as an aftermarket add-on to trucking companies sometime in the next few years. When it\u2019s for sale, Otto\u2019s system will drive the truck fully on freeways; the driver will take over on all other roads, as well as assist in other functions (refueling, filling out paperwork).How Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton think about autonomous trucks is in some ways a test case for their ideas about technology generally. It might reveal how they would weigh the benefits of innovation \u2014 which usually accrue diffusely to the nation at large \u2014 against the particular burdens borne by a small group (the truck drivers who might lose their jobs, in this case).Their answer might also illuminate how they would balance competing advances and losses for the economy, the labor market, health and safety and the environment. More fundamentally, their thoughts on trucks could give us a look into their deepest ideas about technology. Are they more inclined toward bold, optimistic grabs at the future, or to recoil at the potentially devastating possibilities of its being unleashed?As far as I can tell, Mr. Trump has not talked about self-driving trucks.\u201cA new truck costs $160,000 to $200,000, and they can basically only drive it nine hours a day,\u201d Mr. Ron said. With Otto\u2019s technology, the driver would be able to double his output \u2014 he could drive all day, then take a nap while the rig barrels along the road, then come back to driving.\u201cThe truck is always productive,\u201d Mr. Ron said. \u201cThey\u2019re making more money, because they can use it more. They\u2019re seeing their families more often, because they can finish their long-haul routes faster. And most importantly, they\u2019re safer.\u201dThe technology is not there yet. During a recent ride on the freeways surrounding Otto\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, an Otto driver and engineer showed me how the prototype was working. After self-driving was flipped on, the rig handled most conditions fairly well \u2014 it steered itself around bends and maintained a consistent distance from other vehicles.But about a half-dozen times during the 20-minute ride, the cab emitted a sharp beep warning the driver that it detected some trouble, and that it needed him to immediately take over. The engineer noted each of these instances; back at the office, Otto\u2019s techies will examine each incident to teach the system better tricks.For truck drivers, the benefits of automation are less certain. Kara Deniz, a spokeswoman for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, told me the union had not issued any policy decisions on automation because there were more questions than answers about the impact of self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe believe experienced, skilled drivers will be needed well into the future,\u201d she added.Several truckers I talked to were resistant to automation.\u201cThe idea that we\u2019ll go to automated trucks and then drivers will sleep while the truck drives \u2014 not a chance in hell. I would never do that,\u201d Wade Dowden, 32, who\u2019s been driving a truck for 10 years, told me while he was on the road in Houston.Mr. Dowden is no technophobe. He said easy access to live maps and mobile entertainment had made everything about driving a truck much less stressful than before. Now Mr. Dowden spends his days listening to audiobooks and podcasts, and when he\u2019s not driving, he watches Netflix and studies for a degree in transportation management.Yet he isn\u2019t ready to turn over his truck to a computer.\u201cIt would make the job not worth doing,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you\u2019re only paying a guy to drive the final miles into a city, we\u2019re certainly not going to get a raise for that.\u201dThat leads back to what Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump might say about self-driving trucks if they were asked on Monday. There are many potential policy ideas to delay, accelerate or ease this transition. They could ban self-driving trucks entirely. Or they could also institute a retraining program for drivers. Or do nothing and see what happens.Mr. Dowden, though, has no faith either will do anything meaningful to address the issue, because he thinks both are out of touch. \u201cThey just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

When Murphy\u2019s narration begins the episode with \u201cLook up magical realism in the dictionary \u2026,\u201d the series comes full circle, but it\u2019s never been good with abstraction \u2014 those moments when, as Murphy puts it, \u201cthe bizarre shakes hands with the inexplicable.\u201dThe final hour gets off to a rough start with a dream sequence in which Escobar imagines his ascension to the Colombian presidency, with a glad-handing Gaviria passing him the torch (and sharing a blunt) and his family welcoming him with a chorus of \u201cHappy Birthday to You.\u201d The fantasy is too on the nose, ending crudely with Escobar living like a sad bachelor, accepting a garbled \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d through ham radio static.But that elusive magical realist quality is more delicately applied to a sequence where Escobar decides to slip on a pair of sunglasses and drive himself for strawberries and cream in a crowded public square. He leaves on the thin rationale that the city of Medell\u00edn would never betray him, but his adventure plays out like a wistful dream, as if Escobar is already imagining himself as a ghost before he\u2019s been shot dead. He picks up a dropped lighter for an armed forces member without fear of recognition. He takes off his sunglasses. He enjoys his treat on a park bench while doing a little people watching. It\u2019s a more audacious and defiant last stand than a shootout with the authorities could ever be, affirming Escobar\u2019s deep connection with the city and perhaps a resignation over his inevitable and imminent death.\u201cAl Fin Cay\u00f3!\u201d doesn\u2019t need to hit this conclusion any harder than the scene with Pe\u00f1a, because \u201cNarcos\u201d has spent the entire second season laying out the devastating shortsightedness of hunting Escobar. If it\u2019s missing anything, it\u2019s a fuller evocation of the aftermath in his native city, where many revered him for the housing projects, hospitals, churches and other philanthropic ventures that met their needs more effectively than the Colombian government. In a story rife with ironies, where \u201cthe bizarre shakes hands with the inexplicable,\u201d the mourning of a mass murderer is the capper.Parting Shots\u2022 \u201cNarcos\u201d was intended to tell the Escobar story in full, but the final episode teases the story of the Cali cartel, which should occupy some portion of seasons three and four. Any notion that Cali might share Escobar\u2019s generosity is squelched in an icy exchange between Gilberto Rodr\u00edguez and Tata, who appeals to her late husband\u2019s rival for assistance. Gilberto asks Tata how much cash and property she has left. She says she\u2019ll look into it. \u201cGood,\u201d he replies. \u201cBecause I want all of it.\u201d\u2022 The footage of the real Hermilda Escobar in the wake of Pablo\u2019s death, hailing his achievements and dismissing his atrocities as conspiracy theory, tracks with her depiction on the show as a mother determined to believe the best in her son.\u2022 \u201cNarcos\u201d hasn\u2019t been playful with Murphy\u2019s narration, so having the killshot interrupt him midsentence (\u201cYou take a good, long look at evil \u2026\u201d *bang*) was an effective surprise.\u2022 The Netflix model of dumping the entire season at once wound up suiting \u201cNarcos\u201d better than most, because the show never had an interest in discrete, stand-alone episodes. This has been one complete story told over two seasons and 20 episodes. It could be edited into a single, daylong mega-movie without a great deal of fuss.Advertisement"}

Should we expect Kalinda 2.0?There are definitely similarities, but there are also differences. Nas doesn\u2019t use sex as a weapon, at least up till now. Kalinda was immensely sexual, and there was a lot of fascination with her sexuality. And Nas is fiercely protective of her team, but she\u2019s also got this wild, unpredictable side.

When he left I had to go in there with sage, holy water and a priest.\u201dAll joking aside, Ms. Woodard said that working-class parents may feel a child\u2019s absence even more acutely. \u201cTheir house or apartment is smaller, so the kid\u2019s presence is missed more,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, working-class parents probably raised that kid on their own.\u201dRegardless of the factors when a household is decanted of its young people, it\u2019s clear that kids who leave their home need a lot of room to grow in, and that parents need to hone their listening skills.Once, when Ms. Coburn asked a Washington University student to give advice to a group of the school\u2019s parents, the young woman offered: \u201cSometimes we want your advice and sometimes we don\u2019t. The challenge is, we won\u2019t tell you which time is which.\u201d\u201cMost of them don\u2019t complain about their parents being in touch too much,\u201d Ms. Keneally said of her clients in their 20s. \u201cBut a lot of them talk to me about stuff that they wouldn\u2019t talk to their parents about: relationship problems, or things they\u2019re contemplating doing or not doing. Parents would jump in too quickly, or would be embarrassed about what the kid is proposing.\u201dIndeed, the greatest lesson for many empty nesters may be learning to be their child\u2019s coach or inspiration rather than a child\u2019s concierge or critic.In 2014, when students at Keene State College in New Hampshire injected a local event called the Pumpkin Festival with fire-starting and car-flipping, the president of the college chastised her students for failing to \u201cpumpkin responsibly.\u201d It seems only natural that a parent, on hauling the last box of his child\u2019s shinguards and Harry Potter effluvia into the unsupervised blankness of a dorm room, may fear the advent of pumpkin irresponsibility.In the end, empathy and patience are an empty nester\u2019s Xanax. I asked Ms. Woodard what she would say to her parents today about keeping in touch if she were a young person going off to college.Ms. Woodard didn\u2019t miss a beat: \u201cI would say, \u2018I\u2019ll hit you up.\u2019\u201dHenry Alford is the author of \u201cWould It Kill You to Stop Doing That?

{"Headline": "Style.com Bets on a Street Style Star", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs London Fashion Week picks up steam this weekend, with all its traffic, sharp elbows and celebrities, one woman is going to come in for unusually serious scrutiny: her every facial twitch parsed, outfits obsessively chronicled, show schedule observed.You couldn\u2019t have picked a better poster girl if you\u2019d Photoshopped her from Vogue.Ms. Sewell lives in the London Fields section of Hackney with her husband, Kyle Robinson, and their young sons, Knox and Renzo; fits in the odd yoga and Pilates session when she can; and says her favorite hobby is \u201cgetting people together, cooking and hosting big dinners.\u201dLike Sarah Rutson, the vice president for global buying at Net-a-Porter, whose impeccable wardrobe and original style are a major inspiration for the wealthy, fashion-conscious demographic for whom she shops, Ms. Sewell is the idealized-yet-accessible embodiment of the retail brand she now represents.And though the site debuted to fanfare in Britain earlier this month, with the rollout set to continue in Europe and the United States later this year, it is an untested addition to the e-commerce landscape. It potentially blurs the already eroding line between editorial and commercial in a discomfiting way, but also could serve as a model for other publishing companies.\u201cWe are very different from the original Style.com, of course, but I think fans of the old site will see that core motivation has remained the same,\u201d Ms. Sewell said. \u201cIt\u2019s just we have made the focus shopping instead.\u201dMs. Sewell, a known (or at least oft-photographed) quantity to many of the site\u2019s users, demystifies the change and gives it literal shape and personality.\u201cYasmin is a distinctive voice in the fashion world, with a wide follower base and strong pre-existing relationships with lots of designers and brands,\u201d Franck Zayan, the president of Style.com and a former head of e-commerce at the Parisian luxury department store Galeries Lafayette, said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cShe is a prototype of the sort of shopper we are looking to attract.\u201dTurns out she thought so, too. Mr. Zayan initially approached her about some part-time branding work, but \u201cI was just very upfront with him. I said straight out, \u2018Do you need a fashion director?\u2019\u201d Ms. Sewell said over lunch in North London a few days before the site\u2019s debut.Clad in ripped Vetements jeans, Prada platforms and a graphic Herculie white T-shirt, she was full of polished enthusiasm. \u201cFor a while they weren\u2019t sure, and if anything I was almost pursuing them,\u201d Ms. Sewell said. \u201cBut then the offer came and it was full-time and I thought, \u2018My life has just completely changed.\u2019\u201dMs. Sewell moved to Britain from Sydney at the age of 20 and two years later, in 1999, started a Soho boutique called Yasmin Cho, attracting celebrities like Madonna and Kylie Minogue and attention from rivals. But while her creative instincts were honed, she lacked commercial experience; the store closed and she retreated home to Australia.A call from Joan Burstein, the owner of the London concept store Browns and a doyenne of the luxury buying scene, brought her back to run Browns Focus, a younger, edgier sibling to the main store. Later, she became the main store\u2019s buying director.In 2009 she went freelance, consulting for J. W. Anderson and Moda Operandi, among others, and four years ago she and her husband introduced their own clothing label, \u00catre C\u00e9cile, all Parisian-inspired tees, tanks and sweatshirts. She has now stepped back from its day-to-day operations, however, as she has other issues on her plate.At Style.com, Ms. Sewell is responsible for everything from selecting the brands featured (now around 150, though notable omissions, like Prada, Versace and Alexander McQueen, caused more than a few raised eyebrows at the site\u2019s unveiling and still prompt whispers) to identifying key seasonal trends, and for compiling articles from Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s magazines for the site.Currently the only titles involved are British Vogue and GQ \u2014 screen-grab-style shots of their pages sit on the slick, monochrome Style.com site, which a user can click through to find products. But in time Ms. Sewell hopes to feature all of the group\u2019s publications, broadening offerings beyond fashion to include food, wine and travel.Her team also can select brand-created content to feature, and is developing collaborations with partners including Burberry, Chlo\u00e9 and Vetements. And hefty investment has gone into incorporating artificial intelligence tools into the site, which will, over time, \u201clearn\u201d what each shopper wants to see and then make specific recommendations, \u00e0 la Netflix or Spotify.But unlike its rival Net-a-Porter, Style.com doesn\u2019t hold any inventory. (Style.com gets a cut of the sale price, though it would not specify how much, and the amount varies from brand to brand.)\u201cContent can be bolder and braver when we don\u2019t handle stock,\u201d Ms. Sewell said. \u201cBut it is also fantastic for brands whose online businesses are still small, who don\u2019t have access to the clients we do, or can\u2019t afford to create the content. Because we\u2019re owned by Cond\u00e9 Nast, there is this trust there that the product will be shown in a beautiful, credible way.\u201dBut therein also lies the rub. Questions have surfaced around what this means for the credibility of the articles on the site, since if an e-commerce business gets a slice of a sale, the bigger the sale, the bigger its profits. That could create pressure for magazines to feature pricier goods in order to bolster the bottom line.\u201cWhen it comes to Vogue or GQ, I have absolutely no say on what they do or who they talk about,\u201d Ms. Sewell said. \u201cI have no influence whatsoever on their editorial strategy,\u201d she added, her smile tightening, as she reached for her sunglasses.With increased competition from new digital publications over the last decade, alongside an industrywide plunge in advertising spending, it is little surprise that Cond\u00e9 Nast is intent on cultivating new revenue streams. In recent years it has widened its focus, from magazine publishing to more varied media initiatives, with minority stakes in several fashion e-commerce start-ups, including Vestiaire Collective, Rent the Runway and Farfetch.But Style.com is its first fully owned venture, with 50 percent held by the United States-based Cond\u00e9 Nast and the other half by the British-based Cond\u00e9 Nast International. Concerns were raised after the site\u2019s introduction was repeatedly pushed back, and there were rumors of repeated personnel changes circling around London\u2019s tech scene.Now that it\u2019s finally live, the big question is: Will it work?Lauren Kaufman Witten, the vice president for retail and luxury at L2, a research and advisory firm for consumer brands, is not sure. \u201cIt is not an easy business to scale,\u201d she said.\u201cNo one has the answers, but it\u2019s an exciting time to be in fashion,\u201d Ms. Sewell said. \u201cThe entire industry is in an intense period of flux. In 20 years in the business, I have never known anything like it. But you\u2019ve got to be game for change, haven\u2019t you? I\u2019m not nervous at all. Bring it on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(\u201cI was a songwriter, really, and that took up a lot of my imagination and time,\u201d he said of his youthful indirection.)A stint on the daytime soap \u201cLoving\u201d followed, along with roles in movies like \u201cThe Last Days of Disco.\u201d In 2000, he entered the world of television dramas opposite Jessica Alba in James Cameron\u2019s \u201cDark Angel\u201d before originating the role of DiNozzo three seasons later, first in two episodes of \u201cJAG\u201d and then in its spinoff, \u201cNCIS,\u201d centered on Special Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and his team of investigators.\u201cBull does not sweat \u2014 he\u2019s not worried about what anybody thinks about him,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is interesting because DiNozzo lived in an almost constant craving for people\u2019s validation.\u201dAs for finally being the man in charge, \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating \u2014 you sort of become the character you play,\u201d Mr. Weatherly said of the side effects of portraying a masterly if chaotic emotional manipulator.\u201cMy wife has already pointed out that there has been a subtle adjustment in my personality since I started doing the show, and I asked her if she liked it or not.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cShe just stared at me.\u201dMs. Moore plays the mother of soon-to-be-born triplets.After three unsuccessful pilot seasons \u2014 that winter ritual when actors scramble to be cast in shows that are desperately seeking a fall network berth \u2014 Mandy Moore was contemplating sitting out a fourth. \u201cIt\u2019s a soul-crushing endeavor to be as invested as you possibly can in a project and imagining the future,\u201d she said, \u201cbut to not be too invested that you\u2019re desperately upset that things don\u2019t move forward.\u201dThen, in the off-season, the script for NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us\u201d came Ms. Moore\u2019s way, written by Dan Fogelman of the Disney hit \u201cTangled,\u201d in which she had voiced Rapunzel.

People look at you like you\u2019re a freak.\u201dMr. Colter\u2019s friends in St. Matthews, S.C., probably weren\u2019t thinking freak, exactly, when they anointed him the Bryant Gumbel of their elementary school\u2019s public announcement system. His classmates in high school also were onto something, when they voted him most ambitious in his senior year.At the historically black Benedict College in Columbia, S.C., he befriended the head of the drama department, who encouraged him to test his talent on a larger stage. After graduating in theater from the University of South Carolina, he earned an M.F.A. in acting from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University. His breakthrough came, at 28 and with only two television appearances to his credit, as the boxer Big Willie Little in Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Baby.\u201d With guest spots on the \u201cLaw & Order\u201d franchise and \u201cRinger,\u201d he then landed what became a recurring role on \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d as the quietly fearsome Chicago drug lord Lemond Bishop.Long before Cage loomed onscreen, Mr. Colter and Cheo Hodari Coker, the show\u2019s creator, talked about what kind of person he was. \u201cWe wanted to elevate him in a sense,\u201d Mr. Colter said of Cage\u2019s refusal to bandy about a certain racial slur commonly slung on the TV show. \u201cIt\u2019s a small step but so symbolic. He is a superhero, and I wanted him to feel like a superhero.\u201dSure, a leading role is exciting, but Mr. Colter isn\u2019t about to let the frenzy divert his methodical way of looking at things. \u201cA lot of people would say, \u2018Oh, this is so wonderful,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, it is great \u2014 you\u2019ve got the opportunity.

{"Headline": "People Are Watching Less TV. So Will They Watch the Emmys?", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHERE was a time several years ago when awards shows were on the upswing.As television ratings began to erode in an era of Netflix, the DVR and Facebook, awards shows, along with sports and other big live events, were among the few rock-solid programming institutions that were immune to the changes, delivering grindingly sturdy results.Well, they used to, at least.Here's a look at some of the most memorable moments from the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards.Trying to buck this recent trend on Sunday will be the Emmys, which will be broadcast on ABC and hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.Executives in the television industry are aware of the declines and are wondering if they are part of the cyclical rise and fall of awards shows, or if people\u2019s ever-changing viewing habits are finally affecting the ratings for these three- to four-hour, commercial-loaded TV events.\u201cWhat prompts these trends?\u201d said Don Mischer, the longtime TV-event producer who is overseeing this year\u2019s Emmys. \u201cAs we\u2019ve gone through time, there is so much more content available that the pieces of the pie are getting smaller and smaller.\u201d57 PhotosThat\u2019s one theory: that viewers are instead turning to an ever-expanding list of options instead of habitually tuning in to the Oscars or Emmys. Another is that with a growing number of awards programs, viewer fatigue is setting in. Yet another is that at a time when services like Netflix provide programming without commercials, the prospect of watching a prolonged awards show riddled with ads seems like too much to endure. It doesn\u2019t hurt that highlights from an awards show that happened the night before are always just a click away.\u201cThere are so many things fighting for your time, and live TV, even for live events, is fairly inefficient,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, a financial-services firm. \u201cOur tolerance for commercials and high-ad loads is disappearing. Once you started to binge watch, it\u2019s just hard to go back to any form of live-linear TV unless you\u2019re an absolute die-hard fan.\u201dFinding an answer is critical for an industry that is desperately trying to maintain an ad-supported business model. Big live events that drive viewership and provoke engagement \u2014 on social media in real time, and in offices the day after \u2014 are a crucial component of that strategy.Executives point out that awards shows have long been prone to seesaw ratings, with any number of factors affecting their appeal. For the Oscars, viewership is often dictated by whether a series of blockbusters, or movies with big-name stars, were nominated for best picture. For other awards, the competition that night \u2014 whether it\u2019s an N.F.L. playoff game that goes into overtime or a hit like \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d \u2014 can dictate an up year or a down year.The television critics James Poniewozik, Mike Hale and Neil Genzlinger evaluate the 2016 Primetime Emmy nominations.But in the last two years, the gains have stopped. The Oscars went from an audience of 43.7 million in 2014 to 34.3 million this year. The Golden Globes went from a total of 20.9 million viewers in 2014 to 18.5 million this year. The Grammys went from 28.5 million viewers two years ago to 25 million this year. And the Emmys went from an audience of 17.6 million in 2013 to 11.9 million last year. There are similar trend lines for many other awards programs, with big highs from a couple of years ago eroding by the millions.\u201cPerhaps the outlier was the growth in viewership,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cMaybe this is just the reality now.\u201dDan Donnelly, a managing director at Publicis Media, said that even if ratings continue to fall, big live events still deliver an audience that few programs can match, and so might remain attractive to advertisers.\u201cEven with that decline, if someone tells you, \u2018Oh, you can advertise in an environment with 18, 25 or 30 million viewers, even if they used to have 45 or 50 million,\u2019 well, then wow, that\u2019s still a great place to play,\u201d he said.There is also hope within ABC that it is better positioned than Fox (last year\u2019s Emmy network) to provide a promotional push \u2014 through Mr. Kimmel\u2019s late-night show and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d \u2014 that could position the show for higher ratings this year.The Emmys present an unusually intriguing case study: They are dedicated to honoring an industry that\u2019s never been bigger or filled with more celebrated shows, but those shows also don\u2019t attract big audiences, Mr. Mischler said, at least compared with Emmy winners of years past.Producers for the show said they have had to take special care to introduce a growing supply of shows and actors to viewers who might never have watched or heard of them.\u201cEach year, there are more nominations of shows and actors that an increasing number of viewers at home are unfamiliar with,\u201d Mr. Mischer said. \u201cWe will go on the air Sunday night, and how many of viewers across the country are familiar with \u2018Portlandia\u2019\u201d?Or, as Mr. Nathanson, the analyst put it: \u201cAmazon won an Emmy for \u2018Transparent\u2019 last year. Most people haven\u2019t seen it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Is This the End for Movies?", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).It\u2019s Friday! Let\u2019s talk movies.To help us understand what to make of cinema\u2019s dirge, I turned to two of The Times\u2019s most thoughtful Hollywood watchers: Brooks Barnes, the neighborhood beat reporter based in Los Angeles, and A.O. Scott, one of our chief film critics.He cited evidence that suggests people may be shunning spontaneous treks to the theater in favor of plopping on the couch for a Netflix binge. This trend also coincides with a summer flush with big studio flops: \u201cSequelitis and an overload of event movies have been blamed for much of the carnage.\u201dBut, he argues, these trends don\u2019t spell doom for the medium.\u201cIt pops up almost every summer \u2014 \u2018nothing but blockbuster drivel!\u2019 he said in an email. \u201cFor more than 40 years, summer has been when studios roll out their lumbering parade floats aimed at the out-of-school set.\u201dIn the fall, the studios shift to more sophisticated fare, Mr. Barnes said. \u201cComing up are movies that will blow people away.\u201d\u201cThe death of cinema has been going on for most of a century,\u201d he said, \u201cand I expect it will last for at least another hundred years.\u201dHe wrote: \u201cWhatever the state of the industry or the prevailing winds in the culture and the digital economy, the integrity and specificity of cinema is a fact.\u201d\u201cThis is big, and I hope it sends a message across the country.\u201d Mr. Brown said at a signing ceremony in a Los Angeles park.The two measures require the most populous state to cut emissions from vehicles, factories and utilities to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.Supporters overcame strong opposition from the oil industry and many Republican lawmakers to pass the legislation.The New York Times Magazine sent Nico Young, a particularly talented student photographer, on an assignment to show what life is like at his high school.There is still gold to be found in the Sierra Nevada foothills.Mr. Espinoza, 40, said he was in Woods Creek, a waterway in Jamestown known for bearing gold, when he pushed aside a big rock and spotted it, pinched in the bedrock.\u201cIt was just amazing,\u201d he said of the 17.9-ounce nugget. \u201cI was waiting to wake up anytime.\u201dFrank Powell, a guide at the company, said California\u2019s 120-mile Mother Lode continues to provide a livelihood for many lone prospectors.It\u2019s grueling work, he said, requiring strenuous digging to get down to bedrock where the gold is hiding.For Mr. Espinoza, who has two daughters, prospecting has provided a precarious livelihood since he took it up almost four years ago.In a typical week, he makes between $200 and $300, he said. Some days he goes home empty-handed.\u201cThere are times when it drains you, not only economically, but physically and mentally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to get back up and try again after you failed so many times.\u201dAs word started to spread about his discovery, he said he has fielded three serious offers.Mr. Espinoza is not saying how much he wants for it, but the owner of Gold Prospecting Adventures suggested that with its historical significance it ought to fetch up to $70,000.Mr. Espinoza said he plans to wait for the right offer.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Emmy Awards 2016: Emmys Welcome Surprises Along With the Favorites", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 It was business as usual in the two major categories at the Emmys on Sunday night, as HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cVeep\u201d repeated as winners for best drama and comedy.But for a ceremony that can be numbingly predictable, the Emmys were energized by a slew of first-time winners in the acting categories and a tour de force in the limited series category by FX\u2019s \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.\u201dThe success of the O.J. series set the theme for the evening as Sarah Paulson, Courtney B. Vance and Sterling K. Brown all scored their first Emmy victories. Rami Malek won his first Emmy as well in a wide-open race for best actor in a drama, for his role as the tortured hacker in USA\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d And in a big upset, Tatiana Maslany won as best actress in a drama for her numerous performances in BBC America\u2019s \u201cOrphan Black,\u201d beating out the likes of Robin Wright, Claire Danes and last year\u2019s winner, Viola Davis.Here's a look at some of the most memorable moments from the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards.Kate McKinnon of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d provided a change of pace, too, upsetting Allison Janney, a seven-time Emmy winner, as best supporting actress for comedy. Likewise, Louie Anderson won his first Emmy in the best supporting comedy category for his role as a suburban mother in FX\u2019s \u201cBaskets.\u201dThere was a changing of the guard in the variety category, as John Oliver\u2019s show, \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d ended the 13-year run of Comedy Central victories.There were familiar winners as well: In the comedy category, Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her fifth consecutive best actress award for her role on \u201cVeep,\u201d and Jeffrey Tambor, for the second year in a row, won for his role as a transgender woman in \u201cTransparent.\u201dThis was the second consecutive year that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cVeep\u201d took top honors, which helped propel HBO to six Emmys on Sunday night and 22 Emmys over all (some categories were awarded previously), the biggest haul of any programmer. FX was right behind with 18 wins, including six on Sunday.57 PhotosIn a sign of the expected Emmys dominance for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cO.J,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel, the show\u2019s host, said in his opening monologue, \u201cIf your show doesn\u2019t have a dragon or a white Bronco in it, go home.\u201dHere are some of the themes and highlights of the evening:Comedy Central had a chokehold on the variety talk show category for years, and a Comedy Central alumnus took the award on Sunday: Mr. Oliver, for his HBO show, \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201dThe show is now in its third season, and the win represents a breakthrough of sorts. The Emmy in this category has been handed out to daily talk shows for years and hasn\u2019t been given to a weekly show since Tracey Ullman won for her sketch series \u201cTracey Takes On\u2026\u201d nearly 20 years ago. (Starting last year, variety sketch series and variety talk series were separated into different categories.)Mr. Oliver\u2019s triumph is a blow for Comedy Central, which had won this award for 13 consecutive years between \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d Not this year; Trevor Noah, Jon Stewart\u2019s replacement, was shut out of the race and not nominated in his first year as host of \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201dBut there was some solace in Comedy Central\u2019s night, when \u201cKey & Peele\u201d won the best variety sketch series award. The bad news? That is now off the air.Not surprisingly, this year\u2019s divisive election played a significant role in this year\u2019s ceremony.Lamenting the possibility of a Donald J. Trump presidency, Mr. Kimmel lit into the reality show producer Mark Burnett, who was one of the creators of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the show that made Mr. Trump a nationwide television star. With ABC\u2019s camera firmly squared on Mr. Burnett \u2014 who laughed the entire time, despite the charged barbs \u2014 Mr. Kimmel said that if Mr. Trump is elected president, Mr. Burnett is the man to blame.\u201cIf he\u2019s elected and he builds that wall, the first person we\u2019re throwing over it is Mark Burnett,\u201d Mr. Kimmel said.Later in the night, after \u201cThe Voice\u201d won the best reality show, Mr. Burnett, a producer for that show as well, shot back at Mr. Kimmel saying that the host gave \u201canother five minutes of free publicity\u201d for Mr. Trump.Mr. Kimmel took the stage afterward and had his own retort: \u201cThat Emmy is going on the hood of Trump\u2019s limousine, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAnd Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, who plays the vice president turned president Selina Meyer, said this upon winning her Emmy for every year she\u2019s been nominated in the role: \u201cOur show started out as a political satire, but it now feels more like a sobering documentary.\u201dFX\u2019s \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d was a ratings hit and a darling of critics, and now a big-time Emmy winner.In addition to winning the limited series Emmy, Ms. Paulson, Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown all won acting awards. Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown both beat co-stars to win. Nearly every feature player on the show was nominated for an award, a total of six in all.After Ms. Paulson was named best actress, she got up from her seat and gave a big hug to Marcia Clark, the prosecutor she played in the 10-episode drama, and whom she brought as her guest to the ceremony.Ms. Paulson\u2019s performance was a sympathetic one, and it\u2019s been a year of redemption for Ms. Clark.\u201cI, along with the rest of the world, had been superficial and careless in my judgment,\u201d Ms. Paulson said, choking up as she directed her comments to Ms. Clark. \u201cAnd I am glad to be able to stand here today in front of everyone and tell you I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u2019For FX, \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d was the leader for what was turning out to be its best year at the Emmys ever. \u201cFargo\u201d was also nominated in the limited-series category and, after years of being shut out, FX\u2019s critically praised \u201cThe Americans\u201d finally broke through with three major nominations \u2014 best drama, best actor (Matthew Rhys) and best actress (Keri Russell) \u2014 though it did not win.There were three African-American winners in acting categories Sunday, a notable departure from this year\u2019s Academy Awards, in which no minorities were nominated in the acting categories. In addition to wins from Mr. Brown and Mr. Vance, Regina King won the supporting actress in a limited series Emmy for her role in ABC\u2019s \u201cAmerican Crime.\u201d And \u201cKey & Peele\u201d prevailed in the variety sketch award.Instead, attention has turned to the awards themselves, with campaigning having turned into something of a blood sport. In the last two years there has been a 40 percent increase in the number of submissions for the best drama Emmy, according to the Television Academy. And \u201cfor your consideration\u201d mailers have reached comical proportions, with Netflix sending out a package to Emmy voters so hefty that it could crush a toe.For each of the last three years, streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have become a larger presence at the Emmys. Netflix had 54 nominations this year, its highest ever, and for the first time, it did better than any of the broadcast networks.But despite the upheaval Netflix has caused in the industry, the streaming service has yet to have a big Emmys night. Though it collected nine Emmys overall, including three on Sunday, Netflix continues to strike out in the best drama, best comedy and best actor and actress categories.Ben Mendelsohn did win the Emmy for best supporting actor for his role in \u201cBloodline.\u201d But even with the lavish attention on the presidential election this year, neither Kevin Spacey nor Robin Wright won for their roles in the political drama \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Neither actor has won a Primetime Emmy Award.For Amazon, Mr. Tambor won again for \u201cTransparent.\u2019\u2019The broadcast networks continued to have a diminished presence at the Emmys. NBC won two awards Sunday night, and ABC and Fox won one. CBS was shut out altogether.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What You Should Watch This Week: \u2018High Maintenance\u2019 and \u2018Fleabag\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWatchingDear Watchers,Em-mys week-end [clap, clap, clap clap clap]. As with all award-distributing endeavors, the Emmys are deeply flawed, and we must not confuse Emmy-worthiness with goodness nor its opposite with badness. But I love a spectacle, and rituals are the way we consecrate behavior to foster magical experiences within ordinary acts. Plus look at how nice everyone looks!Before the Emmys on Sunday night, though, there are two fabulous shows premiering this weekend, and Watching\u2019s movie writer, Monica Castillo, has two great movie recommendations for you.Let\u2019s all really make a go of things this weekend. Wheee.Phoebe Waller-Bridge created and stars in this British series that starts out as dark, filthy fun and deepens into a stunningly rich portrait of a complex, complicated woman.On the one hand, she has perfect British sweaters and alluring pink lipstick and a haircut that I swear will inspire 10,000 curly bobs, and she\u2019s funny and smart and seemingly irresistible to men. On the other hand, she\u2019s a wreck \u2014 and not in that \u201ctee-hee, I\u2019m just a lil girl with all this whiskey!\u201d way women are \u201cwrecks\u201d in TV shows. She\u2019s a profoundly self-sabotaging monster. The show breaks the fourth wall just often enough for cheekiness without devolving into commentary on itself, and it captures some of the unresolvable tension of adult-sibling relationships and the intoxicating thrall of intimate friendships.The more \u201cHigh Maintenance\u201d you watch, the more you\u2019ll like it, and I strongly encourage you to watch the web episodes (available on HBO streaming platforms) before watching the cable version. Lots of familiar faces reappear, and while context isn\u2019t essential, it never hurts.\u201cHigh\u201d follows a bicycle-riding weed dealer only identified as \u201cthe Guy\u201d (the show\u2019s co-creator Ben Sinclair) and his various clients \u2014 most episodes are heavier on the clients than on the Guy, but there are a few exceptions. Most of the webisodes were under 10 minutes, so this leap to HBO does push the format a little; the show compensates by having most episodes cover two clients\u2019 stories.More important than exact story structure, though, is the show\u2019s, well, vibes: It can be nakedly and straightforwardly hilarious, but it tends more to the gimlet eye \u2014 though only toward the characters who can take it. The wounded, vulnerable and downtrodden are handled with gentle care, with the encouraging gaze of a hopeful kindergarten teacher.Ever since \u201cRevenge,\u201d \u201cRinger\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl\u201d (such guilty pleasures!) ended, I\u2019ve been looking for a show that has rich people with ridiculous dramas and money problems, but haven\u2019t quite found the right one for me. Everyone tells me to watch \u201cQuantico,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d or \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder,\u201d but those are pretty \u201ceh\u201d (and I don\u2019t like medical shows). Could you please help me out? \u2014 JohnOh, I love a good rich-person soap. I encourage you, though, to disabuse yourself of the concept of \u201cguilty pleasures.\u201d Pleasure is just pleasure; if no one\u2019s getting hurt, there\u2019s nothing to feel guilty about. (If someone is getting hurt, find a different outlet. That\u2019s not cool.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Narcos\u2019 Season 2, Pablo Escobar\u2019s Time Is Running Out", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust as in the first season, however, Mr. Moura\u2019s wonderfully blank Escobar commands Season 2 of \u201cNarcos.\u201d Seldom has an actor done so much by doing what appears to be so little.And so it takes us ever deeper into the byzantine worlds of narco-crime and South American politics. Escobar has more than just law enforcement to worry about. Rival drug dealers are trying to capitalize on his organization\u2019s weakened state, and groups with political rather than criminal agendas are seeing the manhunt as an opportunity to advance their causes.That means Season 2 requires more attentive viewing than Season 1 did \u2014 there are more players, alliances and animosities to track \u2014 but it also gives the writers characters other than Escobar to develop. A particularly well-conceived arc in the early episodes involves a cabby (Leynar Gomez) who agrees to drive Escobar around Medell\u00edn (he hides in the trunk) and the young woman, Maritza (Martina Garc\u00eda), he persuades to be his decoy passenger. Soon both are in far deeper than they ever imagined.The Maritza story line is representative of one thing Season 2 has that Season 1 didn\u2019t: significant roles for women. There is Judy Moncada (Cristina Uma\u00f1a), one of those rival drug dealers, who is bent on avenging some particularly brutal deaths Escobar doled out. There is Claudia Messina (Florencia Lozano), who is sent from the United States to take over the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s somewhat anemic efforts to assist in the manhunt. And Escobar\u2019s wife, Tata (Paulina Gait\u00e1n), becomes more assertive about securing her family\u2019s safety.The calculus seems to be that the series won\u2019t draw an audience in the United States unless it fosters the myth that no problem can be solved without American brainpower. Sure, the real-life Mr. Murphy and Mr. Pe\u00f1a played roles in the manhunt, but the Americans who really ought to receive more of this show\u2019s attention are the ones who fostered the rise of Escobar and other drug lords by buying their products.In any case, Mr. Moura is inscrutably brilliant at the center of it all. Normally, an actor stands out by creating a character who is constantly revealing things, whether with his eyes, his expression or his words. Mr. Moura excels by doing the opposite. The difference between Escobar\u2019s coldhearted stare and the loving gaze he aims at his family is almost imperceptible.Mr. Moura\u2019s Escobar is so tightly controlled that you never know, when he walks into a room, whether he\u2019s going to kill someone or shower that person with praise and money. More important, the other characters never know either.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Kicks the Tires at McLaren", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsMcLaren\u2019s cars travel fast, but rumors about Apple acquisitions can flash by, too.Apple approached McLaren, which is based in Britain, about an investment or purchase, according to The Financial Times. The $610 billion Apple, though, has made few acquisitions, even to help it pioneer smartphones. While McLaren is a high-tech supercar and Formula One business, it is still hard to see it taking Apple\u2019s vehicular ambitions far.Apple executives might enjoy such a bauble. The design guru Jony Ive has a penchant for Aston Martins and Bentleys. Eddy Cue, head of software and services, sits on Ferrari\u2019s board. But Apple\u2019s typical market is far bigger than the rarefied one for $1 million automobiles. And the technology of designing racecars does not trickle down very fast \u2014 BMW retains an aura of tech leadership and refinement despite dropping its Formula One team years ago.Over the last year Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., has, according to reports, sniffed around the electric-car maker Tesla Motors, the entertainment giant Time Warner, the video-streaming site Netflix, the music service Tidal, the camera maker GoPro and the software producer Adobe. The spread of technology, Apple\u2019s lack of hit new products and its giant cash hoard \u2014 more than $230 billion \u2014 explain why both outsiders and some insiders might fancy and even start exploring all kinds of options.Perhaps the promise and challenges of autonomous electric cars will force Apple to change its habits. Even the dedicated carmaker Tesla, for example, used a Lotus-produced chassis and body for its first model. But the simpler explanation probably applies. Fancy can run free when a company has so much cash. A McLaren deal is probably already no more than a dot disappearing over the horizon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Insomnia Machine", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 1914, The Lancet reported on a clergyman who was found dead in a pool; he had left behind this suicide note: \u201cAnother sleepless night, no real sleep for weeks. Oh, my poor brain, I cannot bear the lengthy, dark hours of the night.\u201dI came across that passage with a shock of recognition. Many people think that the worst part of insomnia is the daytime grogginess. But like that pastor, I suffered most in the dark hours after midnight, when my desire for sleep, my raging thirst for it, would drive me into temporary insanity. On the worst nights, my mind would turn into a mad dog that snapped and gnawed itself.Though one in 10 American adults suffer from chronic insomnia, we have yet to answer the most fundamental questions about the affliction. Scientists are still arguing about the mechanisms of sleep and the reasons it fails in seemingly healthy people. There are few \u2014 if any \u2014 reliable treatments for insomnia. At the same time, medical journals warn that bad sleep can fester into diseases like cancer and diabetes. Deep in the night, those warnings scuttle around my mind like rats.About 18 months ago, during a particularly grueling period, I felt so desperate that I consulted yet another doctor \u2014 but all he did was suggest the same drugs that had failed me in the past. I was thrown back once again on my own ways of coping. As a child, I had invented mental games to distract myself. For instance, I would compile a list of things and people that made me happy, starting with words that began with A and moving through the alphabet.One night, I was in the Qs, trying to figure out what to add to quesadillas, queer theory and Questlove. Then, suddenly, the game infuriated me \u2014 why, why, why did I have to spend hours doing this? In the red glare of the digital clock, my brain rattled its cage. I prepared for a wave of lunacy.But instead of a meltdown, I had a wild idea: What if there was another, easier, way to drive the miserable thoughts from my mind?I began to fantasize about a machine that would do the thinking for me. I pictured it like another brain that would fit on top of my head. The next day, I cobbled together my first insomnia machine.Though millions of us struggle with chronic insomnia, we\u2019re not a unified army fighting the same foe. Every one of us is grappling with a different mix of mental and physical dysfunctions. Dozens of medical conditions deprive people of sleep; these include apnea, Parkinson\u2019s disease, chronic pain, depression, brain injury, autism and restless legs syndrome.For a while I followed the rules of \u201csleep hygiene\u201d \u2014 a tough-love approach that includes dragging yourself out of bed during wakeful periods, and allowing yourself to crawl back under the covers only when you feel sleepy. But I never felt sleepy. And in our frigid New England house in winter, it was excruciating to be exiled from the wool blankets; I felt humiliated, like a bad dog, as I put one foot and then another down on the cold floor and slunk off to another room. Even the name of the therapy shamed me: The word \u201chygiene\u201d had an old-fashioned sting to it, an implication that the way I slept was filthy and needed to be scoured.So that\u2019s why I \u2014 the dirty, disreputable insomniac \u2014 took matters into my own hands. I found a stretchy sock that was long enough to wrap around my head like a blindfold. Then I sewed the sock into a circle, from toe to topstitch, making sure it fit securely, so that it would stay in place no matter how I tossed and turned on the pillow. I cut two slits in the inner layer of fabric, sewing stitches to create button-hole-like openings. And then I found an old pair of earbuds, sewed foam around each bud, and threaded the foam-bumps into holes in the headgear. This way, the gizmo would hold the speakers near my ears, but not in them \u2014 more comfortable for sleeping. Once I had finished, I attached a cheap MP3 player (made by SanDisk) to the rig. Now I could roll my head around, doze, slumber or pad to the bathroom, all while listening to the new voice in my head.My boyfriend said that he felt as if he were sleeping next to a hostage. But weird as it looked, the device offered relief. I\u2019d cue up an audiobook and a monologue would commence, blotting out my own thoughts. Instead of laboring to calm myself, I could just drift on the voice pumped into my head. I began to wear the machine all night long, floating in and out of sleep, comforted that whatever happened, the narrator would stay with me.After I\u2019d built my headgear, I discovered companies were selling similar devices online \u2014 usually in the form of fleece headbands outfitted with flat earphones. I tried some out, but I found they weren\u2019t snug enough to stay in place, so I still use my D.I.Y. gear.Of course, the insomnia machine is a humble hack. The real challenge lay in curating the audio: It took trial and error to find material that could tame my midnight mind.At first, I loaded the machine with the kind of dry disquisitions that, according to conventional wisdom, bring on sleep; I turned to books like \u201cDirt: The Erosion of Civilizations,\u201d an important jeremiad about soil quality that is not super-entertaining. But the drone in my ears didn\u2019t keep my mind busy enough, so instead I began to pick out funny, engaging and friendly books. When I enjoyed those hours of wakefulness, I no longer tried to sleep, and when I stopped trying to sleep, I slept.The slow pace of 19th-century novels and memoirs is perfect for an insomnia machine: You fall asleep when the characters are having dinner, and when you wake up they\u2019ve only reached the drawing room. It feels as if you\u2019re surrounded by friends, dozing comfortably in a corner as life carries on.\u201cHow is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!\u201d Rostov thought. His horse had collapsed underneath him, and blood streamed from the poor creature\u2019s head. Rostov staggered to his feet and looked around the empty meadow, feeling as if he must be in a dream. Was he in enemy territory? Where were the other soldiers?And now I was sleeping. Wakefulness, that galloping horse, had fallen to the ground underneath me. I waded through fields of grass while Tolstoy monologued at me. I wanted to warn him to shut up and take cover, for Napoleon\u2019s spies watched us from the hillside, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. Still, I was glad to have Tolstoy by my side, leading me through that desolate meadow.Literature did not cure my insomnia, but transformed it into a manageable condition, and so I feel enormously grateful to the internet and its crowd of volunteers for providing thousands of hours of literary medicine. I think of Jorge Luis Borges, who lamented that he had been put in charge of Argentina\u2019s National Library after he\u2019d gone blind and was unable to peruse a single page. Today we live in a splendor that Borges might have dreamed into existence, a library we can stumble through in the dark.In 1886, the author Franklin Harvey Head reported that his contemporaries regarded insomnia as a \u201cmodern and even an almost distinctively American disease\u201d brought about by the hustle-bustle of the railroad and the telegraph. As wires spread across the country and incandescent bulbs burned away the stars, some warned about what would happen when electrification spread into rural towns. Surely, chickens would die of insomnia \u2014 and presumably the farmers, too.Whenever a new technology comes along, we inevitably blame it for ruining our sleep. Today, we believe that phones and laptops will scramble our sleep, even though the evidence of that is thin. Few studies have been done to find out whether digital media can set off insomnia in adults, and the findings of what research has been done tend to be contradictory. Nonetheless, many health professionals recommend that we banish all digital devices from our bedrooms.Most important, the internet is becoming a place for insomniacs to gather together and figure out what works, to share insights and help one another.For instance, in 2013, Drew Ackerman created a podcast to lead listeners into slumberland. Now, three times a week, he climbs into a makeshift studio in the back of a closet and spins whimsical stories about matters of no importance. \u201cFasten your sleep-belts,\u201d he might murmur in a codeine drawl before jumping into a tale about the glug-glug-glug sound of a water cooler.Mr. Ackerman has no training as a sleep doctor or health professional. He, too, found salvation from insomnia in audiobooks, specifically aboard the Pequod, squinting out at the 19th-century sea as he floated along on Melville\u2019s words. That experience led him to wonder whether he could fine-tune audio as a therapy.Nowadays, about 70,000 listeners download each episode of his podcast, and reviewers attest to the power of this treatment. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled to fall asleep for most of my 37 years,\u201d writes DaileyComputer. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything \u2014 changing my diet, exercise, meditation, pills, you name it.\u201d He continues: \u201cNothing helps consistently. Except this podcast.\u201dMr. Ackerman treats insomnia as a disease of existential loneliness. \u201cI hear from so many people who listen to the podcast while their partners are sound asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might be in bed with somebody who loves them. But in that situation, it\u2019s the deep dark night, and you\u2019re all alone.\u201dAnd so Mr. Ackerman has created an alter ego named Dearest Scooter who hosts the show and acts as your \u201cbore-friend.\u201d In the bunk bed of your mind, he\u2019s the compassionate brother lying a few feet above you, a voice in the darkness promising he\u2019ll talk until you drift off.He\u2019s also the antithesis of the sleep-hygiene therapists. He doesn\u2019t shame, he commiserates; he knows how horrible insomnia is, and he\u2019s here for you.\u201cPeople need to be validated,\u201d Mr. Ackerman said. \u201cIf I\u2019m thirsty, I drink; if I\u2019m hungry, I can eat. But when I want to sleep, that\u2019s not under my control. And that\u2019s why this is such a painful mystery.\u201dSo many of us are muddling along, finding relief where we can get it. At least we have one another. At 2 in the morning, with my insomnia machine strapped to my head, I listen to a volunteer reading George Meredith\u2019s \u201cThe Egoist\u201d in a South Indian lilt. As every parent knows, there is magic in the human voice telling a story; this is the oldest and most primitive insomnia treatment. In the dark hours, when we\u2019re wandering in the wilderness of thought, sometimes we just need to feel that someone, even a digital someone with a prerecorded voice, is watching over us.Listening to 19th-century novels and memoirs helps Pagan Kennedy defeat insomnia.

{"Headline": "Marcia Clark Finally Has a Moment to Savor at the Emmys", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 From the stars to the producers to the executives, no one involved with \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d seemed to realize the significance of where they were celebrating their triumphant Emmy night after the awards ceremony Sunday.They were all at an after-party at an event space called Vibiana, about two blocks from the courthouse where the Simpson case was tried. A couple of decades later, the case was recreated on this FX program, which won the Emmy for best limited series, capping a big night for the show.When the Fox executive Dana Walden heard about the proximity of the courthouse to the party, she said, \u201cThat just gave me chills,\u201d a sentiment echoed by FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, who called it \u201ca little chilling.\u201dBut there was one person who understood the odd coincidence of ending up back where it all started, after a circuitous and sometimes torturous route.\u201cI know where I am,\u201d Marcia Clark, the prosecutor in the Simpson case, said, a little gravely.She was sitting on a couch, inches away from the actress Sarah Paulson, who was holding the Emmy she won for portraying Ms. Clark.Ms. Clark, who was Ms. Paulson\u2019s guest at the Emmys, said she couldn\u2019t help but think about how near the courthouse was on the ride over from the ceremony.It was a bitter reminder for Ms. Clark, who was ridiculed in the news media in the mid-1990s \u2014 the perception being that she had blown the prosecution and let Mr. Simpson go free. She has found her public comeback only in the last year, after the explosive popularity of the series and the sympathetic portrayal from Ms. Paulson, who in her acceptance speech for her best actress award offered up a moving public apology to Ms. Clark.\u201cThe world saw me in sound bites,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cNow I feel like I\u2019m more understood.\u201dAs Ryan Murphy, the prolific television producer who shepherded this show, put it: \u201cThe great story tonight is Marcia Clark finally won.\u201dAnd so did FX.But propelled by a category that FX is reinventing \u2014 the limited series \u2014 the network arguably stole the show, smashing the basic cable Emmy record by winning 18 awards over all. The previous record was eight awards.The FX show also won acting Emmys for Courtney B. Vance\u2019s portrayal of the defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran and Sterling K. Brown\u2019s depiction of another prosecutor, Christopher Darden. (Louie Anderson won his first Emmy for his role as the mother of Zach Galifianakis\u2019s character in FX\u2019s \u201cBaskets.\u201d)But despite that, FX outshined them on Sunday.\u201cLike most things, it\u2019s a no-brainer in retrospect, but it wasn\u2019t at the time,\u201d said Brad Simpson, a producer of the show, with his Emmy in hand. \u201cThere was such a heavy saturation of O.J. that nobody wanted to hear about it again. When we announced the show, all the comments were, \u2018Oh lord, don\u2019t put the country through this again.\u2019 But the show touched on things that obsesses America: class, race, the criminal justice system.\u201dAnd though the Academy Awards have been criticized for their all-white lineup of acting nominees, the Emmys have done better with diversity: Three African-Americans won acting awards on Sunday, including Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown from \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson.\u201d\u201cActors and directors follow the writing,\u201d Mr. Vance said at the party. \u201cThe writers in TV are writing for different hues of color. Hopefully the movies start to see that if you want to get the people, you better do the writing.\u201dMr. Murphy, the producer, has been a regular at the Emmys (he\u2019s the man behind shows including \u201cGlee,\u201d \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d), and he said that between the diversity onstage and the large number of first-time winners, Sunday night\u2019s ceremony represented \u201ca sea change.\u201d\u201cI feel like sometimes you go to those award shows, and there are some people who win over and over again, but it wasn\u2019t that type of night,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Television Academy and the voters have moved onto a different feeling, a different embrace, and it felt good.\u201dThere was arguably nobody who benefited more on Sunday night than Ms. Clark.Though Ms. Paulson was joined at the hip with Ms. Clark on Sunday, the two did not meet until late in production.They\u2019ve become close since then, and Ms. Paulson provided one of the night\u2019s stirring moments when she apologized to Ms. Clark during her acceptance speech, saying that the public in the 1990s was \u201csuperficial and careless.\u201dMs. Clark seemed to be enjoying the rehabilitation of her reputation.\u201cI think the benefit of this mini-series was people got to see the fullness of everyone involved,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just me. Chris Darden, too. Everyone. As well as the historical context. I think everybody got more of what was going on, more than they did ever before.\u201dFor two hours, Ms. Clark and Ms. Paulson sat cozily in a corner near Mr. Murphy and the \u201cNarcos\u201d star Pedro Pascal.At a little before midnight, Ms. Paulson got up to leave with Ms. Clark. As they walked through a courtyard, a group of young women were gawking at them, but they weren\u2019t interested in the one holding the Emmy.\u201cOh my God, that\u2019s Marcia Clark!\u201d one woman said.Ms. Clark heard it, looked over, pointed triumphantly and waved. She walked out of the party and toward an S.U.V. with Ms. Paulson, and just a few blocks away from her first brush with fame, Ms. Clark finally had her Hollywood ending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon and Pandora to Gauge Music\u2019s Value in the Internet Age", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow much are people willing to spend for streaming music?For years, thanks to rigid pricing structures at streaming services, the answer has been stuck at $10 a month or nothing. But that model may soon be challenged by two giants of online media: Amazon and Pandora Media.Both companies are set to introduce new versions of their streaming services in coming weeks, charging as little as $5 a month, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process was ongoing. The plans will put pressure on incumbent players like Spotify and Apple Music and offer the music industry a major test regarding the value of streaming music \u2014 including the crucial question of whether discounts will be enough to entice people to pay anything when virtually every song is also available free.The pricing model of $10 a month, the standard rate charged by most on-demand streaming services, has been compared to the 99 cents that Apple charged for song downloads when it opened the iTunes music store in 2003 \u2014 a simple and comprehensible amount that established in consumers\u2019 minds the value of music in the internet age.But many in the business have argued that $10 a month is too high for casual listeners. At $120 a year, it costs more than most people have historically paid for music. According to MusicWatch, a market research firm, the average music customer in the United States will pay about $67 this year on recorded music, up from $55 last year but down from $80 in 1999, around the peak of the CD market.The streaming market is divided between internet radio services like Pandora, which offer songs tailored to listeners\u2019 tastes but do not let them choose exactly what songs to hear, and so-called on-demand services, like Spotify and Apple Music, which let users pick specific songs and create playlists.Pandora is expected to make the first move by unveiling, perhaps as early as this week, an expanded version of its $5 subscription platform. That service, which is currently limited to removing ads on its internet radio streams, will soon begin offering customers new features like the ability to skip more unwanted songs and store several hours\u2019 worth of playlists online, according to three people with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s plans.By Christmas, according to these people, Pandora wants to introduce a fully developed competitor to Spotify and Apple Music, with a catalog of tens of millions of songs that a listener can gain access to on demand. That version is expected to cost $10 a month, in line with the current market.For both companies, the new streaming offerings represent variations on the existing models, with a mix of new features that are intended to entice casual listeners into paying a minimal fee without eroding the ranks of customers who are willing to pay more.Amazon and Pandora have spent months negotiating new licensing terms with record companies and music publishers to allow their new streaming offerings, and they are close to completing those deals, according to the people briefed on the plans. Representatives of both companies declined to comment.That episode, technology executives say, was a window into a little-understood reality of the streaming business: that prices are indirectly enforced through the licensing contracts that services sign with record companies.Yet while the headline prices have been stuck at $10 a month, analysts and music executives say that a range of discounts and promotions has made it difficult to gauge what customers are really willing to pay. Most offer family plans, student discounts and introductory trials.Major corporate players like Amazon and Pandora do not face such basic questions of financial viability. But there are still doubts about whether lower price points will make any difference to consumers. YouTube makes virtually any song available free, and, much to the chagrin of the record companies, it is widely considered the most popular online source for music around the world. Spotify, in addition to its $10 premium service, also has a free version supported by advertising.Russ Crupnick, the managing partner of MusicWatch, the market research company, said his research showed that subscribers to premium services like Spotify were pleased with the product and willing to pay. Furthermore, such customers were also likely to pay for other media subscriptions, like to Netflix, Showtime and so on.But for less engaged consumers, he said, particularly those who are satisfied with radio or free streaming on YouTube, it may take much more to get them to buy a subscription.\u201cI don\u2019t know that you get the casual listener to automatically be a superfan just by lowering the price,\u201d Mr. Crupnick said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Delays Vote on Cable Set-Top Boxes", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators on Thursday delayed a vote on a proposal to reshape the television market by freeing consumers from cable box rentals, putting into doubt a plan that has pitted technology companies against cable television providers.Members of the Federal Communications Commission could not agree on a set-top box proposal that requires cable operators to provide their shows and movies on alternative devices rather than just on a cable box. The plan was intended to bring more competition to the television industry and liberate consumers from an average of $231 in annual cable box fees.The proposal will still be considered for a future vote. But Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., said commissioners needed more discussions. Even late Wednesday evening, members of the F.C.C. were negotiating over disagreements and concerns over the proposal.\u201cIt was simply a matter of running out of time,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said in a news conference Thursday after the F.C.C.\u2019s planned monthly meeting.The window of opportunity for Mr. Wheeler to adopt his signature regulation on cable and satellite boxes is growing smaller. With the change of administration after the election, he is under pressure to pass through several ambitious regulations before the end of the year.Ms. Rosenworcel, in a joint statement with the two other Democrats on the five-member commission, said on Thursday morning that she supported the goal of the proposal, to create more competition in the television box market.\u201cWe are still working to resolve the remaining technical and legal issues and we are committed to unlocking the set-top box for consumers across this country,\u201d the three commissioners said.Under the proposed rules, consumers would be able to watch cable shows on devices like a Roku or Apple TV, or on no devices at all with internet-enabled televisions. Getting rid of the cable box would make finding and watching YouTube and Netflix streaming videos as easy as viewing cable programs because they would be presented in what would look like just another app.\u201cThe M.P.A.A. is pleased that the F.C.C. is taking more time, and we hope they use it to ensure any set-top box proposal remains consistent with copyright policy and avoids harming creators,\u201d said Chris Dodd, chairman of Hollywood\u2019s trade group, the Motion Picture Association of America.And recent changes made to address these concerns do \u201cnot solve the copyright, privacy, innovation and other significant concerns that were implicated in this discredited original proposal,\u201d said David Cohen, Comcast\u2019s senior executive vice president, adding that the plan \u201csuffers from the same legal infirmities.\u201dThe regulations would remove a crucial part of the cable television industry\u2019s model of forcing consumers to rent the boxes that showcase their own bundle of channels, analysts say. Making cable programming another app on a device like a TiVo would expose viewers to more streaming content that is directly competing against the paid-TV bundle.\u201cThis is the last gateway to the internet and this is a battle between open and closed platforms,\u201d said Chip Pickering, president of Incompas, a lobbying group that represents Google and Amazon in support of the plan.Backers of the plan were disappointed with the delay, which could put the proposal in jeopardy.\u201cToday\u2019s vote delay is an unequivocal loss for the tens of millions of Americans across the country who are forced to spend their hard-earned money on overpriced set-top box leases that cost them hundreds of dollars a year,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a statement on Thursday.He has said consumers have been charged a combined $20 billion a year in forced rental fees.Advertisement"}

It shakes you up, but it also challenges your ideas about the intersection of race, justice and mass incarceration in the United States, subject matter that could not sound less cinematic. Yet Ms. DuVernay \u2014 best known for \u201cSelma,\u201d and a filmmaker whose art has become increasingly inseparable from her activism \u2014 has made a movie that\u2019s as timely as the latest Black Lives Matter protest and the approaching presidential election.Speed is one reason \u2014 you\u2019re racing through history witness by witness, ghastly statistic by statistic \u2014 but you\u2019re also charged up by how the movie\u2019s voices rise and converge. It\u2019s like being in a room with the smartest people around, all intent on rocking your world. Ms. DuVernay is working within a familiar documentary idiom that weaves original, handsomely shot talking-head interviews with well-researched, occasionally surprising and gravely disturbing archival material. All these sources, in turn, have been shaped into discrete sections that are introduced with music and animation. Every so often, the animation underscores an interviewee\u2019s point, as in one sequence in which the word \u201cfreedom\u201d morphs into flying birds and then the Stars and Stripes and then a slave ship.With few exceptions, the movie\u2019s voices \u2014 including most of its several dozen interviewees \u2014 speak in concert. Some (like a galvanizing Angela Davis) are more effective and persuasive than others; at least one \u2014 Newt Gingrich, speaking startling truth to power \u2014 is a jaw-dropper. Even with its surprise guests, the movie isn\u2019t especially dialectical; it also isn\u2019t mainstream journalism. Ms. DuVernay presents both sides of the story, as it were (racism versus civil rights). Yet she doesn\u2019t call on, say, politicians who have voted against civil rights measures for their thoughts on the history of race in the United States. She begins from the premise that white supremacy has already had its say for centuries.Ms. DuVernay forcefully and sorrowfully challenges that confident assertion, tracing the history of systems of racial control from the years after the abolition of slavery all the way to George Zimmerman\u2019s speaking to a police dispatcher about the 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s got his hand in his waistband,\u201d we hear Mr. Zimmerman say shortly before fatally shooting Mr. Martin. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a black male.\u201d When this documentary reaches its culmination, which features graphic videos of one after another black man being shot by police, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s rigorously controlled deconstruction of crime, punishment and race in the United States has become a piercing, keening cry.\u201c13TH\u201d is not rated.

{"Headline": "\u2018Luke Cage\u2019 Puts Race at the Center of the Story", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the connected series of movies and television shows known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which occupies an inordinate amount of territory in our popular culture, there\u2019s a quiet corner that belongs to Netflix. The Netflix-Marvel series, focusing on a mostly second-tier group of heroes \u2014 so far Daredevil, Jessica Jones and, beginning on Friday, Luke Cage \u2014 have been a laboratory in turning comic books into live-action TV without the noisy battles and tag-team group heroics of Marvel mainstays like the Avengers, X-Men and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.But what\u2019s most distinctive about the series is the way it puts race \u2014 and specifically pride in Harlem, where the show takes place \u2014 at the center of the story. It\u2019s not just that Cage (Mike Colter of \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d) is engaged in a battle for the neighborhood\u2019s soul with Cottonmouth (Mahershala Ali, \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d), a local crime boss. That\u2019s a plot we\u2019ve seen plenty of times.It\u2019s the steady drumbeat of visual and spoken references to Harlem\u2019s history and culture, which depending on your taste can come off as an inspiring refrain or as facile name-dropping. The occasional reference to a Beyonc\u00e9 or Denzel is lost among the citations of past and present neighborhood figures, from Langston Hughes and Billy Strayhorn to Percy Sutton, Geoffrey Canada and ASAP Rocky.This approach has a couple of effects, beyond the unusual (for the superhero genre) and welcome element of diversity. The selling of Harlem as a literary-artistic wonderland is distracting in what\u2019s basically a straightforward, middling-quality comic-book adaptation about a reluctant hero taking on gangsters and crooked politicians.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Explaining the U.S. Presidential Election to China: It\u2019s Not Really Like \u2018House of Cards\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySinosphereAs Election Day approaches in the United States, the Chinese are paying closer attention to the selection of the next president.An estimated 70,000 people listen the podcasts every month. In August, Mr. You published \u201cGet Elected: A Very Short Introduction to the U.S. Presidential Election\u201d (Taihai Publishing House, Beijing) with Mr. Hua and Lin Yao, who has a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University.In an interview, Mr. You explained that the Chinese are more interested in the United States presidential election than ever, but don\u2019t always understand it.What do Chinese get wrong about the American political process?I feel that the biggest misunderstanding is that many Chinese take \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d too seriously. American politics is complicated, even for Americans. For many Chinese, it\u2019s just too confusing. So people take a shortcut. \u201cHouse of Cards\u2019\u2019 is so real for them that it filters their impressions of American politics.Another misunderstanding is derived from the negative propaganda many Chinese have absorbed over the years, that is, that American politics is controlled by money or big capitalists and that politicians are just puppets controlled by capitalists. It\u2019s possible that there are serious problems in American politics. But as far as plutocratic politics is concerned, it\u2019s not as bad as people in China imagine.On the other hand, some liberal intellectuals in China believe that the United States is good in every way. Its political system is good and its people\u2019s voices are heard. They attribute every achievement of the United States to its superior political system.I feel that many Chinese aren\u2019t really observing American politics as much as they\u2019re projecting their own biases onto American politics.Are people in China are better informed about the presidential election than four or eight years ago?We have access to far more information than we did four or eight years ago. Millions of Chinese have traveled to the United States. We have a powerful internet and social media. A large percentage of younger people speak English. But American politics is complicated. To understand it, we need to put it into context, which many Chinese can\u2019t do.What is the range of Chinese political views you see on social media comments on the podcast?Obviously Chinese political views vary. But I\u2019ve noticed that many in our audience who express their views publicly take a nationalistic stance. They look at the election from the perspective of what\u2019s best for China.Who are your listeners?What shows or topics have been the most popular with your Chinese listeners?The four most popular shows, according to Google Analytics, dealt with Obama\u2019s health care reform, guests explaining why they are against Donald Trump, spending bills and the Iowa caucuses. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that Chinese are interested in Obamacare. China is also undergoing health care reform and we want to learn lessons from the United States.As your Chinese listeners learn more about presidential politics and the American political system during this election, do they get more or less cynical?It\u2019s hard to tell. From the comments of some Trump supporters on our Zhihu account [a question-and-answer website], they are clearly angry. But I can\u2019t tell how representative they are of our audience. My personal observation is that they might be overpowering other voices by expressing themselves loudly and attacking others.But I would like to say that 2016 appears to be the beginning of a real Chinese interest in U.S. elections. The combination of a growing middle-class, more overseas experience and easier access to information have fostered more interest than I\u2019ve seen before.Second, many Chinese don\u2019t like the Democratic Party. President Truman, a Democrat, supported Chiang Kai-shek, oversaw the Korean War and interfered in China-Taiwan relations. President Kennedy, a Democrat, got involved in Vietnam. President Clinton, a Democrat, criticized China\u2019s human rights record and slowed negotiations on China entering the World Trade Organization. Meanwhile, President Eisenhower, a Republican, ended the Korean War and President Nixon, a Republican, ended the Vietnam War and initiated the normalization of Chinese-U.S. relations. Many Chinese think another Democratic president would not be favorable to China.Third, many Chinese support Trump\u2019s isolationist foreign policy. They believe that Trump would take a more pragmatic approach towards China and create new opportunities for China\u2019s rise.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hollywood\u2019s Summer of Extremes: Megahits, Superflops and Little Else", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Sequel fatigue does not fully explain it. Nor does an overload of mega-budget event movies. A spate of terrible films? Yes, but that\u2019s not entirely the explanation, either.In a summer when studios suffered more misfires than ever, many of them supersized, Hollywood is scratching for answers, and some longtime movie executives are pointing toward a nuanced shift in consumer behavior.For the first time since moviegoing became a staple of American life, an underappreciated revenue engine \u2014 ticket buyers who still trek to theaters more for the experience than for the movie itself \u2014 may finally be conking out.When movies do not seem worth the hassle, and there seem to be many more of those, there is less of a cushion for studios. Is it because the number of people just wandering in is dwindling?Theater owners and some analysts dismiss that idea, saying studios are refusing to look inward for explanations for a cavalcade of summer disappointments, including \u201cThe BFG,\u201d \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,\u201d \u201cThe Nice Guys,\u201d \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cThe Legend of Tarzan,\u201d \u201cIndependence Day: Resurgence,\u201d \u201cNeighbors 2: Sorority Rising,\u201d \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass,\u201d \u201cWarcraft,\u201d \u201cIce Age: Collision Course,\u201d \u201cHands of Stone,\u201d \u201cStar Trek: Beyond\u201d and \u201cNow You See Me 2.\u201dSequelitis and an overload of event movies have been blamed for much of the carnage. But sequels have sputtered before. The collapse of \u201cHappy Feet Two\u201d and the \u201cChronicles of Narnia\u201d series led to similar anxiety a few years ago.\u201cWe think the issue is less that audiences are tired of sequels, and more that there are now so many sequels that they are cannibalizing each other,\u201d Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a report on Thursday.Still, while data is scarce, PostTrak does show an erosion. In summer 2014, about 32 percent of people made their decision while in line at a theater. In 2015, the number was about 28 percent. PostTrak discontinued research on this audience segment in March, leaving studios to guess at what happened over the 2016 summer season, which started on May 6 and ends on Monday.If the just-show-up crowd is dwindling, the reasons include the comparative ease of other forms of entertainment (HBO Go, Netflix); the increasing cost of moviegoing (now $17.25 per adult at the ArcLight chain\u2019s Hollywood location, before 3-D upcharges); and the movie business itself, which has aggressively pushed one kind of event movie (lumbering, visual-effects-driven sequels) at the expense of variety.When hauling the family to the theater seems worth it, the upside can still be enormous, Ms. Basinger noted. \u201cFinding Dory\u201d and \u201cCaptain America: Civil War,\u201d both from Disney, were the top draws of the summer, collecting a combined $891 million at North American theaters, according to comScore. Third place went to Universal\u2019s \u201cSecret Life of Pets,\u201d which took in $360 million; a sequel is already in the works.On a smaller scale, STX Entertainment hit the jackpot with its modestly budgeted \u201cBad Moms,\u201d which passed $100 million over the weekend, and Sony similarly succeeded with \u201cSausage Party,\u201d which has taken in about $90 million. Warner Bros. powered \u201cLights Out,\u201d a horror movie made for $5 million, to $66 million in ticket sales.Over all, the handful of blockbuster hits made up for the misses \u2014 at least for theater owners, who will collect roughly $4.49 billion at the summer box office, on par with 2015, according to comScore. (Last summer was one week longer.) Attendance is expected to total 513 million, a 3.5 percent decline. For the year, theaters have generated about $8.11 billion in ticket revenue, a 5 percent increase; attendance is up about 1.2 percent.But the misfires have added up for studios, most of which have been spending more on individual films as they search for global hits. Warner Bros., Sony, Universal, 20th Century Fox and Paramount all had diminished or nonexistent profits in the most recent quarter.Disney was the exception, with a huge $766 million in profit, a 62 percent increase from the same quarter a year earlier. But even Disney has struggled recently. Its last three live-action releases have been duds: \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass,\u201d \u201cThe BFG\u201d and \u201cPete\u2019s Dragon.\u201d And, over the Labor Day weekend, a fourth, \u201cThe Light Between Oceans\u201d is expected to sell a disappointing $6.3 million.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see a lot of middle ground this season,\u201d Dave Hollis, Disney\u2019s executive vice president for theatrical distribution, said on Sunday. \u201cThere are probably multiple reasons why, starting with the fact that people are making their selections much more carefully.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Immediately, two of its hosts, Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc, announced their departures.\u201cWe\u2019re not going with the dough,\u201d they said in a joint statement.The BBC is a publicly funded television network with no advertising, while Channel 4 is a publicly owned but commercially funded broadcaster.

{"Headline": "Amazon Has a Potent Weapon in the Tablet Wars: Low Prices", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, five years after unveiling that first tablet, Amazon is coming out with a new model of the device that takes the company\u2019s single-minded obsession with offering the lowest practical price to new extremes.It is doing so at a time when the overall tablet market is no longer the growth juggernaut it once was, with weak sales from the likes of Apple and Samsung. One notable exception to the downward trend is Amazon, which is seeing sales rise because its devices are so inexpensive.\u201cThey\u2019re obviously doing something right because they continue to grow in a market that is overall declining,\u201d said Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at IDC, the technology research company.The latest Amazon tablet is the Fire HD 8, a new model of the company\u2019s 8-inch touch-screen device.The most remarkable thing about the device is the price, which, at $89.99, represents a 40 percent drop from the previous 8-inch Fire\u2019s price of $149.99. More striking is the contrast to Apple\u2019s 8-inch iPads, which start at $399 for the latest generation and $269 for an earlier model.There is nothing new about Amazon\u2019s fixation on undercutting its competitors on price. In tablets, it has seemed more aggressive about lowering prices. Last year, it introduced a 7-inch tablet that sells for $49.99, a few dollars more than Apple charges for a leather iPhone case.The success of that low-price Fire device provided a big lift to Amazon\u2019s tablet sales, which have more than doubled on a unit basis this year compared with the same period last year, said Kevin Keith, general manager of Amazon\u2019s Fire tablet business.The global tablet market is no longer a growth business, falling 11.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. Amazon ranked fifth during that period, accounting for 4.1 percent of sales, IDC estimates.Apple \u2014 the top tablet maker \u2014 has reported that the number of iPads it sold during that period fell 9 percent, though its iPad revenue rose 7 percent because of sales of high-end versions.If Amazon\u2019s approach to tablet pricing sounds unprofitable, that is because it is, at least directly. The company views them as a way to entice people to become more enthusiastic Amazon customers by, for example, encouraging the purchase of $99-a-year Prime memberships, which include a Netflix-like video service, music and other forms of entertainment that can be consumed on the devices.\u201cWe aim to break even on our hardware and make money when customers use our devices, not when we sell devices,\u201d said Mr. Keith. \u201cWe feel like that\u2019s a great model for our business.\u201dAmazon squeezes additional revenue out of its tablets in other ways, too. It sends advertisements to the lock screens of Fire tablets. If customers do not want to see the ads, they can pay Amazon $15 to remove them. This is not something Apple is likely to do, and die-hard fans of the iPad, which many say has a polish that other tablets lack, will not be swayed merely by price.Despite the overall decline in the market, Amazon\u2019s Mr. Keith says he thinks there are still opportunities for Amazon tablet sales to grow. Its prices are low enough that Amazon customers are buying multiple tablets for their homes and giving them as gifts.\u201cWe don\u2019t think the market is saturated yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have plenty of runway.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Years of War, Celebrities Find a Syrian Group to Back", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe complex and brutal conflict in Syria has defied the best efforts of peace negotiators and humanitarian officials for more than five years, but a new group of luminaries is weighing in on a war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives: celebrities.More than two dozen actors, singers and other prominent people have signed a petition urging the Nobel Prize committee to award its 2016 Peace Prize to a group of volunteer rescue workers toiling in cities across the war-torn country. The move draws attention to both the horror of the conflict and the growing willingness of well-known Americans to adopt it as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.The White Helmets, also known as the Syria Civil Defense, are a group of volunteer emergency workers who rush to the scene of airstrikes in civilian areas of cities like Aleppo, which was once the country\u2019s largest but is now divided between rebel groups and the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. His central government has rained bombs on citizens for years, and the White Helmets say they have pulled more than 60,000 people alive from the rubble.The petition may have no impact on who gets the Nobel Peace Prize, which will be awarded on Oct. 7. But its organizer, an advocacy group called the Syria Campaign, said it was hopeful that the celebrities\u2019 endorsement of the rescue workers, as well as an upcoming Netflix documentary about them, were signals of growing concern for the plight of Syrian civilians, who they say have often been overshadowed in the West by concerns about refugees and the Islamic State.Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, said in a statement that it was a \u201chuge morale boost\u201dto see increased international support for their work, especially from people they recognized from the movies. The signatories include George Clooney, Ben Affleck, Daniel Craig, Justin Timberlake, Aziz Ansari and Zoe Saldana.\u201cFor international stars to stand next to the White Helmets\u2019 humanitarian cause gives a morale boost for all people doing this work,\u201d Mr. Saleh said. \"We deeply appreciate this support and remain determined to rescue as many souls as possible and create the opportunity for peace. This is our mission.\u201dSyria is far from the first conflict to attract celebrity attention, and stars like Angelina Jolie and Mr. Affleck have devoted considerable time to touring war zones and raising money for relief efforts. So why has it taken more than five years for celebrities to adopt Syria as a cause?One reason may be the complicated nature of the conflict, which has involved hundreds of rebel groups, including some linked to Al Qaeda, and has set the stage for the rise of the Islamic State, analysts said. It has confounded policy makers, so movie stars and pop singers can hardly be expected to have done any better.\u201cFor years people have been confused by the perceived complexity of the Syria conflict and have continually asked, \u2018Who are the good guys?\u2019 \u201d said Anna Nolan, the director of the Syria Campaign.\u201cThe White Helmets are probably one of the most inspiring stories that has come out of the Syrian conflict, so it is a very easy group to endorse and stand behind because they are real life heroes on the ground,\u201d said Lina Sergie Attar, a writer who founded a humanitarian organization that works with refugees on the Turkey-Syria border.Celebrity activism has sometimes been controversial, but Ms. Attar said she was glad to see famous people support a local organization addressing \u201cthe heart of the problem.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve seen celebrities go to refugee camps, but I\u2019ve always watched that and thought they were engaging with refugees as if they\u2019re divorced from the political and military circumstances that created the refugee crisis itself,\u201d said Ms. Attar. \"That was very frustrating to watch.\u201dKassem Eid is a Syrian asylum seeker in Germany who spent two years touring the United States with the Syrian-American Council campaigning for the United States to act against the Assad regime. The experience left him deeply cynical about American policy makers. But he said he believed in the work of the White Helmets, and thought that actors, writers and singers could perhaps do some good.\u201cI have more faith in the devil than in politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cBut movie stars and celebrities don\u2019t have elections to win, so they can say whatever they want or whatever they believe is right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The BBC is publicly funded and does not have commercials, nor does the show\u2019s American home, PBS, where it is shown under the name \u201cThe Great British Baking Show.\u201d It is also available in the United States on Netflix.\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve found the perfect new home for \u2018Bake Off,\u2019 \u201d Richard McKerrow, the creative director of Love Productions, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a public service, free-to-air broadcaster for whom Love Productions have produced high quality and highly successful programmes for more than a decade.\u201dMr. McKerrow added that he believed Channel 4 would \u201cprotect and nurture\u201d the show \u201cfor many years to come.\u201dJay Hunt, the chief creative officer of Channel 4, said she was \u201cdelighted\u201d that the deal would \u201ckeep this much loved show on free-to-air television.\u201d\u201cThe Great British Bake Off\u201d follows a group of amateur bakers as they execute increasingly complex recipes and is noteworthy among reality shows because its contestants are uniformly pleasant and likable. It is devoid of both the interpersonal drama and the cash prize that are the hallmarks of American reality TV. There are no screaming fights, just spongecake.More than 10 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched its season premiere last month, and it has spawned a fleet of spinoffs in other countries. Many viewers in Britain reacted negatively to the news that an iconic TV show was leaving the country\u2019s iconic national broadcaster.Julia MacFarlane, a BBC producer, shared a picture on Twitter of the broadcaster\u2019s newly redecorated cafeteria, whose walls were adorned with the image of two of the hosts of \u201cBake Off.\u201dThose viewers were not alone.The BBC made no secret of its displeasure with the move. Shortly before Channel 4 announced it had acquired the rights to the show, the BBC issued what amounted to a plea to \u201cBake Off\u201d producers, saying in a statement that it had \u201cgrown and nurtured the programme over seven series and created the huge hit it is today.\u201dIn their joint statement, Ms. Perkins and Ms. Giedroyc agreed with that sentiment.\u201cWe made no secret of our desire for the show to remain where it was,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe BBC nurtured the show from its infancy and helped give it its distinctive warmth and charm, growing it from an audience of two million to nearly fifteen at its peak.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve had the most amazing time on Bake Off, and have loved seeing it rise and rise like a pair of yeasted Latvian baps,\u201d they added. \u201cWe wish all the future bakers every success.\u201dIn the end, the BBC said its disagreement with Love Productions came down to money.\u201cWe made a very strong offer to keep the show but we are a considerable distance apart on the money. The BBC\u2019s resources are not infinite,\u201d the BBC statement said. \u201cGBBO is a quintessentially BBC programme. We hope Love Productions change their mind so that Bake Off can stay ad free on BBC One.\u201dIt was a rare moment of drama for a show noted for its placidness. When asked via email to comment on the news that \u201cBake Off\u201d had found a new home, a BBC spokesperson replied tersely, \u201cWe\u2019re not adding anything to the statement.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the chief creative officer of Channel 4. She is Ms. Jay Hunt.Advertisement"}

But I could will myself to believe in it, because my friends could still afford to live in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Fort Greene, Brooklyn, where the telltale markers of gentrification \u2014 construction cranes, farm-to-table restaurants and soaring rents \u2014 had yet to take hold.But the real estate landscape has shifted so profoundly over the last two decades that this generation\u2019s girl-about-town occupies a very different kind of space. And it is one that keeps shrinking, which is why Desi, Marnie\u2019s hapless husband, frantically builds a wall down the middle of Marnie\u2019s tiny studio to try to save their crumbling marriage. \u201cWelcome to your new one-bedroom apartment,\u201d he says, to her horror.As rising rents squeeze young New Yorkers, the TV apartment has become grittier, dirtier and ever more cramped. You could almost say it is angry.A generation ago, Carrie could whine about the size of a closet in a $2,800-a-month apartment in the episode where she goes apartment hunting after being threatened with eviction. \u201cI pay $750 for something that\u2019s twice the size!\u201d she laments. The broker is unmoved. Carrie, of course, has what most New Yorkers could only dream about, then and now: a rent-controlled apartment.Now we have Abbi on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cBroad City,\u201d apartment-hunting with Pam, the broker in a neck brace. Abbi\u2019s options include \u201ca beautiful railroad-style apartment in your budget\u201d that is bright green, has no bathroom and might actually be a hallway. But it sure beats the place with the blood-spattered walls. \u201cYou guys know that television show \u2018Friends?\u2019 \u201d Pam asks as she jimmies the door with a penknife. \u201cHere\u2019s this place.\u201dWhat Abbi finds inside is the antithesis of the \u201cFriends\u201d apartment: austere, soulless and stark white, except, of course, for the blood spatter, remnants of an apparent double murder. \u201cMore good news! The walls are super thick,\u201d Pam says.As you will recall, the \u201cFriends\u201d apartment, shared by a young barista and a struggling chef, was a palatial two-bedroom with amusing purple walls in the West Village. Even in 1994, few of us were fooled by the \u201cFriends\u201d fantasy, but we ran with it anyway.Television has become smarter since then \u2014 viewers expect more rawness. Well, maybe they expect more truth. It just happens to be raw. But dig deeper and shows like \u201cBroad City\u201d and \u201cGirls\u201d tell a different coming-of-age story, one that is experienced in the shadow of the worst economic recession since the Great Depression.The characters on these shows are part of a generation burdened by student loan debt and stagnating wages. Netflix\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d doesn\u2019t get a place with a Parisian-style balcony in the happening West Village. For her, there\u2019s a grim garden apartment reached by a dicey set of steps in far Greenpoint, Brooklyn.We\u2019ve traded crown molding for blooming mold in the bathroom. Furniture is worn and stained. None of the throw pillows match. \u201cWe make sure there\u2019s no bedbugs and then we use it,\u201d said Angelique Clark, \u201cBroad City\u2019s\u201d production designer, about choosing furnishings for the set. The walls have been painted countless times, and Abbi definitely did not choose the puke green of the hallway wall of her two-bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens.But the grime and the lack of space are the point. At a rent party that Abbi\u2019s friend Ilana hosts, she trips over her guests as she tries to shield them from the rats that have overrun her 550-square-foot two-bedroom in Gowanus, Brooklyn.Although Marnie\u2019s studio in Chinatown could have been modeled on my sad pad, its inspiration was an apartment the show\u2019s art director once rented. \u201cPeople can watch and be like, \u2018Oh, yeah, I had an apartment like that,\u2019 \u201d said Matt Munn, the production designer for \u201cGirls.\u201dNew York has never been kind to young people just starting out. But in recent years, it has become downright cruel. In early 1996, when \u201cFriends\u201d was in its second season, the median rent in Manhattan was $2,000 a month. Over the next 20 years, it jumped 67 percent to $3,344 a month in early 2016, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.But while that may seem like an enormous increase, adjust those numbers for inflation, and the median rent in 1996 would have been $3,645 a month, or 9 percent more than it is today. \u201cRents are actually somewhat lower than they were in the mid 1990s,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cBut because wages have leveled off, it doesn\u2019t feel that way.\u201dYoung people between the ages of 18 and 29 earned about 20 percent less in real wages in 2014 than they would have earned in 2000, according to a report by the city comptroller. Also, Brooklyn \u2014 at least the parts seen as hip alternatives to Manhattan \u2014 is no longer cheaper. The flow of young professionals looking for housing led to a hair-raising rise in rents in those areas, while displacing many of the people who were living there.\u201cHe is living in the past,\u201d Stephen Girasuolo, one of the show\u2019s creators, said of Kevin. \u201cYou could sort of say, \u2018Dude, maybe you should sort of let it go.\u2019 \u201dAn earlier version of the map accompanying this article incorrectly labeled location No. 3. It marks the home of Jerry Seinfeld on the TV show \u201cSeinfield\u201d at 129 West 81st Street, not that of George Costanza on the same show, who lived at 321 West 90th Street.Advertisement"}

Hallelujah. Come next week, we\u2019ll be reveling in the flood of new fall shows, but for now, we\u2019ve got a three-day weekend to enjoy.Have a beautiful weekend.\u201cHigh Maintenance,\u201d now on all HBO streaming platformsWatch if you like short-story anthologies and perceptive but not cruel satire.The series stars the co-creator Ben Sinclair as \u201cthe guy,\u201d a bike-riding weed dealer who in each episode visits a different client or clients. The stories are very loosely interwoven, with some characters popping up in a few episodes, though if you miss the connections, you\u2019re not really poorer for it \u2014 it\u2019s more of a bonus.Though \u201cHigh\u201d has pot smoking as a central plot point, the show isn\u2019t at all stoner humor. It\u2019s a sometimes-wry, sometimes-poignant look at urban loneliness, and the character-building accomplished in these webisodes in just a few minutes puts plenty of feature films to shame. I have cried at episodes of \u201cHigh Maintenance.\u201d The pieces all work as stand-alones, so there\u2019s no bad place to start, although the emotional resonance works best when you watch several in a row.Watch if you like single-camera family comedies with a brain.Some people blame the cancellation of \u201cTrophy Wife\u201d on its misleading title. I prefer to blame it on the widespread global issue of people not behaving as I know they should.The 2013 ABC comedy stars Malin Akerman as the fun-loving new wife to a guy (Bradley Whitford) with three kids and two ex-wives (Marcia Gay Harden and Michaela Watkins). But the show isn\u2019t about wicked stepmothers or evil teens \u2014 everyone mostly gets along.\u201cTrophy\u201d takes a little while to find its footing, but even the sorta-lesser early episodes have plenty of appeal. If you have ever enjoyed an episode of \u201cModern Family,\u201d try \u201cTrophy Wife.\u201d If nothing else, the show gave us the wonderful Bert (Albert Tsai, now on \u201cDr. Ken\u201d), and his description of his greatest dance move, Bert-wheels: \u201cThey\u2019re like cartwheels, but with screaming.\u201dWatch if you liked previous seasons, or love France.\u201cChef\u2019s Table\u201d continues to be canonization in documentary\u2019s clothing, and the new batch of four episodes are about chefs in France \u2014 libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, hagiography.This isn\u2019t a complaint, though: I love that \u201cChef\u2019s Table\u201d goes as hard as possible on its mission to depict food and cooking as the apex of personal artistry and sensory pleasure. Sure, sometimes it\u2019s hard not to roll one\u2019s eyes a bit \u2014 we\u2019re saut\u00e9ing mushrooms here, not working in the coal mines \u2014 but every time there\u2019s a shot of someone methodically cutting through a big, pink hunk of fish, I swear my fingers genuinely, physically tingle with jealousy as I imagine how satisfying it must feel to be that good at slicing something that expensive.My wife and I are looking for a show to watch after we finish \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d or some similarly bleak drama. Something so I don\u2019t have nightmares, but hopefully, something I haven\u2019t seen before and I can get invested in.My wife and I tend to lose motivation with shows with primarily stand-alone episodes (like \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d) and need a through narrative thread to keep us going. Ideally this show is not longer than 45 minutes (although 30 would be better). We just finished \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d which filled this slot well. We\u2019re looking for something a little out of left field \u2026 \u2014 KevinIf you generally skip over teen shows, you\u2019ve been missing out. Expand your horizons! If you avoided \u201cThe O.C.\u201d or \u201cGossip Girl\u201d when they were on, this is the ideal circumstance in which to watch them. Neither needs to be watched all the way through, but the first seasons of each are magical. Both shows are chitter-chatter delights, and there\u2019s enough plot and story to keep you hooked but no lingering psychological baggage. \u201cMy Mad Fat Diary,\u201d a British teen import about a recently suicidal teen girl, is thoughtful and hilarious, and a more earnest follow-up to \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend.\u201dBut if you want a more traditional show for and about adults, try \u201cSensitive Skin.\u201dFinally, there are Ewan McGregor\u2019s motorcycle-trip documentary series \u201cLong Way Round\u201d (2004) and \u201cLong Way Down\u201d (2007). In each, McGregor and his BFF take a motorcycle trip around the world, first the \u201clong way [a]round\u201d from England to New York City, then from Scotland to South Africa. The paperwork alone is enough to keep me couch-bound, but these two seasons are equal parts charm, adventure and the worldview that most people are mostly good most of the time. Plus, unlike \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d no extended foot-lotioning sequences. That is the true palate cleanser.Roy (Michael Shannon) and his friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) kidnap Roy\u2019s son Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) from a religious cult and go on the run. Alton is able to do things that no other human can, and both the government and the cult want to use him for their own ends.Advertisement"}

Can he bring himself to vote for a Democrat for the first time since Michael Dukakis? Will people like his new cookbook?\u201cHere\u2019s the problem with a book like this,\u201d he said during a day that had started with morning cocktails and bee-tending at the suburban Atlanta compound that serves as his studio, kitchen workshop and man cave. \u201cIf they don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t like me.\u201dAlton Brown is an outlier among food celebrities. He is a private, politically conservative Southerner who sometimes carries a Bible and a firearm. He is a pilot and a devoted student of film. He is the opposite of cuddly. And he is probably much smarter than you.\u201cEveryDayCook\u201d is an eclectic and appealing collection of 70 recipes in Mr. Brown\u2019s regular rotation and another 30 he created to bring the book to a respectable size. The photos were shot entirely on an iPhone at the compound, each picture taken directly overhead, like an Instagram image.In one, he lies among the hardware-store items he prefers as kitchen tools. On another page, he offers a list of 30 favorite pantry items that begins with amaranth and ends with white cornmeal.The recipes range from simple with a twist (warm Saltines brushed with dried mustard, hot sauce and butter) to delicious gimmicks (a breakfast carbonara) to science experiments (pancake batter powered by nitrous oxide). He even makes cold barley water steeped with lemon and sweetened with honey seem ridiculously appealing.\u201cIt\u2019s an hour of juggling well while standing on the back of a horse,\u201d he said.At its heart, \u201cEveryDayCook\u201d is a midlife-crisis book. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Who the heck am I?\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent years projecting and presenting this thing, but in the end, what am I? I thought it was important to put something on paper.\u201dMr. Brown, who describes himself as \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201ca terrible workaholic,\u201d has never been in a more reflective period. His divorce from DeAnna Brown, his second wife, with whom he had a daughter and built an empire, became final on May 13, 2015. She got the 7,000-square-foot historic brick home in Marietta, a couple of miles from the compound, which went to him.\u201cIt was a sad time,\u201d said the Rev. Bryant Wright, the pastor of Johnson Ferry Baptist Church, where Mr. Brown was immersed in baptismal waters in 2006.The church tried to keep the couple together, but Mr. Brown \u201cwas determined to get a divorce,\u201d Mr. Wright said. The former Mrs. Brown, a woman so devout that she kept a Bible on her desk at the \u201cGood Eats\u201d studio, did not respond to a request for an interview.Mr. Brown, who said that over the years he gave a significant amount of money to the church, formally resigned from it, and he remains bitter about pressure from church leaders to fall in line. He still prays, but says his concept of God is evolving.After the divorce, he started drinking too much, he said. He indulged his sweet tooth, which leans toward peanut M&Ms. The result was an extra 20 pounds. He had lost a significant amount of weight a decade earlier, and was in no mood to return to what he called his chunky monkey period.He quit drinking. He worked out, which he says he can sometimes do to excess.\u201cThe problem with being so skinny is now people are like, \u2018How\u2019s the chemo?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get older, skinny is not really your friend. You get the turkey neck.\u201dMr. Brown also sings and plays guitar. The effect, especially on country-tinged songs like \u201cAirport Shrimp Cocktail,\u201d about gastronomic distress, is that of a soccer dad who managed to keep his college band together.And then there is the merchandise. As a great collector of everything from bow ties to vintage cast iron and old bourbon, Mr. Brown pays a lot of attention to the quality of his \u201cmerch.\u201dPerhaps more important, the live shows afford him an opportunity to stay mobile. \u201cI think I\u2019ve built a life that\u2019s based on running away from my life,\u201d he said.Mr. Brown, who was born in Los Angeles but moved to northern Georgia when he was 7, had plenty of life thrown at him early. His father, Alton Brown Sr., owned a radio station and the local newspaper in Cleveland, Ga. His mother, who loved to entertain, was the editor.On Mr. Brown\u2019s last day as a sixth grader, his father was found dead at the family\u2019s home with \u201ca Hefty bag taped to his head,\u201d Mr. Brown said. The police determined that it was a suicide, but Mr. Brown still believes that his father may have been murdered.His mother would eventually marry four more times, and with the marriages came stepsiblings. He is not close to them, and keeps his mother at what he called \u201ca 100-mile distance.\u201d\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t have a lot of respect for me until I became famous,\u201d he said.He often jokes that his success is a way to show her that studying drama and film in college wasn\u2019t a waste after all.The rocketing popularity of food television in the 1990s caught his interest, so he secured a degree in 1997 from the New England Culinary Institute. Two years later, \u201cGood Eats\u201d was on Food Network. With its smart mix of history, science and cooking, shot with homemade props and a cinematographer\u2019s sensibility, the show was more sophisticated than anything the network had ever shown. He made 249 episodes.Mr. Brown is not driven by an inherent love of food in the way some cooks are. And he is not so much a culinary authority, like Bobby Flay or Emeril Lagasse, as a really smart guy who has figured it out and wants you to as well.Mr. Brown is working on a new version of \u201cGood Eats\u201d for his own digital distribution next year. He is buoyed by a generation of younger fans who watch reruns on Netflix. Food Network owns \u201cGood Eats,\u201d so he doesn\u2019t make a penny from the revival.Mr. Brown makes more from one episode than he did from the entire first season of \u201cGood Eats,\u201d he said.Although Mr. Brown often assumes he is the weakest link in any chain, he holds strong opinions. A question about why he makes barbecued potato chips by smoking potato slices over wood chips on the stove when they sell perfectly good barbecue chips at the store propels him into a monologue on the state of hospitality in America.\u201cI\u2019m going to make you these chips,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to eat them and say, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 The time we spent together making them is a valuable piece of the hospitality equation. The taking in that equation is even more important than the giving. But here in this country, we have decided to replace \u2018thank you\u2019 a great deal with \u2018I can\u2019t eat that.\u2019\u201dWhen he\u2019s on a roll like this, it\u2019s best to let him keep going.\u201cUnless you have a medical bracelet that says celiac, shut up and eat the food,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be so special. We not only want to be special for our cooking, we want to be special for our eating. There are times when vegetarians should shut up and eat the pork chop.\u201dStill, for all his forcefulness and clarity on any number of topics, Mr. Brown seems to be seeking clarity on matters more internal. \u201cI\u2019m not where I thought would be at this point in my life,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m wiser by a long shot.\u201dStill, he said, taking another sip of sangria, \u201cI don\u2019t really know what I am anymore.\u201dThen he got up off the porch swing and headed back to his kitchen.\u201cFunny business,\u201d he said, \u201cthis living.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goodbye, Ivory Tower. Hello, Silicon Valley Candy Store.", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor eight years, Peter Coles had an economist\u2019s dream job at Harvard Business School.His research focused on the design of efficient markets, an important and growing field that has influenced such things as Treasury bill auctions and decisions on who receives organ transplants. He even got to work with Alvin E. Roth, who won a Nobel in economic science in 2012.But prestige was not enough to keep Mr. Coles at Harvard. In 2013, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. He now works at Airbnb, the online lodging marketplace, one of a number of tech companies luring economists with the promise of big sets of data and big salaries.Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute candy store for economists,\u201d Mr. Coles said.The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for a Ph.D. economist will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more.Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends \u2014 topics like recessions and currency exchange rates \u2014 and help their employers deal with them.But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they are studying the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging.Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft and up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of improved efficiency means more profit.At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic research scientist, is finely measuring the effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in economic behavior: What consumer actions occur coincidentally after people see ads, and what actions are most likely caused by the ads?At Airbnb, Mr. Coles is researching the company\u2019s marketplace of hosts and guests for insights, both to help build the business and to understand behavior. One study focuses on procrastination \u2014 a subject of great interest to behavioral economists \u2014 by looking at bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or months in advance? Do booking habits change by age, gender or country of origin?\u201cThey are microeconomic experts, heavy on data and computing tools like machine learning and writing algorithms,\u201d said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics.Understanding how digital markets work is getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian, Google\u2019s chief economist. But, he said, \u201cI thought it was fascinating years ago.\u201dMr. Varian, 69, is the godfather of the tech industry\u2019s in-house economists. Once a well-known professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Varian showed up at Google in 2002, part time at first, but soon became an employee. He helped refine Google\u2019s AdWords marketplace, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown on search pages, based on the words users type into Google\u2019s search engine.Google\u2019s insight was to avoid giving the best ad placement to the highest bidder. Mr. Varian worked to develop a different model for ad placement, calculating the probability that a user will click on an ad and find the ad relevant. It was a classic example of smart market design.Seeing this emerging job market, the National Association for Business Economics held its first meeting for technology company economists in April in San Francisco. Another is set for October in Silicon Valley.Academia is also starting to take notice \u2014 and adapt. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast, it\u2019s hard to keep up,\u201d said Susan Athey, an expert in the economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who is also a consultant to Microsoft.Many economics students also take computer science courses, and some major in both. But a new course this fall at Yale, called Designing the Digital Economy, seeks to blend economics and computer science in the way digital economists do at tech companies. The instructor is Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, and the course will have guest lecturers from Amazon, Pandora and Uber.The course is a pilot for curriculum change and perhaps a joint degree program focused on digital markets and their design. Dirk Bergemann, chairman of the Yale economics department, explained that economics was concerned with efficiency, prices and incentives, while computer science focused on algorithms and complexity.\u201cIn digital marketplaces, you are trying to address both sets of problems,\u201d he said.Mr. Weyl predicts that the rise of digital marketplaces in the economy is just getting underway. Uber in ride-hailing and Airbnb in room-renting, he said, may well be just the start of a redefinition of private property, made possible by digital technology.Things, according to Mr. Weyl, will increasingly be rented as services instead of owned. That is the long-term vision of driverless cars: When a vehicle just shows up on command, far fewer cars will sit in driveways. Transportation efficiency, resource consumption and industries will all be transformed, he said.The same could be true for household goods, Mr. Weyl said. One possible situation: After you use your espresso machine for breakfast, a drone comes to pick it up, and you rent it out for the day.A current market-design challenge for Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud computing services. These digital services, for example, face a peak-load problem, much as electric utilities do.How do you sell service at times when there is a risk some customers may be bumped off? Run an auction for what customers are willing to pay for interruptible service? Or offer set discounts for different levels of risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working on that now.To answer such questions, economists work in teams with computer scientists and people in business. In tech companies, market design involves not only economics but also engineering and marketing. How hard is a certain approach technically? How easy is it to explain to customers?\u201cEconomics influences rather than determines decisions,\u201d said Preston McAfee, Microsoft\u2019s chief economist, who previously worked at Google and Yahoo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fall TV Season Isn\u2019t Dead Yet. But Why?", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than a decade, television executives have been forecasting the eclipse of the fall TV season. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a real year-round schedule,\u201d Gail Berman, then president of entertainment at Fox, said in 2004. (At the time that meant putting \u201cNorth Shore,\u201d \u201cThe Jury\u201d and \u201cMethod & Red\u201d in the summer. But you have to start somewhere.)Yet despite the mad, year-round growth of TV since then, the fall season not only survives but remains the only season with any real identity. The traditional crush starts on Monday, with more than 80 new and returning network shows (and about 35 significant cable and streaming shows) crammed into six weeks.But what is the fall season, exactly, from a TV watcher\u2019s point of view? Despite the disproportionate amount of attention it still receives \u2014 including copious previews in magazines and newspapers \u2014 it\u2019s definitely not the home of TV\u2019s most acclaimed shows. Take a look at this year\u2019s Emmy nominees for best drama: Six of the seven shows started their seasons in the first half of the year, from January to June, and the seventh, \u201cHomeland,\u201d is moving from fall to winter (January) for its next season.If the fall doesn\u2019t have the most compelling dramas or cutting-edge comedies, what does it offer? One partial, uncomfortable answer is that it offers the greatest concentration of expensive, ostentatiously bad TV \u2014 formulaic, bombastic, ingratiating shows that make you shake your head at the squandering of money and talent.But a more useful way to look at it is that fall has become TV\u2019s equivalent of the summer movie season \u2014 it\u2019s popcorn time, the concentrated period in which profits need to be made. Fall is still where most of the tent-pole franchises reside, the remaining handful of shows capable of drawing a critical mass of viewers week in and week out \u2014 \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d \u201cNCIS,\u201d \u201cEmpire\u201d and, on the cable side, \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d the highest-rated scripted show in the 18-to-49 demographic that advertisers find so desirable.Will the fall season, as it\u2019s currently constituted, survive? The seemingly inexorable move of series television toward an \u00e0 la carte, on-demand model argues against it. Some vestige will survive, though, as long as the possibility of lucrative syndication sales based on 100-plus-episode runs still exists. But in a binge-watching world, with viewers increasingly choosing to focus on one series at a time, it probably makes more sense to spread your shows across the calendar rather than pile them into a few months. In the meantime, anecdotal evidence suggests that for a lot of TV watchers, fall represents a good time to binge on the shows they missed earlier in the year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Compete With Mobile, Sony Tailors PlayStation to Next-Generation TVs", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew video game consoles are normally introduced every six or seven years, a far cry from the smartphone business, where more capable models debut every year or so.Taking inspiration from the pace of innovation in the mobile industry, Sony on Wednesday announced a more powerful version of its PlayStation 4 that would display games at higher resolutions, among other big improvements to image quality.The new PlayStation 4 Pro, introduced at an event in New York, is aimed at the growing segment of the television market buying so-called 4K high-definition television sets, which jam millions more pixels into their displays for much sharper images. The new console will also present games using another technology called high dynamic range, or H.D.R., which offers big improvements in color and other image enhancements.The PlayStation 4 Pro will cost $400 and goes on sale Nov. 10. Sony also announced a new, slimmer version of its base model of PlayStation 4 that will sell for $300 starting on Sept. 15.Andrew House, chief executive of Sony\u2019s video game division, said in a phone interview that Sony\u2019s decision to release the PlayStation 4 Pro was influenced by the speed of change in the mobile industry, which has come to rival consoles for the attention of gamers. The first PlayStation 4 came out in 2013.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we didn\u2019t wait seven years before we started to innovate and tried something new?\u201d Mr. House asked, referring to the time between the introductions of the PlayStation 4 and its predecessor, the PlayStation 3.Sales of 4K television sets have surged as prices have come down and models have proliferated. In the second quarter, the average price of 4K televisions was down 29 percent from a year earlier, to $877, the research firm IHS Markit Technology estimates. H.D.R. is a newer feature on 4K television sets that generally adds a premium of 20 to 30 percent to the price, according to Paul Gagnon, an IHS analyst.About 55 million 4K televisions will be sold worldwide this year, but only about 3.5 million will include H.D.R., Mr. Gagnon estimates. \u201cIn a couple years, we expect there won\u2019t be many TVs sold over 50 inches that aren\u2019t 4K,\u201d he said.The availability of video that exploits 4K sets has been improving, but it is still limited. Streaming video services from Amazon and Netflix are among the early adopters of the technology for their original programming.Microsoft, Sony\u2019s primary rival in the console market, announced its own 4K-capable Xbox One console this year, with the code name Project Scorpio. But that system will not be available until next year\u2019s holiday season.Sony already has a comfortable lead in the console market, having sold more than 40 million of the PlayStation 4. Microsoft no longer reveals sales figures for the Xbox One.Game developers will need to adapt their existing PlayStation 4 games to take advantage of the better image quality of the new Sony console, and update them over the internet. New installments of best-selling games like Call of Duty by Activision and Battlefield by Electronic Arts will support the PlayStation 4 Pro\u2019s better image quality when they go on sale, the publishers said.Joost van Dreunen, chief executive of SuperData Research, a game research firm, says he thinks Sony could persuade 10 to 20 percent of existing PlayStation 4 owners to buy the new model, along with people who mainly play games on PCs.\u201cThis sets them up for another three to five years,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steve Reich at 80: Still Plugged In, Still Plugging Away", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCaught between Netflix binges and digital detoxes, Americans can\u2019t decide whether they love or hate technology. Despite being a pioneer of electronic music, the composer Steve Reich has maintained a similar ambivalence throughout his long career. Decades before the Grammy- and Pulitzer-winning heyday that has made him one of this country\u2019s most renowned artists, Mr. Reich struggled with the very technology that first brought him fame.Mr. Reich made his name in mid-1960s San Francisco. Experimenting with tape loops, he discovered what he subsequently dubbed \u201cphasing\u201d when he accidentally let two identical tape fragments gradually drift out of sync. In \u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Rain\u201d (1965) and \u201cCome Out\u201d (1966), Mr. Reich played recorded voices against themselves: As they \u201cphased,\u201d the voices began to reverberate, then echo and eventually blur into chaos.But after working exclusively with tape when he returned to New York, his hometown, he reached a crossroads with technology and later described 1966 as \u201ca very depressing year\u201d in which he \u201cbegan to feel like a mad scientist trapped in a lab.\u201d He decided to add live performers to the mix in a style then called live/electric music.One live/electric experiment was \u201cPiano Phase\u201d (1967), in which Mr. Reich recorded himself playing a 12-note pattern on piano and set it to loop. He then tried to play mechanically against his recording \u2014 as if he himself were a second tape \u2014 and \u201cphased\u201d with the looped piano by playing slightly faster. Once this idea had been successful, he performed the process completely live with the pianist Arthur Murphy.\u201cThe phase pieces for instruments turn machine fantasies into human events,\u201d Mr. Reich wrote in his sketchbook.While \u201cPiano Phase\u201d brought Mr. Reich out of his mad scientist impasse, he soon discovered new fantasies. In March 1967, he expanded \u201cPiano Phase\u201d into \u201cFour Pianos,\u201d in which four performers played electric pianos while listening to a \u201cguide\u201d player over headphones. For technical assistance, Mr. Reich consulted engineers from Experiments in Art and Technology, a nonprofit group capitalizing on Cold War funding for technological research and the countercultural yen for zany investigations.They paired artists with engineers interested in collaboration. Through such work, the organization was involved in the development of a great deal of American experimental music, from the amplified brainwaves of John Cage\u2019s \u201cVariations VII\u201d (1966) to the electronic mantras of Pauline Oliveros\u2019s \u201cPep-Psi\u201d (1970).In early 1968, Mr. Reich envisioned a phasing machine, so the group paired him with the engineer Larry Owens to create the Phase Shifting Pulse Gate. That device was designed to phase 12 separate oscillator pulses, creating gradually shifting melodic patterns. Mr. Reich spent over 15 months working on the contraption and wrote two new works for it, one called \u201cPulse Music.\u201d But after two performances, the machine had a glitch, causing the oscillator pulses to hiccup or shudder randomly.In 1970, following the Pulse Gate fiasco, Mr. Reich wrote a short manifesto, \u201cSome Optimistic Predictions (1970) About the Future of Music.\u201d Among his prophecies were that \u201celectronic music as such will gradually die and be absorbed into the ongoing music of people singing and playing instruments.\u201d At least in his own work, this held true: Outside of amplification and the occasional electric organ, Mr. Reich\u2019s music of the 1970s was resolutely tech-free.But while Mr. Reich had renounced machines, critics still noticed something \u201cmachine-like\u201d about his pulse-based music. The critic Louis Snyder, for instance, described the maraca players in \u201cFour Organs\u201d (1970) as \u201crelegated to the status of automatons.\u201dWhen he was asked in a 1970 interview about this apparently mechanical aspect of his music, Mr. Reich responded with an unexpected analogy. \u201cI think there\u2019s a human activity which might be called \u2018imitating machines,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cbut which is simply controlling your mind and body very carefully as in yoga breathing exercises, or in playing my phase pieces.\u201dWith these analogies to yoga, the notion of \u201cpulse music\u201d acquired new meaning, as Mr. Reich\u2019s music of the \u201970s began to evoke and incorporate the pulsing of bodies rather than those of machines. By 1971, his yoga practice had spurred a new pulse-based composition: \u201cWhile doing yoga this morning,\u201d he wrote in his sketchbook, \u201cI thought of a piece where a huge drum would pulse at about the same rate as heart beat \u2014 60-72 and low wind or brass instruments would play long slow tones for a full breath so that the analogy of breathing + heartbeat would be clear.\u201dHis body-generated works continued. \u201cPulse Music,\u201d the name of that old abandoned Pulse Gate experiment, was, in fact, the provisional title for his next piece. But after many reworkings, Mr. Reich decided to call it \u201cClapping Music.\u201d His most low-tech composition, it required nothing more than two sets of clapping hands to perform.\u201cI wanted to get all the way back to people,\u201d Mr. Reich told an interviewer in 1973.But his prolonged sabbatical from technology would not last. Mr. Reich used an Apple computer and sampling software in the 1980s. \u201cI\u2019m not a Luddite,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cBut I understand the Luddites.\u201dMany of his later works make extensive use of electronics, most notably \u201cThree Tales\u201d (2002), a video opera created in collaboration with the video artist Beryl Korot. As Mr. Reich and Ms. Korot once described it, the work is meant to reflect a debate about \u201cthe physical, ethical and religious nature of the expanding technological environment.\u201d To be included in the Nov. 1 birthday concert at Carnegie, it includes accounts of the Hindenburg explosion, the nuclear bomb testing on Bikini Atoll and the cloning of the sheep Dolly in the 1990s.\u201cThere\u2019s no free lunch,\u201d he said, musing on the trade-offs we make with technology. \u201cWhatever you gain, you have to realize that it\u2019s at some cost. And if you\u2019re not aware of that, then you are, in a sense, living in what we used to call a fool\u2019s paradise.\u201dIn 2016, when countless secular Americans are finding a need for \u201cunplugged retreats,\u201d Mr. Reich still seems to have his finger on the pulse of the times.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s a picture of Mindy Kaling and a picture of Gloria Steinem and, very close to them, is a picture of Syrian refugees in a boat. And then I have a letter from my mother with all the reasons she\u2019s proud of me. It was unsolicited.\u201dNell McShane WulfhartAdvertisement"}

I\u2019ll be the one rolling around in TV shows like a puppy in a pile of leaves.After one episode, it\u2019s not clear that the show wouldn\u2019t be better off as a movie, but in the five episodes made available to critics, the show does make a convincing case for itself. \u201cPlace\u201d is funny and gentle (and not religious, if that\u2019s something you wonder about), and once the premise establishes itself, the ensemble settles into an easy, cartoony rhythm.

{"Headline": "Review: Emmy Awards Showcase TV\u2019s Cultural Dominance and Trump Jokes", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd as the host Jimmy Kimmel reminded us at Sunday night\u2019s Emmy Awards on ABC, a prime-time personality is close to running the whole show in America \u2014 even if that wasn\u2019t a point of pride to the host or to much of the crowd.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for television, would Donald Trump be running for president?\u201d Mr. Kimmel asked in a scathing run of jokes, pointing out the producer of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in the audience. \u201cThanks to Mark Burnett, we don\u2019t have to watch reality shows anymore, because we\u2019re living in one.\u201dHere's a look at some of the most memorable moments from the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards.The cultural ubiquity of TV was a theme of the night, and so was the tension between the night\u2019s crowd of stars and winners and the TV entertainer who\u2019s dominated the year\u2019s nonfiction programming.It started with the opening sketch, in which Mr. Kimmel hitched a ride to the ceremony with several celebrities. Among them was Jeb Bush, one of several Republicans defenestrated by Mr. Trump, who said that he was now driving for Uber. \u201cIf you run a positive campaign, voters will ultimately make the right choice,\u201d Mr. Bush said, adding, \u201cThat was a joke.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t the only one joking about Mr. Trump, however ruefully. The comedian Aziz Ansari, of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaster of None,\u201d declared that he was going to enforce Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and order Muslims and Hispanics out of the audience. \u201cAmerica Ferrera?\u201d he said to the actress. \u201cNice try changing your name to \u2018America.\u2019 You\u2019re not fooling anybody!\u201dAs expected, it was a big night for FX\u2019s \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,\u201d a limited series that, like the campaign, represented a powerful synthesis of reality and entertainment.57 PhotosThe series also exemplified how the Emmys cleared the admittedly low bar of diversity set by the 2016 Oscars, all of whose acting nominees were white. It not only showcased African-American actors \u2014 Courtney B. Vance and Sterling K. Brown won for lead and supporting \u2014 but it also made race (and, through Sarah Paulson\u2019s character, Marcia Clark, gender) a subject.That was also true of \u201cMaster of None,\u201d whose Alan Yang and Mr. Ansari shared a comedy-writing award for an episode about Asian-American immigrant families.And while the industry still hasn\u2019t achieved parity for female directors, two women won directing awards: Susanne Bier for the limited series \u201cThe Night Manager\u201d and Jill Soloway for her comedy \u201cTransparent,\u201d who ended her acceptance speech, \u201cTopple the patriarchy!\u201dRegarding which, both the lead and supporting comedy acting categories were won by men playing women: Louie Anderson, for a supporting character on \u201cBaskets,\u201d and Jeffrey Tambor, again winning best actor for playing a transgender woman on Ms. Soloway\u2019s series. Mr. Tambor used his acceptance to urge the industry to cast more transgender performers.It was up to Mr. Kimmel to tweak the high-mindedness of the night. \u201cThe only thing we value more than diversity,\u201d he said, \u201cis congratulating ourselves on how much we value diversity.\u201d He\u2019s both the snarkiest of the major networks\u2019 late-night hosts and a TV classicist at heart, the sort of roastmaster and toastmaster who could spike the punchbowl without tipping it completely over.There was a little shaking up of the drama-lead categories, which both went to first-time winners in tour-de-force performances. Tatiana Maslany won for \u201cOrphan Black,\u201d and Rami Malek quoted his own hallucination-suffering character from \u201cMr. Robot\u201d: \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re seeing this, too.\u201dThe surprises ended before the night did: exactly as last year, HBO won both best drama for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (much-improved as it raced ahead of its source books but not as deserving as FX\u2019s \u201cThe Americans\u201d) and best comedy for the political satire \u201cVeep,\u201d which last year broke the hammerlock of \u201cModern Family\u201d and may now have the category in its own grip.But you can\u2019t argue that the comedy didn\u2019t feel of the moment. Accepting the award for best lead actress in a comedy, Julia Louis-Dreyfus (the star of \u201cVeep\u201d) said that the program \u201cnow feels like a sobering documentary.\u201dAt the night\u2019s end, Mr. Kimmel congratulated the awardscast for ending neatly on time: \u201cWe finished before the election came!\u201d But as we\u2019ve seen for a while, and the Emmys reminded us, it\u2019s not entirely clear where TV ends and the election begins.Advertisement"}
