{"Headline": "The Minivan vs. the Maserati", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI have my parents to thank for preparing me for tonight\u2019s spectacle. They first alerted me to the power of Donald J. Trump\u2019s brute displays of strength and unvarnished outsider status, which are widely expected to be on full display in the first of three debates against Hillary Clinton.A year ago, I was completely unprepared to learn that the billionaire who bashed three of my former bosses \u2014 John McCain, Jeb Bush and former President George W. Bush \u2014 had enthusiastic backers in my parents. His conversion of my moderate, rational mom and dad to self-declared \u201cTrumpers\u201d was revealed to me in August of 2015. My parents pulled me into their kitchen to share their theory on why I hadn\u2019t been renewed as a panelist on the talk show \u201cThe View.\u201d\u201cYou called Donald Trump an embarrassment to the G.O.P. and the nation,\u201d they said quietly.There was wine on the counter, and I poured myself a juice glass full of it.\u201cSo? He doesn\u2019t own ABC,\u201d I said.\u201cNo, but he\u2019s very powerful.\u201dI told them not to share the theory with their friends or neighbors.Like many Trump supporters, my parents believe that only someone from outside the political establishment possesses the necessary skill to break the cycle of dysfunction in Washington. They are not racists, misogynists, anti-Muslim or anti-American. They see Mr. Trump as the deeply flawed candidate he is, but they find Mrs. Clinton more deficient. Their second choice this year was Bernie Sanders.Neither candidate will really be speaking to them tonight. Most people, like my folks, will have drawn their conclusions about two of the most unpopular candidates ever nominated. A much smaller number will be looking for some crystallizing moment that makes one appear less bad than the other.By conventional political standards, Mr. Trump\u2019s vulnerabilities heading into a debate are enormous. He has no plan to release his taxes, he refuses to treat the press corps in a manner long considered the norm of national political campaigns, and he shows no sign of toning down the insults directed at his opponent and his fellow Republicans.Mr. Trump has managed to turn most of these glaring liabilities into displays of \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d in the eyes of his fans, but he\u2019d be wise to detail some journey of personal remorse for his most egregious insults. An apology, accompanied by a story of educating himself about the pain caused by his words, might help him with the sliver of voters uncomfortable with both candidates.For her part, Mrs. Clinton has been waging an illogically asymmetrical counterattack. She shouldn\u2019t waste her time in the debate explaining to people what a scoundrel Mr. Trump is or how abhorrent some of his supporters are. Everyone has heard that message and either they don\u2019t care or they are already with her.She needs to make a different kind of emotional appeal. She should present herself as the safe alternative. The minivan with airbags and seat belts for everyone, compared to Mr. Trump\u2019s vintage Maserati without brakes.Her attempts to address her trustworthiness deficits are a waste of time. She should present herself as flawed but steady: A competent and socially acceptable figure who knows the players on the world stage and has bipartisan relationships in Congress.Her debate performance should assure voters that she\u2019s learning valuable lessons from the very people she\u2019s pushed away for most of her political life \u2014 reporters and Republicans. She can display a willingness to be transparent and pledge to answer questions from reporters every morning between now and Election Day, and hold a news conference every week as president.She could promise to pick from the best policy minds in the country when naming a cabinet and pledge to appoint several Republicans to senior posts on her national security team. Mrs. Clinton has consolidated her base and a lack of enthusiasm from liberals shouldn\u2019t become an excuse for a lack of imagination in winning over moderate voters from both political parties.The winner of the debate will be the candidate who travels the greatest distance in fixing his or her own problems \u2014 not the one who lands the toughest punch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Posting Political Signs in the Window Is Your Right \u2014 Isn\u2019t It?", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by360 ViewIn July, Rebecca and Shirley Solomon, two sisters who have shared a TriBeCa loft for the better part of 40 years, hung a sign in their window for Hillary Clinton. In other election years, they had hung signs for Barack Obama and placards opposing George W. Bush and the Iraq war. But this time, their exercise in political engagement was thwarted.Two weeks after the sign went up, their landlord told them to take Hillary down.The building had converted from a rental to a condominium, and the condo board had new rules about window d\u00e9cor, prohibiting residents from putting signs of any kind in their windows.The sisters were dejected. \u201cWith our old landlords, we were pretty much allowed to get away with murder,\u201d said Rebecca Solomon, who has lived in the Beach Street loft with her sister on and off since 1978.The new regime is far less lenient. Their landlord, as the owner of the apartment, is beholden to the condo association\u2019s rules, passing its orders along to the Solomon sisters, who are rent-stabilized tenants. \u201cDon\u2019t I have a First Amendment right?\u201d Rebecca Solomon asked.She might not. The First Amendment, a cornerstone of the United States Constitution, does not necessarily protect a person on private property. In New York State, a homeowner can, theoretically, display signs of any political persuasion. But people living in condos, co-ops and privately owned rental buildings answer to a higher power: the owner of the building.A renter\u2019s lease might restrict what objects can be placed in windows. Owners of condo and co-op apartments must follow the rules of the condo association or the co-op board. Like a landlord, a condo or co-op board can enforce building rules, including those that prohibit window displays like holiday lights or signs of any kind.Rent-stabilized tenants, however, have some protections. Under rent-stabilization law, a landlord cannot evict a tenant for a window sign, according to David E. Frazer, a lawyer who represents tenants. But if you resist your landlord\u2019s demands, he might take you to court, which carries risks. To keep peace with a landlord who\u2019s \u201cactually been a pretty nice guy to work with,\u201d Rebecca Solomon took the sign down, she said.Stroll the streets of Brownstone Brooklyn, where many residents own their properties, and you will invariably see signs supporting or opposing national and local causes \u2014 like saving a Brooklyn Heights library branch or the view of the Brooklyn Bridge. In Manhattan, where most people live in apartments, such displays are rare.Sometimes, even ownership does not guarantee political expression. In February, Joseph Hornick, a retired firefighter, hung two flags bearing Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d outside his house in West Long Branch, N.J. They were the first campaign flags Mr. Hornick had ever flown. \u201cI was proud to put those flags up,\u201d he said. Until declaring his support for Mr. Trump, he had hung only the American flag of 1815, the year his home was built.In March, Mr. Hornick received a citation for violating a town ordinance restricting the display of political signs to 30 days before an election and five days after. He faced a fine of up to $2,000 or 90 days in jail, or both, although it was unlikely he would have received such a stiff punishment from the municipal court for a first offense, according to his lawyers.Mr. Hornick was not deterred. \u201cI would have done a year in jail,\u201d he said. \u201cI was only concerned about who was going to guard my flags.\u201d (Vandals had repeatedly stolen them, but Mr. Hornick replaced them with new ones from eBay.)The story \u201ctook on a life of its own,\u201d said Mr. Hornick, who soon became a local celebrity in his community near the Jersey Shore as news outlets took notice. By May, the case had been dismissed. In June, the town repealed the ordinance.Towns can place some restrictions on the political signs that homeowners put on their properties, but they cannot outright ban them, and the ordinance that essentially prohibited signs for 11 months a year in Mr. Hornick\u2019s town constituted an unreasonable ban, according to Ms. LoCicero of the ACLU of New Jersey.In New Jersey, unlike in New York, condo and homeowners associations cannot prohibit political signs, although they, too, can impose some limitations. Nevertheless, restrictive and potentially unconstitutional rules remain on the books, unless someone pushes back. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like playing Whack-A-Mole,\u201d Ms. LoCicero said. \u201cEvery four years, we find out about these bans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Rolling Coal\u2019 in Diesel Trucks, to Rebel and Provoke", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by7 PhotosMONTROSE, Colo. \u2014 There is a new menace on America\u2019s roads: diesel truck drivers who soup up their engines and remove their emissions controls to \u201croll coal,\u201d or belch black smoke, at pedestrians, cyclists and unsuspecting Prius drivers.Sgt. Chris Worthington of the Montrose Police Department here is out to stop them.\u201cYou can hear those trucks across town, driving like idiots,\u201d he said on a recent Friday evening patrol. He is among the first law enforcement officers in the country to be trained at \u201csmoke school\u201d to pick up the skills to police the coal rollers.He lost sight of one truck cruising in the opposite direction, trailing plumes of smoke. But another, a Ram 3500 fitted with two steel smokestacks, was parked in a Walmart parking lot. The owner, Pryce Hoey, insisted his truck was emissions compliant, but nevertheless agreed to demonstrate its smoke-generating prowess.\u201cI just wanted something different,\u201d Mr. Hoey said, revving the engine and releasing two black pillars of smoke into the evening air before Sgt. Worthington shut him down. \u201cPeople who see it giggle. They think it\u2019s funny.\u201dDepending on whom you ask, rolling coal is a juvenile prank, a health hazard, a stand against rampant environmentalism, a brazen show of American freedom. Coal rollers\u2019 frequent targets: walkers, joggers, cyclists, hybrid and Asian cars and even police officers. A popular bumper sticker reads \u201cPrius Repellent.\u201dAnd while official tallies of coal rolling do not exist, there are signs that smoke, whether from intentional belching or not, is a growing public nuisance. In Colorado, complaints over diesel smoke have risen 5 percent over the last two years. In California, complaints about smoking vehicles to the California Air Resources Board have jumped from under 700 a month, on average, two years ago to more than 1,000 now.State legislatures, as well as local law enforcement agencies, are starting to take action.Last year, New Jersey became the first state to explicitly ban rolling coal, going beyond the federal laws that already prohibit drivers from tinkering with emissions controls. A similar bill is on the table in Illinois, while Colorado and Maryland have defeated proposed bans.But to diesel owners like Corey Blue of Roanoke, Ill., the very efforts to ban coal rolling represent the worst of government overreach and environmental activism. \u201cYour bill will not stop us!\u201d Mr. Blue wrote to Will Guzzardi, a state representative who has proposed a $5,000 fine on anyone who removes or alters emissions equipment.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go live in Sweden and get the heck out of our country,\u201d Mr. Blue wrote.\u201d I will continue to roll coal anytime I feel like and fog your stupid eco-cars.\u201dEven in this election year of bombastic rhetoric on political correctness and climate change, rolling coal stands out as an ideological statement. At its core, it also struggles with a basic, somewhat existential question: Should we seek to minimize the human footprint on the earth, or should we flaunt it?Still, Michelle Minton, a fellow at the institute, draws a line. Coal rollers who use their trucks for harassment, as opposed to celebration, \u201caren\u2019t being rebellious,\u201d she said, they are just being jerks.At a recent truck pull at the McHenry County Fair in Woodstock, Ill., the fumes were part of the draw. \u201cWhen the smoke goes black, don\u2019t look back,\u201d read one man\u2019s T-shirt.\u201cWe pull for bragging rights,\u201d said Scott Vivian, president of the Illini State Pullers league, the event\u2019s organizer. \u201cAnd smoke\u2019s a big part of it.\u201dThere is, in fact, disdain among truck-pull enthusiasts toward coal rollers, whom they view as wannabes sullying their sport. \u201cI hate those guys. I used to do it, smoke out friends, but I grew out of it,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cGives diesel a bad name.\u201dRaymond Elick runs the smoke school at the Colorado Health and Environment Department, training police to spot coal rollers. It is more art than science.In Colorado, a bill that would have made rolling coal a misdemeanor died in a G.O.P.-controlled State Senate in April. Still, an obscure Colorado state law, a holdover from the days when diesel was far dirtier, allows officers to cite coal rollers that blow smoke for at least five seconds at more than 40 percent opacity, or thickness.Using a \u201csmoke machine\u201d that burns toluene, Mr. Elick has trained 55 police officers to discern smoke opacity: Zero percent opacity is clear air; 100 percent opacity lets no light through.\u201cIf it\u2019s smokin\u2019, it\u2019s broken,\u201d Mr. Elick said. \u201cIf you see a smoky truck running down the street, that\u2019s probably 40-50 percent, and that\u2019s pretty darn smoky,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all of the light disappears over that path, if it\u2019s a really bad coal roller, it could be approaching 100 percent.\u201dA group of Canadian cyclists touring the Vermont countryside in June was on the receiving end of a coal roller\u2019s attention. A white pickup truck accelerated, then belched on the bikers, said John Gelder, a management consultant based in Ottawa.Several minutes later, the truck returned to smoke them out a second time.\u201cWhat the hell. Can you believe it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gelder remembers shouting to his friend Steve Fischer, a Canadian journalist who was touring with him. \u201cIt\u2019s like weapons. They think: \u2018We\u2019re entitled to our guns, and we\u2019re entitled to our roads,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gelder said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an assault.\u201dThe group alerted the police in Morristown, Vt., who Mr. Gelder said took no action. Andrew Glover of the Morristown Police Department said that officers would probably not pursue the case.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a law against whatever they did,\u201d he said.The Volkswagen diesel scandal has helped thrust emissions cheating into the spotlight. The German automaker acknowledged last year that it used a defeat device to evade emissions limits. Up to 11.5 million of its vehicles worldwide contain the tainted software.The Environmental Protection Agency has also gone after the aftermarket hobbyist market. In 2013, it fined a components manufacturer in Ogden, Utah, $500,000 for selling devices that let diesel truck owners override emissions controls.\u201cYou have created a growing business transforming lawful, emission-compliant vehicles into illegal, pollution-belching\u201d trucks, the physicians wrote in a letter to the Diesel Brothers. \u201cTo what purpose?\u201dHeavy D, or David Sparks, said through a representative that there was \u201ca misunderstanding on the modification process of trucks on the show.\u201d The Discovery Channel declined to comment.Anyone who tampers with emissions-control equipment violates the Clean Air Act, which prohibits the selling or installing of any component intended to bypass emissions equipment and carries penalties of up to $2,500.Enforcing that ban on the street is difficult, however. Moves in a handful of states to follow New Jersey\u2019s explicit coal-rolling prohibition have been opposed by those who argue that a ban would be regulatory overkill.Mr. Guzzardi, the Illinois representative and an avid cyclist, has been pushing a bill that would impose an additional fine of up to $5,000 for anyone caught coal rolling. \u201cWhy should I get a giant blast of smoke in my face from someone who doesn\u2019t approve of my transportation method?\u201d he said.But a bid in Colorado that would have made rolling coal a misdemeanor was defeated in April. \u201cAre we overreaching here?\u201d Mark Scheffel, a Republican state senator, argued in committee. \u201cIt\u2019s just kids with too much time and money on their hands.\u201dStill, some truck lovers say times are changing.\u201cWhen a truck like this pulls and you don\u2019t see the smoke, we\u2019re proud of it,\u201d Mr. Voss said.But when Clean Sweep dragged the heavy sled down the track, the crowd was confused. \u201cWhere\u2019s the smoke?\u201d one spectator shouted.\u201cThe air sucks anyway,\u201d said Ben Poncher, who was drinking a beer next to the track. \u201cSmoke\u2019s pretty. I like seeing it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Chesley B. Sullenberger III, the pilot whose skillful emergency landing, necessitated by a flock of geese that had disabled both of the plane\u2019s engines, was christened in some quarters the \u201cMiracle on the Hudson.\u201dMr. Koen said he recently attended a premiere in Manhattan for emergency workers and passengers, and that neither he nor his boat appeared in the rescue scenes.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told a really good story, and just to be able to help out as a first responder, that\u2019s a feather in my cap. I didn\u2019t get a whole bunch of press, but then again my story\u2019s not done yet.\u201dHis story, he said, is one of a \u201criver rat\u201d who has made a half-dozen other rescues during his three decades on the Hudson, most recently in February, when he pulled a woman from the water after she survived a jump from the George Washington Bridge.He said he had also made several rescues in Rutherford, N.J., where he is an assistant chief with the volunteer fire department.\u201cI guess it\u2019s my lot in life \u2014 God gave me certain skills to be able to help people in their hour of need,\u201d said Mr. Koen, captain of the Baylander, a 130-foot decommissioned Navy vessel he docks at West Harlem Piers Park, at the end of 125th Street in Manhattan.The Baylander, whose owner, Alvin Trenk, has opened it for tours and special functions, was built as a Vietnam-era riverboat and renovated in the 1980s, turned into a mobile helicopter landing pad. Known as the Navy\u2019s smallest aircraft carrier, it retains its original equipment, including its working radar.Mr. Koen pointed out a picnic table aboard the boat that he had made out of mammoth planks of driftwood. He said he grew up in the Adirondacks surrounded by lakes and had always lived or worked around water.\u201cI\u2019ve either been in it, on it, or under it, all my life,\u201d said Mr. Koen, who also held jobs on offshore oil rigs. He started work at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in Manhattan in 1984 and worked his way up from a volunteer to director of operations.He figured out ways to transport decommissioned military planes, tanks and other apparatus to New York and mount them on the carrier\u2019s deck as exhibits. And he used his penchant for wood carving to salvage scraps from the Intrepid\u2019s flight deck and transform them into models of the carrier, given as mementos to important guests and benefactors.\u201cI was never good with books \u2014 I graduated high school with a degree in shop class \u2014 but I always enjoyed working with my hands,\u201d Mr. Koen said.As for the 46-foot \u201ckicking around\u201d boat he found on eBay, he said he didn\u2019t tell his wife until after he had bought it, adding that he \u201cspent the next three nights sleeping at the firehouse.\u201dHe named the boat, a buoy tender, the Lt. Michael P. Murphy, after a Navy SEAL killed in Afghanistan. He uses it for odd jobs for friends, and for barbecuing while drifting on the Hudson.In February, he agreed to take divers out to search for the body of a Rockland County man who had jumped off the George Washington Bridge. That is when they saw a 25-year-old woman jump off. She survived the 200-foot fall, which is extremely rare, but told Mr. Koen that her legs were broken. He jumped in and supported her while guiding a rescue line around her.On a January day in 2009, Mr. Koen was idling the Lt. Michael P. Murphy\u2019s engines at the Lincoln Harbor Yacht Club in Weehawken when he heard on his marine radio that a plane had gone down in the Hudson. He cast off his lines and plowed over to join several New York Waterway ferries on the scene.He recalled that he was able to maneuver close to two passengers stranded on the plane\u2019s right wing. He pulled one aboard and then helped the other onto a ferry. Then he gathered debris from the water and gave it to the authorities. He did keep a seat from the plane as a souvenir.Mr. Koen said he kept in touch with many Flight 1549 passengers and rescuers and attended an annual reunion.\u201cWe\u2019ve all become family,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we all went through this event together.\u201dEMAIL: character@nytimes.comThe ParticularsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ahmad Khan Rahami Was Inspired by Bin Laden, Charges Say", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was charged with several crimes, including use of weapons of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use, and the criminal complaint against him outlines how close the attacks came to causing death and even more destruction.The bomb in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday night was powerful enough to vault a heavy steel Dumpster more than 120 feet through the air, according to the complaint. Windows shattered 400 feet from where the explosion went off, and pieces of the bomb were recovered 650 feet away. Among the 31 victims \u2014 two more than first reported \u2014 one had to have multiple ball bearings removed from her body as well as bits of metal from an ear and wood shards from her neck, the complaint says.The charges came on a day when it was revealed that Mr. Rahami\u2019s father told the authorities two years ago that he feared his son was a terrorist, prompting a review by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that did not find any basis for a fuller inquiry.The complaint says Mr. Rahami was motivated by an extremist Islamic ideology that he recorded in a notebook he had with him when he was shot and wounded by the police in Linden, N.J., on Monday morning before being taken into custody.Pierced by a bullet and splattered with blood, the journal contains screeds against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In one handwritten message, Mr. Rahami pleads that he not be caught before carrying out his planned attacks.\u201cMy heart I pray to the beautiful wise ALLAH,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo not take JIHAD away from. I beg.\u201dElsewhere in the notebook, the complaint says, he refers to pipe bombs and pressure cookers as well as to shooting police officers.Mr. Rahami had been meticulously planning his attack since at least June, according to the complaint, acquiring the materials he used to construct his weapons, often via eBay, where he was registered as \u201cahmad rahimi.\u201dWhile items like \u201cAmmo Slingshot Steelies\u201d and electric igniters used for fireworks displays might seem harmless, in Mr. Rahami\u2019s hands, they were combined to create tools of potential carnage, the complaint says.Two days before the bombing in Chelsea, according to the complaint, Mr. Rahami recorded video of himself igniting an incendiary device in the backyard of his Elizabeth, N.J., home.The lighting of a fuse, the complaint says, is followed by \u201cbillowing smoke and laughter,\u201d before Mr. Rahami is seen entering the frame and picking up the device.David Patton, the chief federal defender in Manhattan, said on Tuesday that his lawyers\u2019 immediate goal was for Mr. Rahami, who remains in the hospital, to appear before a judge \u201cso that he can be informed of the charges against him.\u201dLate on Tuesday Mr. Patton wrote to the court, asking that Mr. Rahami be given a court appearance on Wednesday at the earliest possible time. If he cannot travel to Manhattan for medical reasons, Mr. Patton proposed a hearing by phone or video conference.In a complaint filed in federal court in Lower Manhattan, Ahmad Khan Rahami was charged with several crimes, including the use of weapons of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use, in the weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey.The complaint leaves unanswered questions about when Mr. Rahami began to harbor such apparent antipathy for the country he had lived in for years and where he had become a naturalized citizen.As happened with those involved in terrorism-related cases in Orlando, Fla.; San Bernardino, Calif.; and Boston, federal authorities had looked into Mr. Rahami\u2019s life well before he launched his assaults.Federal agents first became aware of Mr. Rahami two years ago, when his father shared with them his concerns that his son might be involved in terrorism.The F.B.I., which had been notified about Mr. Rahami by the local police after a domestic dispute involving the family, said in a statement that it conducted a review \u2014 checking its databases, contacting other agencies and conducting interviews. But the review did not turn up anything that warranted further inquiry, and the matter was closed.Investigators have not discovered any ties between Mr. Rahami and known terrorist groups, and no one has claimed responsibility for his attacks. While the Islamic State is usually quick to claim credit for attacks around the world, organizations linked to Al Qaeda vary widely in when or if they do so.One key area of the investigation involves whether Mr. Rahami had help building the bombs or if anyone knew what he was doing and did not report it. In all, he is linked to 10 explosive devices found in the region.Among those Mr. Rahami praises in his notebook, according to the complaint, is Mr. Awlaki, whose lectures and jihadist declarations are widely available on the web. So, too, is Inspire magazine, which has published detailed instructions for making pipe bombs as well as more sophisticated explosive devices using pressure cookers and Christmas lights, the components used in the New York-area bombs.Despite being killed in a drone strike ordered by President Obama, Mr. Awlaki remains a powerful influence on would-be jihadists, especially in the English-speaking West. Among his documented admirers were Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino; Omar Mateen, who fatally shot 49 people in an Orlando nightclub; and Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who staged an attack at the finish line of the Boston Marathon with pressure-cooker bombs in 2013.The authorities are also scrutinizing a number of trips Mr. Rahami made overseas, particularly several to Pakistan. In May 2011, he made a three-month trip to Quetta, according to law enforcement officials, citing Customs and Border Protection records. In April 2013, he traveled to Quetta again and did not return until March 2014, according to information provided to customs authorities by the New York City police.Mr. Rahami\u2019s wife, Asia, who left the country days before the bombing, is now in the United Arab Emirates. She provided a statement to the F.B.I., according to officials, and the authorities are working to bring her back into the country as soon as possible.The F.B.I. believes Mr. Rahami acted alone but is trying to speak with everyone who knew him.It was unclear when Mr. Rahami married his wife, but after returning from a nearly yearlong visit to Pakistan in March 2014, he was increasingly desperate to get her into the country.He was still in Pakistan when he emailed Representative Albio Sires, Democrat of New Jersey, asking for help getting her a visa, the congressman said.Ms. Rahami\u2019s Pakistani passport had expired, and agents at the United States Embassy in Islamabad discovered that she was 35 weeks pregnant, Mr. Sires said. Ms. Rahami was told she would need to wait until her baby was born before she could apply for United States visas for her and the child. She eventually came to the United States.It was unclear when her visa issue was resolved. But in August 2014, Mr. Rahami got into a fight with his family, during which he stabbed his brother in the leg with a knife, court records show.When the police arrived, Mr. Rahami\u2019s father told them of his concerns about his son\u2019s possible involvement in terrorism. The information was passed to the Joint Terrorism Task Force led by the F.B.I. in Newark. Officers opened what is known as an assessment, the most basic of F.B.I. investigations, and interviewed the father multiple times.Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, the suspect in a bombing in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan that injured 29 people Saturday night, was arrested in Linden, N.J.They never interviewed Mr. Rahami, who was in jail at the time, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The father, Mohammad Rahami, said in an interview that at the time he told F.B.I. agents about his concerns his son was going through a difficult period.\u201cTwo years ago I go to the F.B.I. because my son was doing really bad, O.K.?\u201d he said. \u201cBut they check almost two months, they say, \u2018He\u2019s O.K., he\u2019s clean, he\u2019s not a terrorist.\u2019 I say O.K.\u201dHe added: \u201cNow they say he is a terrorist. I say O.K.\u201dOne official familiar with the inquiry said that the elder Mr. Rahami, after his initial comments about his son, recanted and said he had spoken out of anger.The assessment of Mr. Rahami illustrates the challenges the F.B.I. faces as it solicits information from the public about people who might pose a threat and then must sort through what is credible, while balancing the need to protect the country without overstepping its authority.Depending on the intensity and urgency of an inquiry, there are three types of investigations the F.B.I. can undertake with varying levels of intrusive techniques.The first is an assessment, in which agents use basic techniques like conducting interviews, talking to confidential informers, using physical surveillance and checking databases and public records.Next come preliminary and full investigations, which can be initiated if agents believe a federal crime has been committed or there is a threat to national security. Those investigations can involve polygraphs, undercover agents and mail searches.Both assessments and preliminary inquiries have time limits.A full investigation has no such time limits, but does eventually require review and employs powerful electronic surveillance tools, requiring the approval of a court warrant. Among other things, it allows for the secret interception of international communications.Like Mr. Rahami, one of the Boston bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was the subject of an assessment in 2011.And just as with Mr. Rahami, the F.B.I. did not generate any additional leads that would have prompted a more serious investigation.The Tsarnaev assessment was one of approximately 1,000 the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Boston carried out that year.In the Orlando nightclub attack this year, the circumstances were different.Mr. Mateen, who carried out the deadly assault, had made highly inflammatory comments, which came to the attention of investigators, raising the profile of his case to a preliminary inquiry. He told colleagues he had family ties to Al Qaeda and was a member of Hezbollah. During the 10-month investigation, Mr. Mateen was interviewed twice, and the F.B.I. used confidential informers.Still, the bureau found no evidence that his statements were credible or that he had ties to terrorism.While the federal assessment of Mr. Rahami was closed weeks after it began, he did face criminal charges of aggravated assault and illegal weapons possession stemming from the domestic dispute, according to court records. He spent over three months in jail, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. A grand jury, however, declined to indict Mr. Rahami.Reporting was contributed by Rukmini Callimachi, Annie Correal, Elizabeth A. Harris, Joseph Goldstein, Sarah Maslin Nir, Julia Preston, William K.

{"Headline": "Your Mutual Fund Has Your Proxy, Like It or Not", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameDo you think executive compensation is out of control or that a company should have to disclose its political contributions?If so, you may also think that your mutual fund should vote on these and other issues in accordance with your beliefs. Good luck with that.As investors, we are supposed to be able to sound off on corporate governance matters at the companies whose shares we own. We do so by voting on the issues when they arise at a company\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting.But if you invest, as most people do, with a large fund manager, like BlackRock or the Vanguard Group, the chances are very good that your objections to common corporate practices are not getting through. That is because fund overseers vote your shares and often do so without regard to your views.The result is a breakdown in one of the few accountability mechanisms available to individual investors in our so-called ownership society. This failure has everything to do with the fact that executive pay rises higher each year.\u201cFunds often avoid challenging management on executive pay and corporate governance because they want to be included in corporate defined-contribution benefit plans,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIf a fund irritates a C.E.O. and the C.E.O.\u2019s pals on the board, the fund risks losing business at several companies.\u201dBlackRock and Vanguard dispute this notion, saying they put their customers\u2019 interests first in their voting. \u201cWe weigh all factors that could affect the long-term value of our clients\u2019 assets,\u201d Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for BlackRock, said in a statement, \u201cincluding the hundreds of public pension plans, nonprofits, foundations, endowments, educational institutions and individual investors we serve.\u201dHere is what I learned. On matters involving executive pay, in the most recent 12 months, both fund managers overwhelmingly supported compensation practices at the companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. BlackRock supported executive pay at 98.3 percent of those companies in the most recent year, and Vanguard voted in favor of pay practices in 98.1 percent of its votes. (Vanguard disputed this, saying it voted yes a mere 96 percent of the time.)As head of BlackRock\u2019s investment stewardship unit, Michelle Edkins oversees its voting. On executive compensation, she stressed that the firm voted against pay practices or compensation committee members at 10 of the 50 companies with the highest-paid chief executives this year. She also said that BlackRock discussed compensation matters with half of those companies.Beyond pay, BlackRock and Vanguard both supported management by voting against most proposals requiring that a company\u2019s board be led by an independent chairman. Shareholders in favor of this idea contend that such a move would reduce management\u2019s grip on the board and bring more accountability to corporations.BlackRock voted nay on 95 percent of such proposals, Proxy Insight found, while Vanguard rejected 100 percent of them.That is not particularly surprising, given that neither BlackRock nor Vanguard has an independent chairman overseeing their boards. Laurence Fink is both chairman and chief executive at BlackRock; F. William McNabb III holds both titles at Vanguard.Officials at both companies said they voted against independent chairman proposals at companies whose boards had lead independent directors and whose roles brought necessary balance to the boardroom. BlackRock and Vanguard themselves have lead independent directors on their boards.Nevertheless, a lead director will rarely be as powerful as an independent chairman.Another type of proposal nixed by both BlackRock and Vanguard would require companies to disclose their political contributions and lobbying expenditures. Ms. Edkins at BlackRock characterized such proposals as micromanaging but said, \u201cWe believe it is the responsibility of the board to ensure there is a robust process around any type of spending that has a reputational impact on the firm.\u201dDeutsche Bank spent considerably less \u2014 $900,000 \u2014 and the database showed no expenditures for Pax World.Asked about these and all their votes, both BlackRock and Vanguard cautioned that they were just one way of communicating their views to companies. Company officials said they also regularly discussed issues of concern with boards and if they got nowhere would vote nay. BlackRock voted against 5 percent of directors up for election this year at the approximately 4,000 companies whose shares it owns, Ms. Edkins said.Vanguard abstained on almost 20 percent of shareholder proposals this year. One required companies to report on the gender pay gap among employees. Vanguard abstained on this at Alphabet, Citigroup, Danaher and eBay, among others.In a statement, John Woerth of Vanguard said the company generally abstained from voting on social or environmental proposals that it did not believe \u201chave a clear link to increasing shareholder value.\u201d Vanguard will engage on topics that could affect long-term value, like climate change, he added, \u201cto understand their processes for overseeing and managing those risks.\u201dOne of Vanguard\u2019s abstentions involved pay. A shareholder proposal at the Ameren Corporation, a big utility in the Midwest, would have required its top executives to hold on to a significant number of shares for two years after leaving the company. Such programs align pay with shareholders\u2019 interests by encouraging executives to manage for the long-term.About 50.6 percent of shares were voted against the proposal versus 35 percent in support. Had Vanguard voted its 22 million shares in favor, the proposal still would have failed. But the vote would have been close enough that Ameren\u2019s management might have been forced to take the proposal more seriously.Vanguard declined to comment on this abstention.Unfortunately, there is little that investors can do to change this dynamic.But here is an idea. If your fund company votes the wrong way on issues you care about, register your displeasure by voting against the fund\u2019s directors in its annual election. Maybe that will get someone\u2019s attention.The Fair Game column last Sunday, about how mutual fund managers vote on corporate governance matters, misstated part of the name of a fund man-ager. It is AXA Investment Managers (not Management).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Plan: Get Humans to Mars, and Beyond", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUADALAJARA, Mexico \u2014 Elon Musk\u2019s plans to get to Mars start with a really big rocket. He still needs to figure out how to pay for it.For years, Mr. Musk, the billionaire founder of the SpaceX rocket company, has been offering hints and teases of his desire to colonize the big red planet.\u201cWhat you saw there is very close to what we\u2019ll actually build,\u201d Mr. Musk said, referring to the rockets and spacecraft in the video.Mr. Musk estimated it would cost $10 billion to develop the rocket, and he said the first passengers to Mars could take off as soon as 2024 if the plans went off without a hitch. For now, SpaceX is financing development costs of a few tens of millions of dollars a year, but eventually the company would look to some kind of public-private partnership.Each of the SpaceX vehicles would take 100 passengers on the journey to Mars, with trips planned every 26 months, when Earth and Mars pass close to each other. Mr. Musk said the first flights would be \u201cfairly expensive\u201d but ticket prices might eventually fall to between $100,000 and $200,000 a person.To establish a self-sustaining Mars civilization of a million people would take 10,000 flights, with many more to ferry equipment and supplies.\u201cWe\u2019re going to need something quite large to do that,\u201d Mr. Musk said. It would take 40 years to a century before the city on Mars became self-sufficient, he said.The mood at the conference was almost as giddy as a rock concert or the launch of a new Apple product, with people lining up for Mr. Musk\u2019s presentation a couple of hours in advance.Mr. Musk has talked of his \u201cMars Colonial Transporter,\u201d but a couple of weeks ago, he suggested that its capabilities would be much greater.He now calls it the Interplanetary Transport System. The booster would include 42 of SpaceX\u2019s new, more powerful Raptor engines. On Monday, he posted an image on Twitter of the first testing of a Raptor.Mars has long been the goal of Mr. Musk and SpaceX.SpaceX has established a successful business with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket launching satellites, and by taking cargo \u2014 and soon astronauts \u2014 to the International Space Station for NASA. But Mr. Musk has stated often that his loftier goal for SpaceX is to send people to Mars to make humanity a \u201cmultiplanetary species\u201d in order to ensure survival in case some calamity like an asteroid strike befell Earth.The new rocket could be used for even more distant trips, to places like Europa, the icy moon of Jupiter.\u201cThis system really gives you freedom to go anywhere you want in the greater solar system,\u201d he said.What is less clear is how SpaceX will raise the money needed to bring its Mars dreams to fruition. The new rocket is by far the largest ever.Scott Pace, a former NASA official who is the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said Mr. Musk\u2019s vision was plausible technically, but added, \u201cOther than emotional appeal, however, it didn\u2019t really address why governments, corporations or other organizations would fund the effort.\u201d His bottom-line opinion: \u201cPossible, but not probable.\u201dDuring his talk, Mr. Musk put up a slide titled \u201cFunding.\u201d The first item was \u201cSteal underpants,\u201d a joking reference to a \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode. He also listed SpaceX\u2019s businesses \u2014 launching satellites and sending NASA cargo and astronauts to the space station \u2014 and \u201cKickstarter.\u201dBut he admitted that SpaceX would probably not be able to do it alone. \u201cUltimately, this is going to be a huge public-private partnership,\u201d he said.SpaceX has received much of the financing for its rocket development from NASA, from contracts to take cargo to and from the International Space Station. The United States Air Force is providing $33.6 million for development of the Raptor.At a talk here, Robert Meyerson, Blue Origin\u2019s president, said the aim of New Glenn was to take people to space, although it will also be able to launch satellites. The images the company released showed the satellite-carrying version. But Mr. Meyerson disclosed that \u201cthere are other versions that will have a space vehicle on top.\u201dMr. Meyerson said Blue Origin had an even larger rocket, to be called New Armstrong, on the drawing board. Mr. Bezos has said his goal is for millions of people to live in space, although he has not mentioned Mars as a destination.With Mr. Bezos\u2019 Amazon wealth, Blue Origin faces less pressure to be profitable as quickly as SpaceX, or public companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin that have to answer to shareholders.NASA is still talking about its Mars ambitions, too, and its own giant rocket, the Space Launch System, for eventual human missions there. William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said all of the pieces for a crewed Mars mission were in development, at least to reach Mars orbit, by the 2030s and fit within the agency\u2019s existing budget. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a big new budget,\u201d he said.He admitted that in NASA\u2019s plans, astronauts\u2019 setting foot on Mars would take longer, probably not until the 2040s.Mr. Musk was confident that his company could pull off his vision, but he said he would not be among the first colonists, saying he wants to see his children grow up. The chances of dying on that first trip to Mars, he said, are \u201cquite high.\u201dAn article on Sept. 28 about Space X\u2019s plans to send humans to Mars paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Elon Musk, founder of Space X, about the cost of future flights. He said only that initial prices would be fairly expensive \u2014 not that they would initially cost $500,000. (Mr. Musk said the aim would be for ticket prices to fall to less than $200,000.) The article also referred imprecisely to Mr. Musk\u2019s relationship with PayPal when it was acquired by eBay. While he was still a board member and made money from the sale, he was not PayPal\u2019s C.E.O. at the time and he did not sell it to eBay. This correction was delayed because editors did not follow through when the errors were pointed out.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can You Erase the Trauma From a Place Like Sandy Hook?", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebookThree and half years after the shooting that claimed 20 young students and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary, the town leaders of Newtown, Conn., along with a team of architects, led members of the media on a drizzly late-July morning walk around the rebuilt campus. The new Sandy Hook is a gleaming rural retreat \u2014 farther in the woods than the old building \u2014 an almost Romantic vision of streams and bridges. An uncommon amount of public money and energy has been invested in the new campus, and it shows.Designed with the help of the same security firm that consulted on the World Trade Center rebuilding, the Sandy Hook project is a uniquely contemporary piece of American architecture, a kind of 21st-century gothic: the first public-school campus in the United States to have been demolished and reimagined in direct response to a mass shooting. It is a reluctant but unavoidable statement project.On Sandy Hook\u2019s media tour, guides offered the official story. Every design element, they said, \u201crecalls\u201d something from native ecology and local history. The building\u2019s undulating facade, made of two kinds of hardwood \u2014 machiche and garapa \u2014 recalls the hills of the town as seen from afar. The three handmade weather vanes recall the region\u2019s traditional architecture, and the base of the building, made of rough-hewn fieldstone, recalls old New England masonry. The front lobby, with its rust-toned stained glass and matching kinetic leaf sculpture, recalls the New England autumn.Midway through the tour, in the playground, a group of photographers descended on a brightly painted bench that had been dedicated to the memory of a Sandy Hook child and signed with the small handprints of his classmates. When a town official explained that this bench memorialized a boy who died this past year, from a medical condition unrelated to the 2012 shooting, the photographers immediately lowered their cameras and walked away. This craven need for photography was part of the reason town officials didn\u2019t want a memorial on site. And yet the absence of any memorial seemed only to fuel this desire.After the tour ended, during the news conference, a TV reporter \u2014 concerned with getting a usable visual \u2014 asked the head of Newtown\u2019s government, First Selectman E. Patricia Llodra, if there were \u201cany subtle gestures to memorialize the victims that we might have missed.\u201d Llodra was visibly agitated by the question. She gave a terse reply: \u201cNo.\u201dBut the design of the site told a more nuanced story. The new school was built on the grounds of the old one, but in such a way that it didn\u2019t disturb the small area \u2014 formerly two classrooms, a lobby and the main hallway \u2014 where the shooting occurred. That patch was left conspicuously untouched, but it is not exactly a memorial. This contradiction gets at the problem inherent in a site like Sandy Hook: How do we remember the murdered, where they were murdered, without that history defining the site? (How do we tell that history, especially, when the memory is weighted with shame?) And if we don\u2019t explicitly speak of the victims at the site, does it mean we are choosing to forget the history of the place? No other American community has gone as far as Newtown in reimagining a space where a school shooting happened.In America today, the words \u201cSandy Hook\u201d have become a shorthand not just for the shooting but for the culture of shameful inaction that has taken hold in the wake of the shooting. But in Newtown, \u201cSandy Hook\u201d still refers to the largest village within the town and to its school. Local people refer to the shooting as \u201c12/14\u201d or \u201cDecember 14th.\u201d They hope to shift the burden of memory to a day, not a place. Is it possible?After about 40 minutes of speeches, a young mother recounted an exchange with her son, a second grader. Although the boy was excited that his temporary school had stairs for him to climb, he wanted to return to Sandy Hook Elementary, the building he loved. He asked his mother when he could go back. Her reply: \u201cRight now we can\u2019t go back. It\u2019s broken. We have to figure out if we can fix it \u2014 and we don\u2019t know if we can fix it.\u201dAccording to the cultural geographer Kenneth Foote, the ability to openly confront death is critical to the public process of returning a site like Sandy Hook to regular civic use. In his book, \u201cShadowed Ground: America\u2019s Landscapes of Violence and Tragedy,\u201d Foote observes that after mass murders, especially when the violence had been perpetrated by a member of the victimized community, feelings of shame or guilt are a prime motivator in our ambivalent attitudes toward a site. In particularly troubling cases, in which the violent acts are, as we say, \u201cunspeakable,\u201d a kind of silence indeed prevails around the space. The initial impulse is to obliterate the site and to leave it unmarked, spoken of only in whispers, or not at all.There are, in theory, alternative ways of dealing with this problem. Some cultures, Foote writes, \u201chave rituals that serve to lift stigma, guilt or blame, ceremonies that symbolically cleanse people and places and allow them to return to full participation in day-to-day life.\u201d But, he writes, \u201cthis is not true of American society; there is no easy way for stigmatized sites to be returned to use.\u201d Newtown struggled with exactly that problem: how to return the Sandy Hook site back into use without the help of an agreed-upon ritual.Instead, Newtown got a consultant. In 2013, Randall Bell was brought in by a bank to advise on the question of whether to demolish the house where Adam Lanza, the shooter, had lived with his mother, and where he murdered her before setting out for Sandy Hook. Bell specializes in the field of stigmatized property, and he has consulted on cases from the home where Charles Manson\u2019s followers murdered Sharon Tate to the mansion where Heaven\u2019s Gate cult members committed mass suicide. For his Newtown consultation, Bell visited Colorado to investigate the fates of the homes where the two Columbine school shooters once lived. Neither was razed after the crime. Such demolitions are, Bell told me, exceedingly rare. On the day of his visit, roughly 15 years after the shootings, he discovered that one of the houses was hosting a neighborhood party to watch a Denver Broncos game.\u201cIt was just a random look, of course,\u201d Bell told me by phone, \u201cbut it revealed a lot to me. The house was now just a normal place, part of the fabric of the community.\u201dThis observation, which he shared with Newtown leaders, confirmed his belief that demolishing a structure doesn\u2019t change the public\u2019s view \u2014 people will continue to associate the plot of land itself with an infamous event. The only thing that removes stigma from a site is, in Bell\u2019s experience, the passage of time. He delivered his findings to the bank that owned Lanza\u2019s house, the first selectman and the police chief. Despite Bell\u2019s input, Newtown decided to take the unusual step of demolishing the killer\u2019s house and letting the ground grow wild. But the actions taken at the school site were even more extraordinary: The town decided to demolish an entire public-school campus, then carefully erase of every last piece of rubble.Town authorities were anxious to control the physical remains of Sandy Hook, knowing that some piece of it could end up in the hands of profiteers and the conspiracy theorists who believe the shooting never happened, that it was an orchestrated hoax perpetrated by the government. Demolition workers were ordered to sign a nondisclosure agreement that barred them from photographing or discussing their work at the site. According to this document, they were not permitted to remove \u201cany dirt, bricks, tiles, hardware, windows, glass, doorknobs, doors.\u201d The debris was removed to an undisclosed location and destroyed.In May of last year, I visited the town\u2019s municipal offices to speak with the first selectman. Llodra is a friendly, no-nonsense Connecticut Republican who uses the word \u201cpersons\u201d in conversation and speaks in rapid, decisive and well-measured statements. She told me that she had studied the responses of other school-shooting communities but concluded that each case was culturally distinct. And the victims at Sandy Hook were so young, and there were so many of them. Newtown, in her view, was on its own.This concept became axiomatic for the 28 local leaders of a task force that set policy for the project back in 2013. Llodra returned to this theme in those task-force meetings, whenever doubts crept in and threatened her consensus. \u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she said at one point during a meeting in April 2013. \u201cWe have no history.\u201dHaving no history meant that Newtown was operating in scary, uncharted territory, but it also gave them license to be bold. The initiative to remove all traces of the building, with the legal backing of a nondisclosure contract, was one among these unprecedented actions.\u201cOne of our biggest fears,\u201d Llodra told me, \u201cwas that a brick from Sandy Hook would end up on eBay. We just couldn\u2019t have that.\u201dThere is an entire literature that explores the reasons a brick from a place like Sandy Hook might end up on eBay. Some scholars believe that because our culture considers it tasteless and morbid to talk openly about death, people who seek answers to these basic questions often go about it in tasteless and morbid ways.The impulse to handle the material of death has a socially acceptable counterpart: the creation of \u201cspontaneous memorials,\u201d the laying of flowers, teddy bears, letters and candles, which is one of contemporary society\u2019s most conspicuous folk customs. Often a spontaneous memorial begins when regular citizens create a shrine as close as physically possible, usually as close as police barricades will permit, to the actual scene of the violence \u2014 and spreads outward from there. This pattern was followed in Newtown, and it elicited another of the town\u2019s unusual responses: Llodra eventually ordered the removal of the folk memorials (which is not unusual) and had them ground into a fine powder (which is quite unusual). She placed this \u201csacred soil,\u201d as she calls it, in safekeeping, where it remains.The town set out to discover a new plot of land and start over. They studied more than 40 sites. Realistic alternatives were few, they learned; a second site adjacent to the old plot was kept on the table simply for the sake of conversation. That conversation, as it turned out, was illuminating. The proposed second site happened to sit at an elevation that would give students and faculty a clear view over the abandoned Sandy Hook site, including, for some period of time, a view of the old building itself.The members of the task force had shuddered at the proposal. All agreed that this \u201cpretty horrible unintended consequence,\u201d as one put it, was too grim to consider. \u201cI just don\u2019t know that we gain enough emotional barriers to invest in that site,\u201d Llodra said.The concept of erecting \u201cemotional barriers\u201d had perhaps always been the goal of the Sandy Hook rebuild project. But now the time had come to define what these were. When the task force was asked to imagine the view from the proposed second site, something important came into focus: It turned out that seeing the space from afar would be somehow more devastating than reinhabiting it. It was more plausible to create emotional barriers at the old site.None of this made the inevitable decision any easier. Even as the task force neared its vote, after many hours of procedural fussing and technical deliberations about traffic patterns, Brian Engel took the microphone. Engel\u2019s 6-year-old daughter, Olivia, was killed at Sandy Hook; his son would soon be entering kindergarten at the school.\u201cWe\u2019d like it to be \u2026 at a new location,\u201d he said, his voice cracking, \u201cand not at the location where [Olivia] was killed. Our family has not asked for anything since December 14th, except that the building at 12 Dickinson be razed and that the new Sandy Hook school be located at a new location.\u201d That same night, one of the task-force members testified: \u201cTo me, that is always going to be a site where 26 people were murdered.\u201d And at the next meeting, she voted to return the school to that site. All 28 members of the task force did.In the end, the creation of \u201cemotional barriers\u201d took the form of compromises. One came in the form of displacing a future official memorial far from the site. The town hasn\u2019t yet identified a spot for a permanent Sandy Hook memorial, but they are adamant that it won\u2019t be located at the Sandy Hook site, nor across from the school, as was done with Columbine, where a multimillion-dollar official memorial resides on a hill overlooking the school building. Nor will it be in the center of town, where the Newtown war monuments are. The future Sandy Hook Elementary memorial will most likely live in a remote spot where a visitor might sit quietly, alone in the woods, and reflect.But the decision for a remote memorial didn\u2019t directly resolve the problem of the site itself. Newtown decided to reorient the driveway to the school, the place where parents and emergency medical workers lived out the horror of that day. The community also decided to avoid building on the footprint of the site of the shooting: the two first-grade classrooms, lobby and hallway near the school\u2019s entrance. By defining the \u201csacred ground\u201d of Sandy Hook as this smaller footprint, instead of the entire site, the people of Newtown could return to the old site but avoid violating its sacredness.Here again, Columbine offers a useful point of comparison. There, the community did not demolish the school but redesigned it specifically to address the problem of endlessly seeing murder at the site. The renovated Columbine, centered on a giant mural suspended from the ceiling of the cafeteria, was an attempt to pull the gaze away from the violence of that day in the past. \u201cWe wanted heads to be lifted, not hung, wondering: Where did that child die?\u201d said Dawn Anna Townsend, whose daughter was murdered in the school\u2019s library, at the ceremony that inaugurated the new space. In order to transform their gaze, the community decided that they had to re-enter the traumatized space itself and find a new way to look. But in Newtown, they didn\u2019t feel they could look again, and so they eradicated it and built a fence.This small enclosed piece of land marked the spot where the sacrilege of murder and the sacredness of memory lived in perpetual unhappy paradox, the place where an event whose meaning, if there is one, is so appalling and inaccessible to us, all we can do is put a fence around where it happened and declare it taboo. This fence, a literal \u201cemotional barrier,\u201d seemed to be the ritual object that allowed Newtown to preserve its most delicately unresolved past, while the rest of site was thrown into the upheaval of construction for the future.But maybe I was wrong. Perhaps it was just a regular old fence. When I mentioned it to the powers that be, the reactions I encountered seemed to confirm that the fence held a powerful significance to its builders. The architects refused to reply to my questions and directed me to the first selectman\u2019s office. Llodra\u2019s answer was even more telling. She would not confirm or deny the meaning of the fence. And she told me that if I planned to even mention the existence of the fence in this story, she would cease to cooperate with me.This could be regarded as a sign of denial. I don\u2019t think it is. I don\u2019t believe the efforts at nondisclosure, for example, were part of an attempt to not see, but rather an effort to see with eyes closed. During that initial meeting in January 2013, First Selectman Llodra reported to the assembled parents on conversations she\u2019d had with state and federal agencies. Based on these discussions, she assured her constituents that Newtown would receive a great deal of financial support for any construction project they might propose. The question Llodra had posed to the state powers was, in her words, \u201cHow big can our dream be?\u201d It struck me as an odd way to describe a project with such a horrific impetus. But maybe the new Sandy Hook really was a kind of dream, the playing out of a fantasy that preoccupies survivors of violence: the painful desire for a redo, so that, this time, trauma might be prevented.By July of this year, when I visited the school on media day, the fence was gone, and the ground it once contained was now a mound of earth, a memorial in everything but name. I discovered that day that Newtown\u2019s official policy of silence has almost entirely succeeded. I didn\u2019t see any of the dozens of photographers take pictures of the mound. I watched, and winced, as one photographer set up his tripod directly on top of it, to get a better angle of the new building. The reporter at the news conference who asked about memorials apparently didn\u2019t realize that a special plot of land was visible through a window only a few feet behind her.This official silence prevailed until a man named Neil Heslin made a pilgrimage to the site. His son, Jesse Lewis, was murdered at Sandy Hook, somewhere on that plot, in what used to be his first-grade classroom. Heslin told a reporter that he had opposed the project to rebuild at the site, and, having been overruled, decided he wanted the ground clearly marked. He had brought Jesse\u2019s backpack with him, and, holding it aloft, he knelt down on the mound for a photo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "PGA Tour Rookie Smylie Kaufman Strives to Aid Louisiana Flood Victims", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNORTON, Mass. \u2014 The elite of the PGA Tour, the 30 fortunate players who qualify for the season-ending Tour Championship, will have a week of rest to prepare for the Sept. 22-25 tournament.Smylie Kaufman may well be one of those fellows. But he will not spend the third weekend of September with his feet on the couch watching his alma mater, Louisiana State, play Mississippi State in football. He is planning on being in the Baton Rouge area, though not for a game. Rather, he will be raising money for flood victims as well as heightening awareness of their plight.Three other PGA Tour players who also went to L.S.U. will join Kaufman. They will try to help the many children who have been displaced because their schools were flooded. The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said recently that the state had sustained more than $8.7 billion in damage from floods last month.\u201cA lot of schools down there got extremely flooded,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cKids are exchanging schools. It\u2019s unusual. We\u2019re going to try and help out at the high schools, middle schools, elementary schools. Whatever it is they need us to do to help the kids get back on their feet.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe can\u2019t help everybody. But we\u2019re going to try to do the best with the time we have.\u201dThe gesture is all the more meaningful given that Kaufman and everyone else in the Deutsche Bank Championship field will be teeing off in threesomes early Monday to try to get the final round completed before the remnants of Hurricane Hermine arrive at T.P.C. Boston. Kaufman is in contention for his second tour win, part of a three-way tie for third at 11 under par, four strokes behind the leader, Paul Casey. Brian Harman is at 12 under.Casey shot his third straight 66 during Sunday\u2019s third round, capped by an eagle on No. 18 after his 232-yard approach shot landed two and a half feet from the hole. Casey has won only once on the PGA Tour, in April 2009 in a playoff at the Shell Houston Open. He was 59th in the FedEx Cup standings heading into the tournament.\u201cTo be sitting here with a 66, obviously, I\u2019m over the moon,\u201d Casey said.A leaderboard lacking in marquee names got one major boost on what the pros call moving day. Rory McIlroy nearly had a two on No. 18 and finished with a five-under 66 to get to nine under for the tournament. Louis Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open champion who is looking for his first win on American soil, also made a big move, shooting a seven-under 64 to wind up at nine under. They were joined by Justin Rose, the Olympic gold medalist, and Tony Finau.The P.G.A. Championship winner Jimmy Walker is tied with Kaufman at 11 under, but Walker\u2019s fellow Ryder Cup team members Dustin Johnson and Jordan Spieth stumbled to over-par rounds. Ryan Moore is at 10 under.When most people last saw Kaufman, a PGA Tour rookie, he was in the final group of the Masters on the last day with Spieth. While Spieth\u2019s meltdown on No. 12 at Augusta very likely cost him the tournament, Kaufman played like a rookie, finishing with an 81.In his next 11 tournaments, he missed the cut eight times. His best finish was a tie for 10th in the Quicken Loans National in June. But he said he had made one discovery as a rookie: He does not need to be perfect to win. He realized that in his victory at the Shriners Hospital for Children Open in Las Vegas last October.\u201cI barely made the cut,\u201d he said, neglecting to mention that he shot a 61 on the final day for a one-shot victory.He continued, \u201cThat was a big wake-up call for me, realizing I could win on the PGA Tour without my A game.\u201dHe also referenced the experience of playing in the final group on the final day of the Masters, again neglecting to mention his final score.A strong finish on Monday would move Kaufman into the top 30 in the FedEx Cup standings; he was 34th heading into the Deutsche Bank. He missed the cut last weekend at the Barclays.But while he did not play particularly well at Bethpage Black, he did leave a mark in the form of a golf bag. His plan was to get his fellow pros to sign the bag and then auction it off, with the proceeds going to flood victims in Louisiana.Then his grandfather, a former golf coach at Alabama-Birmingham, received a phone call from a friend who wanted to make a $50,000 donation to Kaufman\u2019s flood-relief efforts.\u201cI was like, \u2018Do you want the golf bag in return and just kind of skip the whole eBay process?\u2019\u201d Kaufman said.That man got the golf bag.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of the headline with this article misspelled the surname of a PGA Tour rookie planning to raise money for flood victims in Louisiana. As the article and a picture caption correctly noted, he is Smylie Kaufman, not Kauffman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nike Tosses Its Golf Clubs. (Shirts to Stay On.)", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 So, who comes to mind when you think of golf and Nike?And what, specifically, is Tiger Woods wearing when you think of him?That association, which waned a little for serious golf fans with Woods\u2019s decline but remains strong for much of the casual sports world, has been very good for Nike for a very long time. But it is (or, really, was) also emblematic of Nike\u2019s golf problem.Two months ago, Nike \u2014 whose player roster includes Rory McIlroy, Michelle Wie and yes, still, Woods \u2014 announced that it was leaving the golf equipment business. Development and production of Nike golf clubs and Nike golf balls will be shut down, the company said, essentially admitting that it had not made enough money in this particular field about 18 years after it introduced its first ball and 14 years after it rolled out its first clubs.The decision, which caught many in the golf community off guard (including some players and executives with ties to Nike), has made for some odd realities. For instance, at the marquee Tour Championship played here at East Lake Golf Club last year, Paul Casey introduced and praised a prototype of Nike\u2019s new driver, the sleek blue-and-yellow Vapor Fly model.On Thursday, in the first round of this year\u2019s event, Casey played at East Lake alongside McIlroy; each shot 68, two shots behind the leaders Dustin Johnson, Hideki Matsuyama and Kevin Chappell. Casey and McIlroy again used their Nike gear, even though it was difficult not to look at their clubs and bags as soon-to-be collector\u2019s items. Beginning next season, the most likely place to find them could be on eBay.\u201cThe secret sauce in the equipment business that Nike didn\u2019t have is that each of these companies that\u2019s thriving comes from a core competency that they grew out of,\u201d said Casey Alexander, a senior vice president at Compass Point Research & Trading, which has long tracked the golf industry. \u201cCallaway still uses the Big Bertha name \u2014 that\u2019s what people know them for. TaylorMade invented the metal-headed driver, and that\u2019s still a huge part of what they do. Titleist has a core competency in golf balls. Ping has a history in cast-iron clubs. Nike just never broke through with something like that.\u201dWhat Nike did (and does) have, though, is the ubiquity of that red shirt and the popularity of its brethren. Nike\u2019s golf clothes, or soft products, have long been global favorites, and Nike has said it plans to continue producing new shirts and shorts and pants and shoes and hats \u2014 all of which, not coincidentally, require far less of an investment to create than the funding needed to operate a research-and-development operation for new clubs or new balls.Nike is not alone in bowing to that truth. Earlier this year, Adidas, which also makes a wide variety of popular golf clothing, took steps to separate itself from TaylorMade, the club-and-ball company it purchased in 1997, and Adams, another club company.And why not? In the United States, the number of golfers has decreased to 24 million from about 30 million in 2005, forcing equipment companies, particularly those that produce more than just golf products, to be more discerning.Nike\u2019s decision may have felt abrupt \u2014 Bobby Kreusler, the agent for another Nike player, Jhonattan Vegas, told Golf Magazine that he found the news \u201cshocking and extremely disappointing\u201d \u2014 but the numbers were impossible to ignore. Sales in Nike\u2019s golf division during the fiscal year that ended in May were terrible: Its total figure of $706 million was 8.2 percent lower than the previous year and made it Nike\u2019s worst-performing major category. (The women\u2019s exercise category, by comparison, had sales of $1.34 billion.)Many players, and their agents, have been hesitant to speak openly about the situation because negotiations, with Nike and other companies, are in progress.Several agents speculated that one (somewhat counterintuitive) ramification of Nike\u2019s move out of the golf equipment business is that there will actually be more, not fewer, Nike swooshes on the golf course at top events.In the past, the thinking goes, Nike could not attract some players it wanted to work with because many players believed Nike\u2019s clubs were inferior. Now, Nike will be free to chase any player without demanding that the player use Nike\u2019s clubs as well as wear its clothes.Pressed on the issue, he played coy, saying: \u201cOn the apparel, shoe side, I don\u2019t have anything to share right now. But I\u2019m really excited about the future.\u201dBy next season, many players figure to have different looks, and in a sport that rivals Nascar in terms of perpetually in-your-face branding, Nike\u2019s decision is significant.The on-course effect is less quantifiable. Many players have love-hate relationships with their clubs, depending on how they are playing. Still, the questions are obvious: What clubs will McIlroy be using next year? Or Casey or Nick Watney? How about a young star like Brooks Koepka, who joined Nike only eight months ago?It will be his first tournament action since August 2015, and Woods, who is recovering from two back operations, stoked his fans\u2019 anticipation by writing, \u201cMy rehabilitation is to the point where I\u2019m comfortable making plans,\u201d and adding, \u201cIt could be a fun fall\u201d when he returns to the course.He did not, however, specify what would be in his bag once he did.Advertisement"}

Federal investigators said the video shows Mr. Rahami in his backyard, lighting the fuse of a small cylindrical object in the ground followed by a loud noise and flames, smoke and laughter.Investigators believe Mr. Rahami bought some of the materials he used to make bombs on eBay between June 20 and Aug. 10 under the name \u201cahmad rahimi.\u201dOn July 12, that user bought an electric igniter for a fireworks system. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that \u201can analysis of the 27th Street bomb identified numerous electric igniters inside.\u201dOn July 31, the user bought a circuit board, which the authorities said could be used in explosive devices.On Aug. 10, the user bought what authorities believe to be citric acid, which was described on the online auction site as being \u201cgreat for bath bombs and candy making.\u201d The F.B.I. described citric acid as a precursor for improvised explosives.On various dates, the user bought items listed as milling balls and slingshot ammo, which investigators said could be used to increase a bomb\u2019s fragmentation.The items were shipped to a business where Mr. Rahami worked.The complaint describes a handwritten journal investigators say they recovered from Mr. Rahami during his arrest.They said the journal includes references to slaughter in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine and Syria; concern about being apprehended by the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security; and references to \u201cjihad,\u201d \u201cpipe bombs\u201d and a \u201cpressure cooker bomb.\u201dThe document ends with the following: \u201cInshallah [God willing] the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death to your OPPRESSION.\u201dThe explosive in Chelsea was so powerful that it propelled the Dumpster it was under more than 120 feet, shattering windows as far as 400 feet away and three stories high.Fragmentation from the bomb, which was packed with ball bearings and steel nuts, was found more than 650 feet away.Thirty-one people were injured, two more than were initially reported, the report said.Investigators recovered 12 fingerprints from the unexploded bomb on 27th Street, which F.B.I. agents matched to Mr. Rahami. They also say they matched fingerprints from materials inside the backpack used for the bomb at the train station in Elizabeth to Mr. Rahami.The injuries included lacerations to the face, stomach, legs and arms from flying glass and metal shrapnel and fragmentation embedded in skin and bone. One woman had multiple ball bearings removed from her body, metal from her ear and splintered wood from her neck.Another victim, a man who was driving by the bomb site, was knocked unconscious by the explosion.A video shows a man pulling a suitcase on West 27th Street about two minutes after the West 23rd Street explosion. That man, who investigators believe to be Mr. Rahami, returns shortly thereafter into the camera\u2019s view, without the suitcase.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Hacking at Yahoo Means for Verizon", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the kind of phone call no chief executive wants to make \u2014 or receive \u2014 in the middle of a multibillion-dollar deal.But Ms. Mayer had some unexpected bad news. She caught up with Mr. McAdam and Marni Walden, a rising star at Verizon who is expected to oversee the Yahoo business after the deal is complete, by phone, according to people briefed on the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Yahoo recently discovered that at least 500 million of its user accounts had been breached by hackers two years ago, well before the two companies began talks. Yahoo and law enforcement officials were scrambling to unwind the intrusion.After calling Mr. McAdam and Ms. Walden, Ms. Mayer phoned Tim Armstrong, who leads the AOL business at Verizon and will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo, according to the people briefed on the conversation. Again, the news was not good.The calls set off a flurry of questions at Verizon \u2014 How could this possibly have happened? Who was behind it? Why is it only becoming known now? Could this jeopardize the deal? \u2014 but also the sounding of an alarm and the deployment of a triage team to assist Yahoo.The telecom giant directed its online security experts, including Chandra McMahon, Verizon\u2019s chief information security officer, to do their own investigation of the hack. And they enlisted the help of Verizon\u2019s security division, part of its enterprise solutions business, which helps companies defend against and manage hacks.Now, just a few days after Verizon learned of the breach, it is contending with the ramifications of what is believed to be the largest hack of a single company. Even as Verizon tries to assess the damage at Yahoo and prevent further security intrusions, the scope of the hack and the potential fallout \u2014 including the possibility of a costly class-action lawsuit \u2014 are inevitably prompting renewed scrutiny of a deal that was intended to transform the telecom behemoth into a digital media powerhouse.Simple tips to follow if you think your personal information online has been exposed to hackers.For now, Verizon has given no indication of whether the breach will affect its plans to acquire Yahoo. On Friday, the company declined to provide a comment beyond a statement it issued on Thursday, in which it said it would evaluate the situation \u201cas the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities.\u201dOn Friday, Yahoo said, \u201cOur investigation into this matter is ongoing and the issues are complex.\u201dThe effort is complicated because the sales proceedings between Verizon and Yahoo are at an early stage. Though teams from the two companies were already working together on integration plans, Verizon does not yet own Yahoo. As a result, Verizon does not have direct access to the Silicon Valley company\u2019s servers to conduct its own investigation.In late July, after the Verizon deal was announced, Yahoo became aware of a claim that about 280 million of its user credentials had been hacked, according to a person briefed on the specifics, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Yahoo started an investigation but could not substantiate the claim, this person said. It was not clear on Friday whether Yahoo had made Verizon aware that it was looking into this claim in July.During the course of that investigation, Yahoo learned of the more severe breach, which it has said it believes was state-sponsored. Yahoo has not yet said exactly when it realized how large the intrusion was, leaving open the question of whether Ms. Mayer and her team waited to notify Verizon of the hack. Yahoo is now working with outside security consultants and said its investigation was continuing.Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College Law School, said Verizon had two main options if it decided to use the hack as leverage in setting the terms of the deal.\u201cThey could say, \u2018This thing is huge. We want to walk away from the transaction,\u2019\u201d he said. Were Verizon to try to claim that the breach was so severe it was grounds to terminate the deal, it would have to prove that the hack amounted to a material adverse effect on the value of Yahoo.Such claims can be difficult to prove in court. According to Mr. Quinn\u2019s reading of the merger document for the deal, Verizon would most likely have to prove that certain high-level Yahoo employees were aware of the severity of the hack before the deal was agreed upon, and intentionally withheld that information.More likely, Mr. Quinn said, Verizon could pressure Yahoo to renegotiate the terms of the deal.\u201cThey go to court, or threaten to go to court, and renegotiate the price,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can be a very winning strategy.\u201dFind out which parts of your identity may have been stolen in major hacking attacks over the last four years.Like any big company contemplating an acquisition, Verizon performed due diligence on Yahoo before it agreed to the deal. It was not immediately clear, however, how seriously it took security issues during that process.But Verizon would have known that Yahoo has a history of breaches. In 2012, Yahoo said that more than 450,000 user accounts had been hacked.\u201cWith this concerted action and a series of high-profile strikes on businesses including eBay, Target and Yahoo, the risks of cyberattack are evident,\u201d they wrote.\u201cYet as the global economy recovers and deal activity rises,\u201d the report continues, \u201cincreasing awareness of cyber-risk has not resulted in meaningful changes\u201d to the mergers and acquisition process.Those motivations are unlikely to have changed in the course of two months. But it remains unclear whether this new information has made Yahoo a less desirable acquisition target.Some of Verizon\u2019s executives have indicated they may be up to the challenge of a big hack. In a recent talk at Penn State University, Ms. McMahon, the telecom company\u2019s chief information security officer, suggested that she relished the cat-and-mouse game between hackers and companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "TPG Growth Plans to Start a Social Impact Fund", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow the business, part of the investing titan TPG, is planning to branch out into the world of so-called social impact investing that is meant to be philanthropically and financially successful \u2014 and with operations on a big scale.TPG Growth plans to raise money for what it will call its Rise Fund, which it hopes will eventually invest more than $1 billion, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The fund will involve a partnership with Elevar Equity, an investor that has backed 24 companies in seven countries.An Elevar co-founder, Maya Chorengel, is expected to spend a significant amount of time working on the Rise Fund.The new fund, which has been in the works for about a year, is the latest entry into social impact investing. Most impact funds have been run by smaller investment firms, though last year Bain Capital announced that it had hired Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, to oversee what it called its Double Impact fund.Overseeing the effort by TPG Growth is William E. McGlashan Jr., who in 2013 moved his family to India for a year to help oversee the firm\u2019s investments in developing countries in the region. Among its more prominent investments is in Apollo Towers, which runs cellphone towers in Myanmar and which the firm has promoted as having helped spur mobile phone use in the country.Investments by the Rise Fund will most likely look similar to the one in Apollo Towers, which has generated strong returns. TPG Growth expects returns from the new fund to produce, at minimum, market-rate returns.One major element of the Rise Fund is that it aspires to have rigorous metrics that quantify the social impact of its investments, the people with knowledge of the matter said. To that end, TPG Growth and Elevar plan to work with the Bridgespan Group, which has worked with the likes of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic organization of Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of eBay.TPG Growth has also been in discussions directly with the Omidyar Network, which uses a rating system to evaluate how successful investments have been in their missions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Presenting America\u2019s Newest Comedy Team: Mel Brooks and Obama", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Mel Brooks performed a bit of slapstick near the portrait of George Washington. President Obama tried his hand at stand-up comedy beside his lectern. Audra McDonald almost missed her moment on stage.The ceremony Mr. Obama hosted on Thursday to award the nation\u2019s highest honors for achievement in arts and the humanities was a raucous celebration in the stately East Room.The president recognized what he called an \u201cimpressive crew\u201d of two dozen from the worlds of art and literature, including Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records; the composer Philip Glass; the authors Sandra Cisneros and Ron Chernow; the poet Louise Gl\u00fcck; and the chef Jos\u00e9 Andres.\u201cWe\u2019ve got Terry Gross,\u201d Mr. Obama said, referring to the host of the NPR program \u201cFresh Air\u201d who is known for her questioning of celebrities and public figures, \u201cand a whole bunch of people who Terry Gross has interviewed.\u201dThey were at the White House to receive the National Medals of Arts and Humanities, striding one by one onto a raised stage alongside Mr. Obama, who regularly hosts such functions \u2014 most of them formal affairs that unfold according to well-rehearsed protocols.But before attendees even took their seats on Thursday, the event took on a lighthearted air, as the United States Marine Band played a rendition of \u201cSpringtime for Hitler,\u201d the title song of the fictional Broadway musical within Mr. Brooks\u2019s film and stage play \u201cThe Producers.\u201dBy the end, laughter was echoing from the room\u2019s gilded moldings and silk damask draperies.Maybe it was the presence of Mr. Brooks, whose knees buckled theatrically when Mr. Obama placed the large medal around his neck, sending the audience into hysterics.\u201cThat was a joke \u2014 it\u2019s heavy!\u201d Mr. Brooks, 90, said later in an interview. \u201cIt must weigh five pounds.\u201dThe president chuckled at Mr. Brooks\u2019s routine, and teased him in return. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch you if you sell it on eBay,\u201d Mr. Obama said.(Mr. Obama need not have worried, Mr. Brooks said later; he is planning to pass the medal on to his grandchildren. \u201cIn the meantime,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019ll use it as something to put a hot cup on, so that it doesn\u2019t burn the table.\u201d)For Mr. Obama, consumed this week with the serious business of terror attacks and racial unrest at home, and a crumbling cease-fire in Syria, it was a moment to let loose and reflect on the lighter side of his job.\u201cI can tell this is a rowdy crowd,\u201d the president said. \u201cHistorically, this has been a much more staid affair.\u201dMr. Obama improvised when the naval aide reading the official medal citations neglected to include Ms. McDonald, a six-time Tony Award winner, who exchanged glances of amusement with the president as her turn in the program\u2019s alphabetical order passed without mention of her name.\u201cWe skipped Audra McDonald,\u201d Mr. Obama said quietly to the aide, as staffers shuffled papers and scrambled to locate the proper script.\u201cShe was feeling kind of left out,\u201d Mr. Obama said aloud as he waited, smiling impishly. \u201cI can make up the citation if you want.\u201dIn the end, it was not necessary, and Ms. McDonald was recognized for her \u201crich, soulful voice,\u201d and for becoming one of Broadway\u2019s brightest stars.The jazz musician Wynton Marsalis, another honoree, could not attend the event on Thursday, Mr. Obama noted, nor could the actor Morgan Freeman, who, he said dryly, \u201cundoubtedly is off playing a black president again. He never lets me have my moment.\u201dBut those who were there acknowledged how fortunate they were to be among Mr. Obama\u2019s final class of honorees.\u201cWe were all talking about it, how cool it is that we got in while he\u2019s still president,\u201d Louis Menand, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and Harvard professor, said in an interview.Ms. Gross, the NPR host, said she had been thrilled to find out from Mr. Obama that he used to listen to her program \u201cback in the days when he used to be able to drive, before he was president.\u201d\u201cI just find it remarkable that he can handle all these grave situations that he handles, and also have such grace and such a sense of humor,\u201d she said in an interview.Mr. Obama said that he and Michelle Obama had tried to make elevating the arts and humanities a priority during their years in the White House, and that the final round of honorees reflected the nation\u2019s diversity. The group included several artists whose work explores race and culture in America, including the historian Isabel Wilkerson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist; the writer James McBride; the Texas conjunto musician Santiago Jim\u00e9nez Jr.; and Luis Valdez, a playwright, actor, writer and director.\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible confirmation of your struggle to communicate your dreams to America, and an incredible pat on the back from your country for your work,\u201d Mr. Brooks said of the medal.As for the wilder-than-usual ceremony, he said: \u201cI\u2019m probably responsible for that. I just make trouble wherever I go.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worst of the Trumps", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a presidential campaign often inhabits the gutter it\u2019s not easy to establish its low point.We\u2019ve seen Donald Trump vilify Muslims, Mexicans and women. We\u2019ve seen him indulge airy suggestions that rifle-bearing Americans might like to shoot Hillary Clinton. We\u2019ve seen him belabor the lie that President Obama was not born in the United States \u2014 until he recanted. For Trump, the low road to the White House is paved with boorishness. But perhaps his son Donald Trump Jr. set the nadir this week when he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles.A caption accompanying a photograph of the candy said: \u201cIf I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That\u2019s our Syrian refugee problem.\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted, \u201cThis image says it all.\u201dWhere to begin? With the fact that human beings are not Skittles? With the fact that after more than five years of war 4.8 million Syrians are refugees and 6.1 million are internally displaced and Trump Jr., even with his coddled New York existence, can surely make the calculation that this amounts to almost 2.5 million more human beings than live in the five boroughs?With the fact that you do not flee your home because you have a choice (like choosing between Skittles and M&Ms after a Manhattan dinner party) but because you no longer have one? With the fact that, according to a Cato Institute study of refugees admitted to the United States between 1975 and 2015, the chance of an American being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion? With the fact that Syrians want to work, make a living, put their kids in decent schools, and recover their dignity, just like the rest of us?Or perhaps with the fact that comparing Syrians to Skittles carries echoes of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher comparing Jews to mushrooms in a popular children\u2019s book that posited the ticklish dilemma of how to distinguish poisonous toadstools from edible fungus; and has a mother saying to her son Franz:\u201cYes, my child! Just as a single poisonous mushroom can kill a whole family, so a solitary Jew can destroy a whole village, a whole city, even an entire Volk.\u201dWe all know, even the Trumps know, that the door into the United States was closed to desperate European Jews trying to escape the Holocaust.If I may be pardoned for extending an awful analogy, I\u2019d suggest to the Trumps that a better caption would read: \u201cIf I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three of them would turn out to be Sergey Brin, Elon Musk and Pierre Omidyar, would you take a handful?\u201dThe co-founder of Google, co-founder of Tesla, and founder of eBay were all immigrants. Steve Jobs\u2019 biological father was a Syrian immigrant. In fact, earlier this year, the National Foundation for American Policy found that 51 percent of the country\u2019s start-up companies valued at over $1 billion had at least one immigrant founder. A study by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a coalition of governors and business leaders, found that in 2013 more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies, including seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable brands, were started by immigrants or their children.The strength of the United States is its creative churn. In contrast to European states, it is hard-wired to reinvention through immigration. When Trump traffics in fear about immigrants, whether Muslim or Mexican, he guts America of its greatness and turns his back on its singular idea.The American response to the Syrian crisis has been paltry \u2014 almost 12,000 refugees admitted since the war began, or 0.25 percent of the total. Part of the slowness has come from the rigor of the vetting process. But what do the Trumps care? They are concerned with just one message: Muslim equals danger.Let\u2019s see now. Trump\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was a German immigrant. He arrived in the United States in October 1885. For decades, the family lied: They said he hailed from Sweden. In his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump says his grandfather \u201ccame here from Sweden as a child.\u201d The family historian, John Walter, explained that Trump\u2019s father, Fred, \u201chad a lot of Jewish tenants and it wasn\u2019t a good thing to be German in those days.\u201dMake up stories: It\u2019s the Trump way. So here was a German-American posing as a Swedish-American opting not to rent to African-Americans.Friedrich Trump, the immigrant, was young. He was penniless. He came not from Sweden but from Bismarck\u2019s recently formed nation state in the middle of a turbulent Europe. A U.S. immigration officer allowed him into the United States in 1885 \u2014 not a decision without risk.But an American decision taken in the spirit the Trumps now trample with cavalier untruth and vile innuendo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Journey From Class Clown to Suspect in Chelsea Bombing", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf there was one child Mohammad Rahami had to worry about bringing shame upon the family, it was Ahmad. In the fifth grade, his teacher complained to Mr. Rahami that Ahmad acted like a king in class. In junior high, he broke a friend\u2019s nose. Even worse was high school \u2014 after Mr. Rahami arranged for Ahmad to marry a good Afghan girl from Kabul, Ahmad dated a Dominican girl, getting her pregnant in his senior year.The shame. They had falling-outs, so many of them. In the beginning, because Ahmad was just becoming too American for his conservative Afghan parents, who had moved to New Jersey after Mr. Rahami fought in Afghanistan against the Soviets as part of the mujahedeen in the 1980s. And then, in the last few years, they fell out over much darker fears. Ahmad spent hours watching videos on the internet espousing violent jihad, embracing some of the most prominent purveyors of that message: Bin Laden, Awlaki, Adnani, the men who in that world needed no first names. Mr. Rahami said he asked Ahmad to stop.\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d Mr. Rahami recalled telling his son, one of eight children. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if they are real Muslims. You shouldn\u2019t watch them. You have nothing to do with them.\u201dIn many ways, Ahmad\u2019s story is similar to those of the perpetrators of other recent terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe: a disaffected first-generation immigrant, straddling two worlds and unable to fit into either; a young man who had not yet found a meaningful path in life, easily recruited into a cause that promised divine rewards. It is particularly similar to the life of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the popular, outgoing high school student sentenced to death a few years after graduation for his role in the 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon.But Ahmad\u2019s story has nuances, showing how difficult it was for him to make it in America while trying to break out of his conservative family, something, for a while, he seemed to want desperately. His earliest rebellion was not against the West. It was against his father, a conservative, proud man who tried to run his family like he would have back home. And then, later, Ahmad gave up that fight for another, seemingly seeking out jihad on his own and spurning the country that had welcomed his family as refugees.In his recent planning, Ahmad appeared to be isolated and occasionally conflicted. There was no brother to lead him, as in the case of Mr. Tsarnaev. No terrorist cell appeared to be actively helping him. No wife bent on jihad as well, as with the couple in the December shootings in San Bernardino, Calif. No group rushed to claim him or his attacks. Not Al Qaeda and not the Islamic State, despite Ahmad\u2019s praise of figures from both groups in the notebook found on him. That notebook also showed his fear: that he would be caught before he completed his mission, the authorities said.So what turned Ahmad, the class clown, the man who once wanted to be a police officer or a translator for the United States military, into the man now accused of orchestrating the most serious terrorist strike in New York City since the Sept. 11 attacks? Much remains unanswered, but one thing is certain from interviews with his father and friends: He found jihad on the internet, at a time when there was nothing particularly bad in his life, but nothing particularly good.His life was standing in place. Even as his brothers moved on, graduated from college, drove for Uber, Ahmad was stuck. He tried jobs and failed, and ultimately fell back on the one thing he knew, and wanted to get away from: his family\u2019s fried-chicken business. Years of small indignities piled up, the minor court cases, like the one with the neighbor who allegedly conned him in a small-time bank swindle that involved transferring someone else\u2019s money to him and paying her back. He asked her in a text message, \u201cYo this is solely your money tho rite.\u201d (It was not.)There were two main phases of Ahmad\u2019s life \u2014 before he started watching the videos in 2013 and after, as he grew ever more radical.As a teenager, Ahmad embraced America. To his friends, he was not Ahmad \u2014 he was Mad or Ack. He wore baggy jeans, Air Jordans and hoodies, sent slangy text messages proclaiming \u201cna meen,\u201d instead of \u201cknow what I mean.\u201d He was a cutup, a clown. He had girlfriends. He wrote love poems in a spiral notebook.Back then, Mr. Rahami\u2019s desire to send Ahmad to Afghanistan as a way to bring him into a right way of thinking and curb his excesses was seen as a threat, as a punishment, not as a gateway to an extremist cause.But then came the last trip.In April 2013, Ahmad left for a nearly yearlong stay in Pakistan. While there, he took trips to Turkey and Afghanistan, according to immigration and law enforcement officials in Pakistan and the United States. A relative in Quetta, Pakistan, where Ahmad was staying, began to fret about what was becoming of him, his father said. Ahmad had fallen under the sway of a radical cleric in Quetta, a man called Mullah Qudri, according to a close relative in Afghanistan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid upsetting family members.Ahmad came home, angry and violent. A few months later, he stabbed his mother, a brother and a sister. His father was so worried that he talked to the F.B.I. But then, with that investigation closed, Mr. Rahami tried to reconcile with his son. This is a tightknit Afghan family, after all \u2014 a father will forgive many things in a son.By this year, Ahmad seemed to be doing better. He agreed to take over his father\u2019s fried-chicken restaurant. He even moved into a room in the family apartment upstairs.And then, over the summer, he put a lock on the door.The story of the Rahami family is a typical one for the Afghan diaspora, tracing the fallout from the wars in Afghanistan.Mohammad Rahami, a Pashtun from Kandahar, joined the fight against the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan shortly after the Soviets invaded in 1979, when he was only 16. In the war, backed by the United States, he fought both with Hezb-i-Islami, or the Islamic Party, comprised mainly of ethnic Pashtuns, and with a faction of the Jamiat-e-Islami, or Islamic Society, led by Burhanuddin Rabbani, who would become Afghanistan\u2019s president during the civil war in the 1990s.Mr. Rahami would later show a prized photograph to a neighbor who served in the Marines in Afghanistan: of himself as a young man, a traditional brown pakol perched on his head, with three or four other men, all brandishing AK-47 rifles.In 1984, Mr. Rahami moved his home base over the Pakistan border into Quetta, a city teeming with refugees, one that would later become a stronghold for militants. He settled with his wife, Najiba, and other family members.The Rahamis started a family, first a daughter, Aziza, then a son, Mohammad Khan. Ahmad was born in 1988. Najiba was pregnant in 1989, with another son, Qasim, when Mr. Rahami left Pakistan for New Jersey to claim refugee status, about the time that the Soviets fled Afghanistan. He was all of 26 years old, and his war, his own jihad, was already behind him.Najiba and their four children followed in 1995. Four more children would come later.They endured the travails of so many immigrants with little education: hard work, a confusing legal system, limited opportunity and a sea of slights for things that would make no sense back home. Mr. Rahami moved his family from one home to the next one on the New Jersey ladder, from the sprawling Ivy Hill apartment complex in Newark to the Galloping Hill Estates subdivision in Union to the Blueberry Village apartments in Edison, names that all evoked possibility and peace. But all the while, problems piled up: the small lawsuits, his children\u2019s run-ins with the police, and Ahmad, always Ahmad.Mr. Rahami made his way in America like many Afghans at the time in the New York area: in fried chicken, just like the Afghans who started Kennedy Fried Chicken, the shop that has spawned hundreds of fried-chicken restaurants since the first one opened in the 1970s. When Afghans first arrived, they would work for another more-established Afghan, and then they would join together with other Afghan workers to start their own chicken restaurants, to be their own bosses, with aspirational names like Royal Fried Chicken, formerly known as Hollywood Fried Chicken.\u201cIn the community, it\u2019s a good way to get started,\u201d said Mohammed El-Sioufi, who incorporated businesses in New Jersey, including one of Mr. Rahami\u2019s first ones in Newark.So in the 1990s, Mr. Rahami helped run Tasty Pizza & Fried Chicken. In 2002, he would open his flagship, which was really just a hole in the wall, named for the country that embraced him as a refugee: First American Fried Chicken. Within two years, he had joined a Kennedy Fried Chicken franchise in Asbury Park. Other relatives opened chicken shops. His sons would work in all of them, long hours into the night.The family lived for nine years in Ivy Hill, a magnet for first-generation immigrants. Ahmad was known to neighbors as the kid who tagged along with his big brother. Mohammad, older by about two years, was tall and skinny. Ahmad was short and plump, his weight something that would continue to bother him. When they saw their elders, they would both say \u201csalaam,\u201d a respectful greeting. When they saw their friends, it was, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up guys?\u201d They played basketball and went to the park. With their parents, they spoke Pashto, a neighbor recalled.The apartment complex allowed its Muslim residents to create a mosque in the basement. They put carpets down and installed air-conditioners and called it the Ivy Hills Masjid. The Rahami children wore jeans and T-shirts most of the time but traditional clothes on Fridays, for the most important Islamic prayer of the week.\u201cYou line them up, it was like the von Trapp family, times two,\u201d said Ken Creegan, a regular at the chicken restaurant who became friendly with the family.Ahmad was interested in politics in his teens, said a close friend who has known him for about 15 years and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to get swept up in the investigation. He railed against Pakistan and its main intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, better known as the ISI, which he blamed, like many Afghans, for messing up his ancestral land.\u201cAs a teenager, he was angry at Pakistan, saying ISI created the Taliban \u2014 he was angry about it,\u201d the friend said.Little nuisances always seemed to snowball for the Rahamis.Some of the issues should have been simple enough to fix, like the $242 gas bill from Tasty Pizza & Fried Chicken in July 1998. The elder Mr. Rahami did not pay it. He let it haunt him for six years, until the gas company finally sued him.Then there was the matter of being sued by a man who claimed he broke a tooth on a hamburger at Kennedy Fried Chicken. That was a minor irritant, really, but it came just days after Aziza, his eldest daughter, a high school junior, was arrested on suspicion of taking about $565 worth of jewelry and perfume from a Filene\u2019s store. Not only that, a brief about it ran in a newspaper, although the outcome of the case is unclear.The year 2004 was not a great one for the family: Despite all his business endeavors, Mr. Rahami said he earned only $10,000, a court filing showed. Just try raising eight children on that.Mr. Rahami filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, a decision that for a prideful Pashtun man had to have been tough to make. He owed almost $46,000, for things like a Macy\u2019s card and a doctor in Union, N.J., and a 1999 Chevrolet Suburban. He claimed to earn only $1,447.33 a month from his chicken restaurant, somehow feeding his family on $200 of that. He had just $100 in the bank.Ahmad was also becoming a source of anxiety. The teenager had enjoyed his popularity with a certain group of girls, a male friend said, and the attention \u201csometimes puffed up his head.\u201d His father fretted that he was absorbing too many of the negative aspects of American culture.So off Ahmad went to relatives in Quetta in the beginning of what should have been his junior year, his first trip out of America in five years.He stayed until January 2006, and then returned to Edison High School in Elizabeth. Imani Podhradsky sat next to him in Algebra 2, but said Ahmad spent more time socializing than solving math problems.Maria Mena, whose family was from the Dominican Republic, became Ahmad\u2019s sweetheart. A photograph shows the couple in a swimming pool, with another couple and three friends, a diverse group, Maria smiling broadly and hugging Ahmad from behind. Mr. Rahami was furious at the relationship. The family had arranged for Ahmad to marry a woman in Afghanistan. He told his son that he could not have a girlfriend while he was engaged to someone else.No surprise, but Ahmad did what he wanted. By senior year, Maria was pregnant. The teenagers were excited, holding hands in the hallways, grinning and touching each other. In a prom picture, Maria is pregnant, wearing a shy smile and a white dress. Ahmad seems happy, too, wearing a shiny pink vest and a matching tie over a white shirt.His father had had enough. One day, Ahmad came to school upset, Ms. Podhradsky said. His parents were forcing him to move back to Afghanistan after graduation.In early July 2007, just after Ahmad graduated, he was put on a plane \u2014 to Pakistan, it turned out \u2014 leaving behind his girlfriend, who would give birth to their daughter without him.When Ahmad came home the next March, he tried to put his life back together. He moved in with Maria\u2019s family that year. He worked a job at Kmart, which paid him $485.69 a week, court records show. The life that he was building was small, but he was doing it on his own, and that was something. He tried to be a good father. In July 2008, when he was 20, he spent $10.68 for a modest purchase at a toy store. At the time, his bank balance was only $406.41.The Rahami family also continued to rack up legal problems. For years, it seemed as if the family\u2019s main encounters with the outside community were negative ones, in the courtroom, involving lawsuits over small, unpaid bills. Qasim was arrested as a juvenile. At one point, even the mother, Najiba, was arrested, charged with abusing the couple\u2019s 7-year-old, and sent to parenting classes.Around this time, the City of Elizabeth started coming after First American, which had become a go-to spot for local teenagers to hang out at night. They staged rap battles in the back.The dispute became heated, with the city slapping tickets on the restaurant for staying open past 10 p.m., and the Rahamis arguing that such tickets should never have been issued. After what seemed like countless confrontations, Mohammad Khan, the eldest brother, and another sibling, Qasim, tried to record a police visit in June 2009. They complained of selective enforcement. There was a confrontation, and the two were jailed. Qasim was released; Mohammad Khan eventually pleaded guilty to a minor charge. The Rahamis then filed a federal civil rights suit, claiming in part that they were being targeted because of their faith. That lawsuit fizzled out.Ahmad is strangely absent from those court documents. But at some point, he came back to the family, strapped with an incomprehensible $996 a month in child support, now estranged from Maria. He tried to find his footing. He enrolled in September 2010 in a criminal-justice program at Middlesex County College, but he would give it up in two years.About the same time, he told his close friend who had known him for 15 years that he went to Washington to try to get a job as a translator in Afghanistan with the United States military. But he knew only Pashto, one of the two main languages in the country.\u201cThey rejected him and told him to learn Dari,\u201d the friend recalled.Nothing was working out. He started working nights, from 6 p.m. until 3 a.m., manning the register at Royal Fried Chicken in Elizabeth. On one of the nights he had visitation rights to his daughter, he brought her to work, said Amarjit Singh, a co-worker and high school friend. He held her, refusing to let her go.His life kept going in fits and starts. Ahmad finally married his fianc\u00e9e on a three-month trip to Pakistan in 2011. But the next year, he was fighting with his ex-girlfriend in court. He was slapped with a restraining order \u2014 it was not clear by whom \u2014 and jailed for violating it eight days later.By 2013, he was becoming someone else. A friend from high school, who had once watched the movie \u201cHellboy\u201d with Ahmad, found out that his friend\u2019s tastes in videos had changed. Ahmad had started watching YouTube videos of extremists, said the friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was afraid of repercussions. At one point, the friend said, Ahmad showed him a lecture by the leading English-speaking Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, killed in a C.I.A. drone strike in September 2011.\u201cHe put his hands in this,\u201d is the expression Mr. Rahami used to describe his son\u2019s growing extremism, which he first saw in 2013.So when Ahmad went to Pakistan the last time, in April 2013, he was already dabbling in extremism. Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province and a haven for Taliban leaders and other extremists, would have made it easy for him to be drawn in deeper. The irony was clear: As a young teenager, he had hated the Taliban and Pakistan. And now he embraced them, even though a relative had been killed by the Taliban in Afghanistan around this time, the friend of 15 years said.His close relative in Afghanistan said Ahmad fell under the spell of a man named Mullah Qudri, whom he met through friends in California. \u201cThis Mullah Qudri has brainwashed Ahmad,\u201d the relative said, adding that Mullah Qudri was even spending nights with Ahmad at the house where he was staying in Quetta.Ahmad traveled to Afghanistan for several weeks early on in his trip, according to Pakistani immigration authorities. He also made a short detour in early 2014 to Turkey \u2014 the gateway to Syria and the Islamic State \u2014 although it is not clear what he did there, law enforcement officials said.When Ahmad came home in March 2014, he was flagged by customs officials, who pulled him aside for a second screening and alerted a federal agency that assesses potential threats, two law enforcement officials said. It was the first time he came to the attention of federal authorities.But nothing happened. And there Ahmad was again, living now with his brothers in an apartment in Perth Amboy, N.J., working in the chicken business, even as his brothers were moving on to other things. Only now, he favored wearing more traditional clothes. Only now, he was angry and erratic. His wife, Asia Bibi Rahami, had just given birth to their son but was having trouble getting a visa to come to the United States. When Ahmad showed up at the local congressman\u2019s office to ask for help, he was gruff and abrupt, asking the office to mail a letter to Islamabad demanding to know why it was taking so long.One day in August, he stabbed his brother, his sister and his mother; none of the injuries were grievous, but still. Mr. Rahami, who had seen his son watching these horrible videos, who feared what he was becoming, called the police, a difficult decision, calling in the very people who had never done his family any favors. He described his son to them as a \u201cterrorist.\u201d Ahmad was charged with stabbing his brother Nasim in the left leg. Mr. Rahami, in interviews last week, did not want to say much about the attack, so it is not clear why Ahmad was charged only with his brother\u2019s stabbing.Ahmad spent a little more than two months in jail, and Mr. Rahami said he talked to the F.B.I. about his concerns about his son\u2019s growing extremism.The F.B.I., which challenged Mr. Rahami\u2019s recollection, never interviewed Ahmad. And about three weeks after the stabbing, the review was formally closed.Life went on. Ahmad\u2019s wife eventually made it to the United States. Mr. Rahami and Ahmad were mostly estranged, although in an Afghan family, where family life is paramount, such estrangements are rarely forever. So then came this year, when the elder Mr. Rahami and his wife and their youngest children planned to move to Roanoke, Va., near relatives, where they would open up another fried-chicken restaurant. Ahmad\u2019s brothers were doing well. One was driving for Uber. Another had graduated from college. So Mr. Rahami offered his wayward son a shot: If he wanted, First American was his.The restaurant deal lasted less than six weeks. After a bitter dispute between father and son, Mohammad Rahami came back at the end of May to run the business until he could sell it. Ahmad left the restaurant and started working shifts at two other fried-chicken restaurants in the area.But Ahmad stayed in his father\u2019s apartment, keeping a lock on the door of his room, Mr. Rahami said. His son grew so suspicious of his father trying to get inside, even through the windows, that he changed the lock.In June, Ahmad started ordering supplies from eBay, the slingshot steelies, the citric acid, the circuit board, according to the federal criminal complaint against him. He planned. At some point, he allegedly scrawled his thoughts in a notebook, along with thoughts of his muses, Awlaki, Bin Laden and a founder of the Islamic State. \u201cInshallah the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets,\u201d the journal finished. \u201cGun shots to your police. Death To Your OPPRESSION.\u201dThe bombs went off last weekend, but the elder Mr. Rahami was busy in his chicken restaurant, keeping it open into the wee hours, the best time to make money, after the bars let out and people were hungry.On Monday morning, Mr. Rahami closed the business just before 3. He said his prayers, and then he went to bed. But then he heard a loud racket outside. Two law-enforcement officers burst into his apartment and told him to raise his hands, he said. They handcuffed him, he said, and put him on the floor, before marching him outside his bedroom. There, he saw three of his sons \u2014 Mohammad Khan, Qasim, Nasim \u2014 also handcuffed.He looked from one to the next and he had one thought: \u201cWhere is Ahmad?\u201dAn article on Sunday about the bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami\u2019s formative years in New Jersey misidentified the location of Edison High School, which he attended.
