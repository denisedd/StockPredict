{"Headline": "Could Ancient Remedies Hold the Answer to the Looming Antibiotics Crisis?", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "FeatureOne researcher thinks the drugs of the future might come from the past: botanical treatments long overlooked by Western medicine.Supported byEach of these species intrigued Quave enough to merit a pause, a verbal greeting, a photo. An ethnobotanist based at Emory University in Atlanta, Quave, 38, has an unabashed fondness for all citizens of the kingdom plantae. But on this evening, her attention lingered on certain species more than others: those with the power to heal, with the potential to help prevent a looming medical apocalypse.Quave parked near the edge of a pond crowded with the overlapping parasols of water lilies. Here and there a green stem rose from the water, capped with a round yellow flower bud, like the antenna of some submerged mutant. Alligators had attacked dogs and ducks around here in the past. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry,\u201d Quave said, tracing the pond\u2019s perimeter. \u201cIf we see one, I\u2019m going to shoot it.\u201d She wore lightweight cargo pants, a black tank top, a paisley bandanna wrapped around her head and a .357 Magnum revolver strapped to her hip.After Quave gave the all-clear, her colleague Kate Nelson and I pulled on some tall rubber boots and proceeded cautiously into the water. I repeatedly plunged a shovel into the pond\u2019s viscous floor of gray mud, just beneath the tenacious roots of a water lily \u2014 species name: Nuphar lutea \u2014 working it like a lever to loosen the plant as Nelson tugged on its stems. We seemed to be making good progress, until the roots suddenly snapped and Nelson fell backward with a splash. Thirty minutes later we emerged with boots full of water and several intact specimens. \u201cBeautiful!\u201d Quave said. \u201cHello, lovely.\u201d The roots, which she had not seen properly until now, were large and pale like daikon, though much gnarlier and bristling with a mess of shaggy tendrils. Before this trip to Florida, while reading an old compendium on plants used by Native Americans, Quave had learned that a decoction of N. lutea\u2019s roots could treat chills and fever, and that a poultice of its leaves could heal inflamed sores.Ethnobotany is a historically small and obscure offshoot of the social sciences, focused on the myriad ways that indigenous peoples use plants for food, shelter, clothing, art and medicine. Within this already-tiny field, a few groups of researchers are now trying to use this knowledge to derive new medicines, and Quave has become a leader among them. Equally adept with a pipette and a trowel, she unites the collective insights of traditional plant-based healing with the rigor of modern laboratory experiments. Over the past five years, Quave has gathered hundreds of therapeutic shrubs, weeds and herbs and taken them back to Emory for a thorough chemical analysis.Between the 1940s and 1960s, the golden age of antibiotic discovery, researchers and pharmaceutical companies harvested such molecules from soil microbes and chemically tweaked them into dozens of new commercial drugs. Some antibiotics, most famously penicillin, came from fungi, but soil bacteria were so abundant and so easy to collect that they remained the center of attention. Researchers soon discovered, though, that only about 1 percent of all bacterial species could be grown in sterile laboratory conditions. By the 1970s, scientists had squeezed almost every potential drug out of this small circle of amenable microbes. In subsequent decades, many large pharmaceutical companies turned away from nature as a source of antibiotics, diverting resources to the promising new field of synthetic drug development.Only a handful of truly novel antibiotics have made it to market since 1980. In the past two decades, Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb and other big-name drug companies have downsized or closed their antibiotic-research programs. The pharmaceutical industry lost interest not only because of the disappointment of synthetic chemistry as an engine for discovery but also because antibiotics are simply less profitable than drugs for more persistent conditions like cancer, depression and high cholesterol. Meanwhile, the world indulged in the existing array of antibiotics in such a reckless fashion that it\u2019s hard to know where to place blame. Physicians are just as guilty of overprescribing antibiotics \u2014 even to mollify hypochondriacs \u2014 as patients are of demanding the drugs too often. Farmers grew accustomed to overmedicating livestock because a steady supply of antibiotics supposedly pre-empted infection and encouraged vigorous growth.All those antibiotics were not simply treating isolated people and animals; they were transforming our shared ecosystems. Antibiotics fundamentally alter the invisible microbial landscapes in us, on us and all around us. Although antibiotics are designed to be as lethal as possible to dangerous bacteria, there are often a few inherently resilient microbes that survive and proliferate, passing on their genes \u2014 and grit \u2014 to their offspring. As subsequent generations of these microbial gladiators endure further onslaughts of drugs, they evolve even greater resilience, improving their defenses against antibiotics and sometimes spreading these adaptations throughout the microbial universe through the promiscuous exchange of DNA. By flooding our bodies, farms and hospitals with inordinate amounts of antibiotics \u2014 obliterating the weak and sparing the strong \u2014 we created exactly the kind of ruthless ecological arena most likely to drive the evolution of resistance.With the world\u2019s cabinet of useful antibiotics almost empty, scientists are rushing to discover replacements in a diverse set of natural resources. Some researchers are trying to mine the untapped potential of those noncooperative soil bacteria, devising new kinds of growth chambers that might allow unstudied species to thrive in the lab. Others are genetically engineering microbes to produce little-known compounds that could be useful for making drugs. Still others are scavenging the native antibiotics in ocean life, fungi and insects. \u201cWe\u2019re at the end of the current era of antibiotics, and it\u2019s getting really scary,\u201d says Kendra Rumbaugh, a microbiologist at Texas Tech University who specializes in wound infections. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten all of the low-hanging fruit, and we\u2019re going to have to work a lot harder. We have to go to the ends of the earth \u2014 the ocean, the ice shelf, the rain forest \u2014 anywhere we possibly can to find new natural products.\u201dNo single strategy is likely to be sufficient, but ethnobotany offers a few distinct advantages. Instead of relying on random screenings of living creatures \u2014 an arbitrary scoop of soil or seawater \u2014 it is the only strategy that benefits from a pre-made guide to some of nature\u2019s most potent drugs, honed by thousands of years of trial and error in traditional medicine. And as far as organic drug factories go, it\u2019s difficult to beat the complexity and ingenuity of plants. Plants are nature\u2019s chemical wizards. If a plant finds itself in an unfavorable situation \u2014 feasted on by pests, ignored by pollinators \u2014 it cannot kick up its roots and relocate. Instead, plants regulate the chemistry of their environment, perpetually suffusing the ground, air and their own tissues with molecular cocktails and bouquets intended to increase their chances of survival and reproduction.The story of the malaria drug artemisinin is one of the most compelling testaments to the antimicrobial power of plants. In 1967, Mao Zedong initiated a secret military project to discover new treatments for malaria, which is caused by mosquito-borne microorganisms known as Plasmodia. The Vietnam War was raging, and China\u2019s allies in North Vietnam were losing soldiers to the disease. These outbreaks were made worse by the fact that Plasmodia had developed resistance to chloroquine and other antimalarial drugs then in use.As a toddler, she got around on a tricycle and a makeshift scooter \u2014 a carpeted board with wheels \u2014 until receiving her first prosthetic leg and foot, which she continually upgraded as she grew. Her disability never prevented her from exploring the outdoors with her sister and friends: They would climb trees, ride horses, chase goats and come back home covered in fire ant bites and mud and cow dung, so filthy they had to be hosed down. One time, Quave tried to drive her four-wheeler up a steep pile of dirt, rolling off and burning the back of her knee on the motor. Terrified of her mother\u2019s ire, she kept the injury a secret, soothing herself with the cool, slimy pulp of a backyard aloe plant.At school, Quave loved the sciences, and by the time she got to Emory for college, she was determined to be a surgeon. \u201cI had been around medicine so much,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to emulate the doctors who had treated me.\u201d So she proceeded on the pre-med track as a double major in biology and anthropology. In the spring of her junior year, to fill some vacant space in her schedule, she took a class on tropical ecology, which introduced her to ethnobotany.Botanical medicine, Quave learned, not only predates civilization \u2014 it is older than humanity itself. Many animals appear to self-medicate with plants: In Panama, members of the raccoon family known as coatis rub minty tree resin through their fur to deter fleas, ticks and lice, and some great apes and monkeys swallow mildly toxic leaves seemingly to fight infestations of parasitic worms. Our earliest human ancestors continued such traditions, and until relatively recently, plants were our primary source of medicine. A Sumerian cuneiform tablet dating to circa 3,000 B.C. lists 15 prescriptions, many of which are made from plants \u2014 myrtle, thyme, willow \u2014 mixed with honey, beer or wine. The Aztecs searched far-off lands for new medicinal plants, returning with their roots carefully cocooned in balls of dirt. Between 50 and 70 A.D., while traveling with Emperor Nero\u2019s armies, the Greek surgeon Dioscorides learned how to make balms, elixirs and anesthetics from about 600 plants, like peppermint, hemlock and cannabis. He published his findings in a pharmacopoeia eventually known as \u201cDe Materia Medica,\u201d a standard reference for the next 1,500 years.Although ethnobotany and the longstanding co-evolution with plants that preceded it have provided us with some of our most essential medicines, their purified and generic final forms are so divorced from their origins that most of us are oblivious to this immense botanical debt. Aspirin is based on a compound found in the perennial herb meadowsweet; pseudoephedrine was inspired by the use of the dryland shrub Ephedra sinica in traditional Chinese medicine; morphine, codeine, thebaine and other opiates are still made from poppies; and many anticancer drugs come from plants, like vincristine and vinblastine, both extracted from the Madagascar periwinkle. As of 2003, at least 25 percent of modern medicines were derived from plants, yet only a tiny fraction of the estimated more than 50,000 medicinal plants used around the globe have been studied in the lab.Don Antonio knew another way to dispel the parasites, using a natural remedy ubiquitous in the Amazon. He cut into the bark from one of the numerous fig trees growing in and around the villages, and a milky emulsion seeped out. Ingesting too much could cause severe cramping, but at the right dose it was highly effective. Don Antonio had learned this remedy from his family, who had trained him in plant-based healing from the age of 7. Since the introduction of pharmacies selling Western pills, however, much of traditional medicine had fallen into disrepute. Don Antonio was a healer by training, but history had reduced him to an entertainer in practice. The research station employed him to give talks to visiting scientists and tourists and to maintain a garden of medicinal plants that rarely grew into anything more than ornaments.\u201cThat trip caused a shift in my worldview and in how I thought about medicine,\u201d Quave told me. Even in the jungle, the dominance of modern Western medicine was overwriting vast stores of knowledge about powerful tonics hidden in surrounding ecosystems. \u201cThere\u2019s chemical warfare around all of us all the time \u2014 in plants. When you\u2019re really embedded in nature, you can see that.\u201dQuave\u2019s trip to the Amazon was so inspiring that upon graduating from Emory, she turned down her acceptances to medical school and pursued ethnobotany instead. After working as an ethnobotanical research assistant in Ginestra, a tiny village in southern Italy; earning a Ph.D. in biology at Florida International University in 2008; and completing postdoctoral fellowships, Quave landed her current job as a medical ethnobotanist and assistant professor of dermatology at Emory in 2013. She has conducted most of her fieldwork with traditional healers in rural regions of Italy, Sicily, Albania and Kosovo. Quave has learned, for example, that leaving a bottle of olive oil and St. John\u2019s wort to steep in the sun produces a scarlet solution that heals burn wounds, that immature green walnut can treat fungal infections and that the evergreen shrub Daphne gnidium can stop bleeding and rid dogs of fleas.Around the globe, as people continue to abandon the countryside for urban areas, such botanical cures are increasingly forgotten or dismissed as old wives\u2019 tales \u2014 and certainly some of them are. But to dismiss all of them, Quave thinks, would be a terrible oversight. \u201cWe\u2019re showing it isn\u2019t witchcraft or voodoo medicine,\u201d she says. \u201cIt actually has some biological function.\u201d In southern Italy, Quave discovered that healers use elmleaf blackberry to treat boils and abscesses. She gathered a few bags of blackberry roots, sliced and dried the samples, vacuum-sealed them in plastic bags and shipped them back to her lab in Atlanta, where her colleagues ground them to a powder in a mill and extracted organic molecules using various solvents. When they added different combinations of blackberry molecules to brothy wells of MRSA \u2014 a particularly antibiotic-resistant species of Staphylococcus bacteria \u2014 the botanical extracts did not kill the microbes as typical antibiotics do. Rather, they prevented the bacteria from forming slimy, intractable mats called biofilms, which allow them to adhere to living tissues and medical devices like catheters in hospitals.And that, Quave says, is exactly the kind of antibiotic that can foil the evolution of resistance. A few lone bacteria drifting about are not particularly worrisome. It\u2019s when pathogenic microbes team up that they become a greater threat. Bacteria rely on a form of chemical communication known as quorum-sensing: When they form a critical mass, they start churning out toxins, exchanging genes for antibiotic resistance and protecting themselves with a thick shell of sugar molecules that are impermeable to many drugs. But if an antibiotic could disrupt bacteria\u2019s ability to collaborate, instead of killing them outright, it could render them more vulnerable and \u201csidestep resistance,\u201d as Quave puts it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a magician\u2019s trick. You\u2019re distracting the bacteria, saying, \u2018Look over here!\u2019 Meanwhile your own immune system can clear away the microbes.\u201d Because such an antibiotic would not be directly responsible for the microbes\u2019 death, there would be much weaker evolutionary pressure to develop resistance against it. \u201cEver since Fleming discovered penicillin, we\u2019ve been in the mind-set that we need to kill microbes,\u201d Quave says. \u201cWhat we need to do is find a balance.\u201dRecently, Quave and her research team have discovered that an extract of Brazilian peppertree berries \u2014 an invasive species common in many warmer parts of the United States \u2014 prevents MRSA from forming skin lesions in mice and shrinks biofilms formed by the bacteria. \u201cI really believe these kind of inhibitors are a major part of the solution to antibiotic resistance,\u201d Quave says. \u201cWe can shut down bacteria\u2019s most dangerous machinery without killing them.\u201d She envisions using such drugs as prophylactics in surgeries with a high infection risk, or in combination with other antimicrobials if a serious infection is already established.Given such promise and the desperate need for new antibiotics, you might think that the path from lab to pharmacy would be expedient. It is anything but. In many cases, plant-based remedies work best as complex mixtures of many distinct molecules, as opposed to a highly refined one-\u2009or two-molecule extract. In the past decade, the Food and Drug Administration has approved just two commercial botanical drugs: Veregen, a medley of green-tea-leaf compounds used to treat genital warts, and Fulyzaq, an antidiarrheal derivative of tree resin with so many molecular constituents that some remain unidentified. Despite these successes, there is continued opposition in the pharmaceutical industry to developing complex botanicals because they are perceived as too messy and too difficult to evaluate and standardize for mass production. University scientists often rely on drug companies to fund the costly and time-consuming clinical trials required for approval from the F.D.A., and major pharmaceutical companies have little interest in antibiotics. If a candidate antibiotic is some motley herbal treatment \u2014 if it has the whiff of mumbo-jumbo folklore \u2014 the opposition is stronger still.But above all else, the apathy of the pharmaceutical industry remains the biggest immediate roadblock. \u201cThe odds are sometimes disheartening,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut this is my field, and I\u2019m not going to abandon ship because today the market is not supporting antibiotic research. In the near future they\u2019ll have to. Western medicine will stop without antibiotics.\u201dIf Quave is right, the impending medical crisis will eventually jump-start antibiotic research and development. But it can take more than a decade for a standard antibiotic to transition from discovery to pharmacy, let alone an entirely novel concoction or seemingly convoluted treatment. Meanwhile, we will be stuck with a dwindling stock of extant antibiotics, our only recourse against increasingly armored pathogens.In the early evening of our penultimate day in Florida, while driving along the edge of an orchard, with the scent of orange blossoms wafting through the car\u2019s open windows and the lime-green sparks of fireflies blinking around us, Quave suddenly cried out to stop the car. She flung open the door, rushed forward and stooped to inspect a small rosette of dandelionlike leaves surrounding a few stalks furred with teensy maroon flowers. Most people would have regarded the three-inch-tall plant as a completely unremarkable weed, if they noticed it at all. Quave was rapt.During her two-week expedition in the marshes, wetlands and forests of Florida, Quave had already collected close to 175 species \u2014 primrose willow, carnivorous sundew, toothache grass, gallberry, black nightshade \u2014 but she could not pass this one up. \u201cThis is Plantago!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s known for applications for skin infections.\u201d One species of the plant, she later explained, can stop a bleeding wound; another can heal abscesses. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to dig up,\u201d she continued, turning back to the car. \u201cLet\u2019s get some bags. Grab as much as you can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.U. Rules Look to Unify Digital Market, but U.S. Sees Protectionism", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle may have to pay publishers for their content. Facebook might, too. WhatsApp could have to follow tougher telecom standards.A new set of rules, expected to be unveiled by European Union officials on Wednesday, is likely to put new pressure on American tech companies.Europe calls it consumer protection. Silicon Valley calls it protectionism.In some ways, they are both right.The aim? To give the bloc\u2019s roughly 500 million consumers unfettered access to services like movie streaming, online shopping and cloud computing, no matter where they live. At the same time, the proposals would force some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies to comply with stringent competition, privacy and copyright rules.For many executives from American tech companies, such plans, which will still take years to come into effect and which will be subject to intense lobbying, feel like another round of protectionism. And while Europe\u2019s policy makers balk at these claims, the fact that Google, Facebook and Microsoft, among others, will be the most affected by the digital revamp has again highlighted how much Europeans rely on American tech when using digital services in their daily lives.The plans to be announced by the Brussels-based European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, include:The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u25a0 Providing financial incentives to telecom operators like Deutsche Telekom and Orange to invest in the region\u2019s mobile and broadband networks. Operators may be given greater control over their internet infrastructure, potentially restricting competitors\u2019 use of these networks. Companies say such limits are needed to guarantee a return on the billions of dollars of digital investment. Consumer groups argue that it may lead to higher prices.Europe\u2019s proposals, which could still be subject to last-minute changes before being published, were confirmed by six people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the reforms had not yet been made public.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact of life that most innovative companies come from the West Coast,\u201d said Andrej Savin, an internet governance professor at the Copenhagen Business School. \u201cThe proposals coming from Brussels definitely have the American companies in mind.\u201dWith a roughly 90 percent market share, Google\u2019s search engine in Europe is more dominant than it is in the United States, where Microsoft\u2019s Bing service still holds its own. Facebook has more European users than American ones, while Germany and Britain remain two of Amazon\u2019s largest international markets.The latest digital reforms \u2014 either on purpose or by coincidence, depending on people\u2019s viewpoints \u2014 take aim at that dominance, and potentially give European publishers and telecom companies a helping hand to compete head-on with their American rivals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yum Brands in China Adds Owners With Skill and Connections", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsYum Brands has added some spice at a price. The company, which owns KFC and Pizza Hut, is selling part of its China business to Alibaba\u2019s mobile-payments affiliate and a private-equity firm run by Fred Hu, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs China. They bring valuable technology skill and connections. It is a better deal than usual for so-called cornerstone investors, but may pay off for Yum\u2019s coming spinoff.Mr. Hu\u2019s Primavera Capital and Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Financial, which operates Alipay, are investing $410 million and $50 million in Yum China. In return, they will together receive 4.3 percent to 5.9 percent of the company. That implies a wide valuation of $8.5 billion to $11.6 billion for the enterprise. Their final stakes will depend on where Yum China\u2019s shares trade when they are listed separately, a flotation planned for next month.However things shake out, the new owners will buy in at an 8 percent discount to other shareholders. Standard anchor investors usually come in at a fixed value rather than a floating one linked to the market price. To secure brand names like Mr. Ma and Mr. Hu, after losing other potential backers, Yum was a little more flexible, throwing in warrants for more shares, too.Ant\u2019s e-commerce knowledge could help Yum compete in a market where consumers increasingly make transactions on phones. The two companies already are talking about collaborating, with Ant touting its big data capabilities and ways to shorten lines at KFC.Yum also secured other beneficial restrictions.

{"Headline": "Venture Communism: How China Is Building a Start-Up Boom", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "Supported byHANGZHOU, China \u2014 In Dream Town, a collection of boxy office buildings on the gritty edge of this historic city, one tiny company is developing a portable 3-D printer. Another takes orders for traditional Chinese massages by smartphone. They are just two of the 710 start-ups being nurtured here.Anywhere else, an incubator like Dream Town would be a vision of venture capitalists, angel investors or technology stalwarts. But this is China. The Chinese Communist Party doesn\u2019t trust the invisible hand of capitalism alone to encourage entrepreneurship, especially since it is a big part of the leadership\u2019s strategy to reshape the sagging economy.Which is why the government of Hangzhou \u2014 a former royal capital that has been a major commercial hub for more than a millennium \u2014 built Dream Town and lavishes resources on start-ups. The businesses here get a slate of benefits like subsidized rent, cash handouts and special training, all courtesy of the city.Chemayi, which offers car repair services through a smartphone app, is staying rent-free at Dream Town for three years and is applying for as much as $450,000 in subsidies from city authorities to help pay salaries and buy equipment.\u201cFrom the central government all the way down to local governments, we have seen a lot of warm support,\u201d said Li Liheng, co-founder and chief executive of Chemayi.For much of China\u2019s long economic boom, young people flocked to manufacturing zones for jobs making bluejeans or iPhones. But today China is trying to move beyond just being the world\u2019s factory floor. Policy makers want the next generation to find better-paying work in modern offices, creating the ideas, technologies and jobs to feed the country\u2019s future growth.Premier Li Keqiang frequently calls for \u201cmass entrepreneurship.\u201d In March at the National People\u2019s Congress, he bragged that 12,000 new companies were founded each day in 2015.The entrepreneurial embrace comes with lots of financial support. Across the country, officials are creating investment funds, providing cash subsidies and building incubators.\u201cWithout these kinds of subsidies, you only rely on private money, and you wouldn\u2019t see so many technology start-ups happening today,\u201d said Ning Tao, a partner at Innovation Works, a venture capital fund in Beijing. \u201cWithout quantity, you cannot have quality.\u201dBut the heavy spending is adding to worries about an inflating bubble in the world of China\u2019s tiniest companies. Along with the government funds, venture capital money is flooding the country. About $49 billion in deals were made last year, making China second only to the United States, according to the accounting firm Ernst & Young.Some economists and entrepreneurs are concerned that the government is helping fuel a frenzy that might ultimately result in failed businesses, wasted resources and financial losses. Just one city, Suzhou, near Shanghai, has announced it will open 300 incubators by 2020 to house 30,000 start-ups.Beijing\u2019s policy makers have a long history of giving favored companies easy access to loans and subsidies to propel certain industries, with both good and bad consequences. Though that tactic lubricated the nation\u2019s industrialization, it also contributed to the excess that has buried the country in empty apartment blocks, mothballed cement plants and sputtering steel mills \u2014 all of which threaten the economy\u2019s stability.\u201cI think the subsidies shouldn\u2019t be a long-term policy,\u201d Jin Xiangrong, an economist at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, said of the start-up support programs. \u201cThey can lead to overcapacity like the kind we see now in China\u2019s manufacturing sector, which is largely a result of government support.\u201dHangzhou city officials turned down requests for interviews.At Dream Town, Mr. Li, 39, frets more about his own business. He got the initial idea for Chemayi in 2009 after a car accident. To find a trustworthy mechanic, he searched online, asked friends for advice and visited repair shops.But Mr. Li found it difficult to judge who was reliable. A car culture \u2014 and all the services that come with it \u2014 is relatively new in China.Aiming to fill the information void, he and three friends set up Chemayi in 2013 with 5 million renminbi (currently $750,000) of their own money. For an annual fee, Chemayi sends out staff members to help fix flat tires, paint scratches or repair broken-down engines.\u201cHenry Ford is gone for so many years, but we are still driving his cars,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cI felt that I also must pursue a cause that will persist after I\u2019m gone.\u201dChemayi beat out more than two dozen other start-ups for a coveted space in Dream Town in a 2014 competition. Another co-founder, Ouyang Feng, delivered a 40-minute presentation to a panel of judges who peppered him with questions about Chemayi\u2019s business model and future prospects. The provincial governor watched over the grilling.In the end, the committee awarded Chemayi a three-foot golden key that symbolically opened the doors to Dream Town.Chemayi now has 284 employees in four cities, with plans to reach 1,000 by the end of the year. Mr. Li said his company had raised $22 million in private money and turned a profit of about 10 million renminbi last year.\u201cA lot of Chinese people want to be successful. They want to initiate change through innovation,\u201d Mr. Li said in his spacious corner office, while fussing with a traditional Chinese wooden tea-making set. \u201cThat is a formidable power.\u201dHangzhou is a natural center for China\u2019s start-up fever. After China embraced capitalist reform in the 1980s, Zhejiang province, of which Hangzhou is the capital, emerged as a leading base for the export industries that fueled the country\u2019s rapid growth. Factories pumped out products like socks and plastic Christmas trees.Now that zeal for commerce is being channeled into technology start-ups. Hangzhou is home to China\u2019s most famous internet company, the e-commerce giant Alibaba, which has become a training ground for would-be entrepreneurs.The neighborhoods near Alibaba\u2019s sprawling campus, once a poorly developed area on the city\u2019s outskirts, now make up a budding tech center with newly built office parks like Dream Town, dominated by ambitious college graduates, angel investors and venture capitalists. The local restaurants have become hangouts to exchange ideas and gossip over fried squid and stewed pork and eggs.Feng Xiao is typical of this new breed. Mr. Feng, 39 and a Hangzhou native, spent 11 years at Alibaba, mainly in sales and marketing.\u201cThere is a Chinese proverb, \u2018The soil is too rich,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feng said. Alibaba \u201coffered you a lot of opportunities. It was easy to have a sense of success. But I wanted to be able to start from scratch.\u201dHis start-up was born in Alibaba\u2019s cafeteria, where he ate meal after meal. \u201cI really missed Mom\u2019s cooking,\u201d he said. He figured that many other people, trapped working for long hours far from home, felt the same.Mr. Feng and two other Alibaba employees left their jobs in 2014 and opened a food delivery service, Mishi. Their plan was to connect people willing to prepare homemade meals with on-the-go professionals who were too busy to cook. They set up shop in a friend\u2019s empty house, decorated with secondhand furniture and photos from home.Along with raising $19 million from private investors, Mishi caught the eye of the Hangzhou city government. In 2014, district officials awarded Mishi 5 million renminbi to help pay the bills. Its rent in a Hangzhou office park is also subsidized.\u201cThe most important thing on the part of the government is whether they are open\u201d to new types of businesses, Mr. Feng said. \u201cWe are glad to see they are aggressively supporting us.\u201dHangzhou represents what Chinese leaders see as the nation\u2019s economic future. The country used to generate astronomical growth rates by depending heavily on low-cost exports and extremely high investment in apartment towers, factories and highways. China built so many steel mills that it can produce 10 times as much steel as the United States.But today, costs are rising, eating away at the competitiveness of many export industries. The long investment boom has saddled the economy with too many factories and a mountain of debt.Instead, policy makers are encouraging a shift to new growth engines, like services and high tech. The entrepreneurial focus is providing an economic boost for Hangzhou.The city\u2019s gross domestic product rose 10.2 percent in 2015, compared with the 6.9 percent national growth rate. Hangzhou\u2019s service sector, which includes many start-ups, was the main engine of that strong performance, surging 14.6 percent.\u201cThe Chinese know that state-owned enterprises are not going to employ everybody,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at GGV Capital, a venture capital firm that operates in both Silicon Valley and China. \u201cThey need young people to create jobs for themselves, so they are encouraging them to try something new.\u201dMishi, the food delivery start-up, has created 100 full-time jobs, and has bolstered the incomes of more than 10,000 home chefs.Cai Liangen, a retired businessman turned Mishi cook, learned about the start-up when a marketing team visited his apartment complex seeking to enlist new chefs.Last November, he and his wife began making local specialties in their kitchen, including a sliced pork dish prepared with \u201cmy mother\u2019s secret recipe,\u201d Mr. Cai said. They now receive 40 orders a day and earn 5,000 renminbi a month, increasing their total income 70 percent.\u201cWe do it because we love to cook,\u201d Mr. Cai said, \u201cbut the money is good to have, too.\u201dAfter submitting a 10-page proposal in 2014 to join a Hangzhou incubator, Ai Binke sat nervously before a committee of tech industry executives who questioned his future prospects. His software company, Yun Ran Internet of Things, had only four employees, and its business deals had been small. But his start-up, Mr. Ai explained to the committee, had great potential.That was sufficient for the judges to award him 100,000 renminbi in subsidies. The bulk, roughly 70 percent, was instantly transferred into his corporate bank account. \u201cAs long as you run projects that are encouraged by the Hangzhou government, you can get the subsidies,\u201d said Mr. Ai, 29. \u201cIt\u2019s not very difficult.\u201dLocal governments around China are spending heavily on start-ups. In Shenzhen, authorities are offering to subsidize up to 70 percent of rent for \u201ccreative\u201d start-ups. Local officials in the southwestern metropolis of Chengdu are setting up a 200 million renminbi \u201centrepreneurship and innovation development fund\u201d and promising subsidies of up to 5 million renminbi.Officials in Guangdong province in China\u2019s south will cover part of a start-up\u2019s losses. Even the lesser-known city of Yingtan, in an area of Jiangxi province mainly known for its ancient Taoist temples, is planning to build an incubator.Hangzhou\u2019s government has been one of the more active. Officials are forming a venture capital fund of 4.7 billion renminbi , with contributions from companies, according to the city\u2019s website. This year, Hangzhou announced that it would give 100 million renminbi annually to help start-ups pay expenses.But governments historically have a spotty record of using state-directed money to generate business success stories.In China, government efforts to assist new businesses have often led to waste and excess. Too much investment pours into favored industries, spawning poorly conceived projects in areas like hotels and solar panels. By trying to spur start-ups, the state is also engaging in a high-risk business that even for the most experienced venture capitalist is prone to produce more failures than successes.Hangzhou officials are trying to avoid such pitfalls. At Dream Town, the financial aid is often linked to a start-up\u2019s performance. The amount of free rent depends on how much private capital a company can raise. Cash handouts are tied to revenue targets or top-selling apps.Government officials also enlist professionals to help allocate the city\u2019s money. The committee that judges applicants to Dream Town is usually made up of tech executives, financiers and academics.Ye Feng, a manager at another incubator who has sat as a judge on three occasions, said she quizzed the contenders on their technology, business plan and even product pricing.Usually about 30 start-ups appear at each competition. No more than four make the cut to enter Dream Town. \u201cThe competition is quite fierce,\u201d Ms. Ye said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to make a decision.\u201dBut some in Hangzhou fear that the government is doling out too much money, and it is flowing to start-ups with weak business plans and feeble prospects. Mr. Ai of Yun Ran said that two neighbors also received city subsidies. One, a robotics start-up, failed to attract private capital and closed, while the other, a mobile game company, is struggling to stay afloat as its business withers.The government money, Mr. Ai said, often cannot replace the private capital necessary for start-ups. \u201cWithout financing, it would be very hard for them to survive,\u201d he said.Owen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}

He handed her a small folded piece of paper and waited as Ms. Parker read it. \u201cAw,\u201d she said, and smiled. \u201cThank you! Thank you, Michael!\u201dIn spite of Ms. Parker\u2019s age (51), her 19 years of marriage to Matthew Broderick, and her three children, her public image remains closely bound up with that of Carrie, a symbol of youthful possibility, forever available, forever adorable.\u201cI\u2019m still getting to know her,\u201d Ms. Parker said. She was quick to clarify that she is no more Frances than she ever was Carrie (she and Mr. Broderick married about a week before she shot the pilot). But \u201cDivorce,\u201d at turns moody and comic, does cover material that is meaningful to Ms. Parker, who is an executive producer of the series. For some years, she has wanted to do a show about long-term relationships, a natural outgrowth, she said, of countless conversations she has had with friends who, like her, are in early middle age, a time when it\u2019s common for people to grapple with the choices they have made, in relationships as much as anything else. The show reflects, she said, a \u201ccertain introspection and reckoning\u201d that is inevitable after some 15 or 20 years of marriage.\u201cIt\u2019s a really specific point in a person\u2019s life, right now, for my generation,\u201d said Ms. Parker. \u201cIt\u2019s when you start to think about relationships, the time spent, what came of it \u2014 and what do you do with where you find yourself now?\u201dMs. Parker spent much of her energy in recent years leveraging her brand in the service of high culture (she is vice chair of the New York City Ballet) and her own businesses \u2014 a fragrance line and the SJP shoe collection, which she introduced in 2014 and is carried by high-end department stores. All along, she developed television and film ideas as a producer, including, for some time, a show called \u201cInto the Fire,\u201d which HBO passed on. It featured a talk-show host who quits her job, blows up her career and has an affair with the father of one of her children\u2019s classmates.In some of its details, \u201cInto the Fire\u201d sounds like \u201cGirlfriends\u2019 Guide to Divorce,\u201d which has been renewed for a third season on Bravo, one of a number of television shows in recent years that have featured women in their late 40s or early 50s reinventing their love lives: On \u201cNashville,\u201d Rayna, played by Connie Britton, ends her marriage and enjoys a succession of suitors; on \u201cThe Affair,\u201d Helen (Maura Tierney) is betrayed by her cheating husband but goes on to have flings of her own. \u201cI want to save my life while I still care about it,\u201d Frances tells Robert, trying to explain why she wants a divorce; it\u2019s as if some sense of imminently fading possibility propels Frances into new romance.The bar was \u201cquite high\u201d for Ms. Parker\u2019s return, said Richard Plepler, HBO\u2019s chief executive, who felt this show reached that standard. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Hollywoodization of divorce,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a very authentic one, something she could sink her teeth into creatively and artistically.\u201d Both Mr. Plepler and Ms. Parker mentioned the influence of \u201cAn Unmarried Woman,\u201d the 1978 Jill Clayburgh film that offered an unflinching look at how a flawed but charming wife handles being unexpectedly single after her husband walks out.Ms. Parker was comfortable with embracing her own character\u2019s flaws, said Paul Simms, the showrunner of \u201cDivorce.\u201d \u201cI was a little surprised and pleased that she was willing to not worry about being necessarily likable,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though she ultimately is quite likable.\u201dThough Ms. Parker spoke of the characters in \u201cDivorce\u201d as middle class, it might be more accurate to say they are upper middle class in appearance, middle class in disposable income; they look like a couple with fancy educations, now tenuously maintaining a gimcrack normalcy post-crash, with the help of revolving credit lines and some just-in-time turns of luck. If Mr. Big, Carrie\u2019s beloved, represented one \u201990s male icon, the finance type, Robert, with his debt and pickup truck, represents a very current countertype, a disempowered white guy baffled to find things are no longer going his way.One morning, she arrived at the clock, perfectly prompt, dressed in Swedish-chic chunky sandals and an oatmeal-colored, 1970s-style sundress (\u201cVintage,\u201d she said, \u201cI probably paid $29 for it.\u201d) As she walked through the terminal, she moved quickly, accustomed to people stopping in their tracks, stupefied, as they recognized her. When someone tried to approach her to talk, she had a warm but effective response at the ready: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I wish I could, thank you so much, I have to catch my train!\u201d She offered a big smile, a girlish wave, direct eye contact, somehow meeting the energy of the fan with enthusiasm of her own. From a distance, to a tourist, she might have seemed a holographic conjuring, an icon of turn-of-millennium New York there to enhance the iconic New York setting.She could not have known then how much cultural currency television would come to have \u2014 or how big a role she herself would play in establishing its ascendancy. With that influence came celebrity and the kind of public scrutiny that stings, especially for a parent; paparazzi and tabloid reporters are often camped outside her family\u2019s Lower Manhattan home. There have also long been tabloid rumors about the demise of her marriage, which might make the choice of a show called \u201cDivorce\u201d seem revealing, as if it were some subconscious confirmation of her preoccupations.That the public might think that, Ms. Parker said, suggests a misunderstanding of what really motivates her as an actor. \u201cWhen people ask about the ways in which I relate to Frances, I usually say, \u2018I look like her, but that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing to ask, because all you want to do as an actor is be someone else.\u201d Why, she added, \u201cwould you ever want to play someone like you?\u201dMs. Parker sounded genuinely bewildered by the persistence of tabloid interest in her marriage. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because we just \u2026 keep staying married,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that annoys them?\u201d Mr. Broderick, she said, is \u201cstill the person I want to experience things with, I want to do new things with.\u201d It may be a sign of the health of their current relationship that neither party feels the need to portray it as any more perfect than most that have weathered three children, two big careers and nearly two decades.Ms. Parker described marriage as a series of choices \u2014 choosing to stay, choosing to find patience in it. \u201cIt\u2019s saying, I\u2019m going to try not to roll my eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s thinking about the delight in something that\u2019s delightful to him, but that may or may not be to you.\u201dAsked what Ms. Parker might enjoy about playing Frances, Mr. Broderick thought for a moment. \u201cShe gets to be pissed off at her husband, which I think would be fun for her,\u201d he deadpanned. But his protectiveness of Ms. Parker, as she prepared for her show\u2019s debut, was evident. \u201cI\u2019m always nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching your child walk onto the playground. You want them to be treated well. And when they\u2019re not, it\u2019s horrible to watch.\u201dMs. Parker seems to relish the gap between the show\u2019s plot and her own reality, the way she can experience the aftershocks of a dissolution from a safe creative distance. \u201cFrances was never single with children, never single with a mortgage \u2014 so I think all that\u2019s going to be really interesting,\u201d she said, already musing about a second season. \u201cHow much does she want to date? How much does she really want to take her clothes off with someone?\u201dMs. Parker slapped her hand against her chest. \u201cCan you imagine? I\u2019d be like \u2014 no, we are just going to be companions. I\u2019d be horrified!\u201dOver lunch, Ms. Parker confessed that she was somewhat terrified about the show\u2019s premiere, partly for fear that her fans might be expecting something the show was not \u2014 that they would judge it not by its own merits, but by how closely it inspired the same giddy pleasures that her previous work has.\u201cThis is not Carrie in the suburbs, Carrie the commuter,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I kind of want to get ahead of that, so that there is not this giant heave of disappointment when people find the show is not \u2026 that same buoyant kind of thing.\u201d\u201cBut it was definitely acting,\u201d she said. \u201cI never lived any of those experiences in my own life. I\u2019m not Carrie. Sometimes I feel that if I\u2019d done my job well with \u2018Divorce,\u2019 it will be a reminder that, yes, she\u2019s an actor. But maybe people will start to think I\u2019m like Frances. And then I\u2019ll have to explain how different Sarah and Frances are.\u201d She brightened at the thought.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the date that the HBO series \u201cDivorce\u201d begins. It is Oct. 9, not Oct. 29.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Challenge to Government Secrecy Wins Dozens of Supporters", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Dozens of allies threw their weight behind Microsoft on Friday in a case that challenges law enforcement\u2019s use of secrecy orders to cloak its pursuit of digital communications in investigations.Amazon, Google, Snapchat, Salesforce and several others filed a brief on Friday in support of Microsoft in its case against the United States Justice Department, while Apple, Mozilla and others made their own filing. Civil liberties groups and media organizations like Fox News, National Public Radio and The Washington Post submitted their own briefs.Microsoft\u2019s effort to rally support is part of a growing resistance by technology companies to government attempts to snoop on the electronic communications of their customers.In a statement, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company was grateful for the support from what it expected to total 80 signatories on multiple briefs by the end of the day. He noted the diversity of backgrounds of the signatories, saying, \u201cit\u2019s not every day that Fox News and the A.C.L.U. are on the same side of an issue.\u201d\u201cWe believe the constitutional rights at stake in this case are of fundamental importance, and people should know when the government accesses their emails unless secrecy is truly needed,\u201d Mr. Smith added.Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department, declined to comment.Microsoft said the secrecy orders violated the Fourth Amendment, which grants people and businesses the right to know if the government seizes or searches their property, along with the company\u2019s First Amendment right to communicate with its customers.Technology companies are concerned that secrecy orders are especially troubling in the era of cloud computing. \u201cIn contrast to a search of a home or a seizure of physical property, there may be no way for a user to detect that the provider has disclosed information stored in the account to the government,\u201d the brief filed by Amazon, Google and others said.The Microsoft lawsuit is different in that it does not center on any individual case, but instead is aimed at the legal process the government uses to keep its information requests secret.The company said such secrecy orders are becoming more frequent. In its lawsuit, Microsoft said of the more than 5,600 federal demands for customer data it received between September 2014 and March 2016, nearly half were accompanied by secrecy orders that prevented Microsoft from telling affected customers that it had turned over their information to the government.Microsoft executives have said they appreciate the necessity of secrecy orders in some cases. But they have criticized as too low the bar that prosecutors must meet to obtain a secrecy order from courts.Microsoft is also concerned about the absence of time limits on when it can disclose to customers that the government has obtained their communications. For physical searches of files and the like, most secrecy orders delay notification for a limited period of time, often one to three months.\u201cLaw enforcement officials have no practical need to keep their searches secret indefinitely, except in the rarest of circumstances, which must be supported by particularized need,\u201d read the brief filed Friday by former United States attorneys supporting Microsoft.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unforgettable Moments", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York Fashion Week: An Oral HistoryANDR\u00c9 LEON TALLEYFashion editorIn the \u201970s, Halston\u2019s show at Olympic Tower was the ticket of the week, conceived in a modernist way that hadn\u2019t been seen before, against a backdrop of glass walls with a view all the way downtown.He seemed to know that it was glamour people wanted. A cashmere floor-length sweater would turn into an evening dress with the addition of an Elsa Peretti snake belt or a beautiful silver harness, a cashmere wrap thrown over one shoulder. The twin sets, the Ultrasuede: It was the language of fashion that permeated the \u201970s, and it had a lasting effect.His shows were a merging of fashion, art, culture and the society of that time. You would see in one row Andy Warhol with his camera, Martha Graham, Lily Auchincloss, Diana Vreeland and Bianca Jagger.But his stable, his family, it was the models, the Halstonettes. They would go out together to the Met Ball, to the clubs, spilling out into New York dressed in appropriately dazzling evening clothes. They would travel as a posse and merge, along with Liza and Andy, on the banquettes at Studio 54.PAT CLEVELANDModelIn the 1970s, we were coming into something new. There were clubs: the Loft, the Circus, the private clubs, all dingy and sexually oriented. One night, Steve Rubell was turned away at one of them. He turned to me and said: \u201cI\u2019m going to get revenge. You\u2019ll see, Pat. Everyone will come to my club.\u201dThen along came this wonderful Studio 54, where you could dress up and be seen. We wore these see-through tulle gold dresses and blinding electric-looking shoes. Our hair was fuzzed and teased. Everybody was looking twinkly, like in a fairy tale. In those days, people could go under the bridge and get inspired by the drag queens. And it was all reflected on the streets and in the shows.SIMON DOONANCreative ambassador at large, Barneys New YorkThe most exuberant show I ever went to was the Lane Bryant show. Freddie Leiba had styled it. In the old days, if you were a large-size woman, you were propelled in the direction of modest, covered-up fashion. But Freddie made the show cheeky and sexy. I was sitting next to Isaac Hayes. He was wearing an amazing embellished caftan. All through the show, he kept up a wonderful rapping commentary in my ear, saying over and over, \u201cMy, these ladies are deliciously endowed.\u201dJULIE GILHARTFashion consultantWhen I was a very young buyer at Neiman Marcus, I remember coming to New York and seeing Stephen Sprouse\u2019s show at the Ritz. Let\u2019s say that was an eye-opener. Coming from Dallas, I was pretty conservative. You can only imagine how impressionable I was. I was seeing Teri Toye, a transgender model, for the first time. I didn\u2019t even know what transgender meant.NIAN FISHCreative director, filmmakerIn the spring of 1994, I was doing the creative consulting and the production for a Calvin Klein fashion show. We were doing model go-sees \u2014 where you have models try on the collection \u2014 and Nadja Auermann walked in, this 6-foot-1 Amazon. Calvin put a quintessential nude-on-nude chiffon tank dress on her. She looked stunning, and her body was totally filling out the dress.Meanwhile, waiting behind a rack in the dressing room was Kate Moss. And Calvin said, \u201cPut the dress on Kate,\u201d and we put the dress on Kate, who was 5-foot-7. The dress fell away from her body. Calvin took one look and said, \u201cPut the flat sandals on her.\u201d And then I said, \u201cTake out the lining.\u201dIn that instant, we went from this Amazonian, athletic, full-bodied movie-star model to this teenage girl with no makeup and stringy hair. And that is how the waif was born.ED FILIPOWSKIPresident of KCDI remember the season of Hurricane Floyd, in September 1999. We did two shows that season. One was Helmut Lang in his store on Greene Street. It might have been his first show in New York. I\u2019ll never forget how calm he was in the eye of this major storm. There was water pouring in through the front door. We had people mopping up the floor, fighting back the water.But people showed up. Everyone did.On the same day, Alexander McQueen was showing at a pier on the West Side Highway. The storm at that point was at its worst. They\u2019d closed all the tents in Bryant Park.Lee was not as calm as Helmut had been. It was such a personal investment for him to be showing in New York. Ironically, his set was all water. It was planned that way: The runway was meant to have this shimmering viscosity. Toward the end of the show, these three-foot spikes mechanically rose out of the water. Suddenly the runway was a bed of nails.At the end of the show, Lee ran out. That was the moment that he infamously dropped his drawers on the runway. He was so happy that the show happened at all.JULIE GILHARTThe Proenza Schouler graduate thesis collection at Parsons in the early 2000s was not an extravaganza, but from that first collection you could see the makings of a quintessential New York fashion house. The designers, Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough, had this uptown-downtown aesthetic. We at Barneys were over budget, but they put on such a good performance during the initial selling appointment that we bought the collection. Unbeknown to us, they had nothing to work with: no material, no production. But they figured it out, delivered the collection on time and we sold it.MARION GREENBERGRetired fashion publicistIn 1985, we did a show in New York for Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. They were about to open a store in Manhattan. We did the show in this amazing building, like a garage, in Long Island City. Jean-Michel Basquiat walked the runway. Just at the end of the show, as everyone was preparing to leave, it started to snow \u2014 a glistening, soft snow. And through it we could just make out the skyline of New York. It was like a fairy tale.SIMON DOONANIt\u2019s impossible to imagine any New York Fashion Week without Marc Jacobs. Of course there were delays, sometimes as much as two or three hours. You felt as if you were in the middle of a Fellini circus. Those shows were so polarizing. People complained. I never complained.ELLIN SALTZMANFormer fashion director Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy\u2019s, Bergdorf GoodmanThe first Marc Jacobs show I ever saw was in the early 1980s, at Charivari [the fashion boutique, now shuttered], where they were selling Marc\u2019s collection. A model came out wearing a sweater with a big smiley face on it. Marc\u2019s grandmother, I think, had knitted the sweater. It was such a happy sweater and such a happy collection. You knew you were seeing a young star.ANDR\u00c9 LEON TALLEYWhen Marc Jacobs introduced his grunge collection that was inspired by Nirvana [for Perry Ellis], I didn\u2019t get it. I thought, \u201cWhat is this mess?\u201d Later I understood that it was an important moment. I don\u2019t know if it sold in the stores, but the collection turned fashion in the direction of something more youthful. It was anti-fashion fashion.PAUL CAVACOFashion editorI loved Marc\u2019s grunge show. I was at Bazaar with Liz Tilberis [Bazaar\u2019s editor in chief] at the time. Anna Sui was showing grunge, too. Because I knew both Marc and Anna, their choice of inspiration didn\u2019t strike me as odd. The inspiration was all thrift, but it was done in a luxurious way. The models wore layers and double hats. Supposedly Marc got fired from Perry Ellis after that show because the collection wasn\u2019t part of the DNA of the house. But to me it was gorgeous and not so far off from what Perry originally stood for. We photographed it right away.BRYANBOYBloggerMy first show in New York was Marc Jacobs, in February 2009. I had no idea how the fashion system worked, no idea what the press system was. I just thought: \u201cO.K. Marc Jacobs invited me to the show. I have to go.\u201dCALVIN KLEINIn one of the earliest shows that I did \u2014 I would imagine it was in 1978 \u2014 people had to walk through the dressing room and, from there, the entire length of the showroom to find their seats. Niki de Gunzburg, who was an editor at Vogue and my mentor, arrived, and Carrie Donovan and Polly Mellen, who at that time was at Harper\u2019s Bazaar. Women\u2019s Wear Daily was there and a slew of other editors. There was always this rivalry among them about who gets which piece first to photograph for their publications.Then suddenly, in the middle of the show, the music stopped. In those days, we had reel-to-reel tapes playing in a different room at the far end of the showroom. That meant I had to pick myself up and walk through the showroom past all the guests to where the tape recorder was. I found the tape all jumbled up. I don\u2019t know what I did, but it started to play again. Everyone started applauding.MICHAEL KORSWe were showing fall 1991 in the middle of a heat wave at the end of April. I thought I was being a renegade putting on my show in a raw loft space. There was no air-conditioning and only one set of elevators. The girls backstage were dripping sweat.I started the show. We were on the fifth outfit, and from backstage I heard an explosion. It sounded like gunfire. Naomi Campbell came running backstage to tell me, \u201cThe ceiling just fell.\u201dI rushed out. Between the heat and the vibrations from this very loud music in that raw space, a big chunk of plaster had come down. It hit Suzy Menkes. It hit Carrie Donovan.

Alva Chinn came out on the runway dancing to disco music. She was wearing some little fur thing and a chamois shirt. Beverly Johnson was in a bright red fur coat. In the middle of the show, all of a sudden, the lights went out and stayed out. All I could think at the time was: \u201cOh, no! This show is fantastic.

The runway was raised. A sheep stumbled and landed in the pit between the runway and the spectators. It landed right next to me. We were wrestling it to the ground. All I could think about was that poor crazed sheep.KELLY CUTRONEFashion publicistWe were working with threeASFOUR. It was the late \u201990s, and they were then AsFour: Adi, Gabi, Kai and Angela.

No, we\u2019re breaking up.\u201dI pulled them together, and I told them: \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. People have responded to their invitations. You\u2019ll have a full house. If you don\u2019t get yourselves together right now, I\u2019m going to stand up at your show with a megaphone and tell everyone how selfish and disturbed you are.\u201dBy the time the show started, the designers were barely speaking.

Again, I yelled, \u201cGo for the designers!\u201d Still nothing.

{"Headline": "JetBlue Makes Biofuels Deal to Curtail Greenhouse Gases", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJetBlue, seeking to get ahead of looming restrictions on airliners\u2019 greenhouse gas pollution, has agreed to buy more than 330 million gallons of renewable fuel over 10 years, the company said on Monday.It is one of the largest such purchase agreements yet.Under the agreement with the bioenergy company SG Preston, JetBlue would cover about 20 percent of its annual fuel use at Kennedy International Airport, its home base, with a biofuel blend. That is equivalent to 4 percent of the fuel used throughout its network, the airline said.\u201cIt\u2019s thinking long term about our biggest cost, but its primary motivation is to reduce our greenhouse gases,\u201d said Sophia Mendelsohn, JetBlue\u2019s head of sustainability. \u201cWhat we really want to do is jump-start the industry and quite frankly enable all airlines, very much ourselves included, to diversify our fuel supply.\u201dBiofuels, made from various sorts of organic matter \u2014 whether from agriculture, wood scraps or even municipal waste \u2014 have long been considered important to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transportation. United States rules for gasoline, for example, require at least 10 percent ethanol, which typically comes from corn.Airlines represent potentially easy-to-serve customers for biofuels, given the carriers\u2019 concentration around airports and their voracious energy needs. But with heavy pressure on the companies\u2019 bottom lines, the advent of more efficient planes and a period of low oil prices, the airlines \u2014 with a few exceptions \u2014 have been slow to adopt the novel and more expensive fuels.\u201cAt the end of the day, the vibe that we\u2019ve heard from the industry is, \u2018We\u2019ll use it once it\u2019s cost-competitive, we\u2019ll use it once there\u2019s enough volume,\u2019\u201d said Yuan-Sheng Yu, who leads alternative fuels research at Lux Research. \u201cThis is not an industry with the amounts of cash on hand to invest in these emerging, nonproven technologies.\u201dBut there are signs that may be changing. Last year, United began using a biofuel blend on some of its flights from Los Angeles. In recent weeks, Lufthansa tentatively agreed to buy as many as eight million gallons of fuel a year over five years from Gevo, a Colorado-based biofuel developer, Gevo announced. And Virgin Atlantic announced a successful test of a jet fuel from LanzaTech derived from waste gases from steel mills.Given the industry\u2019s global reach, devising rules to control greenhouse gas emissions has proved contentious and given rise to a regulatory patchwork that companies say could be costly, lead to safety risks and create disadvantages for airlines from different jurisdictions. An effort by the European Union to require United States planes landing in European airports to reduce emissions or pay a fee, for example, encountered so much resistance that regulators approved a partial exemption that expires next year.In recent months, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the aviation agency of the United Nations, approved one set of standards while the Obama administration began the process of writing its own last year. Environmentalists say the international restrictions, written with strong industry input, are too weak, and are pushing for more stringent standards from the Environmental Protection Agency.At the same time, the aviation industry has been looking to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions though a number of approaches, including building more efficient aircraft and supporting the development and approval of new fuels.That has been challenging, said Sean Newsum, director of environmental strategy at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, which is active around the world in helping to develop and certify biofuels for commercial use. In one of the projects this summer, with South African Airways and its Mango affiliate, 300 passengers flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town on fuel derived from tobacco grown for the purpose.\u201cThere\u2019s many different moving pieces to get this into real commercial use, all the way from the growing of the feedstock to the processing of the fuel to delivering that fuel to the airplane,\u201d Mr. Newsum said. \u201cIt takes a while for all of those processes to become stitched together in a standard way,\u201d he added, and to bring down their costs.A long-term customer agreement like JetBlue\u2019s, energy experts say, is an important step for a developer to attract financing to build a new facility \u2014 much as energy-purchase agreements by companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have allowed for the construction of solar or wind farms to help meet their electricity needs.Mr. LeTang said interest in buying biofuel was growing within the industry. Still, that is no guarantee that a project will pan out.A five-year agreement by British Airways to purchase all of the output from a facility that Solena Fuels planned to build outside London, to convert municipal solid waste to jet fuel, collapsed after Solena failed to raise enough money. It could not compete with cheap oil.At JetBlue, Ms. Mendelsohn said she worked for the better part of a year to bring the deal to fruition. She would not say how much the fuel would cost, but that, with subsidies available for biofuels, it would be competitive with conventional jet fuel.Under the agreement, JetBlue will purchase more than 33 million gallons a year of a fuel made from plant oils for at least 10 years; that fuel will be blended with 70 percent traditional jet fuel. SG Preston plans to build a refinery in Ohio to produce mainly renewable diesel and jet fuel, the first of many it hopes to develop.An article on Tuesday about JetBlue\u2019s deal to buy 330 million gallons of biofuel over 10 years from the bioenergy firm SG Preston referred incorrectly to the company\u2019s chief executive. As the article correctly noted, he is Randy Delbert LeTang, and therefore is not \u201cMr. Preston.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article described incorrectly the activity shown. An airport worker was servicing the water tank of the JetBlue aircraft; he was not refueling it.An article on Sept. 20 about JetBlue\u2019s agreement to buy 300 million gallons of renewable fuel over 10 years misidentified the company that announced a similar deal for the purchase of renewable fuels by Lufthansa, and misstated the status of the deal. It was announced by Gevo, a Colorado-based biofuel developer, not by Lufthansa. And the deal is tentative, not confirmed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Does the Messaging Service Telegram Take Privacy Too Far?", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropePARIS \u2014 The encryption of digital information is considered the best protection against hackers, snoops or potential enemies looking to poke around into private exchanges of all sorts.That is why technology experts and privacy advocates in Europe went on high alert last month when the French Ministry of the Interior suggested that it might limit encryption as part of the fight against terrorist threats.Mr. Cazeneuve named one such service: Telegram, a three-year-old messaging application, that is a favorite of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years.Telegram\u2019s vaunted privacy safeguards, involving multiple servers in different countries, are designed to prevent access to information about its users, even by the service itself.At the news conference, Mr. Cazeneuve admitted as much but claimed that French investigators, armed with a court order, had been unable to even contact \u201can interlocutor\u201d at Telegram.In response to a query on his Telegram account, Pavel Durov, co-founder of the service, batted back the widely reported French claims.\u201cWe haven\u2019t received any such request and have no idea what the French officials are after,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn any case, Telegram Secret Chats and information on them are not logged on our servers.\u201dMr. Durov\u2019s background explains his die-hard libertarian attitude on privacy. He left his native Russia in 2014 after refusing to give intelligence information about Ukrainian protesters.However, most privacy advocates agree that messaging services should cooperate with court-issued warrants, even if they are unable to provide investigators with complete information about their users.\u201cThere is an issue with Telegram,\u201d said Mounir Mahjoubi, president of the National Digital Council, an independent advisory group established by former President Nicolas Sarkozy that focuses on privacy issues. \u201cThey had done everything to make it a technological nightmare to find where their server is.\u201dAt a time of heightened public anxiety over terrorism, technology companies and privacy advocates are wary about politicians looking to mandate \u201cback door\u201d access to encrypted data.This, they say, would not only violate privacy rights but put the wider public at an even greater risk, leaving users even more vulnerable to terrorists and other criminals.Mr. Mahjoubi, for one, supports alternative approaches, such as an international network that could call on judges in individual countries to swiftly react to requests from antiterrorism investigators.These ideas also are also backed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a lobbying organization that counts Amazon, Google and Microsoft among its members.\u201cCyberspace blurs the notion of national jurisdictions, and companies are caught in the middle,\u201d said Christian Borggreen, the organization\u2019s Europe director. \u201cThe tech industry encourages like-minded nations to develop international frameworks for quicker response to law enforcement requests while respecting users\u2019 right and the rule of law.\u201dThat kind of targeted approach \u2014 aimed at criminals, not at privacy \u2014 would be more effective than a blank check for law enforcement to break open encoded messages, Mr. Mahjoubi said.\u201cI am deeply and heartily against any effort to limit encryption,\u201d he said, \u201cand I will fight my whole life against that possibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Fleabag,\u2019 Biting, Bitter and Pushing Boundaries", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not the events of \u201cFleabag\u201d that distinguish it. (The title is the nickname of the main character, who otherwise remains nameless.) Ms. Waller-Bridge, who writes the show and plays Fleabag, may push the boundaries on sex \u2014 those who have a problem with anal intercourse as a comic device are advised to be on guard \u2014 and on her character\u2019s propensity for self-centered, self-destructive behavior.In dramatic terms, though, the show, which ran on BBC3 this summer, doesn\u2019t break new ground. Over six episodes, Fleabag, the proprietor of a failing cafe, applies for a business loan, clashes with her politely hideous stepmother (a hilarious Olivia Colman), does a love-hate dance with her seemingly more put-together older sister (Sian Clifford, who\u2019s dour perfection), and juggles a buffoonish boyfriend and a good-looking, sexually eager hookup. Throughout the season, she has flash memories of a tragedy, mysterious but easy enough to figure out, involving a former friend and business partner.What sets the show apart isn\u2019t the surface quality of its humor but its restless, almost feral energy and its slap-in-the-face attitude. Ms. Waller-Bridge knows how to combine naked confessionalism and comic artifice, and it allows her to tap veins of honest emotion \u2014 anger, fear and particularly deep sadness \u2014 rarely felt in half-hour comedies. She\u2019s not averse to having Fleabag walk into conventional, potentially sentimental situations, like a possible reconciliation with her disappointed father (Bill Paterson) or a sudden reversal of fortune with a man she was counting on. But they play out in abrupt, uncomfortable ways that reflect the confusion and desperation that coexist with Fleabag\u2019s headstrong independence.Not all of Ms. Waller-Bridge\u2019s ideas work. She accentuates Fleabag\u2019s self-consciousness and theatricality by not just talking into the camera, but silently looking into it on a regular basis, arching her brows or throwing a look of incomprehension at the ceaseless irritation other humans cause her. At first it\u2019s cute, but it loses its effect, becoming a kind of silent laugh track. And the running thread involving the former friend is a drag \u2014 you see how it works thematically, emphasizing the harm women can do to other women, but it\u2019s the one part of the show that feels forced.They\u2019re small quibbles, though, given the sharpness of Ms. Waller-Bridge\u2019s writing and the quality of the cast. Ms. Colman and Mr. Paterson are at the top rank of British character actors, and Ms. Colman is especially good here as an artist who, through manipulation, arrogance and actual talent, has negotiated life in a way that Fleabag despises and wishes, helplessly, that she could emulate. Ms. Clifford, a stage actress who hasn\u2019t done much TV, is utterly believable as the older sister whose business success and good looks make her an object of jealousy but don\u2019t, in the final analysis, protect her.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Is Said to Be Discussing a Possible Takeover", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter has long positioned itself as a global town square where anyone \u2014 celebrities, politicians, athletes, and you and me \u2014 can chat in 140-character messages and find out about whatever is happening in the moment.But with that premise not drawing enough new people to the social media service, Twitter is now rethinking whether it can survive as an independent company and is exploring several strategic options.Twitter, based in San Francisco, is talking with Salesforce.com, Google and others about a possible takeover of the company, people briefed on the discussions said on Friday. The talks are in the early stages, these people said, with no guarantee that a deal will be reached. In particular, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, is resistant to selling to some of the potential acquirers, they said.Twitter is also weighing a possible revamping that could involve divestitures and layoffs, the people said. Two divisions that Twitter is considering divesting itself of are Vine, the mobile six-second video service, and MoPub, a mobile advertising business, they said. The company is working with the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen & Company on its options.For two years, Twitter has been casting about for ways to attract new users and to become a social media destination on the order of Facebook. While people initially flocked to Twitter, its new-user growth has slowed sharply as people complained about how difficult it was to use the service. At the same time, Facebook and its suite of offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger continued to outpace Twitter in user growth and profitability, while five-year-old Snapchat has become the newest darling of the social media world.Lack of growth also began to erode advertiser demand, which had remained robust even as Twitter\u2019s overall number of users stagnated at around 313 million people. Advertisers aiming for big audiences tended to choose Facebook, while those looking for younger audiences have the option of Snapchat.Twitter has endured internal turmoil and a revolving door of executives and board members. Mr. Dorsey, a co-founder who became permanent chief executive of Twitter almost a year ago, has vowed to turn it around by making it easier to use and by emphasizing real-time elements that could make it more essential to people.But after several false starts, critics are skeptical that these efforts will work.On Friday, how interested Google or Salesforce might be in buying Twitter, along with the identities of other possible bidders, became something of a parlor guessing game in Silicon Valley. Google\u2019s name has surfaced in the past as a logical buyer because of the internet search company\u2019s size and digital portfolio. Media companies have also been considered possible suitors.Why Salesforce might be interested in Twitter was a head-scratcher to some people. Salesforce is an enterprise technology company that focuses on businesses and not individuals, as Twitter does.But Salesforce has publicly expressed interest in owning a social network, which the company believes can bolster its main business of selling software and services to business clients. Many companies use Twitter to handle customer service requests and complaints, for example.Compared with its social media and internet peers, Twitter is more susceptible to a takeover because it has only one class of stock. Companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, have multiple classes of shares, which gives their founders tight control over their companies and guarantee independence.Twitter has $3.6 billion in cash on hand and $1.6 billion of debt, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. Microsoft paid a premium of nearly 50 percent for LinkedIn, although any sale of Twitter is unlikely to bring such a rich price.Leslie Picker and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That may be about to change, because of the way its local government is welcoming its robot overlords.The cars will have human overseers in the driver\u2019s seat, for now, but they are expected to operate as autonomous vehicles. And autonomy seems to be what the mayor has given Uber \u2014 he and the chief of police have ridden in the cars, but no one else in government has even seen them.\u201cIf you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet,\u201d said the mayor, basically encapsulating a concept called \u201cgreenlight governing,\u201d or letting companies do whatever they want (within reason).The hope is that this will gain the town a reputation as a robotics hub, something already plausible because of the impressive robotics engineering department at Pittsburgh\u2019s Carnegie Mellon University (which Uber once raided for talent).But fear may be another motivation. The city rode high during America\u2019s industrialization, enabling Andrew Carnegie to fund Carnegie Mellon. He also built the first of his famous public libraries in nearby Braddock, which was hit by the steel bust that set Pittsburgh back for decades.Other parts of the city have come back, in part because of the insurance and health care industries that have made Pittsburgh home. The experience of losing out from one economic cycle, however, very likely shapes how much Pittsburgh views getting in early on the next one.In that case, the towns also look for a big economic bump from sponsoring some part of our computing-intensive future, but it does not turn out that way: Data centers are exceptionally automated, with just a few highly skilled jobs, and even fewer jobs in security and maintenance that match the local skill sets.As robotics catch on, there will be even fewer positions in the data centers.

Chris Worthington of the Montrose Police Department here is out to stop them.\u201cYou can hear those trucks across town, driving like idiots,\u201d he said on a recent Friday evening patrol. He is among the first law enforcement officers in the country to be trained at \u201csmoke school\u201d to pick up the skills to police the coal rollers.He lost sight of one truck cruising in the opposite direction, trailing plumes of smoke. But another, a Ram 3500 fitted with two steel smokestacks, was parked in a Walmart parking lot. The owner, Pryce Hoey, insisted his truck was emissions compliant, but nevertheless agreed to demonstrate its smoke-generating prowess.\u201cI just wanted something different,\u201d Mr. Hoey said, revving the engine and releasing two black pillars of smoke into the evening air before Sgt. Worthington shut him down. \u201cPeople who see it giggle. They think it\u2019s funny.\u201dDepending on whom you ask, rolling coal is a juvenile prank, a health hazard, a stand against rampant environmentalism, a brazen show of American freedom. Coal rollers\u2019 frequent targets: walkers, joggers, cyclists, hybrid and Asian cars and even police officers. A popular bumper sticker reads \u201cPrius Repellent.\u201dAnd while official tallies of coal rolling do not exist, there are signs that smoke, whether from intentional belching or not, is a growing public nuisance. In Colorado, complaints over diesel smoke have risen 5 percent over the last two years. In California, complaints about smoking vehicles to the California Air Resources Board have jumped from under 700 a month, on average, two years ago to more than 1,000 now.State legislatures, as well as local law enforcement agencies, are starting to take action.Last year, New Jersey became the first state to explicitly ban rolling coal, going beyond the federal laws that already prohibit drivers from tinkering with emissions controls. A similar bill is on the table in Illinois, while Colorado and Maryland have defeated proposed bans.But to diesel owners like Corey Blue of Roanoke, Ill., the very efforts to ban coal rolling represent the worst of government overreach and environmental activism. \u201cYour bill will not stop us!\u201d Mr. Blue wrote to Will Guzzardi, a state representative who has proposed a $5,000 fine on anyone who removes or alters emissions equipment.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go live in Sweden and get the heck out of our country,\u201d Mr. Blue wrote.\u201d I will continue to roll coal anytime I feel like and fog your stupid eco-cars.\u201dEven in this election year of bombastic rhetoric on political correctness and climate change, rolling coal stands out as an ideological statement. At its core, it also struggles with a basic, somewhat existential question: Should we seek to minimize the human footprint on the earth, or should we flaunt it?Still, Michelle Minton, a fellow at the institute, draws a line. Coal rollers who use their trucks for harassment, as opposed to celebration, \u201caren\u2019t being rebellious,\u201d she said, they are just being jerks.At a recent truck pull at the McHenry County Fair in Woodstock, Ill., the fumes were part of the draw. \u201cWhen the smoke goes black, don\u2019t look back,\u201d read one man\u2019s T-shirt.\u201cWe pull for bragging rights,\u201d said Scott Vivian, president of the Illini State Pullers league, the event\u2019s organizer. \u201cAnd smoke\u2019s a big part of it.\u201dThere is, in fact, disdain among truck-pull enthusiasts toward coal rollers, whom they view as wannabes sullying their sport. \u201cI hate those guys. I used to do it, smoke out friends, but I grew out of it,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cGives diesel a bad name.\u201dRaymond Elick runs the smoke school at the Colorado Health and Environment Department, training police to spot coal rollers. It is more art than science.In Colorado, a bill that would have made rolling coal a misdemeanor died in a G.O.P.-controlled State Senate in April. Still, an obscure Colorado state law, a holdover from the days when diesel was far dirtier, allows officers to cite coal rollers that blow smoke for at least five seconds at more than 40 percent opacity, or thickness.Using a \u201csmoke machine\u201d that burns toluene, Mr. Elick has trained 55 police officers to discern smoke opacity: Zero percent opacity is clear air; 100 percent opacity lets no light through.\u201cIf it\u2019s smokin\u2019, it\u2019s broken,\u201d Mr. Elick said. \u201cIf you see a smoky truck running down the street, that\u2019s probably 40-50 percent, and that\u2019s pretty darn smoky,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all of the light disappears over that path, if it\u2019s a really bad coal roller, it could be approaching 100 percent.\u201dA group of Canadian cyclists touring the Vermont countryside in June was on the receiving end of a coal roller\u2019s attention. A white pickup truck accelerated, then belched on the bikers, said John Gelder, a management consultant based in Ottawa.Several minutes later, the truck returned to smoke them out a second time.\u201cWhat the hell. Can you believe it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gelder remembers shouting to his friend Steve Fischer, a Canadian journalist who was touring with him. \u201cIt\u2019s like weapons. They think: \u2018We\u2019re entitled to our guns, and we\u2019re entitled to our roads,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gelder said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an assault.\u201dThe group alerted the police in Morristown, Vt., who Mr. Gelder said took no action. Andrew Glover of the Morristown Police Department said that officers would probably not pursue the case.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a law against whatever they did,\u201d he said.The Volkswagen diesel scandal has helped thrust emissions cheating into the spotlight. The German automaker acknowledged last year that it used a defeat device to evade emissions limits. Up to 11.5 million of its vehicles worldwide contain the tainted software.The Environmental Protection Agency has also gone after the aftermarket hobbyist market. In 2013, it fined a components manufacturer in Ogden, Utah, $500,000 for selling devices that let diesel truck owners override emissions controls.\u201cYou have created a growing business transforming lawful, emission-compliant vehicles into illegal, pollution-belching\u201d trucks, the physicians wrote in a letter to the Diesel Brothers. \u201cTo what purpose?\u201dHeavy D, or David Sparks, said through a representative that there was \u201ca misunderstanding on the modification process of trucks on the show.\u201d The Discovery Channel declined to comment.Anyone who tampers with emissions-control equipment violates the Clean Air Act, which prohibits the selling or installing of any component intended to bypass emissions equipment and carries penalties of up to $2,500.Enforcing that ban on the street is difficult, however. Moves in a handful of states to follow New Jersey\u2019s explicit coal-rolling prohibition have been opposed by those who argue that a ban would be regulatory overkill.Mr. Guzzardi, the Illinois representative and an avid cyclist, has been pushing a bill that would impose an additional fine of up to $5,000 for anyone caught coal rolling. \u201cWhy should I get a giant blast of smoke in my face from someone who doesn\u2019t approve of my transportation method?\u201d he said.But a bid in Colorado that would have made rolling coal a misdemeanor was defeated in April. \u201cAre we overreaching here?\u201d Mark Scheffel, a Republican state senator, argued in committee. \u201cIt\u2019s just kids with too much time and money on their hands.\u201dStill, some truck lovers say times are changing.\u201cWhen a truck like this pulls and you don\u2019t see the smoke, we\u2019re proud of it,\u201d Mr. Voss said.But when Clean Sweep dragged the heavy sled down the track, the crowd was confused. \u201cWhere\u2019s the smoke?\u201d one spectator shouted.\u201cThe air sucks anyway,\u201d said Ben Poncher, who was drinking a beer next to the track. \u201cSmoke\u2019s pretty. I like seeing it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Portraying a schoolteacher with a secret (or rather, A Secret) in a self-flagellating monologue that could have been written only by Mr. LaBute, she gives palpable force to a buried guilt that keeps clawing its way to the light, like some prematurely entombed figure out of Edgar Allan Poe.It doesn\u2019t \u2014 at least not if you\u2019re familiar with the crowded canon of Mr. LaBute, a prolific dramatist and filmmaker whose quality may vary but who can never be accused of going off message as an artist. He is a stern and often sensationalist chronicler of the evil that men and women do to one another, and he tends to be as judgmental and retributive as the Old Testament.As a teacher, Mrs. Johnson is in the business of filling in the blanks that follow question marks. Discoursing to us from the perch of her well-worn institutional office (Rachel Hauck did the comfortably uncomfortable set), she tells us that it\u2019s always important to have an answer, even if it isn\u2019t the correct one. \u201cIf it\u2019s wrong,\u201d she says, \u201cthen together we will discover that and work it out as a team.\u201dAnd there we have the template for what\u2019s to follow. Mrs. Johnson is to be our Socratic guide in the investigation of Mrs. Johnson, as she answers to an internal inquisition that never, it seems, goes silent. She keeps building up chipper towers of rationalization only to see them crumble.\u201cAm I crazy to think that?\u201d she says at one point. But she quickly adds that she doesn\u2019t want to know the answer, and her bright professorial composure melts into ashen helplessness.Yes, it\u2019s that old devil sex that is Mrs. Johnson\u2019s nemesis. The affair that she describes was, shall we say, inadvisable according to the ethics of her profession. (Psst \u2014 she sleeps with a student!) But Ms. Light\u2019s unfiltered radiance as she speaks of her trysts with a too-young man makes you believe that the relationship might indeed have been worth the penalty.The form that Mrs. Johnson\u2019s punishment takes will be familiar to regular viewers of true-confession-style television movies. Mr. LaBute adds an extra spice of topicality by introducing the element of a mixed-race romance, but he doesn\u2019t justify its inclusion thematically. Though the script includes an epigraph from that literary master of poisonous passion, Jean Racine, \u201cAll the Ways\u201d feels less like classical tragedy than vintage soap opera.Advertisement"}

It is then that Ms. Abedin\u2019s evident if largely unarticulated exasperation makes for the movie\u2019s most compelling drama.

{"Headline": "Dell Gets Bigger and Hewlett Packard Gets Smaller in Separate Deals", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Michael Dell and Meg Whitman may be business competitors, but they can each claim a technology industry superlative. One has overseen one of the largest mergers in the tech industry. The other has engineered its biggest breakup.Different as they seem, both deals were in reaction to tough competition and declining markets. And so far, neither has provided a clear way for how a storied giant can survive changes like the rise of so-called cloud computing that are undermining the way they operate.On Wednesday, Mr. Dell, who 32 years ago started a personal computer business from his college dorm room, officially completed his giant $67 billion merger with EMC, a data storage company with interests in software and security. He also changed the name of his operation to Dell Technologies.Later in the day, Ms. Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, announced a sale of most of her company\u2019s software assets to a British outfit called Micro Focus for about $8.8 billion. H.P.E. also announced higher earnings in the company\u2019s most recent quarter, but a decline in revenue from the same period a year ago.Shares of H.P.E. moved down about 2 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday evening.H.P.E. itself is a $36 billion computing giant created last year from half of Hewlett-Packard, a record separation that ended one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most iconic companies and neatly mirrored Mr. Dell\u2019s move. The other half of the old company, which specializes in PC and printer sales, is now called HP Inc.With a constant mantra of building shareholder value, Ms. Whitman, who a year ago talked about growth strategies for H.P.E., has sold off big parts of the empire she took over five years ago. Last May, this involved selling off her services group, which employed 110,000 people. In an interview, Ms. Whitman said that after that sale, by the end of October, H.P.E. would have between 50,000 and 60,000 employees.\u201cWe have to understand our place in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are elements of our world that are shrinking.\u201dMr. Dell\u2019s move in the other direction has meant taking his company private, in the process taking on $33.4 billion in long-term debt at relatively little personal risk. He owns 70 percent of Dell Technologies, a company he is counting on to throw off a lot of cash to quickly repay the debt, even as the overall business computing industry shrinks.If his gambit succeeds, within a few years he could multiply by several times his personal fortune, already estimated at $18.5 billion, according to Bloomberg.Dell Technologies starts life with revenue of $74 billion and 140,000 employees, but in an interview on Wednesday Mr. Dell declined to say what those numbers might look like in two years.\u201cThings are going well on a relative basis,\u201d he said. \u201cMarket consolidation is definitely occurring.\u201dWith companies like Amazon Web Services and Google providing cloud computing services, corporations increasingly rent the use of computers they used to buy from Dell and H.P.E., for a lot less money. Other cloud companies, like Salesforce, rent software this way, something A.W.S. and Google also do.Along with the rise of mobile computing, cloud computing is radically altering the computer industry. According to IDC, global demand for traditional data storage fell 7 percent in the first quarter of this year. Server revenue fell 3.6 percent globally. Second-quarter PC sales were down 4.5 percent. In a market like that, big companies like H.P.E. and Dell can only hope for a bigger slice of a shrinking pie.Compare that with Amazon\u2019s fortunes. Since A.W.S. first disclosed its earnings in April 2015, Amazon\u2019s stock has nearly doubled, and despite a 40 percent increase in the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock market, shares of almost all the older business technology companies have barely budged.Cloud companies now get about 10 percent of all spending on business computing, and they are growing at a 30 percent annual clip, said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \u201cThat\u2019s 100 percent of the growth, maybe a little more\u201d of the whole business technology sector, he added. \u201cA year ago Meg talked about growth, but in the past six months it\u2019s all been about capital allocation and return to shareholders.\u201dCompared with many in the old guard, the H.P.E. and Dell strategies may be doing well. At least for now.Shares of H.P.E. have gained about 30 percent in the last year, largely in the last two months, as rumors spread that besides selling services and buying back shares, Ms. Whitman would sell the company\u2019s laggard software division.Pre-EMC, Dell was known mostly for PCs and computer servers. While the financial information released by the private company is limited, in the three months that ended April 29 it had revenue of $12 billion, down 2 percent. Operating income was higher, Dell said, using nonstandard accounting.Selling computers still throws off a lot of cash, which is good for paying debt. Mr. Dell said that Dell Technologies threw off $3.6 billion just in its most recent quarter. EMC also owns a software business, called Pivotal, which Mr. Dell is expected to take public soon.\u201cHe\u2019s betting that size and scale will help him gain share, not that the market will be great,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Computing, once the province of a few business tasks and consumer activities like video games, has with cloud computing attached itself to much of the world, making it possible to connect phones, tablets and sensor-equipped machines to huge computing resources.Both Dell and H.P.E. make the computers and related devices that amount to the infrastructure necessary to this new economy. Increasingly, however, the profit margins can be found above the computing guts, in particular with artificial intelligence technology that helps companies scour data to make smart decisions. Both Microsoft and IBM have invested heavily in both cloud computing and A.I.Mr. Dell said that he had spent $12.7 billion in research and development in the last three years and is gaining some A.I. technology in the EMC deal.In turn, when asked about its innovations, H.P.E. noted changes to its server and storage businesses, along with the acquisition of companies like Silicon Graphics, a high-performance computing company that peaked in the 1990s.An article on Thursday about the differing business strategies of Michael Dell and Meg Whitman misquoted Mr. Dell in one instance. Referring to the prospects of Dell Technologies, the company formed by the merger of his computer business and the data storage company EMC, he said: \u201cThings are going well on a relative basis,\u201d not \u201cThings are going well on a personal basis.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What if \u2018One Click\u2019 Buying Were Internetwide?", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Paying for things online can be cumbersome. Even the man who invented the web, Tim Berners-Lee, says he frequently throws up his hands.\u201cSometimes I will think that I bought something and I press the button, \u2018Buy this,\u2019 and I don\u2019t realize it didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said in a recent interview. \u201cWe are long overdue for a payments user interface for the web.\u201dResponding to the frustrations of Mr. Berners-Lee and hundreds of millions of online shoppers, the web\u2019s governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, has brought together the giants of the internet including Google, Facebook and Apple to fix the clumsiness of paying for things online.Now, a new global standard for online payments \u2014 a sort of Amazon one-click payment system for the entire internet \u2014 is being completed by the consortium and its members.Google, one of the authors of the standard, has recently introduced it in certain new versions of its Chrome browser. Other browser companies have said they intend to follow.The standard will provide a uniform way for users to input their credit cards and payment systems to any web browser so that they can be used for any purchase on the web. After the card details are entered once, they will automatically be called up as choices for all future transactions.This will be somewhat like the existing auto-fill functions that browsers have. But with the new standard, all the data fields will be filled in invisibly, requiring just one click.On the security side, rather than sending along all the credit card details, the browser will generate a one-time payment token that will avoid leaving your credit card number in countless databases around the world.Numerous efforts to modernize the payment system have failed to take off. And this one could fizzle, too, if online merchants, web browsers or consumers fail to adopt the new standard.The new standard will also face competition from the Amazons and PayPals of the world, as well as from the credit card networks, all of which want to be the primary destination for payments, rather than just one option.But payment analysts are hopeful about the new effort because it will not require consumers or merchants to use a new method of payment. Instead it will be equally open to any existing card or payment app, and it will channel them into a single place that most consumers already use \u2014 the web browser \u2014 where everything can be stored and used.\u201cInstead of simplifying the world, we have been fragmenting it into a million apps,\u201d said Eric Shea, a payments consultant at Kurt Salmon Digital. \u201cIf we can get back to that single integrated solution that everyone has on their phone and their desktop, that is the way to move forward and get adoption.\u201dDave Birch, a consultant who has been working on electronic payments for over two decades, said the web browser stood the best chance of providing a unified and more secure portal for payments.\u201cThere\u2019s a convergence going on,\u201d said Mr. Birch, who currently works for Consult Hyperion. \u201cIn the future you will have one experience \u2014 it won\u2019t matter if you are at the store or on the phone. It will pop up on your phone, you will put your thumb on it and you will be done.\u201dThe W3C project represents a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, the current giants of online payments. Both have gained business and fees with their more streamlined checkout processes.Neither company has participated in the current W3C effort and they are likely to continue to provide an alternative to customers who don\u2019t want to enter their details into their browsers.But the W3C has managed to bring in about 40 of the biggest players in online commerce, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and American Express as well as Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent.All met last week in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the specifications that they will introduce on different time frames to users around the world.In the version that Google released, when customers shopping at participating merchants hit the buy button, they are given a drop-down menu of their stored shipping addresses and credit cards.The customer can click on the address and card to be used, enter the three-digit security code on the card and hit \u201cpay now.\u201d Other browser companies may choose to use a fingerprint instead of the security code.\u201cWe wanted to remove what we jokingly call the Nascar effect of checkout, where you see five or seven logos for the different cards and payment methods you can use,\u201d said Zach Koch, the top Google executive on the project. \u201cThis is really fast, where a user can say, \u2018Tap, tap, buy.\u2019\u201dThe fees from transactions will still go to existing financial institutions like credit card companies and banks, unless customers choose a new online payment method like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. Apple Pay takes a piece of each transaction; Samsung Pay does not.But the bigger goal behind the W3C project is to create a standard, seamless and secure way to pay for things electronically in a future that will most likely include virtual reality stores, chat-based transactions and machines making payments to other machines (an autonomous car paying for a parking spot, for instance).The standard will also make it easy to include new payment methods like Bitcoin or the Chinese payment provider Tencent.\u201cThis involves quite radical changes to the way people think about payments,\u201d said Ian Jacobs, the W3C staff member leading the effort. \u201cAs a standards body it is our job to be sure it is an open playing field.\u201dThe need to create a better way to pay for things online was evident from the web\u2019s beginnings in the 1990s, Mr. Berners-Lee said. At some of the earliest meetings of the W3C, which he founded, there were discussions about creating a way to pay for things online that didn\u2019t require people to send credit card details over the internet.The failure to come up with a standard and secure way to do this led to the hodgepodge of payment screens consumers encounter today. It also made an opening for PayPal, which created a way for shoppers to pay on different sites using a single password.Mr. Birch said the main hurdle to accomplishing more seamless payments in the past was online merchants, who did not want to give up control over any part of the checkout process.But merchants have expressed increasing frustration with the high rate of abandoned online transactions and the frequency of credit card fraud.More than half of online purchases now happen on mobile phones, but Shopify has said that only 40 percent of the customers who start filling a shopping cart online finish their transactions.Shopify, which manages the online stores and checkout processes for 300,000 merchants, has been closely involved with the W3C effort and is planning to immediately offer the new standard to its merchants, as is Groupon.\u201cWe are betting a lot on it,\u201d said Jason Normore, the director of engineering at Shopify. \u201cEven though it cuts out a piece of our offering, it makes commerce better for everyone.\u201dApple will be one of the most interesting players to watch, given that it has both the Safari browser, which is part of the W3C effort, and Apple Pay, which could be seen as a competing offering.In the new operating system that Apple released last week, it is possible, for the first time, to shop online using the Safari browser and check out with Apple Pay. After hitting \u201cPay With Apple Pay,\u201d the customer is asked to provide a fingerprint on a phone, and the transaction is complete.The W3C standard will provide a similar experience on any browser \u2014 on a computer or phone \u2014 but will also allow customers to choose from any credit card or payment method they have entered into their browsers.Apple has so far been a part of the W3C group writing the standards, which will allow it to integrate non-Apple Pay choices into its browser.Mr. Berners-Lee said he hoped that more standardized payments would open up new types of online commerce that aren\u2019t possible now. He has long been interested in micropayments that would allow newspapers or small producers of content to be paid a few cents at a time, which isn\u2019t possible in a world with only credit cards.\u201cDifferent things call for different payments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are all interoperable you can separate the market for goods being sold from the payment back end.\u201dAn article on Monday about one-click shopping on the internet misstated the fee structure of one online payment method. While Apple Pay charges a fee on each transaction, Samsung Pay does not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Companies See Gold in California", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorCalifornia is the capital of American business. One out of five companies on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market hail from that state, according to my recent assessment of relevant data.The figures show that when it comes to formation of public companies, the rich states are getting richer while the rest are in slow decline.Compiling data from public filings and adding in missing data from SDC Platinum and CRSP/Compustat, databases that track headquarters information, I examined where public companies had their headquarters from 1965 through 2013. From 1965 through 1979, 10.07 percent of public companies were based in California. The number has continued to grow, so that from 2000-13, 19.46 percent of public companies had their headquarters in California.That\u2019s an astounding number. A state with 12 percent of our population now accounts for a fifth of all public companies. (In the 1970s, California was about 10 percent of the United States population.)Other states, meanwhile, are in decline. Ohio had 5.58 percent and Pennsylvania had 5.9 percent of public listings in the 1965-79 period. But from 2000 through 2013, Ohio had 2.58 percent and Pennsylvania 3.78 percent of public company headquarters.Illinois\u2019s decline was even starker, as it slid to 3.62 percent from 6.42 percent of public company headquarters. The reason for the decline may be obvious as the old manufacturing base went into decline. The appellation Rust Belt rings true to a large degree for these states as old companies disappear and are not replaced with new ones.Yet the decline is not just in the industrial Midwest. New York and New Jersey also fell. New York fell to 8.31 percent of public company listings from 11.32 percent, while New Jersey slipped to 4.53 percent from 5.62 percent.Other states have had growth. Texas rose to 10.26 percent of public companies from 8.38 percent. Massachusetts climbed to 5.12 percent from 3.95 percent. The state is home to technology and pharmaceuticals, two of the biggest growth industries in the United States.Still, the concentration of American corporate might is stark. Nearly 40 percent of all public companies are in just four states: California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas. Three of them \u2014 California, New York and Texas \u2014 account for a third of the Fortune 500.And the trend is accelerating. In the last 12 months, California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas accounted for 50 percent of all initial public offerings by operating companies, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The geographical shift reflects a changing world. The five biggest companies in the United States by market value are all technology companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 three of them with headquarters in California. Not one existed in 1965. The tech phenomenon has benefited California more than all other states, a rise that seems to be unabated.The continued emergence of biotechnology as the other main growth engine of new public company formation appears to be helping California, Massachusetts and Texas, the three states that have long held the lead in this industry.These three stand out as the winners. Why would three very different states perform so well?One might have expected that high-regulation, high-cost, high-tax states like California would decline over time as companies migrated. Texas, of course, offers a different situation. Yet it is not alone among states offering lower taxes and lower regulatory costs.And then what is one to make of Massachusetts, a relatively small state that is punching above its weight? It has regulation and taxes, and yet also business competitiveness.There is no special formula for states to be homes to companies. Instead, what appears to be going on is a winner-take-all system.California is a good example. It is a state burdened with a high tax rate, significant regulation and extreme housing costs. It is the type of place that you would think would lose business. But instead, California is winning at creating public companies. This may be because it already has a significant base of growth companies attracting yet more people to feed off the infrastructure and then create yet more new, big companies. Similar arguments can be made about Massachusetts and the natural network that its biotechnology companies and universities create.Compare this with Texas, which is known for having good hospitals and generates companies in more divergent fields. This may indeed be helped by a more business-friendly environment, but it is more likely a result of the centers that have developed in these fields.New York is increasingly the home of finance companies with a sprinkling of health care companies. But its people\u2019s skills are more associated with media, fashion, finance and consumer companies. Gone are the days when any big corporation would make New York its home because that was the place to be.This is not to say that other states are not successful in business. South Carolina and Alabama, for example, have successfully created manufacturing hubs by creating nonunion, business-friendly environments.There needs to be more study of why certain states nurture and attract public companies.For these states, the economic benefits are not just from those companies alone. There are also secondary effects. The advisers to these companies \u2014 the lawyers, the bankers \u2014 will increasingly be pulled from their New York homes, particularly to the West Coast. As the new crop of unicorns \u2014 start-ups valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 goes public, even at reduced valuations, this pull will continue and the big services that are the specialization of New York are likely to spread out even more to these other states.The country is still going West, it seems.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Essential Budget Query: Is This Spending Aligned With My Values?", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySketch Guy1. For 30 days, every time you make a purchase, take three seconds to notice what you spend your money on.2. Send me your stories about your discoveries.The point was not to change your behavior, or to beat yourself up with what I like to call \u201cthe budget stick.\u201d The point was simply to notice.You sent me a lot of great emails, with some awesome stories about your experiment. Maybe you noticed you spend more money on groceries than you\u2019re comfortable with (or less). Or maybe you discovered that all those little purchases you make on Amazon add up to quite a lot. Either way, for many of you, noticing was just the tip of the iceberg.Reading through your emails, though, it was pretty clear that a lot of you had the same question: \u201cO.K., what\u2019s next?\u201dAnd while I do feel that noticing is an end in and of itself, I wanted to try to address that question. To do so, I\u2019m going to share the story that inspired me to write the article in the first place.It\u2019s a story about a friend I\u2019ll call Tim.A few months ago, Tim began making a conscious effort to notice his spending (using a method, in fact, similar to the 30 days and three seconds one). \u201cCoconut water, $3.73,\u201d he would note, \u201cinteresting.\u201d That\u2019s it. No judgment, just a quick note, and then he would move on.The next step Tim took was to enter each item into a spreadsheet. It\u2019s super easy to do and takes less time than you might think (or you can look at your debit or credit card statement).Then, he asked one simple, but powerful, question: \u201cAre these expenditures in line with my values?\u201d He went down the list, item by item, and asked himself, \u201cWhat was the value this money was invested in and is there a better way I could invest in that value?\u201dOne thing he noticed was a $50 lunch. He recalled that each month, he and a close friend went out for a moderately expensive lunch to catch up. After thinking about it, he realized that the thing he intended to invest in during those lunches was not food or nutrition, but the friendship. And as far as the friendship goes, what he and his buddy really liked to do the most was go hiking, not eat out.Tim called his buddy and asked how he would feel about changing their monthly lunch meeting to a monthly hike, and the friend was extremely enthusiastic. So no more fancy lunch. Now they make a couple of peanut butter sandwiches and go on a hike instead.Here\u2019s the really interesting thing. After noticing that there was a better way he could invest in this value of friendship, Tim was able to free up $50 a month to invest in some other value. One of Tim\u2019s values happens to be long-term financial security, so he took that $50 and invested it in an S.&P. 500 index mutual fund.This may sound a little bit like boring financial adviser talk, but it\u2019s actually quite amazing. Just imagine if I told you that you could have an extra $50 and two hours each month to invest in things you really care about. Would you sign on the dotted line? I bet you would.This sort of investing behavior is something I like to call values-based budgeting. The whole point of the \u201c30 Days and Three Seconds\u201d experiment is to set yourself up to do this kind of work.So here are your instructions:\u25a0 Step one: notice. Become aware of your expenditures.\u25a0 Step three: judge. Go through the spreadsheet and ask yourself, \u201cIs this expenditure really in line with my values?\u201d\u25a0 Step four: reinvest. When you find places that your spending could be better invested in other values, make the change.Tim has gotten to the point where he manages his monthly expenditures with surgical precision. Once a month, he and his wife go through their spreadsheet and figure out where they can better invest their money based on their values. And then, every month, I get a text. \u201cReinvested another $7.50 and 30 minutes!\u201dImagine if you did this for two years. That\u2019s $7.50 and 30 minutes a month, times 24 months, which adds up to $180 and 12 hours. How would you like a free $180 and 12 hours a month to invest in things you really care about?The truth is, it\u2019s yours for the taking. The key though \u2014 the secret, really \u2014 is awareness. If you don\u2019t take the first step of noticing where your money is disappearing to in the first place, you\u2019ll never find the money and time you could be investing elsewhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Steep Premium: The Cost of Employee Stock Grants", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd those grants of restricted stock units or options, which would have to be covered to some degree by any buyer, simply add to the purchase price of any deal.Factoring in the payouts would have pushed Twitter well into the red for the year.By way of comparison, the company reported $2.2 billion in revenue for 2015 \u2014 meaning that it paid out 31 cents in stock-based compensation for every dollar of sales it collected.Twitter\u2019s stock-based compensation has been high since the company went public: Such payouts totaled nearly $632 million in 2014 and $600 million in 2013. So notable has been its practice that the company was called out as one of the most aggressive users of equity grants by Mark Mahaney, a veteran stock analyst with RBC Capital Markets.By comparison, LinkedIn paid out 17 percent of its revenue in stock-based grants last year, or about $510 million. Salesforce.com, which along with Google has expressed interest in buying Twitter, paid out 8 percent of sales in such packages, or $593.6 million, over the same time period.Tech companies that do not factor stock-based compensation into their preferred earnings metrics, such as Twitter, argue that such payouts are not cash and do not reflect the underlying health of core businesses.(Not all tech companies urge investors and analysts to ignore stock-based compensation. Facebook and Amazon are among those that factor in those grants as a real expense.)But a new owner would need to compensate its newest employees by either paying cash or doling out yet more equity. Ignoring those grants, particularly ones made to the most desirable employees like top engineers, is simply impossible for a buyer.Those costs have apparently not diminished the interest of some potential buyers. Shares of Twitter were up about 1 percent after Bloomberg reported that Walt Disney was working with a financial adviser to weigh a possible bid.Still, questions remain about whether Twitter is already valued too richly \u2014 its market capitalization as of Monday afternoon was more than $16 billion. The equity compensation costs just make the company even more expensive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Care.com Creates a $500 Limited Benefit for Gig-Economy Workers", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn one of the earliest moves to bring employee benefits to workers in the so-called gig economy, an online marketplace that connects millions of families with babysitters, nannies and caregivers announced on Wednesday that it would provide up to $500 a year for workers to use for health care, transportation or education expenses.The Care.com solution to this problem is to earmark a small portion of the transaction fee it charges many families toward the caregiver benefit and allow the contributions to accrue across jobs.\u201cAs freelance labor moves to work for different people, their benefits should move with them,\u201d said Sheila Marcelo, the founder and chief executive of Care.com. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anyone do what we\u2019re doing. We think it\u2019s groundbreaking.\u201dDespite the rising interest, however, there have been strikingly few accomplishments to date. In 2012, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a labor organization representing cabdrivers, persuaded the Taxi and Limousine Commission to require taxi medallion owners to deduct 6 cents per fare from the driver\u2019s credit card receipts to fund portable benefits for drivers, like health care services and disability coverage.The New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan struck down the regulation in 2014. (Corey Johnson, a member of the New York City Council, has said he plans to introduce legislation aimed at creating a similar fund.)Earlier this year, Uber reached an agreement with the regional branch of a prominent union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, to create an association to represent roughly 35,000 Uber drivers in New York City. The drivers association could eventually set up and administer a fund for benefits like paid time off.Some worker advocates said the Care.com development could help generate momentum on the issue.The new Care.com benefit will be funded by diverting two percentage points of the 12 percent transaction fee that it charges families who use its platform to pay their caregivers. The caregivers can accrue an unlimited amount of benefit money in a given year, but can spend only up to $500. The company said it arrived at this figure because it is equivalent to what a typical employee pays over six months for pharmacy benefits or vision insurance. Any amount the caregivers do not spend will be rolled over to the following year.Ms. Marcelo conceded that a large percentage of families do not use the Care.com platform to pay the more than nine million caregivers they find there, noting that the payment option is very recent. But she said she expected families to rely more on the company\u2019s payments feature in the future because their caregivers, mindful of the new benefit, would nudge them in that direction.\u201cThese workers a lot of times are living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all need to do what we can do to help these caregivers earn more and save.\u201dStill, some worker advocates were concerned by the development, arguing that any success in creating portable benefits for gig-economy workers could implicitly concede the fight over whether such workers should be classified as employees or independent contractors. Employees receive a variety of rights and protections, including minimum wage, overtime pay and a federally backed right to organize; contractors have very few.\u201cBenefits can make you a little less helpless,\u201d said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t fill that void.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In \u2018Better Things,\u2019 a Single Mother\u2019s Plight.", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd while there\u2019s frustration, anger and heartbreak baked into the premise of \u201cBetter Things\u201d \u2014 a single working mother raising three girls by herself \u2014 it\u2019s not a dark show. The dominant mood is hopeful exasperation. Set in Los Angeles, it has a sunnier vibe than \u201cLouie,\u201d which inhabits a sometimes ominous nighttime New York.The show fits into the proliferating genre of frank, caustic comedies with an overt mission of telling previously hidden truths about women\u2019s lives, from \u201cGirls\u201d to coming series like HBO\u2019s \u201cDivorce\u201d and Amazon\u2019s \u201cFleabag.\u201d \u201cBetter Things\u201d stands out for being focused on motherhood rather than on sex and relationships \u2014 lovemaking is a furtive and infrequent occurrence in the life of Sam Fox, the actress Ms. Adlon plays. When asked about the topic, she announces that she\u2019s married to her daughters, with whom she regularly engages in hilarious, semi-acidic arguments.The low-key, observational style of the humor in \u201cBetter Things\u201d may leave you restless, and there are moments when the show veers into cuteness or sentimentality. But the show\u2019s real payoffs have less to do with laughs than with aching recognition of the single mother\u2019s plight.The world of \u201cBetter Things\u201d is a woman\u2019s world, into which men blunder without much lasting effect. It feels like an overriding metaphor that the father of Sam\u2019s children remains unnamed (as far as I can remember) and unseen through the first five episodes. His only concrete existence is as a club for Sam\u2019s oldest daughter, Max (Mikey Madison), to beat her mother with.In a point-counterpoint argument, Sam complains about an unsanctioned party that left her house in shambles. Max blames Sam\u2019s absence (she had to travel for an acting gig), and Sam asks Max how she thinks food gets on the table. You don\u2019t have to work, Max answers \u2014 \u201cDad told me\u201d you have money saved up, and you just want to be famous. The fury and vexation in Ms. Adlon\u2019s face as she yells, \u201cYour father lives better than I do, and I pay for all of it\u201d is an epiphany of a sort the show offers several times an episode.Ms. Adlon is also sharp on the relationships among the women in Sam\u2019s orbit. Amused when her gynecologist tells her that she has the reproductive system of a 16-year-old, Sam repeats the observation to her 40-something friends, whose faces freeze in indignation. One asks hopefully, but your eggs are fried, right?Besides the fathers of her daughters\u2019 friends \u2014 one of whom she occasionally hooks up with \u2014 Sam\u2019s dealings with men are primarily on the job. But again, it\u2019s the women who are most sensitively drawn. When the clueless male creators of a new sitcom decide they want Sam for a starring role, their female casting director, Jen (Deborah S. Craig), is unhappy because she\u2019ll have to expend some of her credibility arguing for Sam (too old, not famous enough) to the network.In a lot of comedies, that scenario would play out in terms of cattiness, but here it\u2019s about professionalism and, finally, sympathy. Jen makes a persuasive case, despite her misgivings, and when a more famous name comes along, a quick shot registers Jen\u2019s necessarily unspoken disappointment. Sam, meanwhile, is fine \u2014 the shoot would have kept her from going on a field trip with one of her daughters. Motherhood, at the end of the day, is most powerful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "People Are Watching Less TV. So Will They Watch the Emmys?", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHERE was a time several years ago when awards shows were on the upswing.As television ratings began to erode in an era of Netflix, the DVR and Facebook, awards shows, along with sports and other big live events, were among the few rock-solid programming institutions that were immune to the changes, delivering grindingly sturdy results.Well, they used to, at least.Here's a look at some of the most memorable moments from the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards.Trying to buck this recent trend on Sunday will be the Emmys, which will be broadcast on ABC and hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.Executives in the television industry are aware of the declines and are wondering if they are part of the cyclical rise and fall of awards shows, or if people\u2019s ever-changing viewing habits are finally affecting the ratings for these three- to four-hour, commercial-loaded TV events.\u201cWhat prompts these trends?\u201d said Don Mischer, the longtime TV-event producer who is overseeing this year\u2019s Emmys. \u201cAs we\u2019ve gone through time, there is so much more content available that the pieces of the pie are getting smaller and smaller.\u201d57 PhotosThat\u2019s one theory: that viewers are instead turning to an ever-expanding list of options instead of habitually tuning in to the Oscars or Emmys. Another is that with a growing number of awards programs, viewer fatigue is setting in. Yet another is that at a time when services like Netflix provide programming without commercials, the prospect of watching a prolonged awards show riddled with ads seems like too much to endure. It doesn\u2019t hurt that highlights from an awards show that happened the night before are always just a click away.\u201cThere are so many things fighting for your time, and live TV, even for live events, is fairly inefficient,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, a financial-services firm. \u201cOur tolerance for commercials and high-ad loads is disappearing. Once you started to binge watch, it\u2019s just hard to go back to any form of live-linear TV unless you\u2019re an absolute die-hard fan.\u201dFinding an answer is critical for an industry that is desperately trying to maintain an ad-supported business model. Big live events that drive viewership and provoke engagement \u2014 on social media in real time, and in offices the day after \u2014 are a crucial component of that strategy.Executives point out that awards shows have long been prone to seesaw ratings, with any number of factors affecting their appeal. For the Oscars, viewership is often dictated by whether a series of blockbusters, or movies with big-name stars, were nominated for best picture. For other awards, the competition that night \u2014 whether it\u2019s an N.F.L. playoff game that goes into overtime or a hit like \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d \u2014 can dictate an up year or a down year.The television critics James Poniewozik, Mike Hale and Neil Genzlinger evaluate the 2016 Primetime Emmy nominations.But in the last two years, the gains have stopped. The Oscars went from an audience of 43.7 million in 2014 to 34.3 million this year. The Golden Globes went from a total of 20.9 million viewers in 2014 to 18.5 million this year. The Grammys went from 28.5 million viewers two years ago to 25 million this year. And the Emmys went from an audience of 17.6 million in 2013 to 11.9 million last year. There are similar trend lines for many other awards programs, with big highs from a couple of years ago eroding by the millions.\u201cPerhaps the outlier was the growth in viewership,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cMaybe this is just the reality now.\u201dDan Donnelly, a managing director at Publicis Media, said that even if ratings continue to fall, big live events still deliver an audience that few programs can match, and so might remain attractive to advertisers.\u201cEven with that decline, if someone tells you, \u2018Oh, you can advertise in an environment with 18, 25 or 30 million viewers, even if they used to have 45 or 50 million,\u2019 well, then wow, that\u2019s still a great place to play,\u201d he said.There is also hope within ABC that it is better positioned than Fox (last year\u2019s Emmy network) to provide a promotional push \u2014 through Mr. Kimmel\u2019s late-night show and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d \u2014 that could position the show for higher ratings this year.The Emmys present an unusually intriguing case study: They are dedicated to honoring an industry that\u2019s never been bigger or filled with more celebrated shows, but those shows also don\u2019t attract big audiences, Mr. Mischler said, at least compared with Emmy winners of years past.Producers for the show said they have had to take special care to introduce a growing supply of shows and actors to viewers who might never have watched or heard of them.\u201cEach year, there are more nominations of shows and actors that an increasing number of viewers at home are unfamiliar with,\u201d Mr. Mischer said. \u201cWe will go on the air Sunday night, and how many of viewers across the country are familiar with \u2018Portlandia\u2019\u201d?Or, as Mr. Nathanson, the analyst put it: \u201cAmazon won an Emmy for \u2018Transparent\u2019 last year.

Ms. Rude had me at the opening paragraph, when a serious scholar from her student days casually told her: \u201cA chicken is an incredible piece of technology.\u201d And a delicious one at that. Did you know this country consumes more than 8.6 billion chickens in the course of a year?Bonus feature: The book contains fowl-related recipes throughout the ages, including one for chicken soup circa 1390. A salve for the soul, even then.

More rivals have meant wider awareness for the overall business of online grocery ordering and delivery, he said in a telephone interview.Seizing that potential new business has become the game.\u201cThe general pressure is in the fight for new customers who haven\u2019t cast their vote yet,\u201d he said.FreshDirect operates in New York City and in Philadelphia, and the fund-raising is meant to help the company expand into new geographic markets and business lines, as well as to improve its distribution capacity.FreshDirect has also moved into new businesses. In January, it unveiled FoodKick, a service that delivers food within an hour. According to Mr. Ackerman, it is meant to cater to \u201cnonplanned instant gratification,\u201d not unlike what Instacart offers.Mr. Ackerman added that one of FreshDirect\u2019s advantages was that it had been profitable since 2010. He said sales had grown every quarter for the last 12 years, with revenue now above $600 million a year.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that we have achieved scale and profitability,\u201d Mr. Ackerman said, adding that any expansion plans would be from a \u201csolid foundation.\u201dMr. Ackerman said that FreshDirect began looking to raise additional funds about six months ago and that the company began discussions soon after with JPMorgan, whose asset management unit led the latest investment round.As part of FreshDirect\u2019s fund-raising, two JPMorgan executives \u2014 Larry Unrein, the head of the asset management unit\u2019s private equity group; and Ashmi Mehrotra, a managing director \u2014 will join the company\u2019s board.\u201cAs demand for fresh ingredients delivered to your door continues to rise, high-quality food, produce and packaged goods providers are drawing significant attention from the investment community,\u201d Mr. Unrein said in a statement, adding that FreshDirect was a \u201cforward-thinking leader\u201d in the sector.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Audiobooks Turn More Readers Into Listeners as E-Books Slip", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySales of paperback books are up. Independent bookstores are thriving again. The threat of a digital apocalypse has subsided, as e-book sales have tumbled.Sales of adult books fell by 10.3 percent in the first three months of 2016, and children\u2019s books dropped by 2.1 percent. E-book sales fell by 21.8 percent, and hardcover sales were down 8.5 percent. The strongest categories were digital audiobooks, which rose by 35.3 percent, and paperback sales, which were up by 6.1 percent.Though the numbers look bad, they\u2019re not all that surprising. For many publishers, the first quarter is often the weakest period of the year. Publishers often save their biggest books for the summer, timed for vacation reading, and the fall, for the holiday shopping period. Typically, publishers make about 20 percent of their profits during the first quarter of the year, according to Michael Cader, a book industry analyst and the creator of Publishers Marketplace.But there are several factors that might have made book sales at the beginning of this year slightly worse than those in the same period last year. Like the movie business, publishing depends heavily on a few outsize hits each season to drive profits. In the early part of this year, there wasn\u2019t a huge, breakout best-seller, certainly nothing like 2015\u2019s \u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d which came out in January and sold two million copies in just over four months.The adult coloring-book fad, which provided a huge boost to publishers and booksellers last year, has started to fizzle, possibly driving down sales this year. (In 2015, some 12 million coloring books were sold in the United States, up from one million in 2014.) And the surge in downloadable audiobook sales might account in part for the decline in hardcover and e-books, if more people are listening to books instead of reading them.But perhaps the biggest factor affecting publishers\u2019 revenue, and one that is not likely to go away soon, is the decline in e-book sales, Mr. Cader said. While publishers once fretted that digital book sales were eroding more profitable categories like hardcover, they now are finding that e-books \u2014 which cost next to nothing to produce and zero to ship and which can\u2019t be returned as unsold merchandise by retailers \u2014 are critical profit engines. But e-book sales have fallen precipitously for months, in part because many publishers have raised their prices after negotiating with Amazon and gaining the ability to set their own prices.The decline of digital sales and stabilization of print may have also led to higher returns of unsold merchandise from booksellers, reducing revenue. And while some book buyers may have traded e-books for print books, others may be buying cheaper, self-published e-books on Amazon.Those reasons may partly explain why separate data from Nielsen, which tracks only print trade book sales, looks so different from the publishers\u2019 numbers. Nielsen BookScan data showed that sales of print books were up by 16.4 million units in the first half of this year, as Mr. Cader noted on Publishers Marketplace.It\u2019s unclear if publishers will bounce back by year\u2019s end, but there are encouraging signs. There have been some prominent best sellers, including the play \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d the newly released paperback edition of \u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d and Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s latest book, \u201cKilling the Rising Sun,\u201d which sold more than 250,000 copies in its first week. And this fall will be full of new releases from literary heavyweights including Ann Patchett, Ian McEwan, Michael Chabon, Jonathan Safran Foer and Zadie Smith.Still, some analysts say that the weak first-quarter results might reflect a slow decline in sales that is likely to continue. \u201cI would expect the business to slowly shrink,\u201d said Mike Shatzkin, founder and chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, which analyzes the publishing industry. \u201cAs more and more people are reading on multifunction devices, there are all kinds of temptations that intrude on book-reading time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.\u201dThe success of the O.J. series set the theme for the evening as Sarah Paulson, Courtney B. Vance and Sterling K. Brown all scored their first Emmy victories. Rami Malek won his first Emmy as well in a wide-open race for best actor in a drama, for his role as the tortured hacker in USA\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d And in a big upset, Tatiana Maslany won as best actress in a drama for her numerous performances in BBC America\u2019s \u201cOrphan Black,\u201d beating out the likes of Robin Wright, Claire Danes and last year\u2019s winner, Viola Davis.Here's a look at some of the most memorable moments from the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards.Kate McKinnon of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d provided a change of pace, too, upsetting Allison Janney, a seven-time Emmy winner, as best supporting actress for comedy. Likewise, Louie Anderson won his first Emmy in the best supporting comedy category for his role as a suburban mother in FX\u2019s \u201cBaskets.\u201dThere was a changing of the guard in the variety category, as John Oliver\u2019s show, \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d ended the 13-year run of Comedy Central victories.There were familiar winners as well: In the comedy category, Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her fifth consecutive best actress award for her role on \u201cVeep,\u201d and Jeffrey Tambor, for the second year in a row, won for his role as a transgender woman in \u201cTransparent.\u201dThis was the second consecutive year that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cVeep\u201d took top honors, which helped propel HBO to six Emmys on Sunday night and 22 Emmys over all (some categories were awarded previously), the biggest haul of any programmer. FX was right behind with 18 wins, including six on Sunday.57 PhotosIn a sign of the expected Emmys dominance for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cO.J,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel, the show\u2019s host, said in his opening monologue, \u201cIf your show doesn\u2019t have a dragon or a white Bronco in it, go home.\u201dHere are some of the themes and highlights of the evening:Comedy Central had a chokehold on the variety talk show category for years, and a Comedy Central alumnus took the award on Sunday: Mr. Oliver, for his HBO show, \u201cLast Week Tonight.\u201dThe show is now in its third season, and the win represents a breakthrough of sorts. The Emmy in this category has been handed out to daily talk shows for years and hasn\u2019t been given to a weekly show since Tracey Ullman won for her sketch series \u201cTracey Takes On\u2026\u201d nearly 20 years ago. (Starting last year, variety sketch series and variety talk series were separated into different categories.)Mr. Oliver\u2019s triumph is a blow for Comedy Central, which had won this award for 13 consecutive years between \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d Not this year; Trevor Noah, Jon Stewart\u2019s replacement, was shut out of the race and not nominated in his first year as host of \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201dBut there was some solace in Comedy Central\u2019s night, when \u201cKey & Peele\u201d won the best variety sketch series award. The bad news? That is now off the air.Not surprisingly, this year\u2019s divisive election played a significant role in this year\u2019s ceremony.Lamenting the possibility of a Donald J. Trump presidency, Mr. Kimmel lit into the reality show producer Mark Burnett, who was one of the creators of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the show that made Mr. Trump a nationwide television star. With ABC\u2019s camera firmly squared on Mr. Burnett \u2014 who laughed the entire time, despite the charged barbs \u2014 Mr. Kimmel said that if Mr. Trump is elected president, Mr. Burnett is the man to blame.\u201cIf he\u2019s elected and he builds that wall, the first person we\u2019re throwing over it is Mark Burnett,\u201d Mr. Kimmel said.Later in the night, after \u201cThe Voice\u201d won the best reality show, Mr. Burnett, a producer for that show as well, shot back at Mr. Kimmel saying that the host gave \u201canother five minutes of free publicity\u201d for Mr. Trump.Mr. Kimmel took the stage afterward and had his own retort: \u201cThat Emmy is going on the hood of Trump\u2019s limousine, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAnd Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, who plays the vice president turned president Selina Meyer, said this upon winning her Emmy for every year she\u2019s been nominated in the role: \u201cOur show started out as a political satire, but it now feels more like a sobering documentary.\u201dFX\u2019s \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d was a ratings hit and a darling of critics, and now a big-time Emmy winner.In addition to winning the limited series Emmy, Ms. Paulson, Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown all won acting awards. Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown both beat co-stars to win. Nearly every feature player on the show was nominated for an award, a total of six in all.After Ms. Paulson was named best actress, she got up from her seat and gave a big hug to Marcia Clark, the prosecutor she played in the 10-episode drama, and whom she brought as her guest to the ceremony.Ms. Paulson\u2019s performance was a sympathetic one, and it\u2019s been a year of redemption for Ms. Clark.\u201cI, along with the rest of the world, had been superficial and careless in my judgment,\u201d Ms. Paulson said, choking up as she directed her comments to Ms. Clark. \u201cAnd I am glad to be able to stand here today in front of everyone and tell you I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\u2019For FX, \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d was the leader for what was turning out to be its best year at the Emmys ever. \u201cFargo\u201d was also nominated in the limited-series category and, after years of being shut out, FX\u2019s critically praised \u201cThe Americans\u201d finally broke through with three major nominations \u2014 best drama, best actor (Matthew Rhys) and best actress (Keri Russell) \u2014 though it did not win.There were three African-American winners in acting categories Sunday, a notable departure from this year\u2019s Academy Awards, in which no minorities were nominated in the acting categories. In addition to wins from Mr. Brown and Mr. Vance, Regina King won the supporting actress in a limited series Emmy for her role in ABC\u2019s \u201cAmerican Crime.\u201d And \u201cKey & Peele\u201d prevailed in the variety sketch award.Instead, attention has turned to the awards themselves, with campaigning having turned into something of a blood sport. In the last two years there has been a 40 percent increase in the number of submissions for the best drama Emmy, according to the Television Academy. And \u201cfor your consideration\u201d mailers have reached comical proportions, with Netflix sending out a package to Emmy voters so hefty that it could crush a toe.For each of the last three years, streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have become a larger presence at the Emmys. Netflix had 54 nominations this year, its highest ever, and for the first time, it did better than any of the broadcast networks.But despite the upheaval Netflix has caused in the industry, the streaming service has yet to have a big Emmys night. Though it collected nine Emmys overall, including three on Sunday, Netflix continues to strike out in the best drama, best comedy and best actor and actress categories.Ben Mendelsohn did win the Emmy for best supporting actor for his role in \u201cBloodline.\u201d But even with the lavish attention on the presidential election this year, neither Kevin Spacey nor Robin Wright won for their roles in the political drama \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Neither actor has won a Primetime Emmy Award.For Amazon, Mr. Tambor won again for \u201cTransparent.\u2019\u2019The broadcast networks continued to have a diminished presence at the Emmys. NBC won two awards Sunday night, and ABC and Fox won one. CBS was shut out altogether.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some See Anti-Women Backlash in Ouster of Brazil\u2019s President", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 At one heated moment in the impeachment trial of Dilma Rousseff, a powerful senator pushing for her ouster decided that some of his outspoken female colleagues in the chamber needed scolding.\u201cCalm down, girls,\u201d the senator, C\u00e1ssio Cunha Lima, part of a political dynasty from northeastern Brazil, told Senators Vanessa Grazziotin and Gleisi Hoffmann, both supporters of Ms. Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president. His remark drew sharp rebukes from the two women.\u201cMen believe they are the owners of this space, as if we\u2019re just here by chance,\u201d said Ms. Grazziotin, 55, a prominent leftist senator from Amazonas State.Throughout the impeachment proceedings, female allies of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s in Congress argued that the way her impeachment was carried out reflected a political establishment in which women were still supposed to serve as accessories to powerful men. A new wave of vitriolic positioning against female politicians like Ms. Rousseff is fueling these concerns.During the impeachment trial, for instance, Jaufran Siqueira, a socially conservative politician in the northeastern city of Natal, seized on a new idea for gaining votes.\u201cI can\u2019t deny that I oppose the feminist movement,\u201d said Mr. Siqueira, a real estate broker who emerged into the national spotlight with his campaign. \u201cBut it\u2019s absurd to claim I\u2019m going to set fire to women.\u201d He said the photo had been merely \u201ca joke.\u201dDespite the increasing tensions, female political leaders in Brazil remain far from unanimous on whether Ms. Rousseff was driven from office because of her gender.\u201cMy understanding is that Dilma\u2019s budget maneuvers were illegal,\u201d said Ms. Silva, 58, an environmentalist, who repeatedly clashed with Ms. Rousseff when both were ministers in the cabinet of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that women won\u2019t play a crucial role in Brazilian politics after Dilma\u2019s impeachment,\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cOf course we will. We have too much momentum now to stop us.\u201dAs campaigning intensifies for municipal elections, other leaders at different points on Brazil\u2019s ideological spectrum echoed such views.\u201cI don\u2019t see this moment as something that disappoints the aspirations of Brazilian women,\u201d said Teresa Surita, a supporter of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster, who is running for re-election as the mayor of Boa Vista, a city in the Brazilian Amazon.\u201cI have to be aware of the need for support from the federal government, regardless of who is in power,\u201d she said.Still, others contend that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster revealed the ugly workings of Brazil\u2019s male-dominated political scene. As large protests flare against Mr. Temer\u2019s administration, especially on the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city, thousands of women are voicing opposition to the new government.\u201cTemer took out Dilma because a man doesn\u2019t like to answer to a woman, and as president, she was the one telling them what to do,\u201d said Rayra Lima de Ara\u00fajo, 14, a high school student who attended the antigovernment protests on Sunday with her mother, Maria da Cruz Lima, 43, an unemployed nurse.\u201cI\u2019ve always been described as a hard-charging woman in the midst of delicate men,\u201d she said. \u201cI never saw a man accused of being hard-charging, and we know that they are.\u201dBut even Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, once one of Latin America\u2019s most powerful political parties, is grappling with an internal debate over sexism as it tries to reinvent itself.M\u00edriam Leit\u00e3o, an economic historian and one of Brazil\u2019s most influential columnists, said the Workers\u2019 Party was using the debate over women in politics to try to discredit the impeachment process because it cost the party the presidency it had held for more than 13 years.\u201cDilma didn\u2019t fall because she is a woman,\u201d Ms. Leit\u00e3o wrote in her column in the newspaper O Globo. \u201cShe produced a surge in inflation, a recession of historical significance, and lost her job.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a high school student who attended antigovernment protests in S\u00e3o Paulo on Sunday. She is Rayra Lima de Ara\u00fajo, not Rayna. The article also misidentified the Brazilian legislative body that has 513 members, 10 percent of whom are women.

As with all award-distributing endeavors, the Emmys are deeply flawed, and we must not confuse Emmy-worthiness with goodness nor its opposite with badness. But I love a spectacle, and rituals are the way we consecrate behavior to foster magical experiences within ordinary acts. Plus look at how nice everyone looks!Before the Emmys on Sunday night, though, there are two fabulous shows premiering this weekend, and Watching\u2019s movie writer, Monica Castillo, has two great movie recommendations for you.Let\u2019s all really make a go of things this weekend. Wheee.Phoebe Waller-Bridge created and stars in this British series that starts out as dark, filthy fun and deepens into a stunningly rich portrait of a complex, complicated woman.On the one hand, she has perfect British sweaters and alluring pink lipstick and a haircut that I swear will inspire 10,000 curly bobs, and she\u2019s funny and smart and seemingly irresistible to men. On the other hand, she\u2019s a wreck \u2014 and not in that \u201ctee-hee, I\u2019m just a lil girl with all this whiskey!\u201d way women are \u201cwrecks\u201d in TV shows. She\u2019s a profoundly self-sabotaging monster. The show breaks the fourth wall just often enough for cheekiness without devolving into commentary on itself, and it captures some of the unresolvable tension of adult-sibling relationships and the intoxicating thrall of intimate friendships.The more \u201cHigh Maintenance\u201d you watch, the more you\u2019ll like it, and I strongly encourage you to watch the web episodes (available on HBO streaming platforms) before watching the cable version. Lots of familiar faces reappear, and while context isn\u2019t essential, it never hurts.\u201cHigh\u201d follows a bicycle-riding weed dealer only identified as \u201cthe Guy\u201d (the show\u2019s co-creator Ben Sinclair) and his various clients \u2014 most episodes are heavier on the clients than on the Guy, but there are a few exceptions. Most of the webisodes were under 10 minutes, so this leap to HBO does push the format a little; the show compensates by having most episodes cover two clients\u2019 stories.More important than exact story structure, though, is the show\u2019s, well, vibes: It can be nakedly and straightforwardly hilarious, but it tends more to the gimlet eye \u2014 though only toward the characters who can take it. The wounded, vulnerable and downtrodden are handled with gentle care, with the encouraging gaze of a hopeful kindergarten teacher.Ever since \u201cRevenge,\u201d \u201cRinger\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl\u201d (such guilty pleasures!) ended, I\u2019ve been looking for a show that has rich people with ridiculous dramas and money problems, but haven\u2019t quite found the right one for me. Everyone tells me to watch \u201cQuantico,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d or \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder,\u201d but those are pretty \u201ceh\u201d (and I don\u2019t like medical shows). Could you please help me out? \u2014 JohnOh, I love a good rich-person soap. I encourage you, though, to disabuse yourself of the concept of \u201cguilty pleasures.\u201d Pleasure is just pleasure; if no one\u2019s getting hurt, there\u2019s nothing to feel guilty about.

{"Headline": "IPhone 7 and Wireless Headphones: Analyzing Apple\u2019s Announcements", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrian X. Chen, Farhad Manjoo and Katie Benner were at the event to provide live analysis of what you need to know about the announcements, not what you don\u2019t.\u25a0 New iPhones, called the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.\u25a0 The new iPhones lack a headphone jack.\u25a0 The new iPhones have a revised home button with force sensitivity, which will vibrate to give feedback.\u25a0 The iPhones are water-resistant.\u25a0 The Plus model of the new iPhone includes a dual-lens camera to take professional-grade photos.\u25a0 A new Apple Watch, called Apple Watch Series 2, which includes GPS.\u25a0 Pok\u00e9mon Go is available for Apple Watch.\u25a0 An update on how Apple Music is performing.\u25a0 Tweaks to its iWork suite of productivity apps.So if consumers can hold off a year for the next iPhone, I\u2019d encourage them to wait. But for owners of iPhones that are at least two years old, these are going to be major upgrades \u2014 if you find a way to cope with the lack of a headphone jack.Perhaps more important, Apple was trying to cobble together a credible story for the future from these incremental moves \u2014 that a wireless world is coming and that it will be the leader in that world.The problem for Apple is that the steps along the way to achieving its goals aren\u2019t always that exciting. This is one of those years: There are lots of incremental improvements, but nothing stands out as a must-have. Someday, Apple is telling us, all these increments will add up to something unimaginably amazing. Right now, though, the moves look puzzling \u2014 we really did not get a good defense for removing the headphone jack \u2014 and we may just have to live with the confusion.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a deep love for music,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt inspires us, and it\u2019s a key part of our product experience.\u201dMr. Cook said the company had 17 million subscribers after about a year for Apple Music and added that the music service would be the \u201cpremier destination for exclusive music,\u201d nodding to the idea that the company will use its huge war chest to lock up deals with artists.Apple also announced a new version of iWork, its suite of productivity apps that rival Microsoft Office and Google\u2019s productivity apps. The tweaked version of iWork will include real-time collaboration, meaning multiple people can work on documents and presentation slides at the same time. It\u2019s good that these changes are coming to iWork, but Microsoft and Google have been offering real-time collaboration tools for years already.But Apple has lately faced more competition from rivals, especially Google, whose cheap and simple Chromebook has become one of the most-used machines at schools. For both companies \u2014 and lately for other tech rivals, including Amazon \u2014 the education market functions as a gateway. Get them early, win them for life.The gleaming white finish is in some ways a return to the past for Apple. (Remember all those white computers from the early 2000s?) But beyond that, it\u2019s always interesting when Apple discovers a new material for use in its devices. You usually notice some new process or material start in one product and then wend its way throughout the company\u2019s lineup over a few years\u2019 time. In other words, three years from now, we may have all-white, ceramic phones. A man can dream, anyway.The addition of GPS gives the Apple Watch a slight edge against Fitbit\u2019s Blaze, a comparable smartwatch that lacks GPS. But until we get to try the software, it\u2019s tough to tell how the new Apple Watch\u2019s fitness capabilities will compare to accessories from Fitbit. Fitbit\u2019s products are popular partly because the apps are so well designed for monitoring health statistics, including footsteps, calories and weight. So GPS isn\u2019t necessarily the magic bullet.Removing the port for standard headphones means users now have to connect their headphones to the iPhone through the charging port.\u201cFrom the start we designed Lightning to be a great digital audio connector,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.The update may have its detractors in the days after the announcement, but Apple has a long history of making hardware changes that the industry eventually follows, including the decision to change floppy disk sizes in the old Mac days and, more recently, the decision to take away laptop ports. Apple will include new Lightning earbuds, and an adapter, in the box.Why remove the headphone jack, a technology that people seem to like? Mr. Schiller summed it up in one word: \u201cCourage.\u201dPerhaps more important than the earbuds themselves is the wireless technology Apple is using to power them. The company is using Bluetooth, and Apple says its chips improve the technology by connecting faster and using less power. If Apple has perfected a new, proprietary way of doing this, it could prove an important innovation for lots of future wireless products, including home devices, cars and wearables.I\u2019m sure there are minor differences \u2014 the antenna band is different \u2014 but it seems too rich to call it a new design. Too rich, except for Apple.One area where I do give Apple points on the iPhone is the focus on the camera. Apple made a strategic decision a few years ago to plow a lot of development resources into the iPhone camera. That has paid off: The iPhone\u2019s camera has long surpassed most other smartphone cameras, and for many people, it\u2019s better than most stand-alone cameras. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus continue that trend. The Plus model features two cameras, which allows for super-zooming. Even the smaller phone\u2019s camera includes features to improve your snapshots. If the pictures Apple showed off are any guide, the iPhone\u2019s camera is fast closing in on all but the most high-end of cameras. Look forward to more of those \u201cShot on iPhone\u201d billboards.An earlier version of this article misstated the technology Apple is using for its wireless earbuds. It is Bluetooth, improved in a way that Apple says will make it faster and less power-hungry; it is not the case that Apple is not using Bluetooth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Plan: Get Humans to Mars, and Beyond", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUADALAJARA, Mexico \u2014 Elon Musk\u2019s plans to get to Mars start with a really big rocket. He still needs to figure out how to pay for it.For years, Mr. Musk, the billionaire founder of the SpaceX rocket company, has been offering hints and teases of his desire to colonize the big red planet.\u201cWhat you saw there is very close to what we\u2019ll actually build,\u201d Mr. Musk said, referring to the rockets and spacecraft in the video.Mr. Musk estimated it would cost $10 billion to develop the rocket, and he said the first passengers to Mars could take off as soon as 2024 if the plans went off without a hitch. For now, SpaceX is financing development costs of a few tens of millions of dollars a year, but eventually the company would look to some kind of public-private partnership.Each of the SpaceX vehicles would take 100 passengers on the journey to Mars, with trips planned every 26 months, when Earth and Mars pass close to each other. Mr. Musk said the first flights would be \u201cfairly expensive\u201d but ticket prices might eventually fall to between $100,000 and $200,000 a person.To establish a self-sustaining Mars civilization of a million people would take 10,000 flights, with many more to ferry equipment and supplies.\u201cWe\u2019re going to need something quite large to do that,\u201d Mr. Musk said. It would take 40 years to a century before the city on Mars became self-sufficient, he said.The mood at the conference was almost as giddy as a rock concert or the launch of a new Apple product, with people lining up for Mr. Musk\u2019s presentation a couple of hours in advance.Mr. Musk has talked of his \u201cMars Colonial Transporter,\u201d but a couple of weeks ago, he suggested that its capabilities would be much greater.He now calls it the Interplanetary Transport System. The booster would include 42 of SpaceX\u2019s new, more powerful Raptor engines. On Monday, he posted an image on Twitter of the first testing of a Raptor.Mars has long been the goal of Mr. Musk and SpaceX.SpaceX has established a successful business with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket launching satellites, and by taking cargo \u2014 and soon astronauts \u2014 to the International Space Station for NASA. But Mr. Musk has stated often that his loftier goal for SpaceX is to send people to Mars to make humanity a \u201cmultiplanetary species\u201d in order to ensure survival in case some calamity like an asteroid strike befell Earth.The new rocket could be used for even more distant trips, to places like Europa, the icy moon of Jupiter.\u201cThis system really gives you freedom to go anywhere you want in the greater solar system,\u201d he said.What is less clear is how SpaceX will raise the money needed to bring its Mars dreams to fruition. The new rocket is by far the largest ever.Scott Pace, a former NASA official who is the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said Mr. Musk\u2019s vision was plausible technically, but added, \u201cOther than emotional appeal, however, it didn\u2019t really address why governments, corporations or other organizations would fund the effort.\u201d His bottom-line opinion: \u201cPossible, but not probable.\u201dDuring his talk, Mr. Musk put up a slide titled \u201cFunding.\u201d The first item was \u201cSteal underpants,\u201d a joking reference to a \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode. He also listed SpaceX\u2019s businesses \u2014 launching satellites and sending NASA cargo and astronauts to the space station \u2014 and \u201cKickstarter.\u201dBut he admitted that SpaceX would probably not be able to do it alone. \u201cUltimately, this is going to be a huge public-private partnership,\u201d he said.SpaceX has received much of the financing for its rocket development from NASA, from contracts to take cargo to and from the International Space Station. The United States Air Force is providing $33.6 million for development of the Raptor.At a talk here, Robert Meyerson, Blue Origin\u2019s president, said the aim of New Glenn was to take people to space, although it will also be able to launch satellites. The images the company released showed the satellite-carrying version. But Mr. Meyerson disclosed that \u201cthere are other versions that will have a space vehicle on top.\u201dMr. Meyerson said Blue Origin had an even larger rocket, to be called New Armstrong, on the drawing board. Mr. Bezos has said his goal is for millions of people to live in space, although he has not mentioned Mars as a destination.With Mr. Bezos\u2019 Amazon wealth, Blue Origin faces less pressure to be profitable as quickly as SpaceX, or public companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin that have to answer to shareholders.NASA is still talking about its Mars ambitions, too, and its own giant rocket, the Space Launch System, for eventual human missions there. William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said all of the pieces for a crewed Mars mission were in development, at least to reach Mars orbit, by the 2030s and fit within the agency\u2019s existing budget. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a big new budget,\u201d he said.He admitted that in NASA\u2019s plans, astronauts\u2019 setting foot on Mars would take longer, probably not until the 2040s.Mr. Musk was confident that his company could pull off his vision, but he said he would not be among the first colonists, saying he wants to see his children grow up. The chances of dying on that first trip to Mars, he said, are \u201cquite high.\u201dAn article on Sept. 28 about Space X\u2019s plans to send humans to Mars paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Elon Musk, founder of Space X, about the cost of future flights. He said only that initial prices would be fairly expensive \u2014 not that they would initially cost $500,000. (Mr. Musk said the aim would be for ticket prices to fall to less than $200,000.) The article also referred imprecisely to Mr. Musk\u2019s relationship with PayPal when it was acquired by eBay. While he was still a board member and made money from the sale, he was not PayPal\u2019s C.E.O. at the time and he did not sell it to eBay. This correction was delayed because editors did not follow through when the errors were pointed out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.P.O. for Postal Savings Bank of China Gets Help From Beijing", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s biggest banks are struggling with a slowing economy, rising bad debts and shrinking profits.So to raise more than $7 billion in the world\u2019s largest new share sale in two years, a stodgy Chinese bank has sought a little help from its friends.But only a fraction of those shares will be held by nongovernment investors, as Chinese state-run companies have already pledged to buy up most of them.The big I.P.O. is shining a light on the practice, called cornerstone investing, of inviting big investors to buy up large chunks of shares before a company goes public. Though it is less common in other markets, it has been increasingly used by Chinese state firms going public in Hong Kong, where government-controlled companies purchase growing numbers of shares to ensure a smooth offering.Banks tend to go along with the practice because it helps get deals done, but it has come under criticism in the past because it can give plugged-in investors preferential access to new offerings.Postal Savings Bank declined to comment.On the face of it, the I.P.O. recalls a period a decade ago, when an initial wave of offerings by China\u2019s biggest state banks on overseas stock markets resulted in megalistings attracting eager investors among foreign funds and Wall Street banks.Optimism about China\u2019s banks soared with the country\u2019s double-digit economic growth rates, and lenders like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and the Bank of China surpassed traditional names like Citigroup and Bank of America to become the biggest banks in the world by market value.That enthusiasm has been replaced by an increasing wariness of problems with China\u2019s traditional growth model, which relied heavily on state-directed investment to support economic growth. That led to mountains of debt and rampant industrial overcapacity in areas like mining, steel making and other manufacturing businesses.Shares in China\u2019s big banks now trade at less than the reported value of their assets \u2014 a signal that investors do not believe the banks\u2019 books or that they expect more problem loans will crop up.With Postal Savings Bank, more than 75 percent of the shares in the bank\u2019s I.P.O. were presold to so-called cornerstone investors, big buyers that get priority by promising not to sell their stakes for six months. All six cornerstone investors in the deal are entities affiliated with the Chinese government.That state support included about $2 billion from China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation and investments from Shanghai\u2019s main port operator, a regional airline operator and the country\u2019s main power grid company.The postal bank I.P.O. comes amid a relative lull in big listings in Hong Kong. And the deals that have gone through have increasingly relied on cornerstones \u2014 a sign that underlying demand from retail or small investors may be lackluster.For example, cornerstone investors accounted for nearly 80 percent of the shares offered in the June listing of CDB Leasing, a state-backed aircraft leasing company. Last month, Everbright Securities, a state-controlled brokerage, sold nearly 70 percent of its I.P.O. to cornerstones.Last year, cornerstone investors accounted for a record 41 percent of all I.P.O.s in Hong Kong, according to figures from Dealogic, a financial data provider. The previous high was 36 percent in 2012, a difficult year for new listings.Cornerstones last year bought almost $14 billion worth of the $33.6 billion in shares sold through 49 new listings in the city, according to Dealogic.The growing influence of cornerstones in Hong Kong has come under scrutiny, but so far regulators and lawmakers have taken a relatively hands-off approach.\u201cOne undesirable side effect of I.P.O. cornerstone investment is that it takes the pricing process further away from the normal market forces and may have a distortive effect on the company\u2019s market value,\u201d the council wrote in its recommendations.To date, Hong Kong regulators have not moved to limit cornerstone investing. A spokesman for the stock exchange said on Wednesday that it had researched the issue and \u201cfound no conclusive evidence that cornerstone investments narrow the shareholder base.\u201d He added that after last year\u2019s review, the listing committee \u201cdecided that no additional regulation is warranted at this stage.\u201dPostal Savings Bank agreed to sell 12.1 billion shares at 4.76 Hong Kong dollars each, near the bottom of the market range. The offering was helped along by an unusually high number of underwriters \u2014 26 banks in total worked on the deal.Emily Feng contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018The Lovers and the Despot,\u2019 a Harrowing Korean Ordeal", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery so often a documentary has such a head-shakingly bizarre story that alone makes it worth seeing. If you follow the news, this one may sound familiar: In 1986, a popular South Korean actress, Choi Eun-hee, and her ex-husband, a once-successful film director, Shin Sang-ok, entered the United States Embassy in Vienna and said that years earlier they had been kidnapped by North Korea \u2014 where they had been held against their will \u2014 and were now seeking asylum. It was stranger than fiction and also true (mostly, maybe).But did Mr. Shin go willingly or not? That\u2019s a mystery that Mr. Cannan and Mr. Adam play up, though defecting to a totalitarian country seems like a deranged career move, even for a filmmaker down on his luck. The documentary leans toward skepticism about Mr. Shin, which isn\u2019t a singular take. In the book \u201cNorth Korean Cinema: A History,\u201d Johannes Sch\u00f6nherr writes that when Mr. Shin was working in South Korea he \u201cwas not shy when it came to who he was collaborating with.\u201d Collaborating is such a heavy word, and implies so much. Perhaps Mr. Shin wasn\u2019t always especially discriminating, but, then, he worked in movies and mercenariness tends to come with the territory.Despite its flaws and will to kitsch, \u201cThe Lovers and the Despot\u201d has enough enigmas and chills to merit a look, even if some of its spookier moments involve cinephilia rather than the usual weapons of mass destruction. Yet while Mr. Cannan and Mr. Adam certainly engage Mr. Kim\u2019s extreme movie love, there\u2019s so much more to explore, including the contents of his film library, which is said to have included 15,000 titles. Mr. Kim even wrote a book, \u201cOn the Art of the Cinema\u201d (1973), in which he writes that \u201cdirectors must focus on stimulating people\u2019s emotions rather than on the logical connection of events.\u201d You can buy it on Amazon, where it has a four-star rating.\u201cThe Lovers and the Despot\u201d is not rated. It is in English and Korean, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Crisis in Six Scenes,\u2019 a Mere Ghost of Woody Allen Past", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn recent years, Mr. Allen\u2019s movies have swung wildly in quality, alternating real highs (\u201cMidnight in Paris,\u201d \u201cVicky Cristina Barcelona\u201d) with definite lows (\u201cHollywood Ending,\u201d \u201cIrrational Man\u201d). \u201cCrisis,\u201d a six-episode mini-series available on Friday from Amazon, sits in between. It\u2019s closer to the low end, but for fans of a certain earlier strain of his work, its shambling, amiable vibe may seem comfortingly familiar.But \u201cCrisis\u201d also seems inconsequential, as if Mr. Allen, faced with filling not quite three hours of screen time, emptied his notebook and strung together a series of comic set pieces that don\u2019t quite add up to a story. A few of the scenes are funny in themselves \u2014 one in particular, a self-referential bit featuring Mr. Allen\u2019s character pitching a TV series to a pair of stone-faced young executives, is close to vintage. Most of them, however, have a ghostlike semblance of humor. You can see where the laughs are supposed to be, because you\u2019ve seen Mr. Allen do this kind of thing before. But here he\u2019s just going through the motions.\u201cCrisis\u201d appears to be set in the late 1960s, around the time Mr. Allen, already a veteran comedy writer for TV and film, was embarking on his career as a director. He plays Sidney J. Munsinger, a longtime advertising copywriter and sometime novelist who, late in life, has decided he wants to break into TV. The crisis of the title occurs when his comfortable suburban existence is disrupted by the arrival of Lennie (Miley Cyrus), a young, fugitive radical (she bombed a draft board) who\u2019s connected to his wife, Kay, and needs a place to hide out.There are plot complications involving Lennie\u2019s plans to flee to Cuba, which require Sid and Kay (Elaine May) to go into New York and conduct some slapstick skulduggery reminiscent of \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery.\u201d But the setup is primarily an excuse for Mr. Allen to do the befuddled-exasperation shtick he perfected a half-century ago (and is still pretty good at). Sid waves his arms and insists that Lennie leave; Lennie ignores him, eats all the food in the house and quickly radicalizes Kay, who\u2019s drawn to her youthful energy, and Alan (John Magaro), a young family friend who\u2019s drawn to her more physical attributes.The story resolves itself in one of those circuslike endings where waves of people \u2014 relatives, Kay\u2019s marriage-counseling clients, a book club, a pair of gun-toting anarchists \u2014 show up at Sid and Kay\u2019s house all loudly demanding attention. It\u2019s supposed to be zany fun, but as with most of the rest of \u201cCrisis,\u201d Mr. Allen\u2019s halfhearted direction doesn\u2019t get it there. The pleasures the show offers are mostly in performance \u2014 Ms. May and Mr. Magaro give their characters some life, and Mr. Allen, of course, has his own rhythms down pat. He also gives himself the best lines, as when Sid, describing his first novel, says: \u201cIt was called \u2018Let There Be Light.\u2019 It was about a proctologist who finds God in the strangest places.\u201dThroughout the show, the notion of TV as a lesser endeavor pops up. When the crisis has passed, Sid says, \u201cMaybe I should dump this whole idiotic television series thing and give one last shot to writing the book.\u201d Presumably Mr. Allen is just making fun of Sid\u2019s pretensions. But watching \u201cCrisis,\u201d you can\u2019t help wishing that rather than making his first show at the age of 80, he\u2019d just avoided the whole television series thing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018American Honey\u2019: Open Highways, Free Spirits", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeveral years ago, on one of the many road trips around the United States that served as research for her new film, \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d the English director Andrea Arnold was driving through the South learning how to dance. She ended up inadvertently following a tornado.\u201cI would try to stop somewhere I could go dancing every single night, so I was doing two-step, Cajun two-step, blues,\u201d Ms. Arnold said in a recent interview, explaining that her path kept taking her into areas that people were being told to avoid. \u201cI thought, I probably need a bit of a tornado lesson.\u201dThe nearly three-hour \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d in theaters on Friday, Sept. 30, carries that sense of embracing chaos into a tale of young, anarchic rejects (mostly played by nonactors that Ms. Arnold discovered on her trips) who travel around the Midwest in a van selling magazine subscriptions in the suburbs.Star (Sasha Lane, who had no acting experience when Ms. Arnold approached her on a beach in Florida), is a young woman who runs away from a terrible home life to join a 15-person mag crew she encounters at a Kmart. Lured by the promise of escape and attraction to the crew\u2019s top salesman (Shia LaBeouf), she signs on with the group, and the journey takes her through a series of allegorical challenges.Seated around a table at the New York offices of A24, the distributor that released \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d five of the actors playing mag crew members recalled the experience after a night out in New York following the film\u2019s premiere.\u201cWhen they talked to me, I was like, \u2018Are you sure it\u2019s not a porno? Because I\u2019m not down with that,\u2019\u201d said Raymond Coalson, 22, whom Ms. Arnold met at a county fair in West Virginia. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know where we were going, what we were doing, who was coming; there was always new people, places.\u201dMcCaul Lombardi, 25, one of the few who had previous credits, said: \u201cIf Andrea was here right now, she\u2019d tell you that what she was looking for was \u2018the light being on\u2019 in people. It\u2019s not like she was like, \u2018Oh, I need you guys to say this, or do this,\u2019 because if it was happening, most people wouldn\u2019t even listen. It was organized chaos.\u201dMs. Arnold explained that she had written \u201cnot terribly specific characters\u201d and that the actors were hired based on those descriptions. \u201cBut then, because we\u2019re casting real people, when they came, they were being themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThey rebelled against a lot of anything that was too controlling.\u201dThe mag crew\u2019s rapport is a large part of the narrative. Riley Keough (\u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d and the Starz series \u201cThe Girlfriend Experience\u201d) plays the team\u2019s coldly detached leader, who makes the two lowest earners fight each other each week. Ms. Arnold juxtaposes images of highways and open spaces, leafy neighborhoods and seedy motels, with drinking and drug use, set to a soundtrack of contemporary hip-hop (Kevin Gates, Juicy J) and pop (Rihanna\u2019s \u201cWe Found Love\u201d and Lady Antebellum\u2019s song from which the film takes its title).To shoot scenes for the film\u2019s other thread, Star\u2019s evolution and her romance with Jake (Mr. LaBeouf), Ms. Arnold pulled Ms. Lane aside for extended periods, which left the remaining cast members to their own devices. Perhaps for the benefit of the onscreen chemistry (and to the film crew\u2019s torment), the down time seems to have been a bit like \u201cLord of the Flies.\u201d\u201cI shot a porcupine with a 9-mill,\u201d said Dakota Powers, 18, whom Ms. Arnold found in the parking lot of a nightclub in Panama City Beach, Fla., and who became the self-proclaimed ringleader of a series of superglue pranks on the cast and crew.\u201cThey superglued my hand to my face,\u201d said Isaiah Stone, 21, whose credits include \u201cWinter\u2019s Bone\u201d (2010). \u201cI\u2019d wake up, my hair was superglued.\u201dMr. Coalson remembered one of the producers, Lars Knudsen, \u201cwalking around worried \u2014 he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh God, one of them is going to die, where\u2019d they go? What are they doing?\u2019\u201dIn much of Ms. Arnold\u2019s work, her eye often trains itself on small details: flower petals or tree branches scraping against windows. And \u201cAmerican Honey\u201d has no shortage of images ripe with metaphor \u2014 insects trapped against windows, a ditch full of blood, a trio of monochromatic cowboys in a Cadillac.\u201cWhen they showed up on the day, with their white hats and their white car, I just thought: What is that? That\u2019s just come out of my head \u2014 it\u2019s like out of a David Lynch film,\u201d Ms. Arnold recalled, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from somewhere, and I\u2019m sure lots of people will make some kind of \u2014 I\u2019m looking forward to seeing all the more in-depth interpretations, because they\u2019ll probably teach me a thing or two.\u201dLess open to interpretation is the film\u2019s portrayal of American poverty and its effects. The opening scene takes place in a Dumpster, with Star scrounging for food, and the mag crew travels through a number of economically depressed towns and neighborhoods. Even without back stories, the film\u2019s peripheral characters \u2014 a truck driver, an oil worker (played by an oil worker Ms. Arnold met at a Walmart in North Dakota), the neglected children of a drug addict \u2014 are fragments of poor, white America. And as transients, the fictional mag crew members themselves have no place in society.\u201cIt\u2019s an English director, but you have the most American kids as the cast \u2014 you have America as the cast,\u201d Mr. Lombardi said. \u201cWe were showing the youth that\u2019s forgot about.\u201dIt\u2019s not a political film, per se, but it is difficult not to view it as prescient. So as the surreal American election barrels tumultuously toward a conclusion, perhaps an outsider can most accurately portray the culture that produced it.\u201cIf I\u2019m making something, it\u2019s going to be influenced by me and what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Ms. Arnold said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be like a huge truth, because everyone\u2019s truth is different. I\u2019ve experienced America in a completely different way to anybody else, so it\u2019s going to be my version.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Amazon Arrives, the Campus Bookstore Is a Books Store No More", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey had not heard yet that the bookstore was a books store no more.This summer, Stony Brook, part of the State University of New York, announced a partnership with the online retailer Amazon, now the university\u2019s official book retailer. Students can purchase texts through a Stony Brook-specific Amazon page and have them delivered to campus.In the campus store where the textbooks used to be, there are now adult coloring books, racks of university-branded polos and windbreakers and three narrow bookshelves displaying assorted novels. The rest of the store is a vibrant collage of spirit wear and school supplies: backpacks and baseball caps; pompom hats and striped scarves; notebooks and correction fluid. There will soon be a Starbucks.\u201cI was a bit thrown off by the appearance,\u201d Mr. Adames said.It is a conversation occurring on campuses across the country: If more and more students are buying and renting their course books online, why do they need a bookstore?\u201cThere are certainly some growing pains in getting used to it for many students,\u201d Dr. Rockman said. \u201cI think the human condition is not to really love change.\u201dThe shift at Stony Brook is an attempt to provide more affordable options to students, according to Peter Baigent, the university\u2019s vice president for student affairs. Amazon is \u201cmore of a marketplace,\u201d where students can comparison shop, he said, as opposed to a conventional, fixed-price store. Eventually, students will be able to order texts for delivery to an Amazon area, which is still under construction, and pick them up from storage lockers.Ripley MacDonald, director of Amazon Student Programs, said the company was also the primary course materials provider for Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Neither campus currently has a brick-and-mortar textbook store, and as at Stony Brook, the former bookstore in Amherst now sells novels and campus merchandise but not textbooks.Purdue students can still buy textbooks from stores just off campus, including one that calls itself University Bookstore.Other schools are using Amazon as a supplementary course materials provider, Mr. MacDonald said. Amazon has opened pickup locations at 12 universities since 2015, he said, and will have 17 by the end of this year.Stony Brook, like other universities working in partnership with Amazon, receives a percentage of the sales taking place on the Amazon site, said Mark Pace, the chief contracts administrator for the university\u2019s Faculty Student Association. Mr. Pace declined to say how much that amounted to, saying it was \u201cproprietary, confidential financial information.\u201dRobert D. Wynkoop, managing director of Purdue University treasurer\u2019s office, told The Chronicle that the school had made $1 million on the partnership since 2014.\u201cIf they save five bucks and have a miserable week because they can\u2019t even get the damn thing, what good is that?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that people can\u2019t figure these things out, it\u2019s just a hassle.\u201dKevin Costello, a sophomore studying biomedical engineering at Stony Brook, politely vented his \u201cfrustration and confusion\u201d when he learned that employees at the former bookstore could not help when Amazon sent him the wrong course material.\u201cNow I\u2019m going to have to be on the phone with customer service for a while, probably,\u201d said Mr. Costello, who received a disc meant for a political science class instead of his calculus course material. \u201cThere needs to be a better system.\u201dEventually, students will be able to take their questions to the Amazon pickup area, where the staff will provide customer service.According to Mr. Walton, textbooks are generally not the focus of college bookstores, anyway. A school on a two-semester system has an approximately eight-week period of textbook activity per year, he estimated.\u201cThe function of the store has been oversimplified to textbooks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe store really functions on a variety of levels.\u201dAdmissions tour groups pass through; visiting alumni stop by; faculty and staff members go there for the convenience, Mr. Walton said.\u201cIf anything\u2019s in danger, I would say the thing that\u2019s probably the danger is that textbooks are going to go away,\u201d he said. \u201cThe store continues to serve a number of functions that people just don\u2019t recognize.\u201dAt Stony Brook, the former bookstore has become \u201ca branding piece,\u201d Mr. Baigent said, which helps to provide more of a \u201ccampus university identity.\u201dBarnes & Noble College, which operated the Stony Brook store when it sold textbooks, will continue to run it, and is also taking over the other two campus stores, neither of which sell textbooks.Barnes & Noble College Bookstores dropped \u201cbookstores\u201d from its name several years ago.\u201cOver the last eight years, our business has really changed dramatically,\u201d Patrick Maloney, the company president, said. \u201cTo call it a bookstore any longer was very limiting.\u201dHowever, 98 percent of the stores Barnes & Noble College operates still carry course materials in various formats, Mr. Maloney said.\u201cWe firmly believe in the importance of a physical store,\u201d Lisa Malat, the chief marketing officer, said. \u201cMillennials and Gen Z are still very much committed to the physical shopping experience.\u201dThough perhaps not only for books: In recent years, Barnes & Noble College has been offering engagement programs to bring students into its bookstores nationwide, like \u201cV.I.P. shopping nights,\u201d for students who want help in the textbook aisles or advice from peers, and \u201cde-stress events,\u201d where students can spend time coloring, or play with puppies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Insomnia Machine", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 1914, The Lancet reported on a clergyman who was found dead in a pool; he had left behind this suicide note: \u201cAnother sleepless night, no real sleep for weeks. Oh, my poor brain, I cannot bear the lengthy, dark hours of the night.\u201dI came across that passage with a shock of recognition. Many people think that the worst part of insomnia is the daytime grogginess. But like that pastor, I suffered most in the dark hours after midnight, when my desire for sleep, my raging thirst for it, would drive me into temporary insanity. On the worst nights, my mind would turn into a mad dog that snapped and gnawed itself.Though one in 10 American adults suffer from chronic insomnia, we have yet to answer the most fundamental questions about the affliction. Scientists are still arguing about the mechanisms of sleep and the reasons it fails in seemingly healthy people. There are few \u2014 if any \u2014 reliable treatments for insomnia. At the same time, medical journals warn that bad sleep can fester into diseases like cancer and diabetes. Deep in the night, those warnings scuttle around my mind like rats.About 18 months ago, during a particularly grueling period, I felt so desperate that I consulted yet another doctor \u2014 but all he did was suggest the same drugs that had failed me in the past. I was thrown back once again on my own ways of coping. As a child, I had invented mental games to distract myself. For instance, I would compile a list of things and people that made me happy, starting with words that began with A and moving through the alphabet.One night, I was in the Qs, trying to figure out what to add to quesadillas, queer theory and Questlove. Then, suddenly, the game infuriated me \u2014 why, why, why did I have to spend hours doing this? In the red glare of the digital clock, my brain rattled its cage. I prepared for a wave of lunacy.But instead of a meltdown, I had a wild idea: What if there was another, easier, way to drive the miserable thoughts from my mind?I began to fantasize about a machine that would do the thinking for me. I pictured it like another brain that would fit on top of my head. The next day, I cobbled together my first insomnia machine.Though millions of us struggle with chronic insomnia, we\u2019re not a unified army fighting the same foe. Every one of us is grappling with a different mix of mental and physical dysfunctions. Dozens of medical conditions deprive people of sleep; these include apnea, Parkinson\u2019s disease, chronic pain, depression, brain injury, autism and restless legs syndrome.For a while I followed the rules of \u201csleep hygiene\u201d \u2014 a tough-love approach that includes dragging yourself out of bed during wakeful periods, and allowing yourself to crawl back under the covers only when you feel sleepy. But I never felt sleepy. And in our frigid New England house in winter, it was excruciating to be exiled from the wool blankets; I felt humiliated, like a bad dog, as I put one foot and then another down on the cold floor and slunk off to another room. Even the name of the therapy shamed me: The word \u201chygiene\u201d had an old-fashioned sting to it, an implication that the way I slept was filthy and needed to be scoured.So that\u2019s why I \u2014 the dirty, disreputable insomniac \u2014 took matters into my own hands. I found a stretchy sock that was long enough to wrap around my head like a blindfold. Then I sewed the sock into a circle, from toe to topstitch, making sure it fit securely, so that it would stay in place no matter how I tossed and turned on the pillow. I cut two slits in the inner layer of fabric, sewing stitches to create button-hole-like openings. And then I found an old pair of earbuds, sewed foam around each bud, and threaded the foam-bumps into holes in the headgear. This way, the gizmo would hold the speakers near my ears, but not in them \u2014 more comfortable for sleeping. Once I had finished, I attached a cheap MP3 player (made by SanDisk) to the rig. Now I could roll my head around, doze, slumber or pad to the bathroom, all while listening to the new voice in my head.My boyfriend said that he felt as if he were sleeping next to a hostage. But weird as it looked, the device offered relief. I\u2019d cue up an audiobook and a monologue would commence, blotting out my own thoughts. Instead of laboring to calm myself, I could just drift on the voice pumped into my head. I began to wear the machine all night long, floating in and out of sleep, comforted that whatever happened, the narrator would stay with me.After I\u2019d built my headgear, I discovered companies were selling similar devices online \u2014 usually in the form of fleece headbands outfitted with flat earphones. I tried some out, but I found they weren\u2019t snug enough to stay in place, so I still use my D.I.Y. gear.Of course, the insomnia machine is a humble hack. The real challenge lay in curating the audio: It took trial and error to find material that could tame my midnight mind.At first, I loaded the machine with the kind of dry disquisitions that, according to conventional wisdom, bring on sleep; I turned to books like \u201cDirt: The Erosion of Civilizations,\u201d an important jeremiad about soil quality that is not super-entertaining. But the drone in my ears didn\u2019t keep my mind busy enough, so instead I began to pick out funny, engaging and friendly books. When I enjoyed those hours of wakefulness, I no longer tried to sleep, and when I stopped trying to sleep, I slept.The slow pace of 19th-century novels and memoirs is perfect for an insomnia machine: You fall asleep when the characters are having dinner, and when you wake up they\u2019ve only reached the drawing room. It feels as if you\u2019re surrounded by friends, dozing comfortably in a corner as life carries on.\u201cHow is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!\u201d Rostov thought. His horse had collapsed underneath him, and blood streamed from the poor creature\u2019s head. Rostov staggered to his feet and looked around the empty meadow, feeling as if he must be in a dream. Was he in enemy territory? Where were the other soldiers?And now I was sleeping. Wakefulness, that galloping horse, had fallen to the ground underneath me. I waded through fields of grass while Tolstoy monologued at me. I wanted to warn him to shut up and take cover, for Napoleon\u2019s spies watched us from the hillside, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. Still, I was glad to have Tolstoy by my side, leading me through that desolate meadow.Literature did not cure my insomnia, but transformed it into a manageable condition, and so I feel enormously grateful to the internet and its crowd of volunteers for providing thousands of hours of literary medicine. I think of Jorge Luis Borges, who lamented that he had been put in charge of Argentina\u2019s National Library after he\u2019d gone blind and was unable to peruse a single page. Today we live in a splendor that Borges might have dreamed into existence, a library we can stumble through in the dark.In 1886, the author Franklin Harvey Head reported that his contemporaries regarded insomnia as a \u201cmodern and even an almost distinctively American disease\u201d brought about by the hustle-bustle of the railroad and the telegraph. As wires spread across the country and incandescent bulbs burned away the stars, some warned about what would happen when electrification spread into rural towns. Surely, chickens would die of insomnia \u2014 and presumably the farmers, too.Whenever a new technology comes along, we inevitably blame it for ruining our sleep. Today, we believe that phones and laptops will scramble our sleep, even though the evidence of that is thin. Few studies have been done to find out whether digital media can set off insomnia in adults, and the findings of what research has been done tend to be contradictory. Nonetheless, many health professionals recommend that we banish all digital devices from our bedrooms.Most important, the internet is becoming a place for insomniacs to gather together and figure out what works, to share insights and help one another.For instance, in 2013, Drew Ackerman created a podcast to lead listeners into slumberland. Now, three times a week, he climbs into a makeshift studio in the back of a closet and spins whimsical stories about matters of no importance. \u201cFasten your sleep-belts,\u201d he might murmur in a codeine drawl before jumping into a tale about the glug-glug-glug sound of a water cooler.Mr. Ackerman has no training as a sleep doctor or health professional. He, too, found salvation from insomnia in audiobooks, specifically aboard the Pequod, squinting out at the 19th-century sea as he floated along on Melville\u2019s words. That experience led him to wonder whether he could fine-tune audio as a therapy.Nowadays, about 70,000 listeners download each episode of his podcast, and reviewers attest to the power of this treatment. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled to fall asleep for most of my 37 years,\u201d writes DaileyComputer. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything \u2014 changing my diet, exercise, meditation, pills, you name it.\u201d He continues: \u201cNothing helps consistently. Except this podcast.\u201dMr. Ackerman treats insomnia as a disease of existential loneliness. \u201cI hear from so many people who listen to the podcast while their partners are sound asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might be in bed with somebody who loves them. But in that situation, it\u2019s the deep dark night, and you\u2019re all alone.\u201dAnd so Mr. Ackerman has created an alter ego named Dearest Scooter who hosts the show and acts as your \u201cbore-friend.\u201d In the bunk bed of your mind, he\u2019s the compassionate brother lying a few feet above you, a voice in the darkness promising he\u2019ll talk until you drift off.He\u2019s also the antithesis of the sleep-hygiene therapists. He doesn\u2019t shame, he commiserates; he knows how horrible insomnia is, and he\u2019s here for you.\u201cPeople need to be validated,\u201d Mr. Ackerman said. \u201cIf I\u2019m thirsty, I drink; if I\u2019m hungry, I can eat. But when I want to sleep, that\u2019s not under my control. And that\u2019s why this is such a painful mystery.\u201dSo many of us are muddling along, finding relief where we can get it. At least we have one another. At 2 in the morning, with my insomnia machine strapped to my head, I listen to a volunteer reading George Meredith\u2019s \u201cThe Egoist\u201d in a South Indian lilt. As every parent knows, there is magic in the human voice telling a story; this is the oldest and most primitive insomnia treatment. In the dark hours, when we\u2019re wandering in the wilderness of thought, sometimes we just need to feel that someone, even a digital someone with a prerecorded voice, is watching over us.Listening to 19th-century novels and memoirs helps Pagan Kennedy defeat insomnia.

{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Newest Technology Innovation: Priest Delivery", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAKAI, Japan \u2014 The stubble-haired Buddhist priest lit incense at a small, cupboardlike altar just as members of his order have done for centuries. As the priest chanted sutras, Yutaka Kai closed his eyes and prayed for his wife, who died last year of complications from a knee replacement.Mr. Kai, 68, set aside his family\u2019s devout Buddhism when he left his rural hometown decades ago to work in a tire factory. That meant Mr. Kai did not have a local temple to turn to for the first anniversary of his wife\u2019s death, a milestone for Japanese Buddhists.Cue the internet. In modern Japan, a Buddhist priest can now be found just a few mouse clicks away, on Amazon.com.\u201cIt\u2019s affordable, and the price is clear,\u201d said Mr. Kai\u2019s eldest son, Shuichi, 40. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about how much you\u2019re supposed to give.\u201dThe priest at Mrs. Kai\u2019s memorial, Junku Soko, is part of a controversial business that is disrupting traditional funeral arrangements in Japan. In a country where regulations and powerful interests have stymied much of the so-called gig economy \u2014 Uber, for instance, is barely a blip here \u2014 a network of freelancing priests is making gains in the unlikely sphere of religion.But the priests and their backers say they are addressing real needs. They assert that obosan-bin is helping to preserve Buddhist traditions by making them accessible to the millions of people in Japan who have become estranged from the religion.\u201cTemples will sell you 10 yen candles for 100 yen,\u201d said Mr. Soko, 39. \u201cThey\u2019re protecting their own interests.\u201dSuch arguments will be familiar to anyone who has watched e-commerce companies upend other parts of the economy, from book publishing to airlines, taxis and hotels.Yet religion may prove to be an exception. It is so opaque \u2014 and so removed from the day-to-day lives of many modern Japanese \u2014 that a little technological disruption may prove welcome.The stakes are material as well as spiritual. As with religious institutions in many other countries, temples in Japan receive generous tax breaks.As with adherents of many religions, Buddhists typically give donations to priests for their services. Proponents of obosan-bin argue that conventional temples already operate like businesses \u2014 ones that put customers at a disadvantage though murky pricing. The amount is left up to the donor, a custom that leads many to overpay, Mr. Soko said.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to make things clear,\u201d he said.Much of the reaction in Japan to obosan-bin has been positive, for equally familiar reasons: It offers convenience and low, predictable prices.\u201cThere has been fierce criticism from the Buddhist world, but these days many people are abandoning religious funerals altogether,\u201d said Noriyuki Ueda, an anthropologist who studies Buddhism at Tokyo Institute of Technology. \u201cAt least people using obosan-bin think having a priest is necessary.\u201dMr. Kakubo of the Buddhist federation conceded that many temples had done a poor job of adapting.\u201cWe need to reflect on the fact that we\u2019ve created this situation where people feel that they have to turn to the internet,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAre we protecting our vested interests? Yes, obviously.\u201dThe process of booking a priest on Amazon can feel disconcertingly secular. Users click on one of several options and add it to a virtual shopping cart, the same way they would a juicer or a pair of shoes. Prices are fixed. A basic memorial ceremony at the home of the deceased costs \u00a535,000, or about $344.The most expensive package, with a second service at a cemetery and the granting of a special posthumous Buddhist name, costs \u00a565,000.The company has added another 100 priests to meet demand generated by its new partnership with Amazon, said Jumpei Masano, a spokesman. It expects bookings to increase by 20 percent this year, to around 12,000.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have any connection with a temple, so they don\u2019t know where to turn or what to do when they have to arrange a funeral,\u201d Mr. Masano said. \u201cWe saw there was a need.\u201dAmazon declined to comment. In a written reply to the Buddhist association in April, reported by Japanese news media, it said its goal was \u201cto provide as much information as possible\u201d to its users so they \u201ccan make their own decisions.\u201dWhen Mr. Kai\u2019s wife, Chieko, died, her funeral was held at a secular funeral parlor. But for the anniversary, Mr. Kai decided he wanted a priest.\u201cWe had a big altar in the house where I grew up, but not here,\u201d he said, gesturing around his small, tidy apartment in a public housing complex.He said he rarely thought about religion until his wife\u2019s death. In the years after World War II, rural dwellers like Mr. Kai poured into places like Sakai, an industrial suburb of Osaka. Relatively few bothered to put down new religious roots in the city.Today, 70 percent of Japanese identify themselves in surveys as nonreligious or atheist, though many said they still followed traditional religious customs such as going to a Shinto shrine at New Year or periodically visiting their ancestors\u2019 graves.Mr. Kai\u2019s daughter-in-law found Minrevi\u2019s website. Her only request was that the priest should belong to the order to which the Kai family had belonged in his hometown, in Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku.Mr. Soko fit the bill. At the ceremony, which took place in Mr. Kai\u2019s apartment, Mr. Soko delivered a short homily about faith and remembering the dead.The Kais seemed satisfied: They said they would request Mr. Soko for the next important death anniversary, in two years\u2019 time.Mr. Soko said innovations like obosan-bin are vital to Buddhism\u2019s survival. Most temples\u2019 dues-paying congregations are shrinking as a result of social change and rural depopulation.Incomes are shrinking, too.

But who can blame the Oxford editors for dumping Amazon words for Amazon.com ones? Our natural world is rapidly disappearing. Just how fast was the major topic here last week at the global conference held every four years by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which I participated in along with some 8,000 scientists, nature reserve specialists and environmentalists.The dominant theme running through the I.U.C.N.\u2019s seminars was the fact that we are bumping up against and piercing planetary boundaries \u2014 on forests, oceans, ice melt, species extinctions and temperature \u2014 from which Mother Nature will not be able to recover. When the coral and elephants are all gone, no 3-D printer will be able to recreate them.In short, we and our kids are rapidly becoming the Noah generation, charged with saving the last pairs. (This is no time to be electing a climate-change denier like Donald Trump for president.)Sylvia Earle, the renowned oceanographer, put it well to a sustainability conference hosted here by the East-West Center alongside the I.U.C.N. meetings. In her lifetime, said Earle, she has felt as if she\u2019s been \u201cwitness to the greatest era of discovery and the greatest era of loss\u201d in our planet\u2019s history.So now, she said, \u201cwe are at a crossroads. What we do right now or fail to do will determine the future \u2014 not just for us, but for all life on earth.\u201dO.K., so you don\u2019t care that your kids may never see an elephant in the wild, only in a zoo. That\u2019s not all. The species extinction rate is now about \u201c1,000 times faster than before the global spread of humanity,\u201d explained the great biodiversity expert E. O. Wilson, another speaker here. \u201cHalf of the species described today will be gone by the end of the century, unless we take drastic action.\u201dThese species, he noted, evolved over 3.5 billion years \u201cto create an exquisite and careful balance of interconnected resilience.\u201d These plants and animals and their ecosystems sustain the foundations of life on which we depend. When we lose the trees that maintain watersheds, the coastal mangroves that protect against storm surges, the glaciers that store fresh water and the coral reefs that feed fish, we humans become less resilient. Indeed, strip them all away, said Wilson, \u201cand the world as we know it will unravel.\u201dThe magazine Discover just noted that we\u2019ve been tracking average temperature over global land and ocean surfaces since 1880 \u2014 or for 1,639 months. Due to global warming, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that July 2016 was the hottest \u201cof all 1,639 months on record.\u201d\u201cOur vast oceans, full of mysteries and wonders, are thick with plastic and mercury,\u201d she noted. \u201cRain forests \u2014 abundant sources of oxygen and medicine; land of ancient lore and tradition; home to thousands of species of wildlife, many as yet unknown to us \u2014 are being plowed down before we have a chance to properly discover what it is we are losing.\u201cThese are lungs of the earth, the oceans and the forests, and we are destroying them. Deeply, desperately, we are hoping someone will do something before it is too late. That someone we are hoping for is you.\u201dRight now, the I.U.C.N. says, close to 15 percent of the earth\u2019s land and 10 percent of its territorial waters are covered by national parks and protected areas. If we protect half the global surface, Wilson argues, the fraction of species protected will be about 85 percent, which would keep life on earth, including the human species, in a safe zone.Na\u00efve, you say? Not so. Na\u00efve is thinking we humans will survive without the healthy natural systems that got us here. Na\u00efvet\u00e9 is the new realism \u2014 or else we, the human species, will become just another bad biological experiment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon and Pandora to Gauge Music\u2019s Value in the Internet Age", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow much are people willing to spend for streaming music?For years, thanks to rigid pricing structures at streaming services, the answer has been stuck at $10 a month or nothing. But that model may soon be challenged by two giants of online media: Amazon and Pandora Media.Both companies are set to introduce new versions of their streaming services in coming weeks, charging as little as $5 a month, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process was ongoing. The plans will put pressure on incumbent players like Spotify and Apple Music and offer the music industry a major test regarding the value of streaming music \u2014 including the crucial question of whether discounts will be enough to entice people to pay anything when virtually every song is also available free.The pricing model of $10 a month, the standard rate charged by most on-demand streaming services, has been compared to the 99 cents that Apple charged for song downloads when it opened the iTunes music store in 2003 \u2014 a simple and comprehensible amount that established in consumers\u2019 minds the value of music in the internet age.But many in the business have argued that $10 a month is too high for casual listeners. At $120 a year, it costs more than most people have historically paid for music. According to MusicWatch, a market research firm, the average music customer in the United States will pay about $67 this year on recorded music, up from $55 last year but down from $80 in 1999, around the peak of the CD market.The streaming market is divided between internet radio services like Pandora, which offer songs tailored to listeners\u2019 tastes but do not let them choose exactly what songs to hear, and so-called on-demand services, like Spotify and Apple Music, which let users pick specific songs and create playlists.Pandora is expected to make the first move by unveiling, perhaps as early as this week, an expanded version of its $5 subscription platform. That service, which is currently limited to removing ads on its internet radio streams, will soon begin offering customers new features like the ability to skip more unwanted songs and store several hours\u2019 worth of playlists online, according to three people with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s plans.By Christmas, according to these people, Pandora wants to introduce a fully developed competitor to Spotify and Apple Music, with a catalog of tens of millions of songs that a listener can gain access to on demand. That version is expected to cost $10 a month, in line with the current market.For both companies, the new streaming offerings represent variations on the existing models, with a mix of new features that are intended to entice casual listeners into paying a minimal fee without eroding the ranks of customers who are willing to pay more.Amazon and Pandora have spent months negotiating new licensing terms with record companies and music publishers to allow their new streaming offerings, and they are close to completing those deals, according to the people briefed on the plans. Representatives of both companies declined to comment.That episode, technology executives say, was a window into a little-understood reality of the streaming business: that prices are indirectly enforced through the licensing contracts that services sign with record companies.Yet while the headline prices have been stuck at $10 a month, analysts and music executives say that a range of discounts and promotions has made it difficult to gauge what customers are really willing to pay. Most offer family plans, student discounts and introductory trials.Major corporate players like Amazon and Pandora do not face such basic questions of financial viability. But there are still doubts about whether lower price points will make any difference to consumers. YouTube makes virtually any song available free, and, much to the chagrin of the record companies, it is widely considered the most popular online source for music around the world. Spotify, in addition to its $10 premium service, also has a free version supported by advertising.Russ Crupnick, the managing partner of MusicWatch, the market research company, said his research showed that subscribers to premium services like Spotify were pleased with the product and willing to pay. Furthermore, such customers were also likely to pay for other media subscriptions, like to Netflix, Showtime and so on.But for less engaged consumers, he said, particularly those who are satisfied with radio or free streaming on YouTube, it may take much more to get them to buy a subscription.\u201cI don\u2019t know that you get the casual listener to automatically be a superfan just by lowering the price,\u201d Mr. Crupnick said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Delays Vote on Cable Set-Top Boxes", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators on Thursday delayed a vote on a proposal to reshape the television market by freeing consumers from cable box rentals, putting into doubt a plan that has pitted technology companies against cable television providers.Members of the Federal Communications Commission could not agree on a set-top box proposal that requires cable operators to provide their shows and movies on alternative devices rather than just on a cable box. The plan was intended to bring more competition to the television industry and liberate consumers from an average of $231 in annual cable box fees.The proposal will still be considered for a future vote. But Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., said commissioners needed more discussions. Even late Wednesday evening, members of the F.C.C. were negotiating over disagreements and concerns over the proposal.\u201cIt was simply a matter of running out of time,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said in a news conference Thursday after the F.C.C.\u2019s planned monthly meeting.The window of opportunity for Mr. Wheeler to adopt his signature regulation on cable and satellite boxes is growing smaller. With the change of administration after the election, he is under pressure to pass through several ambitious regulations before the end of the year.Ms. Rosenworcel, in a joint statement with the two other Democrats on the five-member commission, said on Thursday morning that she supported the goal of the proposal, to create more competition in the television box market.\u201cWe are still working to resolve the remaining technical and legal issues and we are committed to unlocking the set-top box for consumers across this country,\u201d the three commissioners said.Under the proposed rules, consumers would be able to watch cable shows on devices like a Roku or Apple TV, or on no devices at all with internet-enabled televisions. Getting rid of the cable box would make finding and watching YouTube and Netflix streaming videos as easy as viewing cable programs because they would be presented in what would look like just another app.\u201cThe M.P.A.A. is pleased that the F.C.C. is taking more time, and we hope they use it to ensure any set-top box proposal remains consistent with copyright policy and avoids harming creators,\u201d said Chris Dodd, chairman of Hollywood\u2019s trade group, the Motion Picture Association of America.And recent changes made to address these concerns do \u201cnot solve the copyright, privacy, innovation and other significant concerns that were implicated in this discredited original proposal,\u201d said David Cohen, Comcast\u2019s senior executive vice president, adding that the plan \u201csuffers from the same legal infirmities.\u201dThe regulations would remove a crucial part of the cable television industry\u2019s model of forcing consumers to rent the boxes that showcase their own bundle of channels, analysts say. Making cable programming another app on a device like a TiVo would expose viewers to more streaming content that is directly competing against the paid-TV bundle.\u201cThis is the last gateway to the internet and this is a battle between open and closed platforms,\u201d said Chip Pickering, president of Incompas, a lobbying group that represents Google and Amazon in support of the plan.Backers of the plan were disappointed with the delay, which could put the proposal in jeopardy.\u201cToday\u2019s vote delay is an unequivocal loss for the tens of millions of Americans across the country who are forced to spend their hard-earned money on overpriced set-top box leases that cost them hundreds of dollars a year,\u201d said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a statement on Thursday.He has said consumers have been charged a combined $20 billion a year in forced rental fees.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maria Semple\u2019s \u2018Today Will Be Different\u2019 Serves Up Screwball With Soul", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesThis book\u2019s beleaguered heroine is Eleanor Flood, and she has a lot in common with Bernadette. She had a TV career, but that has long since petered out, and she now feels marooned in status-conscious Seattle. Her husband, Joe, a celebrated hand surgeon, is much more famous than she is. (In one of Eleanor\u2019s best paranoid fantasies, Joe performs surgery on a Russian billionaire who has turned the disco on his yacht into an operating room. All goes well until a switch malfunctions and dumps glitter into the billionaire\u2019s open wound.) They have a son, Timby, who attends the monstrous Galer Street School, with which \u201cBernadette\u201d had such evil fun.Ms. Semple has challenged herself by making the whole book unfold in a single day. It\u2019s a day that begins with a mantra, from which \u201cToday Will Be Different\u201d takes its title: Today Eleanor will radiate calm. (Does that tell you enough about her usual days?) Today she will initiate sex with Joe. (Ditto.) She will wear yoga clothes only for yoga and will actually perform some kind of yogalike activities. (Wanna bet?) And \u201cKindness and self-control will abound.\u201dWith the ideas of possible infidelity and a wife too busy babysitting to go snooping, some novelists might consider their plotting work done. But Ms. Semple, diabolical screwball that she is, is just warming up.The one-day premise does not prevent her from traveling through time and space. So a lot of the book has to do with the Flood Girls, about whom Eleanor was writing a graphic memoir. When she was the star animator for a hit TV show, she tossed off a few pages about the sisters Eleanor and Ivy and their famous mother, an actress who died of cancer. She even sold this to an agent, who was highly enthusiastic about it. Never mind that the Flood Girls date back so far that Timby knows nothing about them and the agent now works in a cheese shop in Nyack, N.Y. Eleanor does have a sister named Ivy. And a lot of the book is about Ivy\u2019s strange life in New Orleans.This is an extreme tangent. It leads Ivy across the Styx into an exaggerated Southern elite culture in which the self-proclaimed toast of Mardi Gras society is more pathetic than grand, and is ready made for Ms. Semple\u2019s skewering. The rules of this social set are so extreme that the sisters\u2019 bond is nearly ruptured by a misplaced container of ice cream at an engagement party.Speed bumps notwithstanding, Ms. Semple is an immensely appealing writer, and there\u2019s something universal in her heroine\u2019s efforts to get a handle on a life spinning out of control. We may not all have long-lost sisters who live in the most crazily status-obsessed corners of the South, but we surely know what she means about waking up each dawn with new resolve that melts by midmorning. The Sisyphean poignancy to this book gives it a heft that \u201cBernadette\u201d lacked, even if it\u2019s also rougher around the edges.\u201cToday Will Be Different\u201d ends on a wonderful grace note from Timby, who has spent most of the book playing straight man to his mother. In the simplest way, Timby\u2019s line provides all the sweetness, confidence and optimism that Eleanor has been trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to give herself on a daily basis. So if the kid\u2019s got it, there\u2019s hope for his mother, after all. Maybe she just didn\u2019t know where to look.And Ms. Semple\u2019s descriptions of Seattle continue to be priceless. It would be overly generous to say that she has a love-hate relationship with the place. She has a gimlet eye for everything from the \u201cblue-badged Amazon squids, every morning squirting by the thousands from their studio apartments onto my block\u201d to the local art scene, as funded by the local tech billionaires. And the hellish blackberry brambles are back. Ms. Semple\u2019s Seattle wouldn\u2019t seem right without them.Today Will Be DifferentBy Maria SempleIllustrated. 259 pages.

{"Headline": "A George Carlin Special Too Raw After Sept. 11 Resurfaces Now", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyOn Sept. 10, 2001, George Carlin, the greatest political comic in history if measured only by stand-up specials, recorded a bracing hour of social commentary for his new HBO special. The next day, he shelved it.It wasn\u2019t only the title, \u201cI Kinda Like It When a Lotta People Die,\u201d that seemed in bad taste after nearly 3,000 people were killed a day later in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Carlin also told a joke about a fart so potent it blew up an airplane. \u201cYou know who gets blamed? Osama bin Laden,\u201d Mr. Carlin joked. \u201cThe F.B.I. is looking for explosives. They should be looking for minute traces of rice and bok choy.\u201dIf timing is everything, Mr. Carlin had nothing.Mr. Carlin, who died in 2008, had always been a left-leaning comic whose skepticism of government would be right at home with the Tea Party. In a 1999 special, he even ridiculed airport security as a pointless charade, saying Americans are \u201calways willing to trade away a little of their freedom\u201d in exchange for \u201cthe illusion of security.\u201dIn \u201cI Kinda Like It,\u201d Mr. Carlin addressed mass killings in a way that seemed on the surface out of touch with the tragedy that followed. In a cavalier tone, he says that he enjoys news of disasters the way a sports fan raves about seeing breaking records. An earthquake, he says in an outer-borough accent, \u201cput up some really big numbers,\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201calways rooting for a really high death toll.\u201dWhat Mr. Carlin is doing here is satirizing American blood lust, bringing to the surface the impulse that makes professional wrestling and crime stories so popular. As he put it more bluntly in 1992, \u201cAt least I admit it.\u201d\u201cI Kinda Like It\u201d adds a more baroque voice to this satire of our dark, repressed thrills. After saying that he enjoys the excitement of people dying, then comparing massacres and natural disasters in the voice of a demented sociopath, Mr. Carlin imagines the apex of calamity, putting every disaster movie to shame.His dizzyingly dense story includes flood, power failure, traffic jams, global warming, cholera, typhoid fever and a conflagration that wipes out North America. And then things go really bad. Shifting into a cosmically fantastical mode, Mr. Carlin imagines this disaster leading to the breakdown of the molecular structure of the atmosphere and changing the laws of nature. Burning clouds of flaming rain fly upward, the moon explodes and the dead return to life.There\u2019s a literary quality to the grotesque and often surreal imagery of this story (Mr. Carlin developed material in performance but began on the page), leaving behind punch lines and aiming for an almost metaphysical sense of the absurd in which people are inconsequential specks in a vast Lovecraftian universe.At the end of this parade of catastrophes, these bitter men gather around a table and spew resentments about their children, parents, the government and minorities. Their disgust spins out of them into what Mr. Carlin describes as a swirling \u201cpool of hate\u201d that expands beyond the universe and explodes in a kind of second big bang. The new world that emerges is utopian, and every Uncle Dave wins the lottery every week. Out of disaster comes nirvana.This operatic yarn is less argumentative than most of Mr. Carlin\u2019s bits, more open to interpretation. One way to see it, though, is as a sendup of the terrorist mind-set that led to the attack on the World Trade Center and other sites that day, a biting take on an extremist view that imagines that a twisted form of deliverance will come from violence and hate. Seen from a certain angle, a story once too provocative to release might be the perfect example of comedy in the post-Sept. 11 world.An earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to the distribution of George Carlin\u2019s recording. It will be on CD and vinyl, and available on digital platforms; it will not be available on DVD.Advertisement"}

And many apps are available to help.When making notes in a book, you can type into text blocks, create freehand text, make diagrams and insert photos and audio. These elements can be combined on one page, and when one page is full you simply move to the next.Using Noteshelf feels similar to writing in a real notebook, with the advantages that the notes are tidier and stored digitally. The app is easy to use and compatible with several types of styluses if you prefer to write with a penlike tool.Searching among notes can be difficult because of the way that searchable typed text is mixed with handwritten notes and drawings. But if you are smart about titling your notebooks, it is less of a problem.For a long time, Evernote was the best note-taking app available. But recently, the features in the app\u2019s free-access level have been limited, to drive people to pay for access. And the app\u2019s design can look confusing compared with newer rivals. Evernote\u2019s paid features are available for $4 and up.Each card has a main purpose. You can create a text card that you can type words on, an audio card that is an audio recording, a photo card or a shopping list-like card. Where you may separate different sections of a note-taking session with a space or a new page in other apps, in Notebook the idea is that you use a new card.Because the text in Notebook is all typed, you can also search through previous notes for specific words. This is useful, but if you want to scribble down a more visual note, like a mathematical formula, you have to use a different app.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren: What Apple Teaches Us About Taxes", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 APPLE got a big surprise last week when the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect more than $14 billion in back taxes from the company. The global giant had been attributing billions of dollars in profits to a phantom head office, allowing it to pay a tax rate of 1 percent or lower.Both Apple and Ireland are appealing the decision, but the commission\u2019s announcement was the latest sign that multinational corporations are running out of places to hide from paying taxes. The door is now open for Congress to fix our own corporate tax code, which has allowed the biggest multinationals to shirk their obligations for decades.The Apple ruling is big, but it is only the latest international effort to end the deals that American multinationals have used to pay near-zero tax rates. The European Commission is investigating Luxembourg\u2019s tax arrangements for Amazon and McDonald\u2019s, and last year the European Court of Justice struck down tax advantages to companies and their subsidiaries selling e-books throughout Europe. Also last year, Britain enacted a new tax to target profits siphoned off by international companies \u2014 nicknamed, without much subtlety, the \u201cGoogle tax.\u201dIt\u2019s not just Europe. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20 nations are coordinating on a global effort to end the cross-border games that allow companies to avoid taxation by moving money among various subsidiaries. Multinational corporations are especially worried about losing access to Cayman Island-style tax rates in European countries where they can also get rule of law, political stability and an educated professional class of attorneys and consultants.The Treasury Department has pushed back against the European Commission over the Apple case, concerned about the impact on the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s authority. But Treasury has also finalized new country-by-country reporting requirements that could help expose the jaw-dropping variety of tax-dodging schemes multinational companies employ. At the Group of 20 summit meeting in China last weekend, President Obama reiterated his support for a cooperative global effort to end the international tax shell game.Now that they are feeling the sting from foreign tax crackdowns, giant corporations and their Washington lobbyists are pressing Congress to cut them a new sweetheart deal here at home. But instead of bailing out the tax dodgers under the guise of tax reform, Congress should seize this moment to take three crucial steps to repair our broken corporate tax code.First, Congress should increase the share of government revenue generated from taxes on big corporations \u2014 permanently. In the 1950s, corporations contributed about $3 out of every $10 in federal revenue. Today they contribute $1 out of every $10, despite their reliance on federal investments to start and expand their businesses. The National Science Foundation helped fund some of the initial work of Google\u2019s founders. Apple\u2019s consumer products still rely on technology that originated in federally funded research. To usher in the next generation of prosperous American companies \u2014 and to make the investments we need to sustain broad-based economic growth \u2014 the current generation of corporate winners must step up and pay its fair share.Second, Congress should encourage investment in jobs here in the United States. Giant corporations are pushing corporate tax reform proposals that offer a lower permanent tax rate for earnings generated abroad than earnings generated at home. That is nuts. Preferential tax treatment, either through special rates or deferred due dates, creates a huge financial incentive for American companies to build businesses and create jobs abroad rather than in the United States. Our tax code should favor jobs and businesses at home \u2014 period.Third, Congress should level the playing field for small businesses. Small companies in Massachusetts don\u2019t stash profits in the Netherlands. They can\u2019t hire a team of accountants to set up a \u201creverse hybrid mismatch\u201d to slash their taxes. This puts small businesses at a competitive disadvantage as they end up shouldering more of the burden of paying for education, infrastructure, research, the military and everything else our nation relies on to succeed.I have been pushing Congress to take these steps since I arrived in the Senate in 2013. The common refrain from Republicans who oppose these measures is that taking them would encourage American companies to flee abroad. But as other nations step up to prevent tax avoidance, that case gets weaker and weaker. And we have the leverage to tighten our tax code because these companies want what America offers: the world\u2019s wealthiest consumers, the world\u2019s best work force, the world\u2019s most reliable legal system and the world\u2019s deepest capital markets.For years, corporate tax dodgers have taken full advantage of all the benefits of being American companies, while searching out every possible way to avoid paying American taxes. Now that other leading countries are starting to get tough on tax enforcement, these tax dodgers suddenly want to move their money back to the United States. When they do, they should pay their fair share, just as working families and small businesses have been all along.Elizabeth Warren is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Remainders of the Day", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuthor\u2019s NoteI assumed the humiliations had ended. They began even before my book was published, when network morning shows that regularly had me on now refused my pleas for some airtime to promote it. Once the book came out in 2012, it only got worse. I read at bookstores with audiences smaller than those you might find randomly browsing on any given day, and had an Amazon ranking higher than the number of books I thought existed in the world.Less than a year after publication, my publisher, Hachette, told me they were mulching the tens of thousands of remaining copies of my book, \u201cMan Made: A Stupid Quest for Masculinity,\u201d and suggested I purchase copies while they still existed. I capitulated, sending a check to the very people who once paid me to write it. Through a haze of self-pity I was utterly incapable of envisioning the physical reality of 300 hardcover books. So a few days later, I was blockaded from entering my house, at risk of succumbing to a literary shame avalanche. I have since lugged these 300 books to a new house, and then again when we built a new storage area, feeling like Sisyphus punished for lacking a strong enough story arc. Perhaps the worst indignity is that Hachette sends me a statement each quarter listing my sales and charting my progress toward paying back my advance. Which is pointless unless Hachette pays royalties to authors\u2019 great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren. And they each also buy 300 books.But after three years of suffering through my stupid quest to sell a book, I encountered an ignominy I didn\u2019t even know existed. My 6-year-old son\u2019s friend Livia came over for a play date, and her mom brought a copy of my book for me to sign. I took out the thick black Sharpie that makes me feel very important, flipped to the cover page ready to write something falsely self-\u00addeprecating and saw, stamped in big letters: \u201cProperty of the Calgary Public Library.\u201d Did this nice public-school teacher steal a book on a ski trip? Did she love my book so much that she decided never to return it \u2014 paying fines in perpetuity until she becomes the main benefactor of Alberta\u2019s library system?No, Livia\u2019s mom had bought it on Amazon. I figured there must be some black market in books from Canada, akin to the way prescription medicine is brought over the border.That very same week, I went to a meeting where someone pulled out a copy of my book for me to sign. This one was stamped \u201cSt. Helena Library\u201d in black, and then right on top of that, in red, \u201cDiscard.\u201d I instantly understood what had happened. Not only would no one buy my book, but libraries in various countries were disposing of them because people wouldn\u2019t take them for free. My book was so bad even Canadians were being mean to it.I emailed the Calgary Public Library to ask why they had given up hope for my book, and why it had taken them a few years longer than it took me to do so. The nice Canadian person there told me the library system had bought six copies of my book for their 18 branches, which seemed generous since there\u2019s not a lot of time to read about struggling with your masculinity while you\u2019re drinking Molsons and watching old hockey fights on an oil rig in minus-10-degree snowstorms. Calgary jettisoned two copies after discovering that one had been checked out 10 times and the other only five. Which means 15 more people read my book than I had thought. Apparently, though, that\u2019s not good enough for the Calgary library system, which had to make room for collections of staff picks. This included a group of works compiled under the rubric \u201cSo Long, Movember, Hello Novem-burns,\u201d all of which celebrated sideburns.I told my sad story to Susan Orlean, who, despite being a New York Times best-\u00adselling author, told me she too has endured library dumping. \u201cI have been at signings where a person sheepishly presents a book for me and I think, \u2018Interesting. They have the Mylar sleeve. How anal.\u2019 And I open the front cover and see \u2018Barnstable Library,\u2019\u200a\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been rejected by the one institution that is practically required by law to carry your book. You\u2019ve been remaindered by the citizens of America.\u201dOrlean, to my surprise, told me that she\u2019s working on a project she calls \u201cThe Library Book,\u201d which is about the 1986 arson fire at the Los Angeles Central Library, and has learned a lot about these institutions\u2019 mysterious ways. She tried to make me feel better by saying that she sees carts of books being culled each day from the Central Library to make room for new acquisitions. Just like bookstores, libraries buy a bunch of copies when a book first comes out, and get rid of them once demand drops. When she offered the Central Library a free copy of her 2011 book \u201cRin Tin Tin,\u201d they politely declined.But just as she found tricks to avoid other author humiliations (namely, selling a lot of books), she\u2019s gotten herself out of this one too. For no matter how few people are checking it out, no librarian is going to toss \u201cThe Library Book.\u201d \u201cThis is my secret plan. The people who make these decisions about whether to euthanize a book are the people whom the book will be about,\u201d Orlean said. Which is why I\u2019m calling my own next book \u201cRemainder at Your Own Risk: Voodoo Spells That Prevent Massive Local Government Cutbacks.\u201dJoel Stein is a columnist for Time magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meet New Glenn, the Blue Origin Rocket That May Someday Take You to Space", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoth the rocket and the ambitions appear to be big.The rockets, named New Glenn after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, are almost as large as the Saturn V rocket that NASA used from 1966 to 1973, before rockets started being built smaller. The two-stage version that could venture to low-Earth orbit will be 270 feet tall, and the three-stage version, which could fly outside Earth\u2019s orbit, will be 313 feet tall. Both will be 23 feet in diameter, packing seven BE-4 engines, which are developed by Blue Origin, and lifting off with 3.85 million pounds of thrust.Blue Origin plans to first launch the rocket from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral, Fla., before the end of the decade.\u201cOur vision is millions of people living and working in space, and New Glenn is a very important step,\u201d Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, said in an email update.As a private company, Blue Origin could launch wealthy tourists into space, send commercial satellites into orbit and provide the technology to send NASA back to the moon, as well as to Mars and beyond.Perfecting the technology of reusable rockets \u2014 which the New Glenn rockets would be \u2014 could have profound implications on the cost and frequency of space travel. Imagine how much more expensive a flight from New York to London would be if airlines built a new 747 jet for each flight, throwing them away after one use. That is effectively the current model of the space industry; rockets typically crash back into Earth after exhausting their fuel, and the steep costs of travel depress how often it happens.\u201cReusability is a total game-changer,\u201d said Charles Miller, the president of NexGen Space L.L.C., a space and public policy consultancy. \u201cIt\u2019s on the order of going from the sail to the steam engine, or going from the horse to the automobile.\u201dBefore New Glenn was announced as the rocket\u2019s name on Monday, Mr. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, had referred to it as \u201cVery Big Brother.\u201dThe large size of New Glenn \u2014 Mr. Miller, a former senior adviser for NASA, had guessed it would be big but thought it would have five engines, not seven \u2014 suggests the company would seek to lower the price of space tourism by offering more seats on the flights, he said.Mr. Miller said if the dream of inexpensive space travel were fulfilled, it would significantly impact life on Earth. In best-case scenarios, the ability to more easily launch satellites could lead to worldwide broadband internet, better weather predictions, the monitoring of carbon sources and the farming of solar energy.For the United States, it could have national security implications, he said. The ability to destroy United States satellites that provide surveillance and guide missiles is a current liability, but enemies may be less likely to target them if they could be quickly replaced.And NASA will most likely be a customer, using the New Glenn rockets for future missions.\u201cWith this vehicle, going to Mars will become a lot easier,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Golf Great Arnold Palmer Was Also a Pioneering Pitchman", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a grainy black-and-white 1968 television commercial, Arnold Palmer steers a Mercury Monterey up to a golf course, nodding approvingly at the coupe\u2019s smooth handling. A few years later, Mr. Palmer was driving up to another course, this time in color, in a flashy Cadillac El Dorado.In the 1980s Mr. Palmer, long past his golfing prime, pitched Pennzoil motor oil and Paine Webber brokerage services, and appeared alongside O.J. Simpson in ads for Hertz rental cars. And just last year, Mr. Palmer starred in a commercial for the blood thinner Xarelto, earnestly pitching the drug in a bright pink shirt on a lush green course.A ubiquitous pitchman for more than a half-century, he hawked nearly 50 products and services, from Johnston & Murphy shoes to Ketel One vodka, transforming the celebrity endorsement from a novelty to an industry.At the same time, he carefully cultivated his personal brand, forming his own company, creating a logo, selling products and equipment adorned with his signature, and paving the way for modern stars with diverse business interests like Serena Williams and LeBron James.\u201cHe was the pioneer,\u201d said Bob Williams, chief executive at Burns Entertainment & Sports Marketing, which represents brands who hire celebrities for endorsements. \u201cHe was the first celebrity in the sports world to have a marketing agent.\u201dMr. Palmer earned an estimated $875 million through endorsements, appearances, licensing and golf course design, according to Forbes. That places him behind only Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods in lifetime earnings for athlete-pitchmen. With many products bearing his name still selling briskly, Mr. Palmer\u2019s estate will keep making millions for years to come.When Mr. Palmer began playing golf professionally in the 1950s, few athletes were endorsing products, and those that were usually did so for nominal fees and free samples, often cigarettes.Then in 1958, Mark McCormack, a golf fan with a hunch that professional athletes could be stars off the field as well, began pitching golfers on the idea of letting him represent them in their business dealings.Mr. Palmer was reluctant at first.But in the fall of 1959, Mr. Palmer agreed to work with Mr. McCormack on an exclusive basis. Mr. McCormack wanted to sign a contract, but Mr. Palmer preferred a handshake.That handshake, legend has it, was the foundation of one of the most lucrative partnerships in the history of sports. Mr. McCormack would go on to establish IMG, the powerhouse sports marketing company, which merged with William Morris Endeavor in 2013. And from the start, Mr. Palmer was among his most important stars.As Mr. Palmer\u2019s playing career wound down in the mid-1960s, his commercial activities ramped up. Soon Mr. Palmer was endorsing Golf Magazine, United Airlines and Bausch & Lomb. Not all endorsements were hits. When Mr. Palmer became the face of a dry cleaner, it fell flat. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always the Midas touch,\u201d Alastair Johnston, Mr. Palmer\u2019s longtime agent at IMG, said in an interview.But before long, Mr. Palmer was being sought out by companies looking for a wholesome face to represent their brands.\u201cHe established the sports marketing industry as we knew it,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cIt became a much more sophisticated exercise. It became a real business with real money.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Palmer got out of an unfavorable contract with Wilson Sporting Goods and went on to establish the Arnold Palmer Golf Company, now known as Arnold Palmer Enterprises. Mr. McCormack was involved in that company as well.\u201cMark represented him like a corporation,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Mr. Palmer\u2019s popularity coincided with the rise of television in the United States, a medium that allowed him to vastly expand his audience beyond golf fans.\u201cIt brought him into people\u2019s living room, whether he was endorsing tomato ketchup or airlines,\u201d Mr. Johnston said.Thanks to Mr. Palmer\u2019s celebrity, Mr. McCormack was able to quickly corner the market for athlete endorsements, attracting other stars and divining profitable pricing models for a nascent business.\u201cWhat Mark was able to do is something that is painfully obvious now: He was able to establish rate cards and costs,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cThat was really how Arnold helped to start IMG. It made IMG the biggest single force in the world of sports marketing. Others who would try to compete would either underprice or overprice.\u201dEventually, Mr. Palmer received a stake in IMG.Through his namesake company, Mr. Palmer would go on to market golf clubs and clothing, and serve as a designer for golf courses around the world. He became an investor in everything from the Golf Channel to real estate that was adjacent to courses he designed.\u201cWhat he did, creating a brand unto himself, was the blueprint for everyone who came after him, whether it be LeBron, or Jordan or Tiger Woods,\u201d Mr. Futterman, the author of \u201cPlayers\u201d and a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, said in an interview.Mr. Palmer even had his own logo: a multicolored umbrella that adorned his products, a forebear to Mr. Jordan\u2019s Jumpman logo and Roger Federer\u2019s RF design.\u201cLast year we sold half a billion containers with Arnie\u2019s face on it,\u201d Don Vultaggio, the founder of AriZona, said in an interview.On Monday, St. Martin\u2019s Press said it would move up the publication date of Mr. Palmer\u2019s final book by two weeks to Oct. 11. \u201cA Life Well Played: My Stories,\u201d rocketed up the best-seller list on Amazon to crack the top 50.\u201cHe was the starting point for the creation of the modern sports world,\u201d Mr. Futterman said. \u201cArnold Palmer is going to be making money long after we are all dead.\u201dAlexandra Alter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about Robert Worth\u2019s \u201cA Rage for Order,\u201d which tries to make sense of the chaos in the Middle East, and Yuval Levin\u2019s \u201cThe Fractured Republic,\u201d which I hear is one of the smartest looks at how our current political landscape became such a mess. I hope to get to both of them over summer break.What\u2019s the last great book you read?I loved Jon Meacham\u2019s \u201cDestiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush,\u201d which was a beautifully crafted look at the 41st president\u2019s life. As always with Jon, he captures the emotional as well as the objective truth of his subject. In the case of the 41st president, this was particularly revealing. He illuminated the inner life of a world-class statesman who probably held more senior government positions than any president before him. Jon is able to draw a very human portrait of a distinguished and accomplished life while not glossing over the inevitable mistakes and imperfections of even the ablest of men.Which writers \u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 working today do you admire most?Because I\u2019m a political junkie and read an inordinate number of newspapers and magazines, my focus tends to be on people who are writing regularly about culture and politics. I have never failed to learn something from David Brooks, Frank Rich, David Remnick, Samantha Power, Henry Louis Gates, Fareed Zakaria, Lena Dunham, David Ignatius, Zadie Smith, Leon Wieseltier or Jeff Goldberg, and am better for having the benefit of their insights. I think they are all at the top of their game and doing consistently superb work.Do you have an all-time favorite author?I began reading John Updike and Philip Roth in high school, and both had a huge impact on the way I looked at the complexity of family, marriage and upper-middle-class America. The Rabbit books are seared in my mind, and to this day I can invoke passages and scenes from memory. The same is true of Roth, particularly \u201cAmerican Pastoral,\u201d which is probably my favorite novel of the last 20 years. I never met either of them, which I think is probably best. The old adage, I think, is true: Best not to meet your heroes. I think Ian McEwan is stunningly good as well, and look forward to whatever he does next.What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?I skew to history because it\u2019s closest to my passions of politics and world affairs, which I\u2019ve been addicted to since I was a kid. Growing up, my dinner table was very much consumed with what was happening in the world. My folks were involved in the civil rights movement and in Eugene McCarthy\u2019s \u201968 presidential campaign. I watched my dad\u2019s deep emotional connection to Gene McCarthy, and that\u2019s where I caught the bug.What are the best books you\u2019ve read recently about American politics?I loved Joseph J. Ellis\u2019s \u201cThe Quartet: Orchestrating the Second American Revolution, 1783-1789,\u201d which in its own way doubles as a business book, because it shows the art of decision making at its best by building consensus rather than worrying about who gets the credit. An old line of Reagan\u2019s was to the effect \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much can get done when you don\u2019t care who gets the credit.\u201d That\u2019s absolutely true. Washington, Madison, Jay and Hamilton were hardly without ego or ambition, but their prime focus was a new constitution, and without their genius it wouldn\u2019t have happened.What are your favorite TV shows (not just HBO!) based on books?I think a lot of people are doing terrific work as well. Unlike the movie business, most TV shows do not emerge from books. That said, in addition to being obviously proud of everything on HBO, I\u2019m a huge fan of \u201cHomeland\u201d and didn\u2019t miss an episode of \u201cMad Men.\u201dWhat are your favorite films based on books?Not even close: \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d The first two I watch every year and quote from too frequently. Also, \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d is a perennial for me as well.Describe your ideal reading experience \u2014 type of book, time of day, electronic or paper, etc.I\u2019m old-school here, so I love hard copies of magazines and newspapers, but I must confess that I find myself on the iPad every night getting a head start for the next day. I\u2019m a night owl, so my most focused and relaxed reading time is at night, often too late into the morning.How do you choose what to read next? Is there someone whose opinion you rely on?I listen to my wife for suggestions on fiction; and obviously The New York Times Book Review, not to flatter you here, as well as The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker help organize and focus my thinking.What\u2019s your favorite bookstore or library?When I\u2019m not ordering off Amazon, my family loves Diane\u2019s Books of Greenwich, so we get a lot there.How do you organize your books?My favorite books are lined up in my study within eyeshot of my reading chair. I actually look at them often and sometimes go back and refer to various underlined passages for use in speeches or just for reference. Doing that also brings back the pleasure and memory from the time I first read them. Great books always make you a little smarter and a little wiser, so when I\u2019m in need of inspiration, going back into the masters\u2019 work is a wonderful way to find an added spark.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?The stories of John Cheever. A jewel. I reread many of them throughout the year.What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?Here I\u2019m sentimental, because my dad gave me the Cheever book for my 20th birthday. All my reading habits come from my father, and so the book holds a special place for me. There\u2019s a lot in there about what Kant called \u201cthe crooked timber of humanity.\u201d It\u2019s a masterpiece.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?I began reading The Times as a kid to keep up with my dad. My father always had either the papers or a book in his hands, and I of course wanted to emulate that. I remember vividly reading \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d and \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d all within the same year as a young teen. They had a particular impact on me since they all dealt with social cultural issues, which opened my eyes to the power of great novels.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? Since we\u2019re well aware of how much the president reads \u2014 something like 20 books a year, I\u2019m told \u2014 it would be presumptuous of me to suggest anything to him. Given the demands of his day job, it\u2019s simply stunning how much reading for pleasure he is able to do.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?For fiction, John Updike. For history, Winston Churchill. For politics, Walter Lippmann.If you could be friends with any author, dead or alive, who would it be?No question, Churchill. I\u2019ve probably read more about him than any historical figure, because I find him endlessly fascinating. Both for his flaws and preternatural strengths. And even though he suffered from what he called his \u201cblack dog\u201d \u2014 his low moods \u2014 I don\u2019t think anyone doubts he could be enormous fun. I also love cigars, so talking history and politics with the grand master would be a treat.Whom would you want to write your life story? This is obviously presumptuous to even consider, but since you asked, I am a huge fan and adoring admirer of both David McCullough and Jon Meacham. I got to know David when we adapted his masterpiece \u201cJohn Adams\u201d for a mini-series and had the privilege of touring Colonial Williamsburg with him. He is a brilliant historian because he not only understands the intricate fabric of the history he is writing about, but also he has a remarkable way of conveying the human dimension of his subjects, which puts us inside the hearts and minds of the great men and women who make up our national story from the founders on.Jon is equally gifted in that way, as his works on Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, Jefferson, Jackson and Bush made clear. They also happen to both be special people.What do you want to read next?In addition to the books I cited earlier, I\u2019m embarrassed to say I haven\u2019t yet read the latest of Caro\u2019s Johnson series, \u201cThe Passage of Power.\u201d It\u2019s also sitting on my pile, and I\u2019m determined to read it this year.For fiction, everyone is talking about \u201cA Little Life,\u201d by Hanya Yanagihara, so I look forward to reading that as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Encounter\u2019 Is a High-Tech Head Trip Through an Amazon Labyrinth", "Date": "2017-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySee that scruffy-looking guy up there on the stage, the one messing around with the microphones and the plastic water bottles? It turns out that he\u2019s a world-class head shrinker \u2014 and head enlarger, too, an all-purpose mind-bender. He is going to retune, rearrange and reproportion your senses, while taking you places you never expected to visit.All you have to do is lend him your ears.But almost as soon as you put them on, your sense of time and space is altered. Mr. McBurney suddenly seems to be standing right next to you, whispering and (oh, wow!) blowing into your ear. Then he\u2019s over there, behind you, and there, in front of you, and then practically sitting in your lap. Yet your eyes tell you that he\u2019s never left the stage. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t trust your eyes.Except in this case, Mr. McBurney is always in full view, standing amid the foam-walled simulated sound studio designed by Michael Levine. You watch him turning from one microphone to another, and crumpling a plastic bag or shaking one of those water bottles to simulate the noises of the brush or the river. So in theory, you can always accurately trace direct cause and effect within the show\u2019s illusions.No, you can\u2019t. Mr. McBurney and his ace sound designers, Gareth Fry and Pete Malkin, have created an aural labyrinth of many layers. You\u2019ll be watching Mr. McBurney\u2019s lips moving in sync with what you\u2019re hearing, only to discover that it\u2019s just a recorded voice you\u2019ve been listening to.Did I say \u201cjust a recorded voice\u201d? It\u2019s a mistake to give undue value to what\u2019s \u201creal\u201d over what\u2019s a simulacrum of reality. With your earphones on, there\u2019s no distinguishing between the live and the prerecorded, a blurring that allows Mr. McBurney to conduct very immediate-feeling conversations with his past selves.And with his 5-year-old daughter, whose voice keeps interrupting him in what feels like real time. And with a host of people he interviewed in preparation for this show, including Mr. Popescu and a variety of neuroscientists, philosophers and environmentalists, who keep interrupting the central story with fragments of theories you\u2019ve heard them expound earlier in the show.The subject of what they have to say is profound enough to feel embarrassing. Among the questions posed: Is consciousness possible without memory? Is time only a structuring fiction devised by humans? Does time have one or two dimensions? Can language exist without words? Does the introduction of modern materialist cultures into indigenous communities inevitably destroy their essence?Don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t sign up for a lecture. The academics are never allowed to hold forth for long. Instead, their voices poke into our consciousness in shards, like flotsam and jetsam carried by a rushing stream.This melding of partly articulated ideas suggests that twilight that occurs just before you fall asleep, when the accumulated impressions of a day \u2014 and a lifetime \u2014 swirl in and out of focus, each weighted with the same significance. And there are moments that approximate the jolting, abrupt waking from such a state of mind.You can be river-deep and mountain-high in the forest with a bewildered and depleted McIntyre after he\u2019s been stripped of all his modern-man appurtenances, when the sound of a door opening thrusts us into Mr. McBurney\u2019s London home, in the room where he is working on this show and where his restless little girl has entered yet again with a bedtime request.So are these domestic scenes the present tense of the show? No, that would be the show itself, right? Better not to think too hard about this while you\u2019re watching it.Not that your mind (or whatever you choose to call it) is ever likely to drift. Mr. McBurney, who does McIntyre\u2019s voice as that of a strapping stoic from a cowboy film, sustains the momentum of his story as tensely and enjoyably as if it were a Rudyard Kipling yarn, albeit of a postcolonial ilk. This isn\u2019t a voyage into a heart of darkness but of enlightenment. And yes, there\u2019s an attendant glimmer of New Age spiritualism.For \u201cThe Encounter\u201d is definitely a work of theater. And though you first meet Mr. McBurney as a vaguely detached magician M.C., his performance becomes increasingly passionate and physical. He is wrestling with all the elements that go into telling and listening to a story, which includes those transporting moments when the teller becomes the tale.As does the audience. Just before you put on your earphones, Mr. McBurney says, by way of partial explanation, that \u201cempathy and proximity are connected.\u201d It may be he who\u2019s running and dancing and leaping and sweating. But by the end of this nonpareil show\u2019s two intermissionless hours, you are as lightheaded, exhausted, baffled and invigorated as if it had been you.A theater review on Friday about \u201cThe Encounter,\u201d at the Golden Theater in Manhattan, misstated the given name of the author whose novel \u201cAmazon Beaming\u201d inspired the show. He is Petru Popescu, not Petro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Has a Potent Weapon in the Tablet Wars: Low Prices", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, five years after unveiling that first tablet, Amazon is coming out with a new model of the device that takes the company\u2019s single-minded obsession with offering the lowest practical price to new extremes.It is doing so at a time when the overall tablet market is no longer the growth juggernaut it once was, with weak sales from the likes of Apple and Samsung. One notable exception to the downward trend is Amazon, which is seeing sales rise because its devices are so inexpensive.\u201cThey\u2019re obviously doing something right because they continue to grow in a market that is overall declining,\u201d said Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at IDC, the technology research company.The latest Amazon tablet is the Fire HD 8, a new model of the company\u2019s 8-inch touch-screen device.The most remarkable thing about the device is the price, which, at $89.99, represents a 40 percent drop from the previous 8-inch Fire\u2019s price of $149.99. More striking is the contrast to Apple\u2019s 8-inch iPads, which start at $399 for the latest generation and $269 for an earlier model.There is nothing new about Amazon\u2019s fixation on undercutting its competitors on price. In tablets, it has seemed more aggressive about lowering prices. Last year, it introduced a 7-inch tablet that sells for $49.99, a few dollars more than Apple charges for a leather iPhone case.The success of that low-price Fire device provided a big lift to Amazon\u2019s tablet sales, which have more than doubled on a unit basis this year compared with the same period last year, said Kevin Keith, general manager of Amazon\u2019s Fire tablet business.The global tablet market is no longer a growth business, falling 11.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. Amazon ranked fifth during that period, accounting for 4.1 percent of sales, IDC estimates.Apple \u2014 the top tablet maker \u2014 has reported that the number of iPads it sold during that period fell 9 percent, though its iPad revenue rose 7 percent because of sales of high-end versions.If Amazon\u2019s approach to tablet pricing sounds unprofitable, that is because it is, at least directly. The company views them as a way to entice people to become more enthusiastic Amazon customers by, for example, encouraging the purchase of $99-a-year Prime memberships, which include a Netflix-like video service, music and other forms of entertainment that can be consumed on the devices.\u201cWe aim to break even on our hardware and make money when customers use our devices, not when we sell devices,\u201d said Mr. Keith. \u201cWe feel like that\u2019s a great model for our business.\u201dAmazon squeezes additional revenue out of its tablets in other ways, too. It sends advertisements to the lock screens of Fire tablets. If customers do not want to see the ads, they can pay Amazon $15 to remove them. This is not something Apple is likely to do, and die-hard fans of the iPad, which many say has a polish that other tablets lack, will not be swayed merely by price.Despite the overall decline in the market, Amazon\u2019s Mr. Keith says he thinks there are still opportunities for Amazon tablet sales to grow. Its prices are low enough that Amazon customers are buying multiple tablets for their homes and giving them as gifts.\u201cWe don\u2019t think the market is saturated yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have plenty of runway.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tom Wolfe Raises His Voice in an Account of Human Speech", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.We are dealing with a short book by a big writer on a dull topic, further complicated \u2014 as it turns out \u2014 by an old man\u2019s willingness to digress (surely the Spanish Civil War could have been left out of all this?), and the result is a qualified success. The scope is far too vast for such brief treatment, and the author\u2019s lifelong commitment to carbonating even the most esoteric subjects leads him to get caught up in so many gossipy side notes \u2014 the scientist whose wife and daughter were stricken with volcanic diarrhea during his fieldwork in the Amazon; the class anxiety of a 19th-century visitor to the \u00adLin\u00adnean Society \u2014 that the reader is left to wonder what, exactly, is Wolfe\u2019s point.His point, as it turns out, is twofold: to report on the findings of the Great Men of Science who have studied language through the ages, and to shank Noam Chomsky. Regarding the former, the story is slight. Regarding the second, he\u2019s hardly the first person to rise to the challenge, but he does so with characteristic wit and savage precision. Anyway, here goes.Evolution doesn\u2019t account for the development of speech, and the best that Darwin and his followers could offer was a guess: Perhaps humans developed language by imitating the sounds of animals? Scholars embedded themselves among various \u201ctribes\u201d and \u201cethnic enclaves,\u201d studying their languages, but learning little about the origin of speech itself. And then .\u2008.\u2008. Chomsky. He is exactly the kind of New Left figure whom Wolfe is uniquely poised to fillet, but given the ostensible scope of this project his politics might seem at most a footnote. Hardly.Chomsky, as we recall, came up with the revolutionary theory that language \u2014 or at least the ability to learn it \u2014 is innate, which accounts for why children the world over learn it at the same age and in exactly the same manner, despite the great differences among individual languages. So widely accepted is this theory \u2014 and so many academic careers by now dependent on its validity \u2014 that challenges to it are often met with swift and unified resistance. His reputation is celestial. Chomsky was named one of The New Statesman\u2019s \u201cHeroes of Our Time\u201d; a Prospect-Foreign Policy poll named him the No. 1 intellectual in the world; Encyclopaedia Britannica\u2019s list of \u201cthe 100 Most Influential Philosophers of All Time\u201d placed him, Wolfe writes, \u201cwith Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Confucius, Epictetus, St. Thomas Aquinas. .\u2008.\u2008. This wasn\u2019t fast company, it was a roster of the immortals.\u201dWhat secured these encomiums, of course, was not merely his work in linguistics; it was his enduring reputation for political activism, which began with his famous 1967 essay on the Vietnam War, and the \u201cResponsibility of Intellectuals\u201d to protest it. \u201cFrom the very first paragraph to the last,\u201d Wolfe reports, Chomsky \u201ctore into the United States\u2019 \u2018capitalist\u2019 rulers, its supine press, its by turns apathetic and pliable intellectuals.\u201d He filled the essay \u201cwith so much Marxist lingo that people took him to be part of the radical left, if not an outright Communist. But he routinely denounced the Soviet Union and Marxism-Leninism as well as capitalism and the United States. He was above their tawdry battles. An angry god was speaking from a higher plane.\u201dWolfe\u2019s attack on Chomsky \u2014 whom he calls \u201cNoam Charisma\u201d \u2014 is precise, scathing and not undeserved. But what, Lord, does this have to do with the topic of language? Precious little. Thank God. But soon enough we\u2019re back on the long march, learning about a Chomskyan principle called \u2014 ZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!! \u2014 \u201crecursion\u201d and how the language of a Brazilian tribe called the Pirah\u00e3 presents a significant challenge to that principle. This section is heavily dependent on a wonderful New Yorker profile of the linguist Daniel Everett by John Colapinto that, quite frankly, sums up the relevant Chomsky theories more clearly than anything in \u201cThe Kingdom of Speech,\u201d but no matter, because consistent reading of this bewildering little book is rewarded by the fact that it does eventually end.Wolfe has much in common with \u201cNoam Charisma.\u201d Both men so deeply reshaped their fields that no one entering either profession can do so without being aware of the long shadow. One senses that Wolfe is as irritated by his omission from the roster of immortals as by Chomsky\u2019s inclusion in it. But one also knows that a hundred years from now, the one whose work will still be read \u2014 whose work will remain imperishable in the face of any new discoveries \u2014 is Wolfe. In the long game, the kingdom belongs to him.Caitlin Flanagan is a contributing editor at The Atlantic.Advertisement"}

But every few months, she goes silent \u2014 for hours or even days \u2014 and won\u2019t speak to me or respond to my attempts to engage her. Eventually, she comes around, a little sheepishly. I know we think highly of each other, which makes her behavior even more jarring. She acknowledges that she is an emotional person, but never mentions the silent spells. Is there a way to address them without making her defensive?ANONYMOUS, OHIOThis is some seriously odd behavior. But let\u2019s consider your office mate\u2019s silent treatment from another angle before we decide on next steps. It is also pretty bizarre, if you think about it, to sit in a tiny room with the same person for eight hours a day. You don\u2019t mention any work disruptions caused by the stony silence. And for almost all of your time together, you get along famously.It sounds to me as if she gets really overwhelmed and just clicks off, like my Cuisinart coffee maker after 90 minutes. As awkward as this is for you, what\u2019s the upside in talking about it? She already knows her behavior is strange, hence her sheepish returns. But I\u2019m afraid that creating more social pressure may only make things worse.If you are worried about her or think she\u2019s depressed, ask if she needs help. But office mates aren\u2019t required to chat. And it\u2019s only that she\u2019s mostly such good company that makes her bad company so glaring. I\u2019d let this slide.

Much of the debate revolves around land.\u201cThis is the heart of hill-shepherding country,\u201d said Peter Edmondson, 61, gesturing to the craggy, bracken-clad mountains that rise steeply above his whitewashed 17th-century home at Seathwaite Farm. \u201cIf they want to rewild the Lake District, what about me and my family?\u201dThere is no formal link between events on Blencathra and in Borrowdale Valley, but both illuminate the competing visions of how the Lake District\u2019s sylvan valleys and rugged uplands should be run and owned, and for whose benefit.The issue started gaining attention in 2014 with the effort to sell Blencathra, also known as Saddleback.The mountain, along with the ceremonial title of Lord of the Manor of Threlkeld, was priced at \u00a31.75 million, or about $3 million according to exchange rates at the time. Its owner, Hugh Clayton Lowther, the eighth Earl of Lonsdale, whose family has owned it for generations, wanted to raise cash to pay inheritance taxes of \u00a39 million on his father\u2019s estate.In the end, the mystery bidder never materialized. The earl sold off other assets, including a painting by the artist J. M. W. Turner, to pay the estate taxes. In June, he said the mountain was no longer for sale, but the Friends of Blencathra said they still wanted to buy it.After an ultimatum to the Friends by the seller\u2019s agent to come up with a more substantial offer by Sept. 5, the group said its trustees \u201cnow see no prospects of a successful purchase.\u201d That left the question of what to do with the \u00a3250,000.Some donors have taken to social media to say the secretive behavior of the Friends of Blencathra creates suspicions that the donations may not be returned, even though the trustees have promised a \u201cpublic consultation\u201d on the charity\u2019s future.Coincidentally, the Charity Commission has said it is also scrutinizing the National Trust\u2019s purchase in August of 303 acres of sheep-farming land, along with 413 sheep, at Thorneythwaite Farm, next to Seathwaite Farm.The purchase added fuel to a passionate debate between farmers and environmentalists who argue that sheep have overgrazed the hills. Parts of the region, the environmentalists say, should be rewilded to nurture a more complex habitat in the name of biodiversity.That has raised concerns that a landscape immortalized by William Wordsworth and other Romantic poets in the early 19th century will change forever. \u201cThis is a way of life,\u201d Mr. Edmondson said in an interview. Sheep farming itself, he said, is \u201cwhy the hills are so beautiful.\u201dBeyond the ecological debate, Mr. Edmondson\u2019s allies took issue with the tactics used by the National Trust, which is financed by subscriptions from about four million members and owns 630,000 acres across England.With its deep pockets, the trust easily outbid Mr. Edmondson at the auction in August, paying \u00a3950,000 \u2014 \u00a3200,000 above the guide price \u2014 for the land at Thorneythwaite. The sale became contentious because the land was sold separately from the lot that includes the farmhouse and outbuildings, prompting apprehension that its days as an active hill-farm were over.The Trust already owns 90 farms in the Lake District with a total stock of 21,000 of the Lake District\u2019s 50,000 Herdwicks, the dominant breed of hardy sheep that thrive on the remote uplands. Mr. Edmondson himself is a tenant farmer on National Trust land that, he said, offers grazing to his 850 breeding ewes and 1,002 sheep owned by the Trust itself.Part of the rationale for rewilding relates to climate change. The Lake District is widely known as England\u2019s wettest place. But as storms have grown in intensity, some environmentalists argue that the revival of trees and shrubs on land grazed bald by sheep, or colonized by bracken, would prevent the runoff of ever more apocalyptic floodwaters.In December, a storm caused so much damage that part of the Lake District\u2019s main north-south thoroughfare was washed away, in effect cutting the region in two for five months.The floods were only one among recent calamities since a crippling outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. Cumbria, the county that overlaps the Lake District, was hit particularly hard, and hundreds of thousands of sheep were incinerated.\u201cThe look and the feel of the Lake District could be changed utterly for generations to come,\u201d Tim Collins, a local legislator, said at the time. His fears were not borne out, but to a longtime visitor, the region seems caught more than ever between a rose-glow of nostalgia and 21st-century pressures.\u201cI can still remember my grandfather\u2019s day when their life was pretty simple,\u201d Mr. Edmondson said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t drive a vehicle. He didn\u2019t ride a bike. All he had was two dogs, a walking stick and his tobacco.\u201d Sometimes, he said, it would take 14 days to walk his flock to market.These days, tour buses clog narrow lanes, spandex-clad cyclists dodge between them, and kayakers take to the rivers and lakes that inspired Arthur Ransome\u2019s \u201cSwallows and Amazons\u201d children\u2019s stories. Such is the quest for adventure in Britain\u2019s leisured society that developers want to build zip wires down precipices. As they have since the 19th century, rock climbers scale vertiginous crags. Walkers clamber over the high passes and summits, sharing the terrain with the sheep.\u201cSooner or later saturation must be reached,\u201d said Terry Fletcher, a columnist in the monthly magazine Cumbria. \u201cSooner or later enough must be enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Wealth, More Jobs, but Not for Everyone: What Fuels the Backlash on Trade", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "Trade is under attack in much of the world, because economists failed to anticipate the accompanying joblessness, and governments failed to help.Supported byHe is a longshoreman here at Europe\u2019s largest port, and his black Jack Daniel\u2019s T-shirt, hoop earrings and copious rings give Mr. Duijzers the look of a bohemian pirate. His wages put him solidly in the Dutch middle class: He has earned enough to buy an apartment and enjoy vacations to Spain.Lately, though, Mr. Duijzers has come to see global trade as a malevolent force. His employer \u2014 a unit of the Maersk Group, the Danish shipping conglomerate \u2014 is locked in a fiercely competitive battle around the world.He sees trucking companies replacing Dutch drivers with immigrants from Eastern Europe. He bids farewell to older co-workers reluctantly taking early retirement as robots capture their jobs. Over the last three decades, the ranks of his union have dwindled to about 7,000 members, from 25,000.\u201cMore global trade is a good thing if we get a piece of the cake,\u201d Mr. Duijzers said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the problem. We\u2019re not getting our piece of the cake.\u201dFar beyond the docks of the North Sea, such laments now resonate as the soundtrack for an increasingly vigorous rejection of free trade.For generations, libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of goods, lifting wages and amplifying growth. The powers that emerged victorious from World War II championed globalization as the antidote to future conflicts. In Asia, Europe and North America, governments of every ideological persuasion have focused on trade as their guiding economic force.But trade comes with no assurances that the spoils will be shared equitably. Across much of the industrialized world, an outsize share of the winnings have been harvested by people with advanced degrees, stock options and the need for accountants. Ordinary laborers have borne the costs and suffered from joblessness and deepening economic anxiety.These costs have proved overwhelming in communities that depend on industry for sustenance, vastly exceeding what economists anticipated. Policy makers under the thrall of neoliberal economic philosophy put stock in the notion that markets could be trusted to bolster social welfare.In doing so, they failed to plan for the trauma that has accompanied the benefits of trade. When millions of workers lost paychecks to foreign competition, they lacked government supports to cushion the blow. As a result, seething anger is upending politics in Europe and North America.\u201cThe trade policy of the European Union is paralyzed,\u201d said the Italian minister of economic development, Carlo Calenda, during a recent interview in Rome. \u201cThis is a tragic situation.\u201dThis tide of animosity may prove nearly impossible to reverse, given that technological disruption and economic upheaval are now at work in an era of scarcity. Today, many major nations are grappling with weak growth, tight credit and a gnawing sense that a lean future may persist indefinitely.The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression has left banks in Europe and the United States reluctant to lend. Real estate bonanzas from Spain to Southern California gave way to a disastrous wave of foreclosures, eliminating construction jobs. China\u2019s slowdown has diminished its appetite for raw materials, sowing unemployment from the iron ore mines of Brazil to the coal pits of Indonesia.Trade did not cause the breakdown in economic growth. Indeed, trade has helped generate what growth remains. But the pervasive stagnation has left little cover for those set back by globalization.\u201cThe debates that we are having about globalization and the adjustment cost, these are the conversations that we should have been having when we did Nafta, and when China entered the W.T.O.,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cThere were people talking about these things, but they weren\u2019t taken very seriously at the time. There\u2019s a lot of policy regret.\u201d\u201cWe do need to have these trade agreements,\u201d Mr. Bown said, \u201cbut we do need to be cognizant that there are going to be losers, and we need to have policies to address them.\u201dThe extent of the damage suffered by these \u201closers\u201d has accelerated an erosion of faith in the wealth-creating powers of free trade. A profound skepticism has taken root in some of the largest trading powers, notably the United States, France, Italy and Japan.Volumes of economic data tell a different story.Lower-income households have benefited from better prices on basic goods. As imports surged, the cost of baby and toddler clothes in the United States dropped by 10 percent from 1999 to 2013, according to an analysis by Pietra Rivoli, a trade expert at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. The price of shoes went up much more slowly than the overall cost of living.But the fear and anger over trade are well founded.Vast numbers of laborers have lost jobs as imported goods from low-wage countries arrived. Mills have closed, while strip malls fill with dollar stores and payday lenders.In the fallout, the United States maintained limits on unemployment benefits, leaving American workers vulnerable to plummeting fortunes. Social welfare systems have limited the toll in Europe, but economic growth has been weak, so jobs are scarce.American factories produced more goods last year than ever, by many indications. Yet they did so while employing about 12.3 million workers \u2014 roughly the same number as in 2009, when production was roughly three-fourths what it is today.Yet if robots are a more significant threat to paychecks, they are also harder to blame than hordes of low-wage workers in overseas factories.\u201cWe have a public policy toward trade,\u201d said Douglas A. Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a public policy on automation.\u201dWhen Michael Morrison took a job at the steel mill in the center of Granite City, Ill., in 1999, he assumed his future was ironclad.He was 38, a father with three young children.\u201cI felt like I had finally gotten into a place that was so reliable I could retire there,\u201d he said.The mill had been there \u2014 just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis \u2014 since the end of the 19th century. It had changed hands, ultimately landing in the portfolio of United States Steel. But the basics held. For those willing to sweat, the mill was a reliable means of supporting a family.Mr. Morrison began by shoveling slag out of the furnaces, working his way up to crane driver. From inside a cockpit tucked in the rafters of a cavernous building, he manned the controls, guiding a 350-ton ladle that spilled molten iron.It was a difficult job requiring finesse and perpetual focus. He was compensated accordingly, earning $24.62 an hour.He worked overtime shifts, amassing savings to send his children to college. Last year, he took home $86,000.His eldest daughter recently finished her master\u2019s in epidemiology. His son completed his sophomore year at McKendree University in nearby Lebanon.But events playing out on the other side of the world would soon upend his life.China\u2019s relentless development was turning farmland into factories, accelerated by a landmark in the history of trade: the country\u2019s inclusion in the World Trade Organization.The W.T.O. was born out of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a compact forged in 1947 that lowered barriers to international commerce in an effort to prevent a repeat of global hostilities.Most of this trade took place between wealthy countries with similar wages and labor standards. But the rollout of Nafta in the 1990s put American workers in direct competition with counterparts in Mexico, where wages were much lower and labor rights and environmental standards were minimal.A washing machine maker with factories in the United States now had a ready way to cut costs: set up a plant in Mexico.Still, Mexico \u2014 home to about 123 million people \u2014 was not big enough to refashion the terms of trade. When China joined the W.T.O. in 2001, that added a country of 1.3 billion people to the global trading system.China targeted crucial industries for domination, lavishing favored companies with sweetheart credit terms while investing aggressively in ports, highways and electrical generation. Anyone with ideas about organizing Chinese labor risked landing behind bars.In the first 13 years after China entered the W.T.O., its exports of goods swelled to nearly $2.3 trillion in 2014 from $266 billion, according to the World Bank.The beneficiaries of this surge include anyone who has bought practically anything touched by human hands \u2014 an iPhone, a car, a Christmas ornament. Corporations that used China to cut costs raised their value, enriching executives and ordinary investors.The casualties of China\u2019s exports are far fewer, but they are concentrated. The rugged country of western North Carolina suffered mass unemployment as Chinese-made wooden furniture put local plants out of business. So did glassmakers in Toledo, Ohio, and auto parts manufacturers across the Midwest.Mr. Trump vows to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. But that would very likely just shift production to other low-wage countries like Vietnam and Mexico. It would not turn the lights on at shuttered textile plants in the Carolinas. (Even if it did, robots would probably take most of the jobs.)Granite City sat smack in the middle of this gathering storm.Last fall, United States Steel began slowing production in Granite City, laying off 40 or so apprentices. As layoffs accelerated, they reached the ranks of more senior workers.Two days before Christmas, Mr. Morrison finished his shift and went into the break room. \u201cEverybody was standing there like zombies, looking at the bulletin board,\u201d he said. A list of names was tacked there, along with instructions for those workers to clean out their lockers.This is how Mr. Morrison found himself confronting a bewildering new state of affairs \u2014 joblessness.\u201cI\u2019ve worked since I was 12,\u201d he said, recalling a paper route, then a job as a cook at his brother\u2019s taco place.A blue Steelworkers union T-shirt hugs his burly frame. His calloused hands attest to years of physical labor. Suddenly, his $2,000 biweekly paycheck shrank to a $425-a-week unemployment check, plus some severance. In July, the unemployment checks stopped. He had reached the six-month limit.He interviewed for a job as a supervisor at an Amazon warehouse, but it required computer skills that he lacked. So he took a position as a \u201cfulfillment associate,\u201d working the night shift, pulling products off warehouse shelves and putting them in boxes. It paid $13 an hour \u2014 a little more than half his United States Steel wages.His first night on the job, his knees gave out. He took painkillers. The next morning he could barely stand up. He called in and said he would not be coming back. He has an interview coming up for a forklift driving position at a warehouse. It pays $12 an hour, another step down.\u201cI had to tell my son that he can\u2019t go back to McKendree for his junior year,\u201d Mr. Morrison says, straining to choke back tears. \u201cHe has to go to community college.\u201dHe swallows hard. Tears emerge from the corners of his eyes.\u201cIt just crushes you,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to go to college. I wanted my kids to succeed. When you see the disappointment in your kids\u2019 eyes. \u2026\u201dWhen Dan Simmons started working at the mill 38 years ago, talk centered on how to make steel. These days, he spends his days at a job for which he feels little prepared \u2014 de facto social worker.Mr. Simmons is the president of the Steelworkers Local 1899, which represents 1,250 workers at the Granite City plant. On a recent morning, only about 375 of his people are employed. He sits at his desk inside the brick union hall, greeting laid-off workers who arrive seeking help.One man wants guidance scanning online job listings. Another has hit a snag with his unemployment benefits.A night earlier, Mr. Simmons took a call on his cellphone from the niece of a high school classmate, a laid-off millworker. He had shot himself to death, leaving behind two children.Trade Adjustment Assistance, a government program started in 1962 and expanded significantly a dozen years later, is supposed to support workers whose jobs are casualties of overseas competition. The program pays for job training.But Mr. Simmons rolls his eyes at mention of the program. Training has almost become a joke. Skills often do not translate from old jobs to new. Many workers just draw a check while they attend training and then remain jobless.European workers have fared better. In wealthy countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, unemployment benefits, housing subsidies and government-provided health care are far more generous than in the United States.Yet in Europe, too, the impacts of trade have been uneven, in part because of the quirks of the European Union. Trade deals are cut by Brussels, setting the terms for the 28 member nations. Social programs are left to national governments.\u201cYou\u2019re pursuing trade and liberalization agreements at the E.U. level, and then leaving to the individual member countries how to deal with the damage,\u201d said Andrew Lang, a law professor at the London School of Economics.In Granite City, the damage now dominates Mr. Simmons\u2019s day.Inside the union hall, a supply cabinet has been outfitted as a food pantry. He hands out plastic bags full of canned foods \u2014 yellow corn, peas, green beans. He hands one to Mr. Morrison, who initially refuses to take it.\u201cThese are some proud steelworkers, and it\u2019s very difficult for them to do this,\u201d Mr. Simmons says. \u201cThese guys are used to making a living, and not asking for handouts.\u201dKenneth Hahn had been working at the plant for more than 40 years when he was laid off in February. He spends most of his time in his garden, tending to vegetables.His father lived on a Missouri farm without plumbing or electricity during the Great Depression.\u201cThey grew everything they needed,\u201d he said.If the mill does not start up again soon, Mr. Hahn is thinking about doing likewise.\u201cMove down to the holler,\u201d he said. \u201cI can always eat squirrel and rabbit.\u201dIn America, idled steelworkers are contemplating how to live off the land.Rotterdam has a history of looking across the water and finding things that can be turned into money.In the 16th century, it was herring. A burgeoning fleet set sail in pursuit. Merchants began salting and drying the catch in barrels for an emerging export trade. By the 17th century, local shipyards were clattering away, constructing vessels for the Dutch East India Company as it plied the spice routes to Southeast Asia.As waterways linking the port to the industrial communities of the Rhine were deepened and channelized, German automobiles and machinery began flowing through Rotterdam on the way to the rest of the planet. Offices filled with law firms, insurance agents and logistics companies.\u201cThe fortunes of this country have been built on trade,\u201d said Wouter Jacobs, a transportation economist at Erasmus University Rotterdam. \u201cIt\u2019s our lifeline.\u201dYet even here, unease has entered the conversation.Jacob van der Vis is paid to promote trade. An adviser on international business for the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce, he advertises innovations playing out at the port. He speaks of trade with China as a golden opportunity.Esso, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, the American petroleum company, has operations in the Netherlands. Suppose the government went ahead with plans to limit drilling to protect the environment?\u201cThey could sue the Dutch state,\u201d he fumed. \u201cWe are not so sure in the Netherlands whether we want to give the multinationals so much power. We are a trading country, but it\u2019s not always that trade should prevail against quality of life.\u201dOut at the docks, the longshoremen fret about robots.On a recent afternoon, the Mette Maersk, a Danish-flagged behemoth, sat tethered at APM Terminals. Some 18,000 shipping containers are stacked like children\u2019s blocks on a deck longer than three football fields, bearing auto parts, scrap metal, electronics \u2014 any conceivable thing made on one continent and sold on another.Robotic arms grip containers, lift them and deposit them on deck with thunderous rumbles. Trucks drive themselves.Yet to absorb this scene and conclude that robots are about to render humanity jobless is to miss something vital. At offices a few miles away, coders are designing the software powering the automated port system, earning wages they distribute through the economy.For the longshoremen still employed, automation has tamed their work.John Arkenbout remembers working through ceaseless wind and drizzle when he started at the port 25 years ago. He lifted huge bricks from a pile and dropped them into rope sacks that a crane operator lifted skyward. He saw three people die \u2014 one crushed by a truck, two flattened by wayward containers.Now many longshoremen sit in glass-fronted offices set back from the docks, controlling robotic arms via computer terminals.\u201cBefore, it was physically taxing,\u201d Mr. Arkenbout, 51, said. \u201cNow it\u2019s more mental.\u201dMost longshoremen earn about 50,000 euros a year, or $56,000. Mr. Arkenbout works a maximum of 40 hours a week.But he sees the robots becoming more sophisticated. He hears from union leadership that as many as 800 jobs could be eliminated by 2020.Mr. Arkenbout scoffs at the notion that automation and trade are separate. The shipping companies are deploying robots to cut costs.Trade deals, immigrant labor, automation: As Mr. Arkenbout sees it, these are all just instruments wielded in pursuit of the same goal \u2014 paying him less so corporations can keep more.\u201cWhen they don\u2019t need me anymore,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m nothing.\u201dAn earlier version of a chart with this article mislabeled a point on the horizontal axis. The final point in a series marking five-year spans should have been labeled \u201915, not \u201905.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Hero of the Empire,\u2019 a Young Churchill Earns His Spurs", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The Times\u201cI\u2019m free! I\u2019m free! I\u2019m Winston bloody Churchill, and I\u2019m free!\u201d he shouts in the film, just as he crosses the border to safety \u2014 a moment, we later realize, that could just as easily have referred to Churchill\u2019s psychological relief as his physical freedom: He had finally shaken off the legacy of his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, whose formidable early accomplishments and later humiliations stalked him like the moon.As her subtitle suggests, Ms. Millard similarly believes that the conflict in the Boer Republics profoundly influenced Churchill. But her book is much shorter on the anxiety of influence and far longer on the blustery impatience of youth. In Ms. Millard\u2019s retelling, young Churchill was entitled, precocious, supernaturally confident \u2014 one of those fellows whose neon self-regard is downright unseemly until the very moment it is earned.On its face, Churchill\u2019s role in the Second Boer War may not seem like a substantial enough subject for a book.The story Ms. Millard tells here is no less cinematic or dramatic. Churchill covered the Second Boer War as a correspondent for The Morning Post, but he was hardly an ordinary reporter: He insisted on traveling with his valet; he took along roughly $4,000 of fine wines and spirits, including 18 bottles of St.-\u00c9milion and another 18 of 10-year-old Scotch.Most critically, though, he brought with him a great thirst for redemption. Churchill, 24, had just stood for Parliament and lost, having made the dire mistake of running \u201con the strength of his father\u2019s name rather than his own.\u201d Though he\u2019d already fought in two wars \u2014 one in Sudan, the other on the northwest frontier of British India \u2014 and witnessed another as a reporter in Cuba, he \u201creturned home every time without the medals that mattered, no more distinguished or famous than he had been when he set out.\u201dIt was not for lack of trying. He charged the Pashtun while riding a bright gray pony. He stuck out like a bride.The bad news: Churchill was captured. The good news: Everyone in England knew about his bravery. The headlines were the stuff of his dreams. \u201cMR. CHURCHILL\u2019S HEROISM\u201d screamed The Yorkshire Evening Post.This part of the book \u2014 where the train derails \u2014 is the only part where the narrative derails, too. (The logistics of this particular skirmish? A bit of a bore. Or rather, too minutely conveyed. They\u2019re hard to follow.)Soldier through. The rest of Ms. Millard\u2019s book \u2014 about Churchill\u2019s time as a prisoner of war, his audacious escape, the outcome of the conflict \u2014 are as involving as a popcorn thriller. Ms. Millard does an excellent job conveying the drama of confinement, both inside the prison and out. Being on the run meant hiding in many dark, dank, undignified spaces. It meant tolerating uncertainty, which Churchill hated. It meant being powerless, utterly dependent on the mercy of strangers, and he hated that, too. \u201cIt had been hard enough,\u201d she writes, \u201cto take orders from his superiors while he was in the army.\u201dMs. Millard also shows, as she has in her previous work, that she has a great ear for quotes \u2014 an underrated virtue in writers of history. (Favorite example: The British ambassador to Berlin wrote that Churchill\u2019s mother had \u201cmore of the panther than of the woman in her look.\u201d) Her eye for detail is equally good. With just a few key images, she conveys how the most formidable empire on the planet could be so discomfited by an unpolished, seemingly ragtag army of Boers: \u201cAt most, British soldiers spent two months of the year actually training to fight,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe other 10 were devoted to parading, attending to their uniforms and waiting on their officers.\u201dIt didn\u2019t help matters that the British soldiers brought heaps of amenities into the field, which required many mules and oxen to lug. They were the hopeless dowager aunt who brings way too much luggage on holiday.But the real example of profligacy in this story may be young Churchill\u2019s ego. It\u2019s not a surprise, exactly. What\u2019s striking is the high volume of evidence Ms. Millard has compiled to show how unswervingly he believed in his own majestic destiny more than 40 years before he fulfilled it, and how early this belief began to appear, like the first visible outlines on a Polaroid.\u201cI do not believe the Gods would create so potent a being as myself for so prosaic an ending,\u201d Churchill wrote to his mother from Bangalore, trying to reassure her he wouldn\u2019t be killed in India.The powerful really are different from you and me. They have more confidence. It requires outsize stamina and self-assurance to save a nation. \u201cThe first time you meet Winston you see all his faults,\u201d his first love, Pamela Plowden, once said. \u201cAnd the rest of your life you spend in discovering his virtues.\u201dHero of the EmpireThe Boer War, a Daring Escape and the Making of Winston ChurchillBy Candice MillardIllustrated. 381 pages.

(The run has already been extended to Oct. 16; then Shelly Pfefferman has to move back to Marina del Rey to shoot Season 4, bubbeleh.)But as has become her way, it\u2019s the chance to take on a challenging, many-layered role that has her enticed. \u201cEach character I play,\u201d she explained, \u201cI have to wake up inside me.\u201dShe is tinier in person than onscreen, her giant brown eyes seemingly bigger than her waist, her straight blond hair showing just a whisper of beach curl. Even on a warm day, her black turtleneck looks uncommonly chic.She offers the greatest hits of rehearsal foods to her visitor: \u201cDid you say iced coffee? We have it. It\u2019s good here. I think you want it iced.\u201dPeople speak of gratitude easily \u2014 we hear of gratitude diaries, daily affirmations \u2014 but when Ms. Light expresses thanks for her fortune, it feels real. She is at an age when so many performers are frustrated and unemployed, and she has the luxury of scheduling one job after another. Yet listening to her describe her work, she sounds as much an analysand as a performer.Enter the very flawed, very LaButean Mrs. Johnson. (Let\u2019s reveal no more.)\u201cAll the Ways to Say I Love You\u201d is a 25-page, single-spaced monologue, which doesn\u2019t allow her the luxury to play off other actors, as she did to memorable effect as the world-weary truth-tellers in her Tony-winning roles.She recorded the text and listens to it as she goes to sleep \u2014 no pleasure given the subject matter. \u201cThis play is about lies \u2014 turning ourselves inside out and about how far one goes for a man,\u201d she explained.Why do it, then? \u201cI take things that are difficult,\u201d she said simply.This willingness to change course goes way back. As a theater graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, Ms. Light announced to her parents that she would not consider working in soap operas. Then came a role in \u201cOne Life to Live,\u201d as a housewife who became a part-time prostitute. It was a career-making hit with the audience and earned her two Emmys.\u201cI learned so much there, when I stopped being condescending,\u201d she said.\u201cI swore I\u2019d never do a sitcom,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was a woman of my word,\u201d she laughed ruefully, indicating the next eight years, in which she starred with Tony Danza in \u201cWho\u2019s the Boss\u201d for ABC. \u201cI stopped being prejudicial,\u201d she said.It was her longtime manager, Herb Hamsher, who suggested that she return to the theater after these two long runs. His message, she said, was \u201cif you want to stay in this business, you have to change people\u2019s impressions of you.\u201dShe stalled. She meditated. She liked living in Los Angeles with her husband, Robert Desiderio. Mr. Hamsher told her what she probably knew but wouldn\u2019t admit, that she was scared to be back onstage, where cameras and retakes and editing don\u2019t exist.Ms. Light went to a \u201cmeditative yoga ladies\u2019 camp\u201d to consider it further. She thought about the fear she felt about her career in relation to the boldness with which she advocated for the gay and lesbian community at the height of the AIDS pandemic. \u201cI don\u2019t like who I am,\u2019\u2019 she said to herself. \u201cI\u2019m going to audition for the next play that comes my way.\u201dFortunately, that audition happened to be for \u201cWit,\u201d the 1999 Pulitzer Prize-winner. Ms. Light hadn\u2019t been onstage in 22 years but got the chance to take over the leading role from the much-praised Kathleen Chalfant.Compared with the comedy for which she was so well known, \u201cWit\u201d was a drama about a serious scholar \u2014 unmarried, unattached and unsentimental \u2014 with terminal ovarian cancer. (Spoiler alert: It doesn\u2019t end well.) Could she imagine a tougher transformation?Ms. Light shaved off her glamorous golden hair and bared her soul; she spent a year as Vivian Bearing, both in New York and on a national tour, which included a run at the Kennedy Center in Washington.\u201c\u2018Wit\u2019 transformed my life,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the theater community to see me, believe in me \u2014 they allowed me to believe in myself, and they received me really warmly in a way that I had forgotten.\u201dHer latest forte has been playing Jewish mothers. She\u2019s not a mother herself, but she is Jewish \u2014 which came as a surprise to Ms. Soloway, the creator of \u201cTransparent,\u201d who said, \u201cI thought she was a shiksa princess.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re all her babies,\u201d Ms. Soloway said by telephone. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re the only family she bestows this Jewish maternal love on. I got a bee sting once on location, and she healed me with reiki.\u201dMs. Light pushed to be part of \u201cTransparent\u201d as an outgrowth of her commitment to gay and lesbian equality. \u201cI wanted this job so badly,\u2019\u2019 she said. It was a chance to act opposite Mr. Tambor, too: \u201cWe hadn\u2019t worked together since we were kids at the Milwaukee Rep.\u201dWhile it requires her to tuck her hair into a sensible wig, the series has shown her character to be hungry for affection, most famously in a bathtub scene in the episode \u201cFlicky-Flicky Thump-Thump,\u201d when Shelly becomes intimate once more with her ex.It\u2019s been a joy offscreen, too.\u201cJill creates the best working environment,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Light explained. \u201cWe begin the day with the whole cast and crew. It\u2019s a time to have a laugh or cry. Then we have the safest space. No one is told they\u2019re wrong or made a mistake.\u201dHer Off Broadway stage challenge is thornier. But it\u2019s her choice to take it, and her choice to leave it behind.\u201cMy job is to give the best performance,\u201d Ms. Light said. \u201cWe will have an experience together. I will have told them what Mrs. Johnson needed to say. Then I\u2019ll take off my costume and wig, and I might see a friend, or I might go home and take a bath.\u201dNo matter what comes next, \u201cI\u2019ll be grateful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hallelujah. Come next week, we\u2019ll be reveling in the flood of new fall shows, but for now, we\u2019ve got a three-day weekend to enjoy.Have a beautiful weekend.\u201cHigh Maintenance,\u201d now on all HBO streaming platformsWatch if you like short-story anthologies and perceptive but not cruel satire.The series stars the co-creator Ben Sinclair as \u201cthe guy,\u201d a bike-riding weed dealer who in each episode visits a different client or clients. The stories are very loosely interwoven, with some characters popping up in a few episodes, though if you miss the connections, you\u2019re not really poorer for it \u2014 it\u2019s more of a bonus.Though \u201cHigh\u201d has pot smoking as a central plot point, the show isn\u2019t at all stoner humor. It\u2019s a sometimes-wry, sometimes-poignant look at urban loneliness, and the character-building accomplished in these webisodes in just a few minutes puts plenty of feature films to shame. I have cried at episodes of \u201cHigh Maintenance.\u201d The pieces all work as stand-alones, so there\u2019s no bad place to start, although the emotional resonance works best when you watch several in a row.Watch if you like single-camera family comedies with a brain.Some people blame the cancellation of \u201cTrophy Wife\u201d on its misleading title. I prefer to blame it on the widespread global issue of people not behaving as I know they should.The 2013 ABC comedy stars Malin Akerman as the fun-loving new wife to a guy (Bradley Whitford) with three kids and two ex-wives (Marcia Gay Harden and Michaela Watkins). But the show isn\u2019t about wicked stepmothers or evil teens \u2014 everyone mostly gets along.\u201cTrophy\u201d takes a little while to find its footing, but even the sorta-lesser early episodes have plenty of appeal. If you have ever enjoyed an episode of \u201cModern Family,\u201d try \u201cTrophy Wife.\u201d If nothing else, the show gave us the wonderful Bert (Albert Tsai, now on \u201cDr. Ken\u201d), and his description of his greatest dance move, Bert-wheels: \u201cThey\u2019re like cartwheels, but with screaming.\u201dWatch if you liked previous seasons, or love France.\u201cChef\u2019s Table\u201d continues to be canonization in documentary\u2019s clothing, and the new batch of four episodes are about chefs in France \u2014 libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, hagiography.This isn\u2019t a complaint, though: I love that \u201cChef\u2019s Table\u201d goes as hard as possible on its mission to depict food and cooking as the apex of personal artistry and sensory pleasure. Sure, sometimes it\u2019s hard not to roll one\u2019s eyes a bit \u2014 we\u2019re saut\u00e9ing mushrooms here, not working in the coal mines \u2014 but every time there\u2019s a shot of someone methodically cutting through a big, pink hunk of fish, I swear my fingers genuinely, physically tingle with jealousy as I imagine how satisfying it must feel to be that good at slicing something that expensive.My wife and I are looking for a show to watch after we finish \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d or some similarly bleak drama. Something so I don\u2019t have nightmares, but hopefully, something I haven\u2019t seen before and I can get invested in.My wife and I tend to lose motivation with shows with primarily stand-alone episodes (like \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d) and need a through narrative thread to keep us going. Ideally this show is not longer than 45 minutes (although 30 would be better). We just finished \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d which filled this slot well. We\u2019re looking for something a little out of left field \u2026 \u2014 KevinIf you generally skip over teen shows, you\u2019ve been missing out. Expand your horizons! If you avoided \u201cThe O.C.\u201d or \u201cGossip Girl\u201d when they were on, this is the ideal circumstance in which to watch them. Neither needs to be watched all the way through, but the first seasons of each are magical. Both shows are chitter-chatter delights, and there\u2019s enough plot and story to keep you hooked but no lingering psychological baggage. \u201cMy Mad Fat Diary,\u201d a British teen import about a recently suicidal teen girl, is thoughtful and hilarious, and a more earnest follow-up to \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend.\u201dBut if you want a more traditional show for and about adults, try \u201cSensitive Skin.\u201dFinally, there are Ewan McGregor\u2019s motorcycle-trip documentary series \u201cLong Way Round\u201d (2004) and \u201cLong Way Down\u201d (2007). In each, McGregor and his BFF take a motorcycle trip around the world, first the \u201clong way [a]round\u201d from England to New York City, then from Scotland to South Africa. The paperwork alone is enough to keep me couch-bound, but these two seasons are equal parts charm, adventure and the worldview that most people are mostly good most of the time. Plus, unlike \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d no extended foot-lotioning sequences. That is the true palate cleanser.Roy (Michael Shannon) and his friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) kidnap Roy\u2019s son Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) from a religious cult and go on the run. Alton is able to do things that no other human can, and both the government and the cult want to use him for their own ends.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goodbye, Ivory Tower. Hello, Silicon Valley Candy Store.", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor eight years, Peter Coles had an economist\u2019s dream job at Harvard Business School.His research focused on the design of efficient markets, an important and growing field that has influenced such things as Treasury bill auctions and decisions on who receives organ transplants. He even got to work with Alvin E. Roth, who won a Nobel in economic science in 2012.But prestige was not enough to keep Mr. Coles at Harvard. In 2013, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. He now works at Airbnb, the online lodging marketplace, one of a number of tech companies luring economists with the promise of big sets of data and big salaries.Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior.\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute candy store for economists,\u201d Mr. Coles said.The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for a Ph.D. economist will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more.Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends \u2014 topics like recessions and currency exchange rates \u2014 and help their employers deal with them.But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they are studying the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging.Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft and up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of improved efficiency means more profit.At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic research scientist, is finely measuring the effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in economic behavior: What consumer actions occur coincidentally after people see ads, and what actions are most likely caused by the ads?At Airbnb, Mr. Coles is researching the company\u2019s marketplace of hosts and guests for insights, both to help build the business and to understand behavior. One study focuses on procrastination \u2014 a subject of great interest to behavioral economists \u2014 by looking at bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or months in advance? Do booking habits change by age, gender or country of origin?\u201cThey are microeconomic experts, heavy on data and computing tools like machine learning and writing algorithms,\u201d said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics.Understanding how digital markets work is getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian, Google\u2019s chief economist. But, he said, \u201cI thought it was fascinating years ago.\u201dMr. Varian, 69, is the godfather of the tech industry\u2019s in-house economists. Once a well-known professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Varian showed up at Google in 2002, part time at first, but soon became an employee. He helped refine Google\u2019s AdWords marketplace, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown on search pages, based on the words users type into Google\u2019s search engine.Google\u2019s insight was to avoid giving the best ad placement to the highest bidder. Mr. Varian worked to develop a different model for ad placement, calculating the probability that a user will click on an ad and find the ad relevant. It was a classic example of smart market design.Seeing this emerging job market, the National Association for Business Economics held its first meeting for technology company economists in April in San Francisco. Another is set for October in Silicon Valley.Academia is also starting to take notice \u2014 and adapt. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast, it\u2019s hard to keep up,\u201d said Susan Athey, an expert in the economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who is also a consultant to Microsoft.Many economics students also take computer science courses, and some major in both. But a new course this fall at Yale, called Designing the Digital Economy, seeks to blend economics and computer science in the way digital economists do at tech companies. The instructor is Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, and the course will have guest lecturers from Amazon, Pandora and Uber.The course is a pilot for curriculum change and perhaps a joint degree program focused on digital markets and their design. Dirk Bergemann, chairman of the Yale economics department, explained that economics was concerned with efficiency, prices and incentives, while computer science focused on algorithms and complexity.\u201cIn digital marketplaces, you are trying to address both sets of problems,\u201d he said.Mr. Weyl predicts that the rise of digital marketplaces in the economy is just getting underway. Uber in ride-hailing and Airbnb in room-renting, he said, may well be just the start of a redefinition of private property, made possible by digital technology.Things, according to Mr. Weyl, will increasingly be rented as services instead of owned. That is the long-term vision of driverless cars: When a vehicle just shows up on command, far fewer cars will sit in driveways. Transportation efficiency, resource consumption and industries will all be transformed, he said.The same could be true for household goods, Mr. Weyl said. One possible situation: After you use your espresso machine for breakfast, a drone comes to pick it up, and you rent it out for the day.A current market-design challenge for Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud computing services. These digital services, for example, face a peak-load problem, much as electric utilities do.How do you sell service at times when there is a risk some customers may be bumped off? Run an auction for what customers are willing to pay for interruptible service? Or offer set discounts for different levels of risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working on that now.To answer such questions, economists work in teams with computer scientists and people in business. In tech companies, market design involves not only economics but also engineering and marketing. How hard is a certain approach technically? How easy is it to explain to customers?\u201cEconomics influences rather than determines decisions,\u201d said Preston McAfee, Microsoft\u2019s chief economist, who previously worked at Google and Yahoo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fall TV Season Isn\u2019t Dead Yet. But Why?", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than a decade, television executives have been forecasting the eclipse of the fall TV season. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a real year-round schedule,\u201d Gail Berman, then president of entertainment at Fox, said in 2004. (At the time that meant putting \u201cNorth Shore,\u201d \u201cThe Jury\u201d and \u201cMethod & Red\u201d in the summer. But you have to start somewhere.)Yet despite the mad, year-round growth of TV since then, the fall season not only survives but remains the only season with any real identity. The traditional crush starts on Monday, with more than 80 new and returning network shows (and about 35 significant cable and streaming shows) crammed into six weeks.But what is the fall season, exactly, from a TV watcher\u2019s point of view? Despite the disproportionate amount of attention it still receives \u2014 including copious previews in magazines and newspapers \u2014 it\u2019s definitely not the home of TV\u2019s most acclaimed shows. Take a look at this year\u2019s Emmy nominees for best drama: Six of the seven shows started their seasons in the first half of the year, from January to June, and the seventh, \u201cHomeland,\u201d is moving from fall to winter (January) for its next season.If the fall doesn\u2019t have the most compelling dramas or cutting-edge comedies, what does it offer? One partial, uncomfortable answer is that it offers the greatest concentration of expensive, ostentatiously bad TV \u2014 formulaic, bombastic, ingratiating shows that make you shake your head at the squandering of money and talent.But a more useful way to look at it is that fall has become TV\u2019s equivalent of the summer movie season \u2014 it\u2019s popcorn time, the concentrated period in which profits need to be made. Fall is still where most of the tent-pole franchises reside, the remaining handful of shows capable of drawing a critical mass of viewers week in and week out \u2014 \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d \u201cNCIS,\u201d \u201cEmpire\u201d and, on the cable side, \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d the highest-rated scripted show in the 18-to-49 demographic that advertisers find so desirable.Will the fall season, as it\u2019s currently constituted, survive? The seemingly inexorable move of series television toward an \u00e0 la carte, on-demand model argues against it. Some vestige will survive, though, as long as the possibility of lucrative syndication sales based on 100-plus-episode runs still exists. But in a binge-watching world, with viewers increasingly choosing to focus on one series at a time, it probably makes more sense to spread your shows across the calendar rather than pile them into a few months. In the meantime, anecdotal evidence suggests that for a lot of TV watchers, fall represents a good time to binge on the shows they missed earlier in the year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Lesson of Tesla Crashes? Computer Vision Can\u2019t Do It All Yet", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJitendra Malik, a researcher in computer vision for three decades, doesn\u2019t own a Tesla, but he has advice for people who do.\u201cKnowing what I know about computer vision, I wouldn\u2019t take my hands off the steering wheel,\u201d he said.The Tesla accident in May, researchers say, was not a failure of computer vision. But it underscored the limitations of the science in applications like driverless cars despite remarkable progress in recent years, fueled by digital data, computer firepower and software inspired by the human brain.Researchers are training computers to recognize actions and behaviors.Today, computerized sight can quickly and accurately recognize millions of individual faces, identify the makes and models of thousands of cars, and distinguish cats and dogs of every breed in a way no human being could.Yet the recent advances, while impressive, have been mainly in image recognition. The next frontier, researchers agree, is general visual knowledge \u2014 the development of algorithms that can understand not just objects, but also actions and behaviors.Computing intelligence often seems to mimic human intelligence, so computer science understandably invites analogy. In computer vision, researchers offer two analogies to describe the promising paths ahead: a child and the brain.The model borrowed from childhood, many researchers say, involves developing algorithms that learn as a child does, with some supervision but mostly on its own, without relying on vast amounts of hand-labeled training data, which is the current approach. \u201cIt\u2019s early days,\u201d Dr. Malik said, \u201cbut it\u2019s how we get to the next level.\u201dIn computing, the brain has served mainly as an inspirational metaphor rather than an actual road map. Airplanes don\u2019t flap their wings, artificial intelligence experts often say. Machines do it differently than biological systems.If successful, the outcome could be a breakthrough in computer vision and machine learning in general, Dr. Poggio said. \u201cTo do that,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need neuroscience not just as an inspiration, but as a strong light.\u201dThe big gains in computer vision owe much to all the web\u2019s raw material: countless millions of online photos used to train the software algorithms to identify images. But collecting and tagging that training data have been a formidable undertaking.ImageNet, a collaborative effort led by researchers at Stanford and Princeton, is one of the most ambitious projects. Initially, nearly one billion images were downloaded. Those were sorted, labeled and winnowed to more than 14 million images in 22,000 categories. The database, for example, includes more than 62,000 images of cats.Vast image databases like ImageNet have been employed to train software that uses neuron-like nodes, known as neural networks. The concept of computing neural networks stretches back more than three decades, but has become a powerful tool only in recent years. \u201cThe available data and computational capability finally caught up to these ideas of the past,\u201d said Trevor Darrell, a computer vision expert at the University of California, Berkeley.Just how far neural networks can advance computer vision is uncertain. They emulate the brain only in general terms \u2014 the software nodes receive digital input and send output to other nodes. Layers upon layers of these nodes make up so-called convolutional neural networks, which, with sufficient training data, have become better and better at identifying images.Or take a fluid scene like a dinner party. A person carrying a platter will serve food. A woman raising a fork will stab the lettuce on her plate and put it in her mouth. A water glass teetering on the edge of the table is about to fall, spilling its contents. Predicting what happens next and understanding the physics of everyday life are inherent in human visual intelligence, but beyond the reach of current deep learning technology.Recognizing situations enriches computer vision, but the ImSitu project still depends on human-labeled data to train its machine learning algorithms. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still very, very far from visual intelligence, understanding scenes and actions the way humans do,\u201d Dr. Farhadi said.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but the pace of improvement is getting us there,\u201d said Gary Bradski, a computer vision scientist who has worked on self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait years and years until some semblance of intelligence arrives, before we have self-driving cars that are safer than human drivers and save thousands of lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I bought a whole pack.Have a restorative weekend.\u201cSon of Zorn,\u201d Sunday, 8 p.m., Fox.Watch if you like comedy with an outlandish premise.Real talk, \u201cZorn\u201d \u2014 a sitcom that combines live-action and animation \u2014 looked horrible in its promos and I fully expected to dislike it or just not care at all. To my huge surprise, I found it pretty funny and enjoyable, and certainly not like anything else.Zorn (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) is a He-Man\u2013esque cartoon hero who returns to California hoping to win back his wife Edie (Cheryl Hines) and teenage son Alangulon, a.k.a. Alan (Johnny Pemberton), who aren\u2019t particularly amenable to his return. There are sight gags, and much fun is had with the kooky ways a swords-and-sandals cartoon guy would respond to regular society, but the show\u2019s humor extends beyond its fish-out-of-water gags. For example, when asked what he thinks adults talk about, Alan guesses \u201cjazz and birth control?\u201d\u201cZorn\u201d might work better on paper than in practice: I can\u2019t quite get on board with the aesthetics, and the world-building could use some work. But I did laugh! In a comedy era with so much self-seriousness and introspection, maybe Zorn is exactly the hero we need.Watch if you like to cry \u2026 but also laugh?I will warn you, though, that if you are currently muddling through some grief, this might not be the right show at the right time. I barely made it through the second episode of \u201cMississippi\u201d and had to bail \u2014 not because I didn\u2019t think it was good. I thought it was great. But I watched the pilot right when it came out, before my grandma died, and watching this new batch of episodes, here in the \u201cafter\u201d section that I guess describes the rest of my life, was just too hard. I cried way more than I was emotionally budgeted for and had to stop. Maybe some day.\u201cQuarry,\u201d Friday, 10 p.m., Cinemax.Watch if you like shows about hard-drinking men with greasy hair and dark secrets.Based on Max Allan Collins\u2019s books, \u201cQuarry\u201d follows a vilified Vietnam vet (Logan Marshall-Green) who returns home to Memphis in 1972 and falls under the employ of a powerful crime lord.The show is bleak and elegant, with the stylish cinematography and brutal violence we all expect from cable dramas, though luckily with a brain and central moral questions. \u201cQuarry\u201d hails from the \u201cRectify\u201d writers Michael D. Fuller and Graham Gordy, and despite its strengths it doesn\u2019t quite have that show\u2019s poetic introspection. Does anything?The first follows the king and queen of Longtrellis (John C. Reilly and Salma Hayek) in their desperate efforts to produce an heir. In another land, the king of Highhills (Toby Jones) bungles a competition for his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage, leaving her to survive her new husband. Next door, the insatiable king of Strongcliff (Vincent Cassel) sleeps with all of the women in the land until he falls for the deceptive Dora (Stacy Martin), whose youthful beauty is the product of magic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Choice Beyond Cable Box Rentals? It May Hinge on a Swing Voter", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it turns out the biggest threat to the plan, which the F.C.C. is expected to vote on Thursday, is a low-profile Democratic commissioner within the agency itself.\u201cI\u2019m going to be very candid here that I have some problems,\u201d Ms. Rosenworcel said in a Senate hearing this month when asked for her opinion on the cable box proposal.Her remarks immediately reverberated across the communications and tech industries, which both have huge stakes in the outcome of the vote, as a sign the plan could be in trouble. The proposal needs a majority vote to pass before going into effect in two years.\u201cThis was a very significant moment, and she is in a very important position because so much is at stake,\u201d said Chip Pickering, president of Incompas, a lobbying group that represents Google and Amazon and supports the plan.The cable box proposal, introduced in January by the F.C.C.\u2019s chairman, Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, would open up the set-top box market by forcing cable and satellite companies to put their television programming on third-party devices instead of on cable boxes. That would let people more easily combine streaming services and cable channels on one device, like a Roku or Apple TV, or on no device at all through internet-enabled television sets. Cable customers would still be able to rent a box from their provider, if they prefer.At the same time, tech companies like Google and Amazon, among others, stand to gain if the plan is passed because they want a stronger foothold in living room technology.All of this puts Ms. Rosenworcel on the hot seat.\u201cAll eyes will focus on Commissioner Rosenworcel, whose views will likely decide the fate of the proposal,\u201d Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, wrote in a recent report about the set-top box plan. \u201cThis is the first time in her career she will be seen as the deciding vote in an issue of this visibility.\u201dMs. Rosenworcel, a native of Hartford, Conn., and a graduate of Wesleyan University and the New York University School of Law, spent a dozen years on telecom issues as an aide to two Democratic senators and as a staff member for a Democratic commissioner at the F.C.C. before being appointed to the agency in 2012. Ms. Rosenworcel, 45, is viewed as an official with a keen sense of the pulse of Silicon Valley.\u201cShe has a tremendous record of public service and has focused attention to the needs of consumers and vulnerable populations,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit public interest group that supports the cable box proposal.When it comes to voting on F.C.C. issues, Ms. Rosenworcel has nearly always stuck with her Democratic colleagues, including on net neutrality in 2015 and on a subsidy to provide broadband to low-income households this year.But she has dissented on some issues and questioned orders brought by Mr. Wheeler, including in 2014, when the F.C.C. chairman proposed allowing cellphones in planes. Ms. Rosenworcel said the idea would be a burden for passengers.With the cable box plan, Ms. Rosenworcel\u2019s concerns hinge on what she views as what may be too much meddling by the F.C.C. in the private agreements between cable providers and device makers. However, consumer groups say the F.C.C. needs to play an oversight role in those licensing deals to ensure fairness. In an emailed statement last week, she said she believed that the market for costly set-top boxes required reform. But she said the cable box proposal needed to be revised to comply with copyright and licensing laws that would not give the F.C.C. outsize power.\u201cI just don\u2019t think we have the authority\u201d to get so involved in the licensing agreements, Ms. Rosenworcel said at the Senate hearing this month.Ms. Rosenworcel is separately in the spotlight for her renomination to the F.C.C. Because of partisan squabbling in Congress, her reconfirmation has been delayed for 15 months.In the last days before the vote, members of Ms. Rosenworcel\u2019s and Mr. Wheeler\u2019s offices have been meeting to negotiate revisions to the portions of the plan that she opposes. Mr. Wheeler has already made some changes to the proposal to pacify cable and satellite companies over their control of programming.Mr. Wheeler\u2019s office declined to comment ahead of the vote this week.Ms. Rosenworcel, when asked how she will vote on Thursday, has demurred.\u201cIt\u2019s time to move beyond clunky and costly set-top boxes,\u201d she wrote in an email last week. \u201cThat\u2019s why I fully support the objective here. Now we need to find a way to make this work under the law we have.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The new console will also present games using another technology called high dynamic range, or H.D.R., which offers big improvements in color and other image enhancements.The PlayStation 4 Pro will cost $400 and goes on sale Nov. 10. Sony also announced a new, slimmer version of its base model of PlayStation 4 that will sell for $300 starting on Sept. 15.Andrew House, chief executive of Sony\u2019s video game division, said in a phone interview that Sony\u2019s decision to release the PlayStation 4 Pro was influenced by the speed of change in the mobile industry, which has come to rival consoles for the attention of gamers. The first PlayStation 4 came out in 2013.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if we didn\u2019t wait seven years before we started to innovate and tried something new?\u201d Mr. House asked, referring to the time between the introductions of the PlayStation 4 and its predecessor, the PlayStation 3.Sales of 4K television sets have surged as prices have come down and models have proliferated. In the second quarter, the average price of 4K televisions was down 29 percent from a year earlier, to $877, the research firm IHS Markit Technology estimates. H.D.R. is a newer feature on 4K television sets that generally adds a premium of 20 to 30 percent to the price, according to Paul Gagnon, an IHS analyst.About 55 million 4K televisions will be sold worldwide this year, but only about 3.5 million will include H.D.R., Mr. Gagnon estimates. \u201cIn a couple years, we expect there won\u2019t be many TVs sold over 50 inches that aren\u2019t 4K,\u201d he said.The availability of video that exploits 4K sets has been improving, but it is still limited. Streaming video services from Amazon and Netflix are among the early adopters of the technology for their original programming.Microsoft, Sony\u2019s primary rival in the console market, announced its own 4K-capable Xbox One console this year, with the code name Project Scorpio. But that system will not be available until next year\u2019s holiday season.Sony already has a comfortable lead in the console market, having sold more than 40 million of the PlayStation 4. Microsoft no longer reveals sales figures for the Xbox One.Game developers will need to adapt their existing PlayStation 4 games to take advantage of the better image quality of the new Sony console, and update them over the internet. New installments of best-selling games like Call of Duty by Activision and Battlefield by Electronic Arts will support the PlayStation 4 Pro\u2019s better image quality when they go on sale, the publishers said.Joost van Dreunen, chief executive of SuperData Research, a game research firm, says he thinks Sony could persuade 10 to 20 percent of existing PlayStation 4 owners to buy the new model, along with people who mainly play games on PCs.\u201cThis sets them up for another three to five years,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The present confronts the past and transforms it into the future. Or so one hopes, anyway. It doesn\u2019t always work out like that.Sometimes the present stumbles over the past and falls flat. Which was it at Saint Laurent?A purposeful pratfall and a hop to the side.Mr. Vaccarello dove into the YSL of the 1980s for his introductory effort, eschewing the usual tropes of safari suiting, gypsies and Mondrian in favor of the big-shouldered, shirred, asymmetrical, metallic Saint Laurent of the later years (plus some Smokings, given a streetwise slant with the sleeves lopped off; transformed into a jumpsuit; or rendered in a slick, square-shouldered tuxedo over skintight denim).Like many designers of his generation \u2014 he is in his mid-30s \u2014 Mr. Vaccarello is fascinated by the decade that defined his youth, and he revisited it in a stream of thigh-high, one-shouldered, single-leg-of-mutton-sleeved, breast-baring dresses in leather, lace, Lurex and leopard spots. Also one Amazon-at-the-disco moment with leather skirt and rhinestone pastie.Certainly, he did not take Mr. Slimane\u2019s approach to merchandising the runway, disguising a broad array of options under an attitude of grunge. Instead, he offered one idea, and he offered it a lot. But a disembodied striped sleeve strapped across the torso like evening armor and worn over a white tank top and slouchy black trousers aside, he didn\u2019t refine that idea to the point where it becomes an abstraction: the kind of garment that transcends its own origins to demand reassessment. He just repeated it. \u201cFree the nipple\u201d can be politics or it can be kitsch. Mr. Vaccarello purposefully made it into the latter.Speaking before the show, Mr. Vaccarello said he was drawn to the 1980s because that\u2019s the period of YSL that cool girls today search out in vintage stores, and then customize and make their own. But there\u2019s a reason those 1980s pieces ended up in resale shops as opposed to preserved for posterity. No joke.This kind of denatured homage has become something of a rite of passage among new designers at heritage houses. Now that he\u2019s done it, perhaps Mr. Vaccarello, who has a signature way with leather and a quiet conviction, can get past the obvious, start mining the essence and move on.One designer who could tell him about the importance of learning from your own history is Olivier Theyskens, erstwhile crown prince of Parisian fashion, who after a tumultuous tour through three other brands (Rochas, Nina Ricci and Theory) and some time in the wilderness has returned with his first namesake collection since 2001: older, wiser and the better for it.His signatures were all there \u2014 hook-and-eye closures on fluted leather or python minidresses; fluid jackets; Jane Eyre silhouettes (for governesses at the Hard Rock Academy anyway); boned bustiers and hip-slung trousers; even two ball gowns trailing wisps of gothic romance \u2014 but they had the serenity that comes from not needing to be a buzz-making machine anymore. Liberated from place or decade, they were simply good clothes, beautifully made. It was enough.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Mr. Robot\u2019 Season 2, Episode 11: The Dark Room", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. RobotNearly every scene in Wednesday\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot\u201d consists simply of two characters talking. But these scenes, as with the conversations these characters have, involve two distinct and indispensable sides. There are the pairs doing the talking, yes: a prisoner and a child, an executive and a government official, an F.B.I. agent and her electronic home companion, a prisoner and her captor, a prisoner (now liberated) and her lawyer, and a madman and a dead man, to name a few. But this is no parade of talky two-handers. In addition to the actors and their dialogue, each of these tightly constructed exchanges involves set design, sound design, cinematography and editing so distinctive, so breathlessly bold, they might as well be from different shows.Only the courage of this series\u2019 second season to follow its artistic convictions-cum-obsessions as far as they\u2019ll go ties them together.Let out of the van in a painfully perfect suburban garage (complete with a tennis ball on a string to prevent the front bumper from hitting the wall), she is escorted into a sumptuously appointed home with black-and-white d\u00e9cor and a series of family photographs on a wall with the subjects\u2019 faces blotted out by swathes of color. She\u2019s then led into a room that could have been part of the cosmic hotel suite David Bowman visited at the end of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d: a red floor; black walls; a skylight; a slowly leaking fish tank; a \u201chang in there\u201d poster, complete with dangling kitten; and a desk covered with antiquated technology (a rotary phone, a Commodore 64 and a paperback copy of the appropriately Kubrickian novel \u201cLolita\u201d).Here, as composer Mac Quayle\u2019s barely-there score rumbles like distant thunder, Angela finds herself face to face with a little girl \u2014 real-world interrogator or dream-world doppelg\u00e4nger? At first it\u2019s hard to tell \u2014 who asks her a series of gnomic questions from a computer game. Some are unnerving, particularly given the young age of the questioner and the beating she says she\u2019ll incur should Angela refuse to answer: \u201cHave you ever cried during sex?\u201d \u201cHave you ever fantasized about murdering your father?\u201d Others are as cryptically revealing as a BuzzFeed personality quiz: \u201cAre you a giraffe or a sea gull?\u201d \u201cAre you red or purple?\u201dThe question that unlocks the next stage of Angela\u2019s journey falls somewhere in between: \u201cIs the key in the room?\u201d Angela\u2019s non-answer prompts a call from the threatening red phone, the menace of which evokes similar scenes from the works of David Lynch as surely as the severe black, white and red environment recalls the Red Room from \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d At the other end of the line is a computerized voice that walks Angela through what feels like the beginning of a text-based adventure game involving a dark room with a locked door. Glancing at the red silhouette of the title character on the cover of \u201cLolita,\u201d Angela intuits that she has had the key all along, it\u2019s in her (or Dolores Haze\u2019s) clenched fist \u2014 the key is indeed in the room.So, after enough time passes for the fish in the draining tank to die, the door opens, and her tormentor is revealed: Whiterose, the Dark Army\u2019s transgender general. This self-described \u201cwoman of time\u201d has gone through all this time and trouble, she says, because she finds Angela\u2019s presence at the center of so many of the world-shaking events that have transpired since her and Elliot\u2019s parents died at E Corp\u2019s hands to be baffling.In order to make Angela fit her rigid schematic for how things are supposed to work, Whiterose demands she surrender not her proof of any misdeeds, but \u201cher belief\u201d that \u201cif you imagined or believed in something it would come true, simply by will.\u201d Like many of Whiterose\u2019s scenes this season, this can be read as a veiled commentary on her own transition, but it\u2019s more readily understood here as an implicit argument that she alone possesses this power. \u201cYes, actually, I did believe that,\u201d Angela says, giving in. \u201cBut I\u2019m slowly having to admit that\u2019s just not the real world.\u201dWhiterose, now seeming nearly as emotionally drained as Angela herself, responds, \u201cWell, I guess it all depends on what your definition of real is.\u201dWith that, the scene fades to black, and we re-emerge into the consciousness of Elliot, who\u2019d begun the episode with instructions to induce lucid dreaming in order to become the \u201csilent observer\u201d of his Mr. Robot personality, rather than the other way around.Was it all a dream? A subsequent visit by Angela to the home of her do-gooding lawyer friend, whom she orders to cease contacting her, indicates that it wasn\u2019t, but it\u2019s really unimportant.As Elliot puts it later, when he finds himself in a cab with the supposedly deceased Tyrell Wellick: \u201cThis is no longer a question of what I\u2019m seeing. No, we know that\u2019s not reliable. The question is, what am I not seeing.\u201d The answer by now is \u201cso very much.\u201dWe can\u2019t see the nature of \u201cStage 2,\u201d the plan Elliot devised with Whiterose and now does not remember. We can\u2019t see E Coins, the cryptocurrency a chortling Phillip Price crams down the throat of the United States government after his company\u2019s Whiterose-instigated $2 trillion bailout from China. We can\u2019t see Alexa, Amazon\u2019s proprietary artificial intelligence, whom a desperately depressed Agent DiPierro grills about love and loneliness as she drifts off to sleep following her near death at the hands of Whiterose\u2019s goons. We can\u2019t see whether Darlene and Cisco, those assassins\u2019 targets, are alive or dead.It\u2019s fitting that the episode ends with a version of \u201cEarth Angel,\u201d another \u201cBack to the Future\u201d music cue, one that plays as the time-displaced Marty McFly begins fading from sight. The message of \u201cMr. Robot\u201d is that human connection is being erased by forces beyond our ability to view. Like Angela, we\u2019re locked in a dark room, and the key leads only to more darkness. Be glad that a show this confident in its own black beauty exists to briefly light the way.Advertisement"}

Rather, they want to foster \u201cpublic understanding\u201d and set \u201cbest practices\u201d for work in artificial intelligence.\u201cWe passionately believe in the potential for it to transform in a positive way our world,\u201d said Mustafa Suleyman, head of applied A.I. for DeepMind, an artificial intelligence development company acquired by Google in 2014. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s critical now to start to think about new models of engagement with the public, new models of collaboration across the industry and new models of transparency around the work that we do.\u201dThe group released eight tenets that are evocative of Isaac Asimov\u2019s original \u201cThree Laws of Robotics,\u201d which appeared in a science fiction story in 1942. The new principles include high-level ideals such as, \u201cWe will seek to ensure that A.I. technologies benefit and empower as many people as possible.\u201dNevertheless, at least one of the tenets implies that the companies realize they could be drawn into sticky ethical situations, and it calls on engineers to oppose the use of artificial intelligence technology in weapons or other tools that could be used to violate human rights.\u201cWith the hyperbole about A.I. over the last two to four years, there have been concerns in an echo chamber of anxiety that the government itself will be misinformed,\u201d said Eric Horvitz, managing director for Microsoft Research.The researchers said they were talking with other companies like Apple and research laboratories like the new nonprofit research group OpenAI about participating in their organization.Advertisement"}

Lately, it\u2019s been more like tragedy minus a half-hour.Laughing yet? You might be, actually, though the laughs generated by the first episode are the cathartic kind, drawing on the disorienting, uncanny experience of confronting the empty shell that used to contain someone you loved.After Tig\u2019s mother dies, for instance, Tig fantasizes being told that she has to bring the body home with her. She wheels the deathbed through the hospital corridor as the staff cheer and wish her well. Snapping back to reality, Tig finds herself lost in a hallway. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to leave,\u201d she tells a nurse.\u201cOne Mississippi\u201d is about how you can never really leave \u2014 not your home, not your good and bad memories, not even the dead and buried. Tig ends up extending her visit as she deals with her mother\u2019s estate, confronts buried issues from her past and manages a long-distance relationship with her flighty girlfriend, Brooke (Casey Wilson). The series starts with an ending, then simultaneously moves backward and forward.Remy is sweet but emotionally stunted, a middle-aged teacher who hasn\u2019t had a girlfriend since high school. Bill is so uptight he considers it cheating to pause a coffee maker to pour a cup before the full pot has brewed. (\u201cI prefer to let the machine complete its process,\u201d he says.) With shellshocked Tig, the house becomes a halfway home for incomplete adults, absent Caroline, who had been the glue connecting them.Caroline becomes a character, too, a Southern-vivacious life force in flashbacks and fantasies. But as Tig settles her family\u2019s affairs, she learns things about her mother that clash with her gauzy memories. \u201cOne Mississippi\u201d becomes a study of how identity, in a family, is a group project \u2014 we often edit our loved ones into the people we want them to be.As can happen when comedians star in series, Ms. Notaro often seems to be narrating her scenes more than experiencing them. She has a low-key charm, but the scenes in which she talks about her life on the radio feel more immediate than Tig\u2019s experiences in the moment.There is a power, though, to having Ms. Notaro herself star in this personal story about the fragility of the body, her mother\u2019s and her own. (As she has in her standup, she reveals her mastectomy scars to bold effect.) And her supporting cast is strong, especially the terrific Mr. Rothman, who locates the stress fractures of emotion beneath Bill\u2019s sheer granite face. The season\u2019s arc, in which Tig and Bill confront long-buried family secrets, brings out the best in both performers.\u201cOne Mississippi\u201d tries to hit many notes in its short run \u2014 grief, light comedy, anger, small-town whimsy \u2014 and the shifts can be jarring. But if you binge the show at a stretch, the conflicting tones resolve into something like the happy-sad-exhausted emotional overload you feel after a wake.Is that comedy? Tragedy? Mel Brooks, in \u201cThe 2000 Year Old Man,\u201d once defined the two. \u201cTragedy is if I cut my finger,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cComedy is if you walk into an open sewer and die.\u201d For Ms. Notaro, as for many artists in today\u2019s confusing, rewarding field of not-just-comedy, the distinctions are not so absolute. Cut fingers or death, it\u2019s all material.Advertisement"}

Instead, as they try to break through the television glut, NBC, ABC and Fox are suddenly serving up audacious, almost experimental prime-time humor more in keeping with cable networks like FX and the risk-taking streaming services. There is an overbearing animated warrior returning to the real world, where he wreaks suburban havoc while revisiting his live-action family. Another new comedy provides Jenna Elfman with a furry, spotted, nonhuman B.F.F. with a big mouth.These \u201chigh-concept\u201d shows (to use the Hollywood term) can be difficult to execute, partly because writers must walk a fine line between inventive and gimmicky, especially given the broadcast networks\u2019 longer seasons, compared with cable. But they represent a new programming strategy for old-school prime time. Broadcasters are not quite throwing in the ratings towel, but they are trying to worry less about an immediate mass audience and more about finding, at the very least, a group of core fans attracted to a strong comedic point of view \u2014 what Jennifer Salke, NBC\u2019s president of entertainment, calls \u201cnot a broad and soft, trying-to-please-the-whole-world kind of show.\u201d\u201cInstead of ending up in the not-so-special middle, do comedy that is specific and sophisticated,\u201d Ms. Salke said in an interview. \u201cThat might mean that it\u2019s not for everybody. But a big group of people will love it, and those people will become advocates and help build a broader audience over time.\u201d She added, \u201cDramas use what-will-happen-next to keep people coming back. More than ever, comedies rely on passionate fans.\u201d\u201cYou are competing not just against what\u2019s on television right now but against everything that\u2019s been made in the history of television,\u201d Mr. Miller said, noting the many services that offer old shows. (\u201cFamily Ties,\u201d for example, is available on Amazon, iTunes, CBS All Access and Vudu.) As a result, Mr. Lord and Mr. Miller say shows must push beyond accepted boundaries. At its core, \u201cSon of Zorn\u201d is a fish-out-of-water comedy \u2014 one of the oldest setups in the book \u2014 but the animation-live-action mash-up lends it a freshness, or so they hope.\u201cWe\u2019re not in as much of a big-tent landscape anymore,\u201d Mr. Lord added, echoing Ms. Salke\u2019s point about shifting broadcast network thinking, at least concerning comedy: Rather than aiming at everyone, find an audience \u2014 any audience \u2014 as long as it\u2019s a passionate one. (Consider \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d one of the more out-there shows from last year. The musical comedy series was a ratings flop, but CW gave it a second season largely because the fans it did attract were extremely vocal.)\u201cSon of Zorn\u201d is intended to explore divorce in a new way, and maybe even immigration. (After all, Zorn comes from a distant island.) \u201cMaking History\u201d will have an undercurrent of \u201cgoing back and addressing your regret,\u201d Mr. Lord said.And Mr. Schur said he has ideas about ethics that he wants to explore in \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d including living life in a \u201cself-sacrificing, empathetic way without being preachy or soapboxy.\u201dSo that left him with \u201cother.\u201d Mr. Schur, 40, said he began to think about a game he sometimes plays while commuting.\u201cIt\u2019s about desperately hoping that someone is keeping score of the terrible things that people do when they are driving,\u201d he said. \u201cFor instance, when people are trying to turn against traffic at a stoplight. I believe that two cars are allowed to turn as the light turns yellow. Two. When there\u2019s a third, I get annoyed. When there\u2019s a fourth, I go crazy.\u201d Mr. Schur said he started to meld that idea with a sketch he created in 1999 as a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer. \u201cIt never got on the air,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was about God coming to earth and saying, \u2018Just so everyone knows, the correct answer is Presbyterian.\u2019\u201dMs. Bell loved the idea of a comedy about ethical behavior.\u201cThis topic \u2014 being a good person, what is my ripple effect in the world \u2014 is something that I was already spending a lot of time thinking about in my personal life,\u201d she said, sitting in the show\u2019s hair and makeup trailer. \u201cLike, sometimes to the degree that I drive myself crazy.\u201d She added, making a loose-screw hand gesture beside her head, \u201cMike didn\u2019t know that side of me then, but he certainly does now!\u201dFor his part, Mr. Danson, who plays a bow-tie-wearing guide to the afterlife, said \u201cThe Good Place\u201d appealed to him because it was so weird. Along with flying shrimp, the pilot episode involves monster-truck-size ladybugs, Ariana Grande and a Buddhist monk \u2014 heaven meets \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201d (The grasshoppers, alas, were deemed too over the top.)There is enormous pressure on \u201cThe Good Place\u201d to perform, even with Ms. Salke\u2019s professed ratings patience. Based on Mr. Schur\u2019s track record, NBC decided to forgo making a pilot and speed ahead with 13 episodes. The network aggressively promoted the show during the Olympics, and has planned a high-profile rollout for it: Two new episodes will run back-to-back on Monday, Sept. 19, after the season premiere of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d followed by a third new episode on Sept. 22. \u201cThe Good Place\u201d will subsequently air on Thursday nights.Mr. Schur feels the weight of NBC\u2019s expectations. But he said the network\u2019s willingness to let him complete all 13 episodes in a bubble (all will have been shot before the first airs) was essential to ironing out the wrinkles that come with such an unorthodox concept.\u201cThis show, so far, has been a lot of trial and error,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s too much, what\u2019s too little. Viewers must feel comfortable and tethered and in good hands \u2014 that this wild stuff is happening for a reason, and it\u2019s not just crazy, willy-nilly land.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "That Voice Inside Your Head? It May Be His", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Simon McBurney was chatting about his children as a technician adjusted his microphone. How many photographs he had of them on his phone \u2014 more than had ever been taken of him in his lifetime. How memories are preserved and created around images and sound. \u201cPut on your headphones,\u201d he urged, going on to explain how binaural technology \u2014 sound transmitted separately into each ear \u2014 works, fooling the brain into imagining a person is just inches away.But Mr. McBurney, who wrote and directed the play, wasn\u2019t really chatting casually. He was rehearsing the monologue at the start of \u201cThe Encounter,\u201d for which each audience member wears headphones. In those first moments, he was doing what he has done throughout his theater-making career: building magic from the stuff of everyday, drawing the audience in to the ruminations about storytelling and memory, illusion and reality, fantasy and imagination, time and consciousness that permeate \u201cThe Encounter.\u201dHis voice and other voices are in the ears of each audience member. So are the sounds of the Amazon rain forest, the shriek of birds, the crackle of leaves underfoot, the chatter of children, the whine of mosquitoes and the roar of a Cessna plane. Interspersed with McIntyre\u2019s adventures are recorded interruptions from Mr. McBurney\u2019s 7-year-old daughter and snippets of testimony from experts on the nature of consciousness, memory and time.Nigel Redden, the director of the Lincoln Center Festival, which has presented Complicite five times since 1996, described Mr. McBurney as \u201cone of the great theater-makers in the world today.\u201d He added: \u201cI think his strength is that he is doing absolutely his own work. He has increasingly become someone who can tell a very complicated story and make it simple and personal and utterly compelling.\u201dMr. McBurney is a compelling storyteller offstage, too. In an interview over lunch at an Italian restaurant near the rehearsal rooms, he managed to eat, gesture and talk, almost without stopping, about \u201cThe Encounter,\u201d which had its premiere at the Edinburgh International Festival in 2015, had a sold-out season at the Barbican in London and has toured Europe. He is 59 and compactly built, with large, mobile features, an intense stare and thinning hair that stands up in jagged peaks on his head when he runs his hands through it.\u201cThere is a short answer and a long answer,\u201d he began, when asked about the genesis of \u201cThe Encounter.\u201dHe proceeded to give both, recounting how he was given Mr. Popescu\u2019s book by a friend in 1994, how the tale \u201cremained on the list of things that keep haunting me\u201d and how he finally began to develop it as a theater piece five years ago.The long answer, he said, was more complicated. \u201cThe question of when something really begins is impossible to answer,\u201d he began, plunging into a discussion of childhood influences (his American-born father was an anthropologist); early adult experiences (\u201cThe question of identity was very important to me \u2014 am I American? Why did I feel at home in Scotland?\u201d); and his fascination over the years with the processes of memory.\u201cOne of the things that most excited me was discovering that every time you remember something, you are making it anew,\u201d he said. \u201cSynaptic connections, at unbelievable speed, form a pattern or electrical charge in the brain that brings memory or images to life. Your mind has to make the pattern each time; it doesn\u2019t exist somewhere intact. That means memory and imagination have the same syntax and biochemistry, which is very exciting for an artist.\u201dDuring the making of many of his theater pieces, Mr. McBurney talked to neuroscientists, philosophers and psychologists. He realized, he said, \u201cthe extraordinary fictional nature\u201d of the world.\u201cIdeas that surround us, like identity, nationhood, countries, language. These things don\u2019t exist or have meaning outside imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cA sense of being lost and a huge doubt about my own culture resurfaced in me, and I thought about \u2018Amazon Beaming,\u2019 and how it\u2019s about a man who is lost and gradually loses everything, who cuts the connections that are the scaffolding for meaning or what he takes to be immutable truths. He encounters another narrative; that\u2019s what it\u2019s really about. I have no Rousseau-esque illusions that these people live better lives. The point is that their narrative is as important as ours.\u201dSoon, he said, he realized that McIntyre\u2019s solitude was the key to the story.\u201cObviously we can sit in the theater together and understand the man is alone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the thing about theater is that it\u2019s a social activity, we are experiencing it together. I thought, could I do the piece for one person? Or what if each person felt it was an individual experience?\u201dHe added that in telling the story of McIntyre\u2019s journey (the photographer died in 2003), he wanted his own role in the narrative to be clear.\u201cI am telling the story but also asking myself what it all means,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to create that sense of uncertainty that we all feel when we ask ourselves existential questions. Something very important in this story is questioning how we understand time. Being able to tell it with the sense of the present moment, to make people highly aware of what is in front of them, yet take them into another world as well \u2014 perhaps that places people in the experience of this man.\u201dMr. McBurney came up for air. \u201cAt another level,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to entertain you. We all like hearing stories.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Spoiler alert: Things do not go well. The main characters are all killed and eaten; the movie\u2019s conceit is that only their found footage survives. Shot on location deep in the Amazon jungle, the film strings together scenes of torture, rape, murder (including the unsimulated slaughter of various animals) and the titular cannibalism in a gorefest so depraved \u2014 and, apparently, so convincing \u2014 that its director, Ruggero Deodato, was not just suspected but criminally \u00adaccused of making an actual snuff film. His defense was not strengthened by the fact that in the wake of the film\u2019s release, its principal actors were nowhere to be found, for reasons Deodato declined to disclose. \u201cReal\u201d or not, \u201cCannibal Holocaust\u201d was so repugnantly violent as to get itself banned in countries around the world. Meanwhile, Sergio Leone pronounced it a \u201cmasterpiece of cinematographic realism,\u201d and on its release in Japan it became the \u00adsecond-highest-grossing film of the year, right behind \u201cE.T.\u201dKea Wilson has taken this thoroughly bizarre true story as the template for her canny, funny, impressively detailed debut novel, \u201cWe Eat Our Own.\u201d Here, the \u00adgruffly uncommunicative, faintly deranged director is named Ugo Velluto, and the masterpiece he is bent on shooting is called \u201cJungle Bloodbath.\u201d For international distribution purposes, Ugo and his producers need to hire at least one American actor, and so the novel opens on a comic high note with the casting of the lead role of \u201cRichard Trent,\u201d a part given to a poor sap of a failed New York actor whose name we don\u2019t even learn until the book is almost over. Fresh off a summer-stock tour with a troupe \u00addevoted to the theater of cruelty (nice ironic touch, that), he is so deliriously gratified to be cast as the lead in anything that he agrees to go straight from his rudimentary screen test to the airport. Ugo, unsurprisingly, has a more gimlet eye: \u201cI want young,\u201d he instructs his casting director. \u201cI want unknown. Check the acting schools. Avoid anyone unionized. And don\u2019t show him the script. .\u2008.\u2008. We need someone who is desperate.\u201d Almost as an afterthought, he adds: \u201cAnd make sure he wears a size 10\u00bd. .\u2008.\u2008. We\u2019re over budget as is, and I\u2019ll be damned if I pay for another pair of boots.\u201dIt\u2019s too bad, in a way, that the novel requires Ugo himself to be remote or absent for long stretches, for he\u2019s certainly Wilson\u2019s wildest, most idiosyncratic character. But the mystery of Ugo\u2019s vision is essential to the plot, in that upon the question of his basic sanity rest the chances of these various D-list hacks getting out of their jungle location alive.The logistics of shooting in Colombia bring the film crew into contact with a very real underworld of violent Marxist revolutionaries and quietly sinister representatives of drug cartels. \u201cThere is no such thing as customs on the Amazon,\u201d one young guerrilla tells another, \u201cno such thing as government, no danger.\u201d They could, he says, \u201ctrain on grenade launchers and Uzis, never worry about being heard.\u201d Wilson does all she can with these figures, and ultimately uses them to produce a gratifyingly artful climax; nevertheless, the revolutionaries in particular come off as somewhat stock \u2014 young, bumbling, sexually liberated yet done in by petty jealousies. Like the actors, they are playing roles, complete with fake names that must supersede their real ones; like the crew, they are urban creatures by nature, overmatched by the hostile new environment into which their hubris has driven them: \u201cWhen she closes her eyes,\u201d Wilson writes of one, \u201cshe can see nothing but the place they\u2019re in, nothing but rot and rain and dead things left to soak, razor grasses and legions of invisible insects vibrating the air. .\u2008.\u2008. Their enemy, now, has no brain and a billion arms and can send spores rooting in wetlands of their bodies. They are all too weak.\u201dFor decades, some film critics have sustained the ludicrous idea that \u201cCannibal Holocaust\u201d \u2014 an Italian production in the wake of the Red Brigades and the assassination of Prime Minister Aldo Moro \u2014 is actually a work of sophisticated social commentary, somehow about sensationalism instead of being merely sensational in itself. Deodato\u2019s reply to one such interviewer \u2014 to his credit, as far as I am concerned \u2014 was that he just wanted to make a movie about cannibals. Similarly, while the publishers of \u201cWe Eat Our Own\u201d appear to want to position it as (according to its jacket copy) \u201ca thoughtful commentary on violence and its repercussions,\u201d it is, thank God, no such thing: Wilson is concerned only with detail, with specificity and precision in the moment, and it\u2019s that concern that marks her as a novelist of real substance and promise. Waiting nervously to be called to the set \u2014 still without a script, his requests for directorial guidance met only with hostility \u2014 the actor playing Richard ventures out one evening to what passes for a nightclub, really just a former storefront with its windows painted black: \u201cYou drink. They\u2019re playing a song in English that you don\u2019t recognize, projecting a black-and-white porno from the 1930s onto each of the three walls. .\u2008.\u2008. The guitars pluck, the rhythm too slow for dancing. Teenage girls dance anyway, in clusters, in front of men slouching in red chairs. The light from the projector turns their bodies white, then black, then marbled. .\u2008.\u2008. They have skinny chains looped around their abdomens, little shiny scars on their bellies, tiny girlish teeth. The dark crowds over them like a thunderhead and flees as they nudge each other into the beam of the projector.\u201d That \u00adindoor-thunderhead image is a particular \u00adbeauty. Wilson appears to have done a ton of research for this novel, but no amount of research can teach a writer to do that.\u201cJungle Bloodbath\u201d is eventually completed and controversially released; flash-forward transcripts from Ugo\u2019s criminal \u00adtrial serve as occasional \u00adentr\u2019actes between chapters, and in them the unrepentant Ugo is at his volatile best, infantile and \u00adsuperior at the same time. His petulant refusal to answer questions directly, however self-serving, exposes the trial itself \u2014 its determination, in a world drenched in violent imagery, to distinguish the real from the unreal \u2014 as absurd. And when the fed-up prosecutor asks him directly how he can possibly justify the horrors he has put on the screen, at such terrible cost to his cast and crew, Ugo answers simply: \u201cDid it scare you?\u201d With that question, rhetorical and multitiered, he effectively rests his case.Jonathan Dee\u2019s novels include \u201cThe \u00adPrivileges\u201d and \u201cA Thousand Pardons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Affleck character, we gradually learn, used to be married to a woman played by Michelle Williams, with whom he shares a heartbreaking burden. A scene they have together near the end is almost shattering. \u201cIt was a hard, hard movie to make,\u201d Mr. Affleck recalled recently. \u201cThough the character seems sort of shut down and muted, it never felt that way. It felt like living in a terrible, painful place.\u201d But he added that as soon as he read the script, he knew he wanted the part. \u201cI\u2019m usually pretty tortured about choosing projects,\u201d he said, \u201cand usually when I read a script I like to think about it for a while. But when I read this, there was no question.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a North Shore guy,\u201d Mr. Lonergan said, referring to the Manchester region. \u201cThat was part of the appeal and also part of the challenge.\u201d He spent a lot of time in the area, studying and listening to the local people and educating himself as he went along. He has always been a sort of self-taught filmmaker, he added, and got into the business more or less accidentally. \u201cI started out wanting to be a playwright, and I still want to be a playwright,\u201d he said and then stopped himself. \u201cI want to continue being a playwright, I guess is what I mean.\u201d\u201cIf they see you\u2019ve written a comedy script, they figure you as a comedy writer,\u201d he went on. \u201cThey\u2019re very nervous; they have to protect their jobs, so they can\u2019t lose by saying no.\u201dIt was only while working on \u201cYou Can Count on Me\u201d that Mr. Lonergan, who is now known for the almost painterly quality of his films, began to worry about what his movie was supposed to look like. \u201cEven the word style made me feel really anxious,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s your style?\u2019 I don\u2019t know.\u201d On the advice of some cinematographer friends, he began watching a lot of movies and cribbing from ones he loved: \u201cFive Easy Pieces,\u201d \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter,\u201d \u201cThe Best Years of Our Lives.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where I started, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I think much more visually from the beginning.\u201dOne habit Mr. Lonergan has carried over from the theater is rehearsal, and for \u201cManchester\u201d the actors sat around a table and went over their parts for almost two weeks, which is highly unusual \u2014 actors tend to be very tightly scheduled. \u201cYou sometimes feel a little silly,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you\u2019re talking about and rehearsing scenes you\u2019re not going to shoot for another month, and so you don\u2019t know how specific and general to be. But it\u2019s still extremely valuable. I can\u2019t imagine doing a movie like this without it.\u201d He added: \u201cSidney Lumet used to rehearse all his movies for five weeks, just like for a play. Not that I\u2019m comparing myself to Sidney Lumet by any means.\u201dMr. Affleck said, \u201cI haven\u2019t always been someone who likes doing much rehearsal, but I\u2019m really glad we did it on this.\u201d Among other things, the extra time allowed him and Mr. Lonergan to work out their different ideas about his character, including his broad New England accent, which Mr. Affleck, though a Boston native, initially resisted.Ms. Williams said that out of respect for Mr. Lonergan she overprepared. \u201cIn theater, words are primary,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing as important as what the character says next. Often in movies that\u2019s not really the case, except in a Lonergan film, because he wrote those words. He\u2019s actually quite specific in sticking to the script, as he should be.\u201dShe worked hard on her accent, which she found difficult at first, and to get a better sense of what North Shore women were like, she even took to hanging around schools in the morning, watching moms drop off their kids. But she still hadn\u2019t seen the finished movie, she confessed. \u201cI sort of don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I feel I have too high expectations.\u201dMr. Affleck said: \u201cAs a community of filmmakers, we have a long way to go in making up to Kenny and giving him his due. He\u2019s been given an enormous amount of grief. This movie wasn\u2019t easy, but they don\u2019t make movies like this anymore. If it was all just run-of-the-mill multiplex stuff, it would be a joyless and draining industry. But when you have someone like Kenny, who can write stuff like this, it just reinvigorates everyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I make the decisions on my own, whether they\u2019re right or wrong.\u201dLike Ms. Adlon, Sam Fox has three daughters \u2014 one almost college age, one in the throes of puberty and one preadolescent \u2014 and just like the actor portraying her, the character\u2019s mother (played on the show by Celia Imrie) lives just across the street.Yet as Ms. Adlon started to write for her alter ego, she said she could not escape the \u201cold-school TV mentality that lives in your brain,\u201d telling her that more exotic trappings were needed. \u201cDo I have a gay brother?\u201d she asked. \u201cDoes he live in the guesthouse in the back? Do we talk about what happened to the kids\u2019 dad? Does somebody rob a bank?\u201dThe advice Louis C.K. gave her, she said, was: \u201cJust don\u2019t think about story. Just put that out of your head. You just keep writing.\u201dWith that in mind, Ms. Adlon said, \u201cI just kept writing scenes, and then characters would come to life.\u201dAs comedic collaborators, Ms. Adlon and Louis C.K. share a sense of humor: world-weary and mistrustful of the arbitrary use of authority (especially as wielded by the entertainment industry), but loving at its core. But when it came time to pitch the show, he said, \u201cI told Pamela that she couldn\u2019t exercise her actor\u2019s pessimism.\u201d\u201cPessimism is the self-preservationist\u2019s tactic,\u201d he explained. \u201cOptimism doesn\u2019t do you any good as an actor. It\u2019s a coping mechanism to say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to get this,\u2019 and move on with your life.\u201dBut to create and produce a show, he said: \u201cYou have to be prepared for success. You can\u2019t be flat-footed when they say, \u2018Get to work.\u2019\u201dFX picked up \u201cBetter Things\u201d because, as John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX Networks, said, it saw the potential for \u201ca highly cinematic, highly specific, original and personal show.\u201dMr. Landgraf said he told Ms. Adlon at the time, \u201cIf you have to take creative risks or do things that are scary or different to achieve that, do it.\u201dGetting comfortable enough to take those chances, Ms. Adlon acknowledged, was \u201ca muscle that I built up over this past year, of prep and production and writing up until the last minute.\u201d For her to take the plunge and direct some of the later episodes \u2014 something Ms. Adlon had never done before \u2014 required some encouragement from Louis C.K.\u201cWhat I advocated for was to give Pamela more control over the show,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we did.\u201dEven the promotional campaign for the show, which depicts an exasperated Ms. Adlon lying face down on a bed with her boots touching the wall, was a departure from what FX felt it had seen in the marketing for previous female-led shows.\u201cIf it\u2019s a woman, she automatically has to be defined in relation to the many hats she has to wear,\u201d Mr. Landgraf said of those other examples. \u201cShe\u2019s raising children, she\u2019s cooking dinner, she\u2019s trying to figure out how to be beautiful.\u201dMs. Adlon said that hiding her face in these billboards and posters had spared her family some grief. \u201cMy kids will still be able to ride the bus and not be like, \u2018Ew, mom,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s my ass.\u201dM. Blair Breard, an executive producer of \u201cBetter Things,\u201d who has also worked on \u201cLouie,\u201d \u201cBaskets\u201d and \u201cHorace and Pete,\u201d said that Ms. Adlon\u2019s show was \u201cfemale driven\u201d but did not a have \u201cfeminist agenda.\u201d\u201cI call myself, proudly, a feminist,\u201d Ms. Breard said. \u201cBut it is just about a person in her life. She happens to be female. She has kids. They happen to be female. She has a parent who lives across the street. She happens to be her mother.\u201dMs. Breard added, \u201cIt really is just these people and their lives and the stories that are happening.\u201dMs. Adlon said she was proud to be part of a \u201cnatural progression\u201d in television that has led to a wider range of comedy shows with female leads, including Lena Dunham\u2019s \u201cGirls,\u201d Maria Bamford\u2019s \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d and Ms. Notaro\u2019s \u201cOne Mississippi.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t yet clear to Ms. Adlon how the lessons and values of \u201cBetter Things\u201d might be received by her real-life daughters \u2014 she has already allowed her oldest daughter to see some parts of it \u2014 but she concedes that it is only a matter of time before all three of her children find a way to watch it.Though Ms. Adlon tries to enforce a no-TV policy in her household, she said: \u201cIn my head, I\u2019m still living in 1974, like, \u2018Ha! At least my kids don\u2019t have televisions in their rooms!\u2019 They all have TV in their rooms because they all use laptops and phones.\u201dShe let out one more self-deprecating laugh and said, \u201cI\u2019m so old.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Presto! Pulp and Poetry: \u2018Chandu the Magician\u2019 and \u2018Stranger on the Third Floor\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn DVDLong ago, in a distant galaxy, Hollywood\u2019s superhero movies were as modest as the comic books or radio shows that spawned them, using special effects that now feel homespun to conjure fantasies with the artless quality of folk tales.Chandu is an indefatigable escape artist with the power to cloud men\u2019s minds. He can induce hallucinations so that some subjects imagine they are scolded by tiny replicas of themselves and others believe that their guns have turned into snakes. With such an occult hero, \u201cChandu the Magician\u201d anticipates \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d the coming movie based on the Marvel character. But as a stout defender of Western values, and with his easy mastery of third-world civilizations, Chandu is a forerunner of Indiana Jones.Directed with breathless panache by Marcel Varnel and William Cameron Menzies, the movie is a 71-minute fun house of mad scientists, comic camels, proto-TV transmissions, \u201cdeath ray\u201d machines, secret passages and slave markets. A glamorous princess (Irene Ware) is on hand as rescue bait, but the most glorious attraction is Mr. Lugosi, resplendent in black tights and a matching turban. The actor\u2019s lunatic conviction is an ode to megalomania as he gloats, chortles and rants, expressing his desire to \u201cbe greater than any pharaoh!\u201d\u201cChandu\u201d is founded on pure irrationality and the primacy of the visual. Atmosphere transcends logic; Mr. Lugosi\u2019s pronouncements notwithstanding, music is more important than dialogue. While Mr. Varnel, a French-born former actor, specialized in comedies, Mr. Menzies (1896-1957) was arguably Hollywood\u2019s premier art director. It almost seems as if the sets he designed for the lavish silent version of \u201cThe Thief of Bagdad\u201d with Douglas Fairbanks are being recycled here; he also managed to contrive dolly shots through the movie\u2019s miniatures to remarkably fluid effect. (\u201cChandu\u201d was shot by James Wong Howe, another virtuoso.)\u201cChandu the Magician\u201d is also an example of what the British critic Raymond Durgnat once called \u201cthe wedding of poetry and pulp.\u201d A darker instance would be the 1940 B-movie \u201cStranger on the Third Floor\u201d (available on DVD from Warner Archive).Like \u201cChandu,\u201d \u201cStranger on the Third Floor\u201d is a fantastic tale given authority by its sets, special effects and production design. And it is also animated by the presence of a Hungarian-born actor blessed, or cursed, with an unforgettable voice \u2014 in this case Peter Lorre, playing a version of the deranged serial killer that made him an international star in Fritz Lang\u2019s \u201cM\u201d (1931).\u201cStranger\u201d was the first feature directed by Boris Ingster, a former associate of Sergei Eisenstein (and later a producer on the 1960s spy series \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d), from a screenplay by the Hungarian writer Frank Partos that is thought to have been reworked by the novelist Nathanael West, who was killed in a car crash several months after the movie opened.\u201cStranger\u201d is as experimental as any movie made in Hollywood between F. W. Murnau\u2019s silent \u201cSunrise\u201d (1927) and \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d which, released a year later than \u201cStranger,\u201d was also produced by RKO. (Van Nest Polglase designed the sets for both films.) The studio evidently recognized this, promoting \u201cStranger\u201d for its \u201ceccentric camera work\u201d and \u201clight-and-shadow effects.\u201dThe ploy backfired. Variety thought \u201cStranger\u201d to be \u201ctoo arty for average audiences.\u201d Other critics found the movie pretentious and confused. A box-office failure, \u201cStranger\u201d was rediscovered on TV by young American cinephiles, who saw it as a precursor to \u201cKane\u201d and the original film noir. (Had it been released a year or two earlier and combined its look with a \u201cChandu\u201d premise, \u201cStranger\u201d could have been a template for the Batman comic book.)Given the left-wing politics and/or refugee status of many involved in its creation, \u201cStranger\u201d has also been interpreted as an anti-Nazi parable and criticism of American xenophobia \u2014 the same year that it was released, a clip of Mr. Lorre\u2019s performance in \u201cM\u201d was incorporated in the most loathsome of Germany\u2019s anti-Semitic propaganda films, \u201cThe Eternal Jew.\u201dNEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Two Producers of \u2018Transparent\u2019 Made Their Own Trans Lives More Visible", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "FeatureThe photos Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst took of each other showed a young couple in love. They became an important public record of transgender life.Supported byDrucker and Ernst, who are perhaps better known as producers of the Emmy-\u00adwinning Amazon series \u201cTransparent,\u201d speak regularly about their work. But Drucker is plainly more at ease in the spotlight. She is tall and blond, with eyes as blue as swimming pools. That night she wore a white shift and high-\u00adheeled sling-backs, and she kept the microphone in its stand so she could gesture with her hands. The images, she told the audience, were meant as a private visual diary. \u201cThere was never an intent to show the photographs, even though we are both art-\u00admakers.\u201dThey are both 33 and around the same height, but Ernst appears slighter. Wearing light brown pants, bright white Reeboks and a diamond stud in his right ear, he explained that he and Drucker have backgrounds in \u201cauto-\u00adethnography,\u201d which he defined as \u201cthe practice of creating self-\u00adreflexive work, or work that reflected my community.\u201d This, he said, was a guiding impulse for the photographs in \u201cRelationship.\u201dAnyone familiar with the rush of young love will recognize its hallmarks in these photos: all smoldering looks, parted lips and bare limbs on rumpled sheets. Drucker and Ernst have an easy sexual charisma, but that\u2019s not what makes this series novel, even daring. During the years they were together, from 2008 to 2014, Drucker was in the process of transitioning from male to female, and Ernst from female to male. They met soon after they each began taking hormones, so the photographs also capture what Ernst has described as \u201cthe unflattering throes of yet another puberty.\u201d In calling this series \u201cRelationship,\u201d Drucker and Ernst are describing not only their partnership but also their relationship with themselves and their genders, their choices and their bodies.Though Drucker and Ernst are no longer a couple, they chose to publish these photographs anyway, because even as transgender stories are becoming more mainstream, there are few public examples of trans people leading ordinary lives, filled with love and lazy mornings. There are even fewer cases, as Drucker and Ernst emphasized that night in July, of trans people taking control over how they are represented.On \u201cTransparent,\u201d whose third season begins this month, their goal has been to ensure not just that trans people are depicted accurately on screen, but also that they are working behind the scenes \u2014 as writers, directors and personal assistants. Except for the character of Maura, a father who comes out to his family as trans, played by Jeffrey Tambor, every trans role on the show is filled by a trans person. The desire to see more transgender people in front of and behind the camera also informs much of Drucker\u2019s and Ernst\u2019s work as artists. Drucker is often the star of her own experimental videos and performances, which challenge conventional views of sex and gender. Her work has been shown at MoMA\u2019s PS1, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and SFMoMA. Ernst\u2019s narrative filmmaking tends to feature trans actors and documentary subjects and travel the film-\u00adfestival circuit. He is at work on his first full-length feature, which he describes as a \u201cmiddle-\u00adaged trans-guy buddy-\u00admovie comedy.\u201d\u201cI remember when we were installing the photographs at the Whitney, someone asked us: \u2018Oh, this is great. Who was the photographer?\u2019\u2009\u201d Ernst told the bookstore crowd. \u201cThey assumed we were just the subjects, which is of course the history of this kind of work. But this is what I hope changes going forward. It\u2019s the work we\u2019re doing in television. It\u2019s the work we\u2019re doing in filmmaking. It\u2019s the work we\u2019re doing in photography. It\u2019s making trans people the author, rather than just the subject. That\u2019s really the key.\u201dIn the two years since, there has been a marked political and cultural shift, and a growing public fascination with trans people. For Drucker and Ernst, whose work has always been about making the trans experience more visible, this has meant a much bigger audience. \u201cThere needs to be a little demystifying about trans existence,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cThat\u2019s why people have so many burning questions about it all.\u201dSoon after their photographs were installed at the Whitney, they began working on the first season of \u201cTransparent\u201d with Jill Soloway, the show\u2019s creator. Soloway met Ernst when they each had a short film screening at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012. Soloway\u2019s father had just come out as trans, and she found herself opening up to Ernst about what she was going through. They kept in touch. After Soloway finished writing the \u201cTransparent\u201d pilot, she reached out to Ernst and Drucker, knowing that she needed trans people involved from the start. \u201cEveryone knows and loves them,\u201d she told me in her office on the Paramount lot. \u201cThey\u2019re the homecoming king and queen of the trans movement.\u201dDrucker and Ernst say the show has been able to \u201cundo a lot of damage\u201d when it comes to popular portrayals of trans people. Maura is not a sad loner whose every act and thought is about transitioning. Rather, she is the parent of a flawed but loving family in which everyone seems uncomfortable in their skin. Initially hired as consultants to prevent the show from trafficking in trans stereotypes, Drucker and Ernst were swiftly promoted to producers. They now offer notes on scripts, watch rough cuts of episodes and work closely with the writers and actors to make the trans performances as authentic as possible. Drucker helps Tambor understand how Maura feels about herself and her body, and she tweaks his mannerisms onscreen, regularly nudging him to close his legs, for example. Ernst directs the opening credits. Both also lead what they call \u201cTrans 101\u201d for everyone involved with the show, from Amazon executives to truck drivers, in which they explain the etiquette of working with trans colleagues. They stress that it is best to ask what pronoun people prefer. They advise against inquiring about the genitals or birth names of trans people, or referring to them as \u201ctrannies\u201d or \u201cshe-males.\u201d \u201cPeople are afraid of saying the wrong thing, so they don\u2019t have the conversation,\u201d Drucker says. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s no undignified questions, only undignified answers.\u201dFor many of the show\u2019s trans performers and crew members, all of this has been life-\u00adchanging. \u201c\u2009\u2018Transparent\u2019 was my coming-\u00adout party,\u201d Trace Lysette said at the show\u2019s panel at Outfest, the L.G.B.T. film festival in Los Angeles, in July. Like many trans women, Lysette struggled for years to find employment, making money by stripping and sex work before she landed a recurring role as Shea, a friend of Maura\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s allowed me to get up off the pole and have a career that I never thought would really happen,\u201d she said. Silas Howard, the show\u2019s first trans director, says the call from Soloway was like getting \u201ca golden ticket.\u201d Tambor has begun teaching acting classes for trans people in Los Angeles.Drian Juarez, the program manager of the Transgender Economic Empowerment Project, a Los Angeles nonprofit group, told me that the show\u2019s success has inspired other companies, including NBC and Ryan Seacrest Productions, to ask her for leads on transgender talent for trans-\u00adrelated stories. Given that trans people are twice as likely to be unemployed as the general population (four times as likely if they are not white), these industry jobs are a big deal. Drucker and Ernst also persuaded Amazon to sponsor the Trans Pride festival in Los Angeles.\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen any production like the familial, politicized, life-\u00adchanging, worldview-\u00adchanging empathy machine that is \u2018Transparent,\u2019\u2009\u201d Ernst told me. The show, he conceded, doesn\u2019t exactly represent a new norm in the industry, but he and Drucker hope that the many trans people involved in its production are gaining the tools necessary to make their own shows. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the beginning of something new,\u201d Drucker says.For the moment, working on \u201cTransparent\u201d has turned Drucker and Ernst into trans spokespeople in Hollywood. Drucker was among the trans women hired to help Caitlyn Jenner navigate her new trans life on the two-\u00adseason E! Network series \u201cI Am Cait.\u201d Focus Features asked Ernst to be a consultant on \u201cThe Danish Girl,\u201d a 2015 biopic about Lili Elbe, one of the first people to undergo gender-\u00adreassignment surgery. Ernst was wary, as the film was already underway with a cis-\u00adgender writer, director and star. Yet he found the studio receptive to his many recommendations, including his request that Focus \u201cgive back to the trans community in tangible ways.\u201d The studio created a $10,000 scholarship for trans filmmakers and helped fund a web series of documentary shorts about trans pioneers called \u201cWe\u2019ve Been Around,\u201d directed by Ernst, which had its premiere online in March. \u201cBeing trans right now necessitates this multihyphenate way of being,\u201d Drucker says.Finding models for how to live, or even a language to describe their feelings, was difficult for Drucker and Ernst. After Drucker discovered that she desired boys and Ernst that he liked girls (at least initially), they didn\u2019t feel right calling themselves gay or lesbian because it didn\u2019t feel as if they were attracted to the same sex. They were both relieved as teenagers to discover the term \u201cqueer,\u201d which is elastic enough to elide standard definitions of sexual orientation and gender.Each was raised in a supportive home by compassionate parents \u2014 a rare privilege, they acknowledge. But public bathrooms were always sites of dread, and school was hard. Drucker\u2019s taste for blue hair, dog collars and makeup made her a target in Syracuse, her hometown. \u201cShe hid a lot from us,\u201d her mother, Penny Sori, told me. \u201cIt was only when I started working at the high school that I saw she took a lot of crap.\u201d When Drucker insisted on wearing a gown to the prom, her parents worried that she was putting herself at risk. But when Sori approached her, \u201cZackary looked at me in this funny way and said, \u2018I need your support on this.\u2019 So I said, \u2018O.K., let me find my long black gloves and at least accessorize you effectively.\u2019\u2009\u201dErnst was similarly ostracized and bullied in Chapel Hill, where his father, Carl Ernst, is an Islamic-\u00adstudies professor at the University of North Carolina. As the only queer kid at his public middle school and later at the local Quaker school, he says, he was treated poorly by both students and teachers. With his parents\u2019 blessing, he dropped out in ninth grade. He studied art and music at home, set up a darkroom in his closet and took classes at local community colleges.Art allowed them to vent their anger and defy convention. At her home, Drucker showed me a box of old photographs. Amid the pictures of her bar mitzvah (\u201ca rare moment of gender conformity\u201d), punk adolescence and androgynous college years was a series of snapshots from when she was 3 or 4, dressed in her mother\u2019s clothes and beaming. \u201cThose photographs provided an opportunity for me to see myself outside of the constraints of my reality,\u201d she said. \u201cArt-\u00admaking has always provided this place to invent and reinvent myself.\u201dDrucker went on to study photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York. Soon after arriving in the city in 2001, she met Flawless Sabrina, a revered drag performer otherwise known as Jack Doroshow, and the first of many \u201ctrans-\u00adfeminine elders\u201d Drucker collected in search of \u201cproof that it\u2019s possible to have a sustainable life and live outside the rules.\u201d At Hampshire College, Ernst fell in love with mixed-\u00admedia filmmaking, which allowed him to combine his many interests. For \u201cThe Drive North,\u201d a Super-\u00ad8 short that Ernst made and starred in as a 20-year-old undergraduate, he used his own animation and original score and experimented with slide projections and energetic editing to tell a story about two teenagers driving to college. It earned him several prizes at festivals around the world. After graduation he moved to New York, where he began working as a personal assistant on film and television projects and eventually became a producer and editor on MTV.Transitioning is a complicated and often stressful process. It took a while before it felt like a necessary step for either of them. Drucker always knew she flouted traditional gender categories, but she was able to maintain a level of androgyny until her early 20s. It was only when her body started aging in a masculine way that she realized \u201cthat wasn\u2019t the path I wanted to go down.\u201d After she moved to Los Angeles to attend the California Institute of the Arts in 2005, she began taking estrogen.Although Ernst knew he wasn\u2019t female, transitioning made him nervous, particularly because he knew few people who had done it. \u201cIt was still this kind of distant, weird relative of \u2018gay and lesbian,\u2019 and people didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d he says. Without public examples of happy, successful, aging trans people, he remembered wondering: Do people grow old? Do the hormones kill you? As a feminist, he asked himself: Do I even want to be a man?He was also troubled by the fact that it is impossible to transition quietly. It feels extremely public, he explains, because essentially everyone else has to transition, too. \u201cAt what point would my mom change pronouns to her hairdresser when they chat about me? It really ripples. It feels like jumping off a cliff.\u201dErnst began taking hormones six months before driving cross-\u00adcountry with a trans-male friend to study filmmaking at CalArts. They were just starting to pass as men, which meant they were \u201cdealing with the panopticon of rest-\u00adstop men\u2019s rooms for the first time.\u201d The experience was nerve-\u00adracking, but he learned that men don\u2019t really look at one another in men\u2019s rooms. He also found that people were much kinder to him than when he was a gender-\u00adnonconforming woman. \u201cI got the, you know, \u2019Sup, chief? \u2019Sup, champ? It was really striking.\u201dDrucker met Ernst at a party soon after he arrived in Los Angeles. \u201cIt was such a revelation when we got together,\u201d Drucker told me. Within a year they were subletting the rundown house of Ron Athey, a performance artist and mentor (they call him \u201cPops\u201d). They collaborated on several projects, including \u201cShe Gone Rogue,\u201d a dreamy experimental short featuring several \u201ctrans-\u00adfeminine\u201d legends from Drucker\u2019s \u201cchosen family\u201d (Flawless Sabrina, Holly Woodlawn, Vaginal Davis), which debuted at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles in 2012. They also took thousands of pictures of themselves and each other.The photographs that make up \u201cRelationship\u201d were never meant for a mass audience; Drucker and Ernst didn\u2019t even share them with friends. They feel like small, private gifts for each other. One shows them topless and tenderly touching each other in bed, their faces flushed with the thrill of discovery. Another finds them nuzzling in the dark corner of what looks like a party, their eyes closed. Often Drucker or Ernst seem to be posing for the other, preening before a mirror or gazing directly at the camera.These photos capture them as they figure out how to present their evolving selves. Ernst is often seen gazing in the distance, steely and remote, his face sprouting new facial hair. Drucker drapes herself across the bed, feline, come-\u00adhither and increasingly curvy. Their disdain for the \u201cprurience\u201d of public curiosity about trans bodies mean there are no full nudes in the book. Both lament that trans people are regularly asked about their genitals. \u201cCis people are not asked about their genitals, so it\u2019s a bit of a double standard,\u201d Drucker says. But the photos include some comic nods. One shows Ernst with two brown eggs between his legs; another has him eating a long link of sausage impaled on a fork. Drucker is seen holding a peeled grapefruit in her lap.As a series, these photos trace a period in Drucker\u2019s and Ernst\u2019s lives when they were both undergoing profound personal changes. Yet they found something still and stable in each other. \u201cThat body of work really speaks to how much love and support can still be at the core of something that might seem unstable or uncertain or unfamiliar,\u201d says Stuart Comer, a co-\u00adcurator of the 2014 Whitney Biennial. Comer is largely responsible for making these images public. Impressed by their film \u201cShe Gone Rogue\u201d and excited by the energy and identity politics of many trans artists, he visited Drucker and Ernst in their Los Angeles studio in 2013. Over margaritas, they shared some of their personal snapshots. Comer was so moved by them that he asked to include a selection in the Biennial.\u201cThe formula is so simple, but the cumulative effect of the series is extremely powerful,\u201d says Comer, who is now the chief curator of media and performance art at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Unlike Drucker and Ernst\u2019s other collaborations, which tend to be more layered and complex, \u201cRelationship\u201d speaks to audiences because it is so direct. It is about love between two humans who happen to be trans.\u201cIt\u2019s an earth-\u00adshattering book,\u201d says Kate Bornstein, a trans activist and queer theorist. \u201cYou can\u2019t read this book and not understand that trans is an identity that is desirable and filled with desire. There are going to be people writing to Zackary and Rhys saying, \u2018Oh, my God, thank you!\u2019 Because right now, being attracted to a trans person is seen as a perversion.\u201dDrucker and Ernst understand why people are curious about them. \u201cTrans people are basically asking everyone to re-\u00adevaluate their notions of gender,\u201d Drucker says. This involves more than changing a few names and pronouns. It means upending our rules about who gets to be a man or a woman, and how we expect everyone to behave. The effects can be disorienting. As someone who has occasionally chafed against the ways women are expected to perform femininity, I found myself marveling at Drucker\u2019s girlishness, including her perfectly painted fingernails (against my own hang-\u00adnailed nubs). What, I asked her, inspires these choices? Were they not burdensome? Drucker patiently explained that she does what makes her feel confident, and she likes the look of manicured nails. It was an answer that could have come from my mother.Recognizing the difference between how gender is felt and how it is enforced can also be liberating. \u201cModern masculinity is so confining,\u201d Jerid Bartow, Drucker\u2019s cis-male boyfriend, told me one evening. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to swallow our emotions, to not seem like a sissy. But those expectations don\u2019t exist in our relationship, which is such a relief.\u201d Bartow recalled a night I was with him and Drucker while they were getting ready for a party, when he declared, \u201cI\u2019m having a clothing crisis!\u201d next to a bed of discarded outfits. \u201cThat\u2019s something men are trained not to say.\u201dErnst points out that maleness does indeed come with privileges, like being able to ask for things unapologetically and say things authoritatively without being judged. But, he says, \u201ceffeminate men, gay men, smaller men, people who are perceived as younger men,\u201d don\u2019t enjoy quite the same benefits. As a 5-foot-9, sparsely bearded trans man who now identifies as gay, he says he has found it harder to secure a strong place in this \u201cincredible pecking order.\u201d He adds that men who believe they are in male-\u00adonly spaces will say \u201crepulsive things about women.\u201d He suspects that this misogynistic posturing is largely about earning the respect of other men. \u201cIt\u2019s this male obsession with each other that results in a kind of weird, sort of insecure butt-\u00adsniffing.\u201dBoth Drucker and Ernst have made a commitment \u2014 separately and together \u2014 to live their lives as openly and proudly as possible. \u201cAs an artist, I\u2019ve always believed in having a fully integrated self and not omitting parts of who you are or what your history is,\u201d Drucker says. \u201cAnd being a woman named Zackary makes me very visible.\u201d Being out is not always easy. Like most trans men, Ernst passes as a cis male, so telling people he\u2019s trans means \u201crocking that boat every day.\u201d He recalls his discomfort during the Q.&A. sessions after screenings of his CalArts thesis short, \u201cThe Thing,\u201d at Sundance in 2012. The film is about a heterosexual couple on a fraught road trip. The man is trans. Audience members naturally asked him why he made that choice. \u201cI realized I had to come out as trans every time on the stage,\u201d Ernst remembers. \u201cYou have to muster all this bravery and courage to transition and tell the whole world, and then you think, \u2018O.K., good, that\u2019s over.\u2019 But then you realize you have to continue that every day \u2014 forever.\u201dEmily Bobrow is a writer based in New York.

But no team anywhere is attracting more attention than the Warriors. It can be reasonably argued that Golden State has the most talent-laden roster in N.B.A. history.That disappointed people in Oklahoma City, where Durant starred for nine years but could not lift the Thunder to a championship. It thrilled fans in the Bay Area, where a championship parade is expected next June.Basketball rules did not change. There will still be just one ball.\u201cEverybody\u2019s numbers may not be where they were last year,\u201d Coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cWho cares? It\u2019s about winning.\u201dMore than 200 credentialed journalists came for \u201cmedia day\u201d on Monday, and dozens returned on Tuesday for the team\u2019s first practice of the season. Kerr is trying to take the long view, to June, but that is difficult for a team that started last season by winning its first 24 games and now looks improved.\u201cThis is a different team,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of growing ahead. The fans should not be focused on how many wins we\u2019re getting.\u201dHe smiled as soon as he said it. \u201cGood luck with that,\u201d he added.The Warriors open the preseason on Saturday in Vancouver, against the Toronto Raptors. The regular season starts on Oct. 25 against the rival San Antonio Spurs.After one practice, Kerr declared things right on schedule. The biggest adjustment Durant may make on Day 2 is leaving earlier for practice, in case the traffic is bad.The name \u201cOregon\u201d comes from an Old French map, historians believe. \u201cNevada\u201d is Spanish for snow covered. And \u201cWashington\u201d is a pretty obvious choice.The first use of the term \u201cIsland of California\u201d was around 1510, in a popular Spanish romance novel by Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo.The conquistadors, such as Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, loved the book and used its legend to refer optimistically to unknown places on the map. In this case, it stuck.Cabrillo himself was no romantic. He helped invade Cuba and joined Cort\u00e9s to plunder Mexico. He made his fortune mining gold in Guatemala, where he was involved in the slave trade.Still, his journey up the Golden Coast was important.

{"Headline": "What if \u2018One Click\u2019 Buying Were Internetwide?", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Paying for things online can be cumbersome. Even the man who invented the web, Tim Berners-Lee, says he frequently throws up his hands.\u201cSometimes I will think that I bought something and I press the button, \u2018Buy this,\u2019 and I don\u2019t realize it didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said in a recent interview. \u201cWe are long overdue for a payments user interface for the web.\u201dResponding to the frustrations of Mr. Berners-Lee and hundreds of millions of online shoppers, the web\u2019s governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, has brought together the giants of the internet including Google, Facebook and Apple to fix the clumsiness of paying for things online.Now, a new global standard for online payments \u2014 a sort of Amazon one-click payment system for the entire internet \u2014 is being completed by the consortium and its members.Google, one of the authors of the standard, has recently introduced it in certain new versions of its Chrome browser. Other browser companies have said they intend to follow.The standard will provide a uniform way for users to input their credit cards and payment systems to any web browser so that they can be used for any purchase on the web. After the card details are entered once, they will automatically be called up as choices for all future transactions.This will be somewhat like the existing auto-fill functions that browsers have. But with the new standard, all the data fields will be filled in invisibly, requiring just one click.On the security side, rather than sending along all the credit card details, the browser will generate a one-time payment token that will avoid leaving your credit card number in countless databases around the world.Numerous efforts to modernize the payment system have failed to take off. And this one could fizzle, too, if online merchants, web browsers or consumers fail to adopt the new standard.The new standard will also face competition from the Amazons and PayPals of the world, as well as from the credit card networks, all of which want to be the primary destination for payments, rather than just one option.But payment analysts are hopeful about the new effort because it will not require consumers or merchants to use a new method of payment. Instead it will be equally open to any existing card or payment app, and it will channel them into a single place that most consumers already use \u2014 the web browser \u2014 where everything can be stored and used.\u201cInstead of simplifying the world, we have been fragmenting it into a million apps,\u201d said Eric Shea, a payments consultant at Kurt Salmon Digital. \u201cIf we can get back to that single integrated solution that everyone has on their phone and their desktop, that is the way to move forward and get adoption.\u201dDave Birch, a consultant who has been working on electronic payments for over two decades, said the web browser stood the best chance of providing a unified and more secure portal for payments.\u201cThere\u2019s a convergence going on,\u201d said Mr. Birch, who currently works for Consult Hyperion. \u201cIn the future you will have one experience \u2014 it won\u2019t matter if you are at the store or on the phone. It will pop up on your phone, you will put your thumb on it and you will be done.\u201dThe W3C project represents a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, the current giants of online payments. Both have gained business and fees with their more streamlined checkout processes.Neither company has participated in the current W3C effort and they are likely to continue to provide an alternative to customers who don\u2019t want to enter their details into their browsers.But the W3C has managed to bring in about 40 of the biggest players in online commerce, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and American Express as well as Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent.All met last week in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the specifications that they will introduce on different time frames to users around the world.In the version that Google released, when customers shopping at participating merchants hit the buy button, they are given a drop-down menu of their stored shipping addresses and credit cards.The customer can click on the address and card to be used, enter the three-digit security code on the card and hit \u201cpay now.\u201d Other browser companies may choose to use a fingerprint instead of the security code.\u201cWe wanted to remove what we jokingly call the Nascar effect of checkout, where you see five or seven logos for the different cards and payment methods you can use,\u201d said Zach Koch, the top Google executive on the project. \u201cThis is really fast, where a user can say, \u2018Tap, tap, buy.\u2019\u201dThe fees from transactions will still go to existing financial institutions like credit card companies and banks, unless customers choose a new online payment method like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. Apple Pay takes a piece of each transaction; Samsung Pay does not.But the bigger goal behind the W3C project is to create a standard, seamless and secure way to pay for things electronically in a future that will most likely include virtual reality stores, chat-based transactions and machines making payments to other machines (an autonomous car paying for a parking spot, for instance).The standard will also make it easy to include new payment methods like Bitcoin or the Chinese payment provider Tencent.\u201cThis involves quite radical changes to the way people think about payments,\u201d said Ian Jacobs, the W3C staff member leading the effort. \u201cAs a standards body it is our job to be sure it is an open playing field.\u201dThe need to create a better way to pay for things online was evident from the web\u2019s beginnings in the 1990s, Mr. Berners-Lee said. At some of the earliest meetings of the W3C, which he founded, there were discussions about creating a way to pay for things online that didn\u2019t require people to send credit card details over the internet.The failure to come up with a standard and secure way to do this led to the hodgepodge of payment screens consumers encounter today. It also made an opening for PayPal, which created a way for shoppers to pay on different sites using a single password.Mr. Birch said the main hurdle to accomplishing more seamless payments in the past was online merchants, who did not want to give up control over any part of the checkout process.But merchants have expressed increasing frustration with the high rate of abandoned online transactions and the frequency of credit card fraud.More than half of online purchases now happen on mobile phones, but Shopify has said that only 40 percent of the customers who start filling a shopping cart online finish their transactions.Shopify, which manages the online stores and checkout processes for 300,000 merchants, has been closely involved with the W3C effort and is planning to immediately offer the new standard to its merchants, as is Groupon.\u201cWe are betting a lot on it,\u201d said Jason Normore, the director of engineering at Shopify. \u201cEven though it cuts out a piece of our offering, it makes commerce better for everyone.\u201dApple will be one of the most interesting players to watch, given that it has both the Safari browser, which is part of the W3C effort, and Apple Pay, which could be seen as a competing offering.In the new operating system that Apple released last week, it is possible, for the first time, to shop online using the Safari browser and check out with Apple Pay. After hitting \u201cPay With Apple Pay,\u201d the customer is asked to provide a fingerprint on a phone, and the transaction is complete.The W3C standard will provide a similar experience on any browser \u2014 on a computer or phone \u2014 but will also allow customers to choose from any credit card or payment method they have entered into their browsers.Apple has so far been a part of the W3C group writing the standards, which will allow it to integrate non-Apple Pay choices into its browser.Mr. Berners-Lee said he hoped that more standardized payments would open up new types of online commerce that aren\u2019t possible now. He has long been interested in micropayments that would allow newspapers or small producers of content to be paid a few cents at a time, which isn\u2019t possible in a world with only credit cards.\u201cDifferent things call for different payments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are all interoperable you can separate the market for goods being sold from the payment back end.\u201dAn article on Monday about one-click shopping on the internet misstated the fee structure of one online payment method. While Apple Pay charges a fee on each transaction, Samsung Pay does not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Creates 3 Games for Twitch Fans", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, Amazon presented three new games it is developing, including a fantasy brawling game called Breakaway, that weave features from Twitch more deeply into the gaming experience. Amazon has released a handful of casual games in the past, but these are its first PC games aimed at hard-core players.Amazon is appearing more sure-footed in the entertainment business. It is financing dozens of original television shows and movies, including Emmy winners like \u201cTransparent,\u201d which are available to subscribers through its Prime membership service.The company is wagering it can differentiate itself from the sea of games available online, partly by using Twitch in novel ways. Twitch is most commonly used by players to stream their game-playing sessions live over the internet. The service is also known for its raucous chat rooms that accompany live streams, allowing spectators to comment on the action on a video stream.\u201cThe Twitch community has already changed how games are experienced,\u201d Michael Frazzini, vice president of games at Amazon, said in a phone interview. \u201cWhat we think is next is to change how games are made.\u201dIn Amazon\u2019s new games, for example, there will be a capability called Matchbuilder that allows someone broadcasting a game-playing session on Twitch to pluck people directly from a chat room and allow them to play the next round of the game. Mr. Frazzini compared it to allowing spectators to play basketball with Michael Jordan after watching him take warm-up shots.Another capability will allow broadcasters to pull statistics about player performances out of Amazon\u2019s games and display them for Twitch viewers.The game pits two teams of four players as warriors and sorceresses. The other new offerings are New World, a multiplayer online game set in a desolate, hostile land, and Crucible, a survival game on an alien planet.Here is a Twitch broadcast from Thursday showing Breakaway:On Friday, Amazon also announced a set of gaming-related benefits called Twitch Prime for Amazon Prime subscribers.Anyone with an existing subscription to Prime, which costs $99 a year for an annual membership, can get the Twitch benefits by linking their Prime and Twitch accounts.\u201cIt\u2019s the first really deep integration between Amazon and Twitch,\u201d Mr. Shear said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tech Giants Are Devising Real Ethics for Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, science-fiction moviemakers have been making us fear the bad things that artificially intelligent machines might do to their human creators. But for the next decade or two, our biggest concern is more likely to be that robots will take away our jobs or bump into us on the highway.Now five of the world\u2019s largest tech companies are trying to create a standard of ethics around the creation of artificial intelligence. While science fiction has focused on the existential threat of A.I. to humans, researchers at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and those from Amazon, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft have been meeting to discuss more tangible issues, such as the impact of A.I. on jobs, transportation and even warfare.Tech companies have long overpromised what artificially intelligent machines can do. In recent years, however, the A.I. field has made rapid advances in a range of areas, from self-driving cars and machines that understand speech, like Amazon\u2019s Echo device, to a new generation of weapons systems that threaten to automate combat.The specifics of what the industry group will do or say \u2014 even its name \u2014 have yet to be hashed out. But the basic intention is clear: to ensure that A.I. research is focused on benefiting people, not hurting them, according to four people involved in the creation of the industry partnership who are not authorized to speak about it publicly.One main concern for people in the tech industry would be if regulators jumped in to create rules around their A.I. work. So they are trying to create a framework for a self-policing organization, though it is not clear yet how that will function.\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that there should be no regulation,\u201d said Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the authors of the Stanford report. \u201cWe\u2019re saying that there is a right way and a wrong way.\u201dWhile the tech industry is known for being competitive, there have been instances when companies have worked together when it was in their best interests. In the 1990s, for example, tech companies agreed on a standard method for encrypting e-commerce transactions, laying the groundwork for two decades of growth in internet business.The authors of the Stanford report, which is titled \u201cArtificial Intelligence and Life in 2030,\u201d argue that it will be impossible to regulate A.I. \u201cThe study panel\u2019s consensus is that attempts to regulate A.I. in general would be misguided, since there is no clear definition of A.I. (it isn\u2019t any one thing), and the risks and considerations are very different in different domains,\u201d the report says.One recommendation in the report is to raise the awareness of and expertise about artificial intelligence at all levels of government, Dr. Stone said. It also calls for increased public and private spending on A.I.\u201cThere is a role for government and we respect that,\u201d said David Kenny, general manager for IBM\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence division. The challenge, he said, is \u201ca lot of times policies lag the technologies.\u201dA memorandum is being circulated among the five companies with a tentative plan to announce the new organization in the middle of September. One of the unresolved issues is that Google DeepMind, an Alphabet subsidiary, has asked to participate separately, according to a person involved in the negotiations.Separately, Reid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn who has a background in artificial intelligence, is in discussions with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab to fund a project exploring the social and economic effects of artificial intelligence.Both the M.I.T. effort and the industry partnership are trying to link technology advances more closely to social and economic policy issues. The M.I.T. group has been discussing the idea of designing new A.I. and robotic systems with \u201csociety in the loop.\u201dThe phrase is a reference to the long-running debate about designing computer and robotic systems that still require interaction with humans. For example, the Pentagon has recently begun articulating a military strategy that calls for using A.I. in which humans continue to control killing decisions, rather than delegating that responsibility to machines.\u201cThe key thing that I would point out is computer scientists have not been good at interacting with the social scientists and the philosophers,\u201d said Joichi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times. \u201cWhat we want to do is support and reinforce the social scientists who are doing research which will play a role in setting policies.\u201dThe Stanford report attempts to define the issues that citizens of a typical North American city will face in computers and robotic systems that mimic human capabilities. The authors explore eight aspects of modern life, including health care, education, entertainment and employment, but specifically do not look at the issue of warfare. They said that military A.I. applications were outside their current scope and expertise, but they did not rule out focusing on weapons in the future.The report also does not consider the belief of some computer specialists about the possibility of a \u201csingularity\u201d that might lead to machines that are more intelligent and possibly threaten humans.\u201cIt was a conscious decision not to give credence to this in the report,\u201d Dr. Stone said.Advertisement"}

So with the region\u2019s antitrust chief visiting the United States this week, the bloc\u2019s officials said on Monday that they were investigating whether a French company signed a sweetheart tax deal with Luxembourg.The inquiry into the French utility Engie is at an early stage and officials gave no estimates of the amount of taxes the company potentially owed. Still, the investigation could help Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s competition commissioner, rebut allegations of bias as she begins her meetings in the United States on Monday.European authorities are also investigating Amazon, McDonald\u2019s and other companies in multiple areas. The move against Apple prompted anger in Washington, where officials said Ms. Vestager was too focused on American companies.Ricardo Cardoso, a spokesman for Ms. Vestager, told a news conference on Monday that the timing of the announcement was not related to her trip to the United States to meet with American officials, and that her investigations also involved many European companies.Last year, Ms. Vestager ordered Luxembourg to claim up to \u20ac30 million in taxes from a unit of the Italian carmaker Fiat. She has also ordered Belgium to recover significant sums of taxes from a number of companies including the brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, which is based in Leuven, Belgium.Even so, American companies are a major focus for Ms. Vestager.She has previously issued orders to the Netherlands to collect up to \u20ac30 million in taxes from Starbucks, and she still is investigating whether Luxembourg gave favorable tax treatment to McDonald\u2019s and Amazon.In the case of Engie, a utility formerly known as GDF Suez and which is part-owned by the French state, officials said Luxembourg may have given the company an \u201cunfair advantage over other companies.\u201dIn particular, the commission said transactions within the Engie group inside Luxembourg had allowed it to reduce its tax burden. That would be a violation of rules against unfair state aid to favored companies, it said.In a statement, the Luxembourg finance ministry said there had been \u201cno special tax treatment or selective advantage\u201d awarded to Engie.Advertisement"}

But what happens to the cash machine if web search eventually becomes outmoded?That worry isn\u2019t far-fetched. More of the world\u2019s computing time keeps shifting to smartphones, where apps have supplanted the web. And internet-connected devices that may dominate the next era in tech \u2014 smartwatches, home-assistant devices like Amazon\u2019s Echo, or virtual reality machines like Oculus Rift \u2014 are likely to be free of the web, and may even lack screens.But if Google is worried, it isn\u2019t showing it. The company has long been working on a not-so-secret weapon to avert its potential irrelevance. Google has shoveled vast financial and engineering resources into a collection of data mining and artificial intelligence systems, from speech recognition to machine translation to computer vision.But Google has much grander aims for the Assistant. People at the company say that Sundar Pichai, who took over as Google\u2019s chief executive last year after Google was split into a conglomerate called Alphabet, has bet the company on the new tech. Mr. Pichai declined an interview request for this column, but at Google\u2019s developer conference in May, he called the development of the Assistant \u201ca seminal moment\u201d for the company.If the Assistant or something like it does not take off, Google\u2019s status as the chief navigator of our digital lives could be superseded by a half-dozen other assistants. You might interact with Alexa in your house, with Siri on your phone, and with Facebook Messenger\u2019s chatbot when you\u2019re out and about. Google\u2019s search engine (not to mention its Android operating system, Chrome, Gmail, Maps and other properties) would remain popular and lucrative, but possibly far less so than they are today.The Assistant, in Google\u2019s most far-out vision, would always be around, wherever you are, on whatever device you use, to handle just about any informational task.Consider this common situation: Today, to book a trip, you usually have to load up several travel sites, consult your calendar and coordinate with your family and your colleagues. If the Assistant works as well as Google hopes, all you might have to do is say, \u201cO.K., Google, I need to go to Hong Kong next week. Take care of it.\u201dBased on your interactions with it over the years, Google would know your habits, your preferences and your budget. It would know your friends, family and your colleagues. With access to so much data, and with the computational power to interpret all of it, the Assistant most likely could handle the entire task; if it couldn\u2019t, it would simply ask you to fill in the gaps, the way a human assistant might.Computers have made a lot of everyday tasks far easier to accomplish, yet they still require a sometimes annoying level of human involvement to get the most out of them. The Assistant\u2019s long-term aim is to eliminate all this busywork.If it succeeds, it would be the ultimate expression of what Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, once described as the perfect search engine: a machine that \u201cunderstands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want.\u201dAt this point, a few readers may be recoiling at the potential invasion of autonomy and privacy that such a machine would necessitate.The Assistant would involve giving ourselves over to machines more fully. We would trust them not just with our information but increasingly with our decisions. Many people are already freaked out by what Google, Facebook and other tech companies know about us. Would we be willing to hand over even more power to computers?Those are important questions, but they are also well down the road. For now, the more pressing question for the Assistant is: Will it even work?Google has technological advantages that suggest it could build a more capable digital assistant than others have accomplished. Many of the innovations that it has built into its search engine \u2014 including its knowledge graph database of more than a billion people, places and things, and the 17 years it has spent trying to understand the meaning of web queries \u2014 will form the Assistant\u2019s brain.Google has also been one of the leaders in machine learning, the process that allows computers to discover facts about the world without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is at the heart of a number of recent advances, including Google Photos\u2019 uncanny capacity to search through your images for arbitrary terms (photos of people hugging, for instance).\u201cWe are in the process of transforming into a machine-learning company,\u201d Jeff Dean, who is in charge of Google Brain, the company\u2019s artificial intelligence project, told me this year. For each problem Google solves this way, it gets better at solving other problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a boulder going downhill gathering more momentum as it goes,\u201d Mr. Dean said.That\u2019s an amazing technological feat. But as Brian pointed out, it\u2019s also pretty useless. Why does your friend care if you know his dog\u2019s a Shih Tzu?This gets to a deeper difficulty. The search company might have the technical capacity to create the smartest assistant around, but it\u2019s not at all clear that it has the prowess to create the friendliest, most charming or most useful assistant. Google needs to nail not just Assistant\u2019s smarts, but also its personality \u2014 a new skill for Google, and one that its past forays into social software (Google Plus, anyone?) don\u2019t speak highly of.\u201cWhen I was trying to book a movie, it didn\u2019t really narrow things down for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there were some times it was wrong. I asked it to show me my upcoming trip, and it didn\u2019t get that.\u201dOf course, it\u2019s still early. Mr. Sullivan has high hopes for the Assistant. It would be premature to look at the technology today and get discouraged about its future, especially since Google sees this as a multiyear, perhaps even decade-long project. And especially if Google\u2019s future depends on getting this right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Word a Headline Didn\u2019t Need", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Public EditorNow, you can see the word applied to Clinton in a headline on the Opinion pages of The New York Times: \u201cThe Bitch America Needs.\u201dZeisler\u2019s piece was an interesting read, strongly pro-Clinton, and pro-feminist. But several readers took issue both with the headline and the editors\u2019 decision to use it.This one from Paula DiPerna of New York City was typical: \u201cI know the piece is mere opinion, but it nevertheless represents a new low in titillation journalism, as if written by a gleeful child who just got permission to use curse words. It is a disservice to the idea of public good in that, disguised as feminism, it actually delivers nothing but tweet fodder to anti-Clinton forces.\u201dI sought out the Opinion editor Rachel Dry to ask her how the essay came about as well as the concerns highlighted in DiPerna\u2019s letter, some of which I share. Dry says she commissioned the piece because she wanted someone to wrestle with how this particular profanity is being used against Clinton. \u201cCertainly the word focuses one\u2019s attention,\u201d Dry said to my questions about its use in the headline and so frequently in the story. \u201cBut that\u2019s what the essay is about.\u201dI did find the essay readable and smart, and given that the Op-Ed pages are intended to throw out the welcome mat to all views, it\u2019s hard to argue that this wasn\u2019t a worthy offering. But I too was jolted by the headline. Have we really reached the point that it\u2019s O.K. for The Times to refer to Clinton in bold type as \u201cThe Bitch America Needs\u201d?Dry said she was unaware of a previous time when the word was used in a headline.Dry says that when opinion editors write the headlines, they are distilling the author\u2019s perspective, not the view or the voice of The Times.That may be, but referring to the first female presidential nominee as the right bitch for the job brings an air of legitimacy to the word that seems beyond where we are at this moment in history. The mainstream may someday apply this term to women who stand up for themselves and bust through feminine stereotypes. Until then, it remains an insult, degrading and misogynistic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Software Is Booming. But Why Now?", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This is the year artificial intelligence came into its own for mainstream businesses, at least as a marketing feature.Salesforce chose this date to pre-empt Oracle, the world\u2019s largest business software company, which on Sunday evening began its annual customer event in San Francisco. High on Oracle\u2019s list of new features: real-time analysis of enormous amounts of data. Oracle calls its product Oracle A.I.There are big pushes in A.I. in agriculture, manufacturing, aviation and pretty much every other sector of the economy.It\u2019s all very exciting, the way great possibilities are, and clearly full of great buzzwords and slogans. But will other companies see any value in all this or understand if A.I. has value for them?\u201cNo one really knows where the value is,\u201d said Marc Benioff, co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cI think I know \u2014 it\u2019s in helping people do the things that people are good at, and turning more things over to machines.\u201dMr. Benioff wasn\u2019t selling Einstein\u2019s capabilities short. He was talking about the long-term value of artificial intelligence, which is passing through a familiar phase \u2014 a technology that is strange and new, that sometimes overpromises what it can do and is headed for uses not easily seen at the start.Cloaked inside terms like deep learning and machine intelligence, A.I. is essentially a series of advanced statistics-based exercises that review the past to indicate the likely future, or look at current customer choices to figure out where to put more or less energy.Perhaps a better question than \u201cWhat is the value?\u201d of this explosion of advanced statistics is \u201cWhy now?\u201d That shows both the opportunity and why many companies are scared about missing out.Much of today\u2019s A.I. boom goes back to 2006, when Amazon started selling cheap computing over the internet. Those measures built the public clouds of Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, among others. That same year, Google and Yahoo released statistical methods for dealing with the unruly data of human behavior. In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone, a device that began a boom in unruly-data collection everywhere.Suddenly, old A.I. experiments were relevant, and money and cheap data resources were available for building new algorithms. Ten years later, computing is cheaper than ever, companies live online and in their phone apps, and sensors are bringing even more unruly data from more places.Amazon, Google and the rest have exceptional A.I. resources for sale, but many older companies are wary of turning their data over to these upstarts. That, along with fear of a competitor getting on top of A.I. first, is a big motivation for some to try things out.Salesforce is selling Einstein as a system that can work predictive magic without having to look at your data, in what Mr. Benioff calls a \u201cdemocratizing\u201d move that will create millions of A.I. users who are not engineers.He said this on his way to attend a series of customer focus groups around the country, however \u2014 strong evidence that customers don\u2019t get it yet, even if they\u2019re willing to try it.\u201cThere\u2019s fear of Google and Microsoft controlling everything, and there\u2019s a desire to apply A.I. to anything that\u2019s digital,\u201d said Michael Biltz, managing director of Accenture\u2019s technology vision practice. \u201cPeople are going to have to experiment, most likely first on pain points like security and product marketing.\u201dHow will we know when the A.I. revolution has taken hold? A technology truly matures when it disappears. We don\u2019t marvel at houses with electricity now, or the idea of driving to work at 60 miles an hour. We can say \u201cphone\u201d and mean a hand-held computer with NASA-level processing power and a professional-quality camera for taking selfies with our drones.A.I. is probably heading for the same places, invisibly sorting through lots of data everywhere to continuously update and automate most of our lives. Goodness knows what the weird new tech thing will be about at that point.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Incredible Shrinking Obamacare", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated there would be 21 million Americans using the exchanges by now. Many supporters argued that the exchanges would eventually replace the current dominant employer-based system.The promise of Obamacare was that it would foster competition and offer lower premiums while covering tens of millions of Americans without, as Obama often put it, adding a dime to the deficit.Unfortunately, most of the exchanges are in serious trouble. As many critics pointed out at the time, the law is poorly designed to induce younger, healthier people to get into the system. The penalties attached to the individual mandate are too weak. The subsidies are too small. The premiums are too costly. The deductibles are too high. Many doctors aren\u2019t participating in the networks.The exchanges are also producing less coverage. The insurers that are staying offer pared-down restrictive plans that look more like Medicaid.Kliff quotes former administration official Michael Adelberg: \u201cThe exchange population \u2014 85 percent of which qualifies for financial assistance \u2014 looks a lot like the Medicaid population. And with it, we\u2019re seeing the start of the Medicaid-ization of exchange plans: narrow networks with no frills.\u201dAgain, this is not bad. But we\u2019d have had a very different debate if we knew the law was going to be a discrete government effort to subsidize health care for more poor people. For one thing, Democrats would have probably paid a much smaller political price if their effort wasn\u2019t billed as an extravagant government grab to take over the nation\u2019s health care system. The administration imagined something transformational; it ended up with something significant but incremental.There are also lessons for people who think about policy making. First designing technocratic systems that will actually work is really hard. Second, designing effective technocratic systems that can pass politically is really, really hard. Third, designing politically plausible technocratic systems in a country divided on fundamental philosophy is hardness on stilts.Philosophically, Obamacare tried to split the difference between European-style government coercion (the individual mandates) with a traditionally American respect for competition and freedom of choice (the exchanges).But lawmakers couldn\u2019t stomach a law involving forceful coercion (punishing penalties to make the young take part) and they couldn\u2019t stomach a more purely market-based system. They wound up with a nonfunctioning compromise.From here on out the health care debate will return, but in polarized form. Democrats are already really pushing for the public option, a heavier state player. Republicans are pointing out that technocrats are bad at designing dynamic systems and the insurance markets should work more like traditional markets. The next president will have to deal with all this, especially if the exchanges go into a death spiral, even though the subject has been basically ignored in the campaign.It will be hard to govern after a campaign about nothing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To the Moon, North Korea? Or Does a Rocket Have a Darker Aim?", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Kim Jong-un is headed to the moon.That, at least, is one of the official North Korean explanations for the testing last week of a rocket engine that, if as powerful as the North claims, would rival the commercial rockets that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, of Amazon and Tesla, now use in their aerospace companies to fire payloads into space.Inside the United States\u2019 intelligence agencies, though, there is considerable skepticism that North Korea is truly eager to plant a flag on the lunar landscape. The agencies are exploring another explanation: that Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, is racing ahead, as the United States is distracted by a bruising presidential election, to develop a way for his growing arsenal of nuclear weapons to reach New York and Washington.The Obama administration has responded to North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests with gradually escalating sanctions, mostly through the United Nations. But on Monday it went a step farther, announcing criminal charges and Treasury Department sanctions against four Chinese individuals and a company that it said engaged in money laundering to help the North\u2019s programs for weapons of mass destruction.The sanctions were against the Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Company and its primary owner, Ma Xiaohong, who lives near the North Korean border.Few threats as urgent as the dramatic escalation of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs are likely to confront Hillary Clinton or Donald J. Trump as president. An engine that delivers 80 tons of thrust would have about three times the power of an advanced North Korean rocket shown in a ground test in April, though it is not possible to verify the North\u2019s claims. By most unclassified estimates, it will take North Korea perhaps five years to marry its missile advances with a weapon small enough and strong enough to survive the stresses of re-entering the atmosphere atop an intercontinental ballistic missile.So far, Mr. Kim\u2019s engineers have never executed a military test flight that could reach beyond the middle of the Pacific, though in a statement on Friday, the North threatened to attack Guam, home of the American B-1 bombers that conducted simulated runs last week over the Korean Peninsula.The Obama administration has not sought sanctions, knowing they would be vetoed by Russia and China, nor has it said much in public about the details of the cooperation on the new rocket engine. There is a long history of sharing missile technology, but no persuasive evidence exists that the Iranians have been involved in the North\u2019s nuclear weapons tests.The moonshot talk may be aspirational, but it is not lunacy. Rocket experts say four of the new North Korean engines, clustered at the base of a space vehicle, would be powerful enough to hurl a no-frills payload to the moon. But the North would have to master many other technologies before even an unmanned vehicle could be landed there.\u201cEven though the U.S. and its allies try to block our space development, our aerospace scientists will conquer space and definitely plant the flag of the D.P.R.K. on the moon,\u201d he said, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.Whatever the goal, the most important aspect of the new North Korean engine is that its design appears to be indigenous, rather than a knockoff of decades-old Soviet missiles. That suggests a growing domestic ability, which may explain the appeal to Iran, which intelligence officials speculate may be helping to fund the effort.\u201cIt\u2019s like nothing we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d John Schilling, an expert on North Korea\u2019s missile program at 38 North, a blog and think tank of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, said of the powerful new engine. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat frightening that they have this capability, but somewhat encouraging that they want to use it for space launching.\u201dHistory shows that any strides in rocketry, no matter what the claimed purpose, can aid both civil and military programs. \u201cThat\u2019s what the United States did,\u201d said David Rothkopf, who has written two histories of the National Security Council. \u201cIt\u2019s what the Russians did. It\u2019s what the Chinese did. Why not the North Koreans?\u201dAmerican officials would not publicly say that the program referred to in the Treasury sanctions was the same one that resulted in last week\u2019s test. But there was no other logical conclusion.The announcement identified \u201cIranian missile technicians\u201d from companies working for Iran\u2019s Ministry of Defense for Armed Forces Logistics. It said that two of them, Seyed Mirahmad Nooshin and Sayyed Medhi Farahi, \u201chave been critical to the development of the 80-ton rocket booster, and both traveled to Pyongyang during contract negotiations.\u201dDr. Schilling said the big new engine seemed more suited to launching satellites and space probes than warheads. The North Korean military is known to prefer missiles small enough to transport on trucks, haul on back roads and hide in tunnels.But the North is also highly aware that its launching failures in past years have become the stuff of ridicule on the internet, making it easy to dismiss the program. It seems to be looking for something that would create at least the impression that it will not take long for it to fly to the moon or strike any part of the United States.\u201cYou cluster four of them together, and that\u2019s a very healthy ICBM,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea specialist at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., said of the new engine.Of course, moving from a static engine test to a cross-Pacific flight test would take considerable time, and the rocket would be a giant sitting duck for American targeting on the launchpad.One possibility is that the North is trying to replicate elements of the American \u201ctriad\u201d \u2014 the creation of a nuclear arsenal that can be delivered by aircraft, from ground-based silos and from submarines.The North Koreans may be thinking, \u201cWhy not have everything?\u201d Dr. Lewis said.David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Cambridge, Mass., group that monitors proliferation, also argued that North Korea\u2019s advance could well end up powering ICBMs from deep silos.He noted that the high power of the new North Korean engine was similar to one that Chinese scientists developed to power that nation\u2019s first long-range missile.\u201cWho knows what North Korea might want to do?\u201d Dr. Wright said. \u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t think we can take an ICBM off the table.\u201dDavid E. Sanger reported from Washington, and William J. Broad from New YorkAdvertisement"}
