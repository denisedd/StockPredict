{"Headline": "Apple Opens the iMessage Door, and the Ephemera Rushes In", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookApple built an empire on hermetically sealed systems with sleek, minimalist designs. Nowhere was its strategy more evident than in iMessage, the company\u2019s instant messaging system that offered a free, elegant chatting solution exclusive to Apple devices. Until last week, that is, when Apple updated its software, cracked open iMessage and allowed the ephemera of the outside internet to seep in.Now, click on an unassuming arrow in the chat window, and you\u2019ll throw open a junk drawer of digital tchotchkes scavenged from web properties new and old. GIFs, stickers and supersized emoji dominate this digital playground, while text \u2014 actual words \u2014 becomes almost an afterthought.But unlike the freewheeling world of the outside web, where we grab and go as we please, Apple is steering users toward a tightly curated selection of non-textual toys. None would look out of place at a 3-year-old\u2019s birthday party. Many come at a price. Welcome to Apple\u2019s sanitized, monetized version of internet culture.These features mimic the aesthetics of the open internet, which is obsessed with nostalgia and is not exactly subtle. But they can\u2019t replicate the feeling of collecting digital miscellany in our travels across the internet, remixing the material and sending it along to friends who might appreciate the find. The programmatic iMessage sucks the spontaneity from the experience. It standardizes the strange.Several new features, meanwhile, blow up iMessage\u2019s intimate chat experience to help it compete with the social networks. A handy GIF keyboard jumps off the reaction-GIF empire that Tumblr built, calling up video loops of broadly accessible cultural references (Honey Boo Boo dancing, two Minions giggling) to convey a range of emotional states. Another feature lets you finger-paint directly onto your photos, just like you can on Snapchat. But mostly, this thing feels like Facebook. A new class of iMessage apps \u2014 yes, apps within an app \u2014 lets chatters play Words With Friends, send money through Square or make dinner reservations on OpenTable, all right within the chat window. It feels like iMessage is trying to swallow the rest of your phone.The camera is in here, and so too can be Fandango, ESPN, and, if you want, Carrot, a snarky robot that reads you the weather report for $3.99. In many of these cases, the service is so slight that exchanging actual words would work just fine: Want to see \u201cSnowden\u201d at 10:15? Did you catch the Nats game? It\u2019s 77 and sunny \u2014 greeaaaaat. It\u2019s not clear why every shade of human interaction needs to be mediated by its own app.Here\u2019s one theory: Each tap into the iMessage world sends you further away from your chat bubbles and deeper into Apple\u2019s labyrinth of special features. Follow the path to its inevitable conclusion, and all of a sudden, you\u2019re no longer talking with your friends. You\u2019re shopping.Five clicks into iMessage, you\u2019ll arrive at Apple\u2019s brand-new sticker shop. Offering colorful sets of illustrations to drag and drop into your chats, it\u2019s one of iMessage\u2019s most tantalizing new destinations. If our chat windows function as modern living rooms, stickers offer the opportunity to appoint our walls with art from cutting-edge digital creators.iMessage is the iPhone\u2019s most trafficked feature. Its chats facilitate an endless combination of social interactions and emotional expressions. But Apple\u2019s shop suggests that all conversations would improve from a Party City-style redecoration, with generic celebratory sentiments and Disney-branded flair.\u201cStickers\u201d sound inherently childish, but they don\u2019t have to be. The stickerification of chats was pioneered by Line, a Japanese chat giant that swept Asia and is lately making a bid for western audiences. Line loves corporate synergy, too, heralding sticker sets starring Snoopy, Super Mario and Hello Kitty.But even as it attempts world chat domination, Line services online subcultures. Dozens of sticker sets feature gay characters, and more than one \u2014 \u201cFangirl\u2019s Activities\u201d and \u201cI Love KPOP\u201d \u2014 depicts anime girls in various states of obsession. Then there\u2019s the sex stuff. The \u201cUMAOTOKO\u201d sticker shows two men in horse costumes, uh, stretching together. The most risqu\u00e9 sticker I could find in Apple\u2019s version was in a set called \u201cFailmoji.\u201d It\u2019s a hand-drawn butt with the caption \u201cFART!!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Companies Like Apple Dodge Taxes and Their Own Investors", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs an investor, one who has been entrusted with helping to safeguard other people\u2019s money over many years, I value the high degree of disclosure required from American public companies. Corporations and the world in which they operate change every day, so investors need to know the risks their money faces.No area of business demonstrates the need for full disclosure as much as one that has been in the news a lot lately: large American companies\u2019 shifting profits overseas to minimize tax bills, or to avoid taxes altogether. These schemes are starting to attract the attention of regulators and governments who view them more as tax dodges than as legitimate financial arrangements.Given the risks, the last thing investors need is less disclosure. But the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency responsible to ensure that companies are being open and honest, is considering exactly that: scaling back the information available to the public.This is the wrong direction. We need more information, not less.When the S.E.C. was created in the 1930s, we did not have multinational companies with scores of foreign subsidiaries or the constant risk of government crackdowns on shady tax maneuvers. Today, there are an estimated $2.3 trillion in Fortune 500 company revenues currently booked in tax havens.Lately, these companies have been running into opposition from government regulators. Apple has accumulated billions in profits and, with the assistance of tax-haven-based subsidiaries, managed to pay little tax on those profits to any national government anywhere in the world. As a result of its near-zero tax arrangement with Ireland, Apple will now be embroiled for years in lawsuits relating to a ruling by Europe\u2019s antitrust enforcer, which ordered the company to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes.Earlier this year, French tax authorities raided the Paris offices of Google, and Spanish tax authorities did the same in Madrid. Both countries are calling for billions in back taxes.Several years ago, members of the British government called for a consumer boycott of Starbucks because the company paid no taxes in Britain (all of its revenue was offset by \u201cexpenses\u201d paid in other jurisdictions).Incredibly, even though the blowback against egregious tax practices is a substantial risk to multinational companies and a significant threat for shareholders, it is often impossible for investors to determine how healthy a company really is and whether or not the profits are merely a reflection of aggressive tax planning.The S.E.C.\u2019s mandate is to require companies to provide full disclosure to a \u201creasonable investor.\u201d But no reasonable investor could have known the full scope of Apple\u2019s overseas tax shelters, which were not detailed in the company\u2019s financial releases. That took multiple investigators with subpoena power working for a United States Senate subcommittee nearly a year. And there was no obvious way for investors to know the particulars of Apple\u2019s Irish deal or how risky it might prove to be.And even when disclosures are made, the sheer complexity of a company\u2019s international taxes can make even the most elemental decision impossible. During the dispute of a management buyout of Dell Computer earlier this year, two experts in valuation science, using similar methods and principles, were asked to come up with a ballpark figure for Dell\u2019s true value. Their estimates differed by $28 billion, largely because they reached different conclusions about the company\u2019s overseas taxes.With companies engaging in high-risk tax avoidance, the investing public needs more information, clearly expressed. Investors should, at a minimum, be given a list of all countries in which a company operates, the revenue and earnings attributed to each country, and the amount of taxes paid in each. There might still be disputes but at least investors would be working from the same numbers.Nothing in the current S.E.C. rules requires even that simple statement from companies. If we are going to protect the integrity of the market, we should start by requiring companies to report exactly how they are doing business, including where they pay taxes and how much. The world has changed, and our rules must change with it.Advertisement"}

Facebook might, too. WhatsApp could have to follow tougher telecom standards.A new set of rules, expected to be unveiled by European Union officials on Wednesday, is likely to put new pressure on American tech companies.Europe calls it consumer protection. Silicon Valley calls it protectionism.In some ways, they are both right.The aim? To give the bloc\u2019s roughly 500 million consumers unfettered access to services like movie streaming, online shopping and cloud computing, no matter where they live. At the same time, the proposals would force some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies to comply with stringent competition, privacy and copyright rules.For many executives from American tech companies, such plans, which will still take years to come into effect and which will be subject to intense lobbying, feel like another round of protectionism. And while Europe\u2019s policy makers balk at these claims, the fact that Google, Facebook and Microsoft, among others, will be the most affected by the digital revamp has again highlighted how much Europeans rely on American tech when using digital services in their daily lives.The plans to be announced by the Brussels-based European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, include:The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u25a0 Providing financial incentives to telecom operators like Deutsche Telekom and Orange to invest in the region\u2019s mobile and broadband networks. Operators may be given greater control over their internet infrastructure, potentially restricting competitors\u2019 use of these networks. Companies say such limits are needed to guarantee a return on the billions of dollars of digital investment. Consumer groups argue that it may lead to higher prices.Europe\u2019s proposals, which could still be subject to last-minute changes before being published, were confirmed by six people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the reforms had not yet been made public.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact of life that most innovative companies come from the West Coast,\u201d said Andrej Savin, an internet governance professor at the Copenhagen Business School. \u201cThe proposals coming from Brussels definitely have the American companies in mind.\u201dWith a roughly 90 percent market share, Google\u2019s search engine in Europe is more dominant than it is in the United States, where Microsoft\u2019s Bing service still holds its own. Facebook has more European users than American ones, while Germany and Britain remain two of Amazon\u2019s largest international markets.The latest digital reforms \u2014 either on purpose or by coincidence, depending on people\u2019s viewpoints \u2014 take aim at that dominance, and potentially give European publishers and telecom companies a helping hand to compete head-on with their American rivals.Advertisement"}

Most other outlets give you several people\u2019s perspectives on a story, usually second hand. On Snapchat, you see dozens of people\u2019s snaps showing different parts of a story \u2014 in this case people showing their homes getting flooded, going to shelters, dealing with the aftermath. It was an incredibly emotionally resonant way to depict the kind of news story that can otherwise seem remote.Also, it\u2019s fun to take pictures of my face as a bee.I think this is a good, necessary and long overdue thing. I\u2019ve had many friends tell me of their continuous rejections on Airbnb. Here\u2019s to hoping it actually curbs the discrimination.One big test of success here \u2014 other than sales \u2014 will be what other smartphone manufacturers do now. If we suddenly start seeing the headphone jack disappearing from all high-end phones, Apple will have won the argument.Speaking of Nintendo, today I\u2019d like to focus on something that got a little bit less attention during the Big Apple keynote: Super Mario.Yes, that\u2019s right, the world\u2019s most beloved plumber is coming to the iPhone rather soon \u2014 before the end of the year, Nintendo said \u2014 in the Japanese video game giant\u2019s first ever Mario franchise on iOS. It\u2019s called Super Mario Run, and it\u2019s a neat-looking side-scroller you can play with one hand, even on the subway.This is a watershed moment for Nintendo, long considered a laggard in its approach to mobile gaming. As you may well know, the advent of the iPhone \u2014 and Android \u2014 was kind of a big deal. The mass adoption of smartphones upended entire industries, like GPS navigation companies, mapping sites, and yes, even video game makers. More and more people who once looked to consoles, desktop PCs or even hand-held devices to get their gaming fix are now playing iPhone games, downloading them directly from the app store without the hassle of going to buy a new video game DVD or another console.That\u2019s a massive shift in a mega-market, something that came virtually overnight. And Nintendo, the world\u2019s pre-eminent legacy video game company, has really struggled to recalibrate.I take this Mario thing as a big deal. But tell me your thoughts on the matter.But really the deeper story here is that smartphones are unstoppable. Everyone in tech keeps looking for the next big thing, but to me the biggest story in tech continues to be the way smartphones keep swallowing up every other gadget. The best smartphone cameras are now much better than any snapshot camera you can buy, and for most people, a phone is the only camera they need. The Nintendo announcement shows that phones have now completely consumed mobile gaming, too.My own prediction: TV is next. Last night I watched the first episode of Season 2 of \u201cNarcos\u201d on my phone.Have a great vacation, Mike!Advertisement"}

Don\u2019t trade it in just yet. Download new software instead.In some cases, that is already possible. And over the next few years, as the already extensive software on modern cars becomes even more feature-rich and upgradeable, manufacturers mean to step up the effort. They plan to offer many types of improvements or repairs through downloads that are beamed directly to the car via satellite, Wi-Fi or cellular signal, without the vehicle\u2019s having to be brought into the shop.Eventually, your car will be serviceable like a giant smartphone, with new features added periodically while you sleep.A leading proponent of the approach is Tesla, the maker of electric luxury cars, which has been sending updates to its cars\u2019 operating systems since 2012. The company is expected to announce an updated operating system next week. The chief executive, Elon Musk, has said via Twitter that the update will include improvements to the company\u2019s Autopilot automated driving system.But Tesla is by no means alone in the download department. General Motors has been offering services and upgrades via the cellular-delivered OnStar entertainment and roadside-assistance system since 2009. G.M.\u2019s Acadia sport utility vehicle can now receive new apps for its entertainment system over the air.Other manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, send wireless uploads to update various in-vehicle apps, including maps and entertainment offerings like Spotify and Pandora.The number of vehicles on United States roads that can accept infotainment software upgrades will increase to 34 million in 2022 from one million now, the consulting firm IHS Markit predicts.\u201cThe advantages for automakers of doing over-the-air updates are too great to ignore,\u201d said Egil Juliussen, automotive analyst for IHS Markit. \u201cThey can keep their functionality up-to-date and get rid of bugs.\u201dTesla\u2019s upgrades have included an updated digital instrument panel, a revised touch screen, faster acceleration, activation of Autopilot and the ability for the vehicle to enter and exit a garage without anyone being in the car.\u201cSoftware updates to my Tesla are like Christmas,\u201d said Ankur Pansari of San Francisco. \u201cWhen I get them, I have a new toy to play with.\u201dAnd the automaker can save money. With cars and trucks increasingly reliant on complex computer code to operate, manufacturers can cut costs if they can correct or improve a vehicle\u2019s functions without having to get the car into a dealership.In November 2013, Tesla issued a software update to electronically raise the ground clearance of the Model S after a vehicle\u2019s battery pack caught fire when it ran over an object. A subsequent update gave the driver the ability to change the clearance at will.\u201cSoftware updates are extremely important to me,\u201d said another Tesla owner, Scott Wolf, a software engineer in Naples, Fla. \u201cKnowing there are new features and they can fix the car without having to bring it in \u2014 that\u2019s very impressive for an owner.\u201dFord, which previously provided software updates to its Sync infotainment system using a USB memory stick, will soon send software uploads to deliver Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality to its 2016 models equipped with its Sync 3 infotainment system. CarPlay and Auto replicate certain iPhone and Android smartphone features on the vehicle\u2019s display.Ford delivers the updated software via Wi-Fi, installing it when the vehicle is restarted. The company will eventually switch to making updates via satellite.Sending uploads will enable Ford to reduce the number of versions of its software. Instead of creating baked-in variants for each country, for example, Ford will be able to upload interfaces in different languages.\u201cWe absolutely believe in the promise of software updates,\u201d said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director of connected vehicles.Manufacturers are also looking at software downloads as a new source of revenue, turning on features remotely if the owner pays a fee. It would be similar to the way most new cars come with the hardware for SiriusXM satellite radio but require owners to pay a subscription fee.Tesla has already incorporated fees-for-features into its business model. While late-model Tesla vehicles are equipped with cameras and sensors to enable semiautonomous driving, this feature \u2014 Autopilot \u2014 requires a $3,000 to $3,500 software download to make it work.Owners of the Tesla S60 are also able to increase their vehicle\u2019s range by about 40 miles if they pay Tesla $9,000 to activate the feature through a software download.Other automakers see similar opportunities. \u201cThere are potential situations where one could buy a Ford with a base configuration, and then we could deliver an update for an \u00e0 la carte fee, or on a subscription basis,\u201d said Mr. Butler of Ford.Jason Hughes, a Tesla Model S owner and computer programmer in Hickory, N.C., did not like the speed restrictions and the need to keep his hands on the wheel that Tesla requires when Autopilot is used on the streets.Hacking into the software, Mr. Hughes removed those safeguards. Tesla declined to comment on whether such activity would void an owner\u2019s warranty. But Mr. Hughes runs the risk of having the restrictions restored when the next update is beamed down.A direct communications link between an automaker and its vehicles means the company has the capability not only to upgrade software but to monitor vehicle systems as well. Location, driving style and serviceability can all be tracked.Since May, G.M. has offered its optional Smart Driver technology to the three million customers who own vehicles with 4G wireless capability. The system tracks and analyzes driving characteristics, suggesting ways to improve fuel economy and reduce wear and tear. The company will also suggest that drivers with strong scores seek insurance discounts.Remote software updates will become particularly crucial as vehicles become more capable of driving themselves.\u201cSoftware upgrades will be almost mandatory once we move up to higher forms of autonomous driving,\u201d said Richard Wallace, a director at the Center for Automotive Research. \u201cThe artificial intelligence underpinning self-driving will require constant upgrading to deal with novel situations.\u201dIn the future, vehicle manufacturers might even refuse to assume liability for an autonomous vehicle that causes a crash but whose owner did not bother to accept an upgrade, said Lars Reger, the chief technology officer at NXP Semiconductors, a supplier to the automotive industry.For all the issues and opportunities posed by the upgradeable car, one business consideration might seem crucial for automakers: Will the ability to continually improve features and performance make the idea of buying a new car less enticing?Here, too, the smartphone analogy could prove apt, carmakers say.\u201cUltimately, satisfied customers will want an ongoing relationship with us,\u201d said Mr. Butler of Ford. \u201cAs with an iPhone, at some point the hardware will no longer be upgradeable. It\u2019s part of the world we live in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Additionally, the width of your wallet can shrink quite a bit from the removal of money.Like its predecessor, the iPhone 7 will cost about $650. The most talked-about accessory is a pair of wireless headphones that will cost $160 more. Not cheap, in other words, to buy the full experience.An editor told Brian the little wireless tubes coming out of the buds looked like he had tiny cigarettes in his ears (to me, they are more like drain pipes.) But the sound, Brian says, is quite good, and the engineering is clever.I borrowed them and realized something else: It\u2019s a very different feeling to listen to music from earbuds without wires leading back to the phone. It\u2019s more intimate than using either standard earbuds or wireless headphones, a direct and full relationship to your music.Immediacy does seem to be a design goal. The faster processor means getting the camera on or moving among apps is closer to instantaneous. The battery lasts longer, too, so there is less time away from the phone while it is charging.Free, that is, to any child or school that buys an Apple iPad.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What It Feels Like to Ride in a Self-Driving Uber", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "Supported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 I\u2019m parked on a patch of gravel outside the old Heinz ketchup bottling factory here early on a Monday morning, and I\u2019m frustrated. My Uber self-driving car will not start driving itself.The engineer in the passenger seat next to me, an Uber employee for all of three weeks who asked if I wanted to take a turn behind the wheel, chimes in to say I should turn the car off and start it again, as if rebooting a computer.In this case, my \u201ccomputer\u201d is a modified Ford Fusion hybrid sedan code-named Boron 6, an atomic element often found in magnets, laundry detergent and nuclear reactors. Uber has outfitted it with more than 20 cameras, seven lasers, a spinning 360-degree laser-based detection system and 1,400 other aftermarket parts that render millions of bits of data about the environment in real time as I drive through it. If the car works as advertised, someday neither I nor anybody else will sit in the driver\u2019s seat of a car again.During my ride, most of which I spent as a passenger in Boron 6\u2019s back seat, my safety engineer proved his worth. At various moments, he had to take over the wheel and turn through intersections where locals are known to speed. When a truck driver backed out into the road illegally, he put his foot on the brake, immediately taking control of the car.If the safety engineer felt unsafe, he could at any time smack down a big red button in the center console \u2014 suspiciously similar to a seat ejector switch from a James Bond film \u2014 to disengage from self-driving mode. To turn the self-driving feature back on, he need only press a sleek steel button next to an embossed nameplate stamped on the console.If I felt unsafe as a passenger, I could also request that the driver take over the vehicle, or press a button on a screen facing the back seat that would end the ride. I also monitored the infrared environment the car had rendered from the screen, a 3-D world updating in real time, and took a selfie from a camera built into the console. After the ride, Uber texts to passengers an animated GIF of the 3-D modeled route taken, along with the selfie.But for most of the ride, I felt safe. In self-driving mode, turns and stops were near seamless, and I often had to check in with my driver to see whether he or the computer was steering the car. I did grow a bit nervous a few times when watching how close the computer drove us to cars parked on the right side of a street. Though, admittedly, that could have been my mind playing tricks on me by being more vigilant than usual about my surroundings.Raffi Krikorian, engineering director of Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center, located in the city\u2019s industrial Strip District, put it this way: \u201cPittsburgh is the double-black diamond of driving.\u201dThe challenge expressed in Mr. Krikorian\u2019s ski analogy is one that Uber has taken to heart. From the company\u2019s point of view, the self-driving vehicle operates more safely than any human driver.My driverless Uber stopped far behind cars in front of us at intersections. It stayed exactly at the speed limit \u2014 25 miles per hour where we drove \u2014 even when there was no traffic around. At one stoplight, the car waited for the green signal before turning right. The human drivers behind us were not pleased.As my ride in Boron 6 wound down \u2014 in total, I traveled roughly 20 miles in the vehicle \u2014 it was hard not to feel like a celebrity, or perhaps more like a Martian. Other motorists gawked, and a boy on a Razor scooter gaped at me from a corner, waving to his mother to come look.But how they will get rich from it remains unclear. Much of Uber\u2019s success has been based on the premise that people could share their idle cars with the public by driving during their spare time. A self-driving car obviates the need for human drivers, a clear source of tension among Uber drivers today. Company executives said self-driving cars would be only one part of Uber\u2019s business in the future, with a mix of drivers and autonomous vehicles.All of these companies face an uncertain regulatory environment for driverless vehicles that could impede the rollouts of the cars across the country.There will be delays and bugs, such as the one I encountered my first time behind the wheel when the self-driving car didn\u2019t drive itself. That\u2019s the whole point of the pilot test. The wealth of sensors and recording equipment will see what happens \u2014 warts and all \u2014 \u201cso we can learn more about what makes drivers and riders comfortable and safe,\u201d said Emily Duff Bartel, a product manager at the Advanced Technologies Center.For me, it took about 10 minutes of troubleshooting to work through the glitches, but Boron 6 eventually turned on and started driving itself. That is, after a little bit of human intervention.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when the Chinese government television news channel reported that a driver of a Tesla with autonomous features had been killed in a crash. It was reported on Wednesday, not Tuesday.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "IPhone 7 Review: Though Not Perfect, New iPhones Keep Apple\u2019s Promises", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "Supported byTech FixApple\u2019s iPhone, just short of 10 years old, has hit puberty.For Apple customers, this creates a difficult choice. While upgrading iPhones in the past was typically a no-brainer, now people must wrestle with whether to deal with the hassle of having no audio jack. Many people could simply upgrade to last year\u2019s model, the iPhone 6S, which is also a fast phone with great cameras and still has the jack.Yet after testing the new iPhone 7 and its larger sibling, the 7 Plus, for five days, I have hopped on the 7 train. While it is irritating not to have an audio jack \u2014 Apple nixed the 3.5 millimeter port to make room for faster chips, better batteries and to make the iPhone water-resistant \u2014 and the older physical home button feels better to press than the new virtual one, the new iPhones deliver on Apple\u2019s promises.The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are tremendously fast \u2014 more than double the speed of the two-year-old iPhone 6 \u2014 and their cameras produce superb, vivid photos. The battery life is improved, and the iPhones survived water torture tests.The bottom line: Those who have been waiting years to buy a new phone are in store for a major upgrade with the iPhone 7.Apple understood that parting with the audio jack would be painful. So it made two moves:1) The new iPhones include a converter, or a dongle with a Lightning connector on one side, for plugging into the iPhone, and an audio port on the other end, for plugging in an audio accessory.2) Also included in the box: A pair of wired earbuds with a Lightning connector.For iPhone owners who relied on Apple\u2019s included earbuds, the Lightning earbuds solve that problem. But for consumers hoarding lots of wired audio gear, the converter solution is less convenient since the adapter is tiny and easy to lose. If you have a pair of great wired headphones, your best bet is to leave the converter connected to the headphones so you don\u2019t forget it.The most convenient workaround to not having a headphone jack is to make the leap to wireless earphones. Apple\u2019s wireless AirPods, due for release in October, cost $159 and come in a box that resembles a dental-floss dispenser. They connect to the iPhone\u2019s Bluetooth connection via a proprietary chip in the earphones, called W1.This makes setting AirPods up extremely easy: When you open the box next to the iPhone, the earphones automatically pair with the device. (The box also charges AirPods.) From there, you simply put the earphones on and start listening to music or podcasts; removing the earphones causes the audio to pause.Here is where AirPods fell short for me: Sometimes when listening to podcasts, a glitch caused the podcasts to rewind and replay a small segment \u2014 an eerie echo. In addition, when using AirPods outside, there was occasional interference, causing the audio to crackle and cut out.An Apple spokeswoman said the company was looking into the podcast issue, adding that the AirPods I tested were early hardware and that bugs should be resolved by the time they are released next month.Over all, AirPods sound decent, with loud bass and clear audio quality, comparable to the wired earbuds that Apple has included in iPhones for years. They aren\u2019t, however, sufficient for drowning out the thunderous prattle of a loud co-worker.While AirPods do a good job staying in your ears, they look odd, like dangling short white stubs. They evoked mockery from one of my editors, who said, \u201cCigarettes belong in your mouth, not your ears, Brian.\u201dThe most compelling improvement on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is the sharp speed increase. Spurred by faster chips, everything \u2014 switching between apps, opening the camera \u2014 feels snappier. The iPhone 7 battery also gets about two hours more juice than the 6S.Using the app Geekbench 4, I tested the speeds of the iPhone 7, 6S and 6. The iPhone 7 was 39 percent faster than the 6S and 114 percent faster than the 6. So people who bought the 6S last year can probably skip upgrading to the 7, but those holding onto a 6 and anything older will benefit from a tremendous performance gain.Apple also improved the iPhone cameras. Like the 6S devices, the iPhone 7 devices carry 12-megapixel sensors. The difference is that both the new iPhones include optical image stabilization, a feature that helps photos remain clear even when your hands are shaky. The larger model, the 7 Plus, also includes a second camera on the back. The two cameras work together to show the photo\u2019s main subject clearly while gently blurring the background.In my tests comparing photos taken with the iPhone 6S, 7 and 7 Plus, as well as a competitor, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7, photos taken with the 7 Plus had noticeably better detail when reviewed on a large computer monitor. But when reviewing photos taken with each camera side by side on a smaller smartphone screen, the differences were negligible.So while the new iPhones have great cameras, I wouldn\u2019t let that drive your buying decision. If you prefer a larger screen for reading and watching videos, consider the 7 Plus, but if you prefer something easier to carry in a pocket and type on using one hand, go for the 7. (The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch screen; the 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.)Lastly, Apple made changes to the new iPhones to improve durability. The iPhones are designed to be water-resistant. In my tests, they survived a swim in a water pitcher. The physical home button was replaced with a force-sensitive virtual one. It remains to be seen if the new home button will be more durable. In the past, one of the first components to wear out on older iPhones was the home button.There are two types of tech consumers: Those who upgrade on a fairly regular cycle (about every two years with smartphones) to embrace new technology, and those who upgrade only when they feel they need to.If you\u2019re in the former camp and own an iPhone that is at least two years old, the decision is obvious: The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are great upgrades. But if you just bought the iPhone 6S last year, the improvements will be incremental, and you may want to save your money for the next iPhone.If you\u2019re in the latter group, it\u2019s a tougher question. If you have, say, the four-year-old iPhone 5, you will see a great improvement with an iPhone 6S or a 7. Your decision may come down to how much the lack of a headphone jack and physical home button bothers you. Audiophiles with lots of wired accessories, for example, may find using a converter too inconvenient.But taking the leap to the 7 may be a wise bet, even for late technology adopters. Apple is likely to continue making iPhones without headphone jacks, and next year\u2019s iPhone will have a full-screen face with the virtual button built directly into the screen, according to two people at the company who spoke on condition of anonymity because the product details are private. Apple declined to comment on next year\u2019s iPhones.To compete with Apple, rivals may also eliminate the audio jack to make room for faster processors, better batteries and more durable parts. (A little-known fact: Lenovo beat Apple to removing the audio jack in its new smartphone, Moto Z, released this year.)Sooner or later, consumers will probably look back at the iPhone\u2019s puberty phase and accept that changes had to be made for the smartphone to mature. I, for one, am looking forward to a future with fewer wires.An earlier version of this article misstated a difference between the 6S devices and the iPhone 7 devices. Both of the iPhone 7 models will have optical image stabilization, as opposed to only one of the 6S models. It is not the case that neither of the 6S models had the feature.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Is Said to Be Discussing a Possible Takeover", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter has long positioned itself as a global town square where anyone \u2014 celebrities, politicians, athletes, and you and me \u2014 can chat in 140-character messages and find out about whatever is happening in the moment.But with that premise not drawing enough new people to the social media service, Twitter is now rethinking whether it can survive as an independent company and is exploring several strategic options.Twitter, based in San Francisco, is talking with Salesforce.com, Google and others about a possible takeover of the company, people briefed on the discussions said on Friday. The talks are in the early stages, these people said, with no guarantee that a deal will be reached. In particular, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, is resistant to selling to some of the potential acquirers, they said.Twitter is also weighing a possible revamping that could involve divestitures and layoffs, the people said. Two divisions that Twitter is considering divesting itself of are Vine, the mobile six-second video service, and MoPub, a mobile advertising business, they said. The company is working with the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen & Company on its options.For two years, Twitter has been casting about for ways to attract new users and to become a social media destination on the order of Facebook. While people initially flocked to Twitter, its new-user growth has slowed sharply as people complained about how difficult it was to use the service. At the same time, Facebook and its suite of offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger continued to outpace Twitter in user growth and profitability, while five-year-old Snapchat has become the newest darling of the social media world.Lack of growth also began to erode advertiser demand, which had remained robust even as Twitter\u2019s overall number of users stagnated at around 313 million people. Advertisers aiming for big audiences tended to choose Facebook, while those looking for younger audiences have the option of Snapchat.Twitter has endured internal turmoil and a revolving door of executives and board members. Mr. Dorsey, a co-founder who became permanent chief executive of Twitter almost a year ago, has vowed to turn it around by making it easier to use and by emphasizing real-time elements that could make it more essential to people.But after several false starts, critics are skeptical that these efforts will work.On Friday, how interested Google or Salesforce might be in buying Twitter, along with the identities of other possible bidders, became something of a parlor guessing game in Silicon Valley. Google\u2019s name has surfaced in the past as a logical buyer because of the internet search company\u2019s size and digital portfolio. Media companies have also been considered possible suitors.Why Salesforce might be interested in Twitter was a head-scratcher to some people. Salesforce is an enterprise technology company that focuses on businesses and not individuals, as Twitter does.But Salesforce has publicly expressed interest in owning a social network, which the company believes can bolster its main business of selling software and services to business clients. Many companies use Twitter to handle customer service requests and complaints, for example.Compared with its social media and internet peers, Twitter is more susceptible to a takeover because it has only one class of stock. Companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, have multiple classes of shares, which gives their founders tight control over their companies and guarantee independence.Twitter has $3.6 billion in cash on hand and $1.6 billion of debt, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. Microsoft paid a premium of nearly 50 percent for LinkedIn, although any sale of Twitter is unlikely to bring such a rich price.Leslie Picker and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Wearable Tech Deals, New Player Data Is Up for Grabs", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "Supported byThe University of Michigan football team took the field for its season opener on Sept. 3 accompanied by Michael Jordan, the team\u2019s honorary captain for the game, in uniforms bearing his signature Jumpman logo. Such pageantry is the fruit of a new apparel contract, worth about $170 million, between the university and Nike.But one significant aspect of the deal, among the richest in college sports, was not apparent to the crowd. A clause in the contract could, in the future, allow Nike to harvest personal data from Michigan athletes through the use of wearable technology like heart-rate monitors, GPS trackers and other devices that log myriad biological activities.The most ambitious projects are still on the drawing board. But at Michigan, a range of devices could eventually collect data including \u201cspeed, distance, vertical leap height, maximum time aloft, shot attempts, ball possession, heart rate, running route\u201d and other measurements, according to the contract.\u201cMy question is, how would players\u2019 interests be represented?\u201d Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist who runs the University of Southern California Center for Body Computing, said, noting that college athletes\u2019 designation as amateurs gave them limited leverage to influence such deals.Michigan\u2019s contract, obtained by several news media organizations, including The New York Times, stipulates that the data collection be anonymous and comply with \u201call applicable laws.\u201dBut privacy experts say those stipulations provide limited security given the threat of hacking and the lack of regulation in this area. The experts also say that the data, if matched to certain players \u2014 something the experts say could prove less difficult than it sounds \u2014 could harm their career prospects and, depending on what is measured, reveal intimate details.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of protections for players,\u201d said Tatiana Melnik, a health care lawyer, who noted that the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act applied to medical records but not biometric data like that covered by Nike\u2019s contract.She, too, said college athletes might lack say over how their data was used.\u201cHow does a player know you\u2019re not going to turn around and share this information with the N.F.L.?\u201d she said.The contract appears to give Michigan a degree of veto power, saying the data \u201cshall be subject to university approval.\u201dKurt Svoboda, an athletics department spokesman, suggested that was an important caveat.\u201cWe would evaluate each request on its own merits and utilize our approval rights in the best interests of U.M. and our student-athletes,\u201d he said in an email.A Nike spokesman, Josh Benedek, said in a statement that although the company had not yet collected athlete data under its college contracts, \u201cNike has a long history of securely measuring athlete performance, specifically through our Nike Sports Research Lab scientists.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to use athlete science to inform footwear and apparel advancements for performance and safety. We take athlete data, privacy and security seriously.\u201dThe quandary presented by wearable tech data in college sports extends well beyond Nike\u2019s deals with Michigan and Tennessee, which signed a contract with similar language in 2014.Catapult, an Australian company that uses GPS hardware to measure how hard an athlete has worked, has attained numerous American clients over the last few years, including Notre Dame and Florida State. In those cases, in contrast with the Nike-Michigan arrangement, the teams own the data, a Catapult spokesman said.The Michigan contract particularly alarmed some experts because of what they perceived as its broad latitude.Although it restricts collection of data to games, practices and other events where coaches or staff appear in official capacities and covers some measurements, like heart rate, wording in the contract leaves the door open to tracking many other attributes, like temperature and sweat production.Wearable tech, although still in its infancy, is booming, and companies are hunting for advancements.\u201cThere\u2019s an arms race for technology advancements,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a time in history in technology and athletics where the lines have blurred as much as now.\u201dChristine Sublett, an information security consultant who counts wearable tech and medical device companies as clients, was concerned about the potential for hacking.\u201cSomebody who is motivated and has the right tools \u2014 and we\u2019re not talking complex or expensive tools here \u2014 could get access to this data while it\u2019s in transit, or in storage where it hasn\u2019t been encrypted,\u201d she said.Hackers could use the data to influence sports wagering, knowing more about the physical condition of teams and possibly players.\u201cThis is a place where there\u2019s lots of money to be made, which means people will be motivated,\u201d Sublett said.Melnik, the health care lawyer, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a huge benefit to the player and the school \u2014 they can get treated faster, and potential long-term damage can be contained.\u201dThe primitive state of regulation and conversation in this area reflects the nature of smart clothing, which has barely been commercialized. But privacy and athletes\u2019 rights advocates worry the technology will outpace the adoption of legal limits and standards.\u201cI have to wonder if Michigan knows what they\u2019ve just done,\u201d said Katrina Karkazis, a bioethicist at Stanford.She added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve seen the size of the hornets\u2019 nest they\u2019ve hit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung to Recall 2.5 Million Galaxy Note 7s Over Battery Fires", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A ubiquitous source of power in most modern technology, lithium-ion batteries keep cellphones, laptops, electric cars and airplanes running. They are also the source of many problems, with some overheating, catching fire and even exploding.In a potentially damaging episode, Samsung, the world\u2019s biggest maker of smartphones, announced on Friday that it would recall its Galaxy Note 7 model after discovering a flaw in the battery cell that could result in fires. The company will replace 2.5 million phones sent to stores and consumers, in one of the industry\u2019s largest recalls.The recall puts Samsung, which has been trying to match the success of the Apple iPhone, in a precarious position.The smartphone industry is grappling with slowing demand and intense competition. Samsung was regaining swagger with its high-end phone models, like the Note 7, in which the screens appear to spill off the side.But the battery fires threaten to undermine Samsung\u2019s efforts, giving an edge to Apple. The recall comes just days before Apple is expected to unveil the latest version of its iPhone.The ultimate scale of the damage to Samsung\u2019s reputation and finances will depend on how quickly the company deals with the issues and how costly they turn out to be. Along with the expense of fixing the phones, Samsung could face lost sales if consumers grow wary of its products.Samsung said it expected that manufacturing replacement phones would take two weeks. Consumers who have already bought the phones will receive replacements before new phones go on sale, the company said. Samsung did not indicate the cost of the recall.\u201cIf you look at previous instances in tech history where there have been recalls, as long as it doesn\u2019t drag on to the point that the company becomes the butt of a joke, then it should be minor,\u201d said Bryan Ma, an analyst at IDC, a technology research firm.\u201cIf it becomes like a Pinto, where you don\u2019t want to buy it because it explodes, that would be a bad situation,\u201d he said, referring to the 1971 Ford car that became famous for erupting in flames after rear-end collisions. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ll get past it.\u201dSamsung said that, so far, 35 battery episodes involving the Note 7 had been registered. Reports of the problem first started to emerge online, as consumers posted photographs and videos of the charred remains of phones they said had burst into flames, usually while being recharged.Samsung said it thought the problem came from a \u201cminute flaw\u201d in the production of the batteries. Samsung would not name the supplier involved.The recall covers 10 countries where the phones have been sold. Samsung said the recall would not affect China, since the models sold there used a battery from a different supplier.\u201cWe acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market, but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest-quality products to our customers,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible.\u201dThe recall is a major blow to Samsung, which had just started to regain its competitive footing. The company faces pressures across its product line, with Apple on the high end and new Chinese brands on the lower end.Samsung was gaining traction with the latest Galaxy phones. The phones\u2019 smooth, tapered edges, which make them more comfortable to hold, have been a hit with consumers.In the second quarter, Samsung\u2019s global smartphone sales rose 5.5 percent from a year earlier while Apple\u2019s fell 15 percent, giving Samsung 22.4 percent of the market compared to Apple\u2019s 11.8 percent, according to IDC. While some of that growth came from Samsung\u2019s lower-end phones, IDC said that a significant part had also come from new demand for its higher-end phones, which contributed a disproportionate amount of profit.Samsung had high expectations for the latest Galaxy phone, which was released last month, to help continue the momentum.The Note 7 is 5.7 inches from corner to corner, making it a large phone sometimes referred to as a phablet \u2014 a combination of phone and tablet. It sells in the United States for about $900 to $1,000 without subsidies from a wireless carrier.The phones were released just ahead of Apple\u2019s traditional release time in autumn, before the important holiday shopping season. Apple is set to show off its latest iPhone on Sept. 7. With the new iPhone, Apple is expected to make major upgrades to both the hardware and software, as it generally does every two years.\u201cYou have to applaud Samsung for moving quickly,\u201d said Ben Wood, mobile analyst at CCS Insight in Berlin. \u201cBut they can\u2019t afford to miss the run up to the holiday season, so they have to fix this problem fast.\u201dLightweight and powerful, lithium-ion batteries are the go-to for technology, since they don\u2019t take up much room and can quickly recharge repeatedly without wearing out. But they are also far from perfect.The batteries, which include volatile and flammable chemical compounds, can become unstable if overheated or punctured. If that happens, the battery can burst into flames or explode.More recently, battery problems have cropped up with increasing frequency among lower-end devices. In America, airline companies began banning hoverboards from flights after it became apparent that some of the products would occasionally burst into flames. There have also been increased reports of e-cigarette batteries spontaneously detonating.Analysts, in part, attribute the issues to the low standards and few regulations in the global electronics supply chain that sprawls across China. As smaller Chinese companies have jumped at opportunities to make their own devices, some have cut corners, leading to a number of problems, including the occasionally combusting battery.For Samsung, the recall strikes at the heart of what has long been considered its greatest strength: its management of the supply chain.Samsung owns the facilities that produce many of the components in its smartphones \u2014 including screens, chips and batteries. The system allows it to keep closer tabs on production.Yet much like Apple, Samsung also manages a large network of suppliers.That means it must coordinate the production of a high number of parts that come from factories in disparate places run on tight margins. It must also double-check the quality of each product, which can be exceptionally challenging given that production processes are complex and factories are sometimes known to sacrifice quality for profit.\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is this comes from Samsung, who have such prowess and competence in manufacturing and supply chain,\u201d Mr. Ma of IDC said. \u201cYou would think this wouldn\u2019t happen to a company like that, but somehow it slipped through.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Su-Hyun Lee from Seoul, South Korea.

{"Headline": "Will the New Apple iPhone Have a Headphone Jack? Rumormongers Say It Won\u2019t", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 If Apple had its way, this week would play out like Christmas for 5-year-olds. First, unbelievable anticipation. Then, great surprise. At the end, immense satisfaction.Anyone who cares enough about the iPhone to know that a new model is being released this month already knows what it is supposed to be like: a little thinner, a little faster and equipped with superior cameras on the Plus model.By far the most controversial feature, however, is the one that will be missing: a headphone jack. A standard element of technology that can be traced back to 1878 and the invention of the manual telephone exchange, the jack is apparently going the way of the floppy disk and the folding map. The future will be wireless.We know about this potential absence thanks to a global information chain, one that shadows the supply and manufacturing chain that produces Apple\u2019s products. The shadow chain is intended to ferret out Apple rumors: promoting them, discussing them and then discussing them some more, long before they become facts.This rumor mill is both a gift to Apple and a burden, a sign that it has not lost its magic and a warning that everyone is on watch for the moment it does. No other company is tracked quite so relentlessly.Things have not quite worked out that way.\u201cWhen Steve Jobs was around, there was still that hope they could surprise you,\u201d said Gene Munster, an Apple analyst. \u201cToday, that hope is largely gone.\u201dFor anyone not ready to go wireless, the story said, wired earphones would plug into the iPhone via Apple\u2019s Lightning connector, which is typically used for charging power. Traditional headphones would presumably work through a converter.This was big. \u201cHeadphones are one of the most basic functions, so this is something that\u2019s going to affect users of all kinds,\u201d said Eric Slivka, editor in chief of MacRumors.com. \u201cI immediately knew it would be an extremely controversial topic all the way until launch.\u201d\u201cAny thinner and I\u2019ll lose it into the time-space continuum forever,\u201d one commenter joked.MacRumors exists for these kinds of moments. So does AppleInsider, Cult of Mac, 9to5Mac and similar sites in various languages, all of which picked up the news and chewed it over. During the next six weeks, helped along by further stories on Chinese blogs, the mainstream media picked it up as well.A Fast Company article announced that Apple would be dropping the jack \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s True,\u201d read the headline \u2014 and added that the iPhone would probably support wireless charging and be waterproof.Some commentators explained that even if people used adapters with their old headphones, they were gaining things, too. Other commentators noted that people complained that Apple never innovated anymore, and yet here it was innovating, and people were complaining anyway.Perhaps it is better to be forewarned about what the future holds rather than be forced to confront it abruptly. \u201cWe soften the blow,\u201d said Neil Hughes, managing editor of AppleInsider. \u201cCan you imagine that if no one saw it coming and Apple just dropped this on Wednesday? People would lose their minds.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ve reached peak iPhone,\u201d said Seth Weintraub, of 9to5Mac.But only for the moment. Even as the Apple faithful wait to see all these rumors confirmed, the scuttlebutt and speculation have started about next year\u2019s model. It will be the iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary, which means the stakes are going up.\u201cApple is hopefully turning on the development afterburners,\u201d Mr. Weintraub said. \u201cWe hear it wants the phone to resemble a sleek glass slab. It\u2019s supposed to be a statement, a really big deal.\u201dAssuming, of course, the rumors are true.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Kicks the Tires at McLaren", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsMcLaren\u2019s cars travel fast, but rumors about Apple acquisitions can flash by, too.Apple approached McLaren, which is based in Britain, about an investment or purchase, according to The Financial Times. The $610 billion Apple, though, has made few acquisitions, even to help it pioneer smartphones. While McLaren is a high-tech supercar and Formula One business, it is still hard to see it taking Apple\u2019s vehicular ambitions far.Apple executives might enjoy such a bauble. The design guru Jony Ive has a penchant for Aston Martins and Bentleys. Eddy Cue, head of software and services, sits on Ferrari\u2019s board. But Apple\u2019s typical market is far bigger than the rarefied one for $1 million automobiles. And the technology of designing racecars does not trickle down very fast \u2014 BMW retains an aura of tech leadership and refinement despite dropping its Formula One team years ago.Over the last year Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., has, according to reports, sniffed around the electric-car maker Tesla Motors, the entertainment giant Time Warner, the video-streaming site Netflix, the music service Tidal, the camera maker GoPro and the software producer Adobe. The spread of technology, Apple\u2019s lack of hit new products and its giant cash hoard \u2014 more than $230 billion \u2014 explain why both outsiders and some insiders might fancy and even start exploring all kinds of options.Perhaps the promise and challenges of autonomous electric cars will force Apple to change its habits. Even the dedicated carmaker Tesla, for example, used a Lotus-produced chassis and body for its first model. But the simpler explanation probably applies. Fancy can run free when a company has so much cash. A McLaren deal is probably already no more than a dot disappearing over the horizon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What if \u2018One Click\u2019 Buying Were Internetwide?", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Paying for things online can be cumbersome. Even the man who invented the web, Tim Berners-Lee, says he frequently throws up his hands.\u201cSometimes I will think that I bought something and I press the button, \u2018Buy this,\u2019 and I don\u2019t realize it didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said in a recent interview. \u201cWe are long overdue for a payments user interface for the web.\u201dResponding to the frustrations of Mr. Berners-Lee and hundreds of millions of online shoppers, the web\u2019s governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, has brought together the giants of the internet including Google, Facebook and Apple to fix the clumsiness of paying for things online.Now, a new global standard for online payments \u2014 a sort of Amazon one-click payment system for the entire internet \u2014 is being completed by the consortium and its members.Google, one of the authors of the standard, has recently introduced it in certain new versions of its Chrome browser. Other browser companies have said they intend to follow.The standard will provide a uniform way for users to input their credit cards and payment systems to any web browser so that they can be used for any purchase on the web. After the card details are entered once, they will automatically be called up as choices for all future transactions.This will be somewhat like the existing auto-fill functions that browsers have. But with the new standard, all the data fields will be filled in invisibly, requiring just one click.On the security side, rather than sending along all the credit card details, the browser will generate a one-time payment token that will avoid leaving your credit card number in countless databases around the world.Numerous efforts to modernize the payment system have failed to take off. And this one could fizzle, too, if online merchants, web browsers or consumers fail to adopt the new standard.The new standard will also face competition from the Amazons and PayPals of the world, as well as from the credit card networks, all of which want to be the primary destination for payments, rather than just one option.But payment analysts are hopeful about the new effort because it will not require consumers or merchants to use a new method of payment. Instead it will be equally open to any existing card or payment app, and it will channel them into a single place that most consumers already use \u2014 the web browser \u2014 where everything can be stored and used.\u201cInstead of simplifying the world, we have been fragmenting it into a million apps,\u201d said Eric Shea, a payments consultant at Kurt Salmon Digital. \u201cIf we can get back to that single integrated solution that everyone has on their phone and their desktop, that is the way to move forward and get adoption.\u201dDave Birch, a consultant who has been working on electronic payments for over two decades, said the web browser stood the best chance of providing a unified and more secure portal for payments.\u201cThere\u2019s a convergence going on,\u201d said Mr. Birch, who currently works for Consult Hyperion. \u201cIn the future you will have one experience \u2014 it won\u2019t matter if you are at the store or on the phone. It will pop up on your phone, you will put your thumb on it and you will be done.\u201dThe W3C project represents a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, the current giants of online payments. Both have gained business and fees with their more streamlined checkout processes.Neither company has participated in the current W3C effort and they are likely to continue to provide an alternative to customers who don\u2019t want to enter their details into their browsers.But the W3C has managed to bring in about 40 of the biggest players in online commerce, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and American Express as well as Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent.All met last week in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the specifications that they will introduce on different time frames to users around the world.In the version that Google released, when customers shopping at participating merchants hit the buy button, they are given a drop-down menu of their stored shipping addresses and credit cards.The customer can click on the address and card to be used, enter the three-digit security code on the card and hit \u201cpay now.\u201d Other browser companies may choose to use a fingerprint instead of the security code.\u201cWe wanted to remove what we jokingly call the Nascar effect of checkout, where you see five or seven logos for the different cards and payment methods you can use,\u201d said Zach Koch, the top Google executive on the project. \u201cThis is really fast, where a user can say, \u2018Tap, tap, buy.\u2019\u201dThe fees from transactions will still go to existing financial institutions like credit card companies and banks, unless customers choose a new online payment method like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. Apple Pay takes a piece of each transaction; Samsung Pay does not.But the bigger goal behind the W3C project is to create a standard, seamless and secure way to pay for things electronically in a future that will most likely include virtual reality stores, chat-based transactions and machines making payments to other machines (an autonomous car paying for a parking spot, for instance).The standard will also make it easy to include new payment methods like Bitcoin or the Chinese payment provider Tencent.\u201cThis involves quite radical changes to the way people think about payments,\u201d said Ian Jacobs, the W3C staff member leading the effort. \u201cAs a standards body it is our job to be sure it is an open playing field.\u201dThe need to create a better way to pay for things online was evident from the web\u2019s beginnings in the 1990s, Mr. Berners-Lee said. At some of the earliest meetings of the W3C, which he founded, there were discussions about creating a way to pay for things online that didn\u2019t require people to send credit card details over the internet.The failure to come up with a standard and secure way to do this led to the hodgepodge of payment screens consumers encounter today. It also made an opening for PayPal, which created a way for shoppers to pay on different sites using a single password.Mr. Birch said the main hurdle to accomplishing more seamless payments in the past was online merchants, who did not want to give up control over any part of the checkout process.But merchants have expressed increasing frustration with the high rate of abandoned online transactions and the frequency of credit card fraud.More than half of online purchases now happen on mobile phones, but Shopify has said that only 40 percent of the customers who start filling a shopping cart online finish their transactions.Shopify, which manages the online stores and checkout processes for 300,000 merchants, has been closely involved with the W3C effort and is planning to immediately offer the new standard to its merchants, as is Groupon.\u201cWe are betting a lot on it,\u201d said Jason Normore, the director of engineering at Shopify. \u201cEven though it cuts out a piece of our offering, it makes commerce better for everyone.\u201dApple will be one of the most interesting players to watch, given that it has both the Safari browser, which is part of the W3C effort, and Apple Pay, which could be seen as a competing offering.In the new operating system that Apple released last week, it is possible, for the first time, to shop online using the Safari browser and check out with Apple Pay. After hitting \u201cPay With Apple Pay,\u201d the customer is asked to provide a fingerprint on a phone, and the transaction is complete.The W3C standard will provide a similar experience on any browser \u2014 on a computer or phone \u2014 but will also allow customers to choose from any credit card or payment method they have entered into their browsers.Apple has so far been a part of the W3C group writing the standards, which will allow it to integrate non-Apple Pay choices into its browser.Mr. Berners-Lee said he hoped that more standardized payments would open up new types of online commerce that aren\u2019t possible now. He has long been interested in micropayments that would allow newspapers or small producers of content to be paid a few cents at a time, which isn\u2019t possible in a world with only credit cards.\u201cDifferent things call for different payments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are all interoperable you can separate the market for goods being sold from the payment back end.\u201dAn article on Monday about one-click shopping on the internet misstated the fee structure of one online payment method. While Apple Pay charges a fee on each transaction, Samsung Pay does not.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Is Said to Be Discussing a Possible Takeover", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "Supported byTwitter has long positioned itself as a global town square where anyone \u2014 celebrities, politicians, athletes, and you and me \u2014 can chat in 140-character messages and find out about whatever is happening in the moment.But with that premise not drawing enough new people to the social media service, Twitter is now rethinking whether it can survive as an independent company and is exploring several strategic options.Twitter, based in San Francisco, is talking with Salesforce.com, Google and others about a possible takeover of the company, people briefed on the discussions said on Friday. The talks are in the early stages, these people said, with no guarantee that a deal will be reached. In particular, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, is resistant to selling to some of the potential acquirers, they said.Twitter is also weighing a possible revamping that could involve divestitures and layoffs, the people said. Two divisions that Twitter is considering divesting itself of are Vine, the mobile six-second video service, and MoPub, a mobile advertising business, they said. The company is working with the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen & Company on its options.For two years, Twitter has been casting about for ways to attract new users and to become a social media destination on the order of Facebook. While people initially flocked to Twitter, its new-user growth has slowed sharply as people complained about how difficult it was to use the service. At the same time, Facebook and its suite of offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger continued to outpace Twitter in user growth and profitability, while five-year-old Snapchat has become the newest darling of the social media world.Lack of growth also began to erode advertiser demand, which had remained robust even as Twitter\u2019s overall number of users stagnated at around 313 million people. Advertisers aiming for big audiences tended to choose Facebook, while those looking for younger audiences have the option of Snapchat.Twitter has endured internal turmoil and a revolving door of executives and board members. Mr. Dorsey, a co-founder who became permanent chief executive of Twitter almost a year ago, has vowed to turn it around by making it easier to use and by emphasizing real-time elements that could make it more essential to people.But after several false starts, critics are skeptical that these efforts will work.On Friday, how interested Google or Salesforce might be in buying Twitter, along with the identities of other possible bidders, became something of a parlor guessing game in Silicon Valley. Google\u2019s name has surfaced in the past as a logical buyer because of the internet search company\u2019s size and digital portfolio. Media companies have also been considered possible suitors.Why Salesforce might be interested in Twitter was a head-scratcher to some people. Salesforce is an enterprise technology company that focuses on businesses and not individuals, as Twitter does.But Salesforce has publicly expressed interest in owning a social network, which the company believes can bolster its main business of selling software and services to business clients. Many companies use Twitter to handle customer service requests and complaints, for example.Compared with its social media and internet peers, Twitter is more susceptible to a takeover because it has only one class of stock. Companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, have multiple classes of shares, which gives their founders tight control over their companies and guarantee independence.Twitter has $3.6 billion in cash on hand and $1.6 billion of debt, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. Microsoft paid a premium of nearly 50 percent for LinkedIn, although any sale of Twitter is unlikely to bring such a rich price.Leslie Picker and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Car\u2019s New Software Is Ready. Update Now?", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsTIRED of your vehicle and its aging, limited features? Don\u2019t trade it in just yet. Download new software instead.In some cases, that is already possible. And over the next few years, as the already extensive software on modern cars becomes even more feature-rich and upgradeable, manufacturers mean to step up the effort. They plan to offer many types of improvements or repairs through downloads that are beamed directly to the car via satellite, Wi-Fi or cellular signal, without the vehicle\u2019s having to be brought into the shop.Eventually, your car will be serviceable like a giant smartphone, with new features added periodically while you sleep.A leading proponent of the approach is Tesla, the maker of electric luxury cars, which has been sending updates to its cars\u2019 operating systems since 2012. The company is expected to announce an updated operating system next week. The chief executive, Elon Musk, has said via Twitter that the update will include improvements to the company\u2019s Autopilot automated driving system.But Tesla is by no means alone in the download department. General Motors has been offering services and upgrades via the cellular-delivered OnStar entertainment and roadside-assistance system since 2009. G.M.\u2019s Acadia sport utility vehicle can now receive new apps for its entertainment system over the air.Other manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, send wireless uploads to update various in-vehicle apps, including maps and entertainment offerings like Spotify and Pandora.The number of vehicles on United States roads that can accept infotainment software upgrades will increase to 34 million in 2022 from one million now, the consulting firm IHS Markit predicts.\u201cThe advantages for automakers of doing over-the-air updates are too great to ignore,\u201d said Egil Juliussen, automotive analyst for IHS Markit. \u201cThey can keep their functionality up-to-date and get rid of bugs.\u201dTesla\u2019s upgrades have included an updated digital instrument panel, a revised touch screen, faster acceleration, activation of Autopilot and the ability for the vehicle to enter and exit a garage without anyone being in the car.\u201cSoftware updates to my Tesla are like Christmas,\u201d said Ankur Pansari of San Francisco. \u201cWhen I get them, I have a new toy to play with.\u201dAnd the automaker can save money. With cars and trucks increasingly reliant on complex computer code to operate, manufacturers can cut costs if they can correct or improve a vehicle\u2019s functions without having to get the car into a dealership.In November 2013, Tesla issued a software update to electronically raise the ground clearance of the Model S after a vehicle\u2019s battery pack caught fire when it ran over an object. A subsequent update gave the driver the ability to change the clearance at will.\u201cSoftware updates are extremely important to me,\u201d said another Tesla owner, Scott Wolf, a software engineer in Naples, Fla. \u201cKnowing there are new features and they can fix the car without having to bring it in \u2014 that\u2019s very impressive for an owner.\u201dFord, which previously provided software updates to its Sync infotainment system using a USB memory stick, will soon send software uploads to deliver Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality to its 2016 models equipped with its Sync 3 infotainment system. CarPlay and Auto replicate certain iPhone and Android smartphone features on the vehicle\u2019s display.Ford delivers the updated software via Wi-Fi, installing it when the vehicle is restarted. The company will eventually switch to making updates via satellite.Sending uploads will enable Ford to reduce the number of versions of its software. Instead of creating baked-in variants for each country, for example, Ford will be able to upload interfaces in different languages.\u201cWe absolutely believe in the promise of software updates,\u201d said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director of connected vehicles.Manufacturers are also looking at software downloads as a new source of revenue, turning on features remotely if the owner pays a fee. It would be similar to the way most new cars come with the hardware for SiriusXM satellite radio but require owners to pay a subscription fee.Tesla has already incorporated fees-for-features into its business model. While late-model Tesla vehicles are equipped with cameras and sensors to enable semiautonomous driving, this feature \u2014 Autopilot \u2014 requires a $3,000 to $3,500 software download to make it work.Owners of the Tesla S60 are also able to increase their vehicle\u2019s range by about 40 miles if they pay Tesla $9,000 to activate the feature through a software download.Other automakers see similar opportunities. \u201cThere are potential situations where one could buy a Ford with a base configuration, and then we could deliver an update for an \u00e0 la carte fee, or on a subscription basis,\u201d said Mr. Butler of Ford.Jason Hughes, a Tesla Model S owner and computer programmer in Hickory, N.C., did not like the speed restrictions and the need to keep his hands on the wheel that Tesla requires when Autopilot is used on the streets.Hacking into the software, Mr. Hughes removed those safeguards. Tesla declined to comment on whether such activity would void an owner\u2019s warranty. But Mr. Hughes runs the risk of having the restrictions restored when the next update is beamed down.A direct communications link between an automaker and its vehicles means the company has the capability not only to upgrade software but to monitor vehicle systems as well. Location, driving style and serviceability can all be tracked.Since May, G.M. has offered its optional Smart Driver technology to the three million customers who own vehicles with 4G wireless capability. The system tracks and analyzes driving characteristics, suggesting ways to improve fuel economy and reduce wear and tear. The company will also suggest that drivers with strong scores seek insurance discounts.Remote software updates will become particularly crucial as vehicles become more capable of driving themselves.\u201cSoftware upgrades will be almost mandatory once we move up to higher forms of autonomous driving,\u201d said Richard Wallace, a director at the Center for Automotive Research. \u201cThe artificial intelligence underpinning self-driving will require constant upgrading to deal with novel situations.\u201dIn the future, vehicle manufacturers might even refuse to assume liability for an autonomous vehicle that causes a crash but whose owner did not bother to accept an upgrade, said Lars Reger, the chief technology officer at NXP Semiconductors, a supplier to the automotive industry.For all the issues and opportunities posed by the upgradeable car, one business consideration might seem crucial for automakers: Will the ability to continually improve features and performance make the idea of buying a new car less enticing?Here, too, the smartphone analogy could prove apt, carmakers say.\u201cUltimately, satisfied customers will want an ongoing relationship with us,\u201d said Mr. Butler of Ford. \u201cAs with an iPhone, at some point the hardware will no longer be upgradeable. It\u2019s part of the world we live in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Driver? Bring It On. How Pittsburgh Became Uber\u2019s Testing Ground", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "Supported bySo with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber\u2019s unprecedented test? The answer is not much.There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don\u2019t know where the Uber cars will travel.It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley\u2019s boldest experiments \u2014 and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities.The mayor\u2019s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs \u2014 essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years.When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city\u2019s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-sharing services in 2014, Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor and the state\u2019s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh\u2019s politicians stay out of the way.The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber.But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber\u2019s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks.\u201cI feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,\u201d said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city\u2019s South Side neighborhood.\u201cThis is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that\u2019s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was \u201cfrankly surprised at how long a leash\u201d Uber got.Mr. Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and said the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal.\u201cThere is no technology that is fail-proof and there is no tech that can guarantee there won\u2019t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,\u201d he said.In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, \u201cOur work would not be possible without the support we\u2019ve received from city leaders.\u201dUber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own.By this decade, the university\u2019s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students.For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state\u2019s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed.Officials from Pennsylvania\u2019s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths.\u201cWe\u2019d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn\u2019t pursue this technology,\u201d said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.In Pittsburgh, Mr. Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Mr. Peduto\u2019s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Mr. Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Mr. Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission\u2019s proposed ban on ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Mr. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber\u2019s driverless cars.\u201cTravis\u2019s vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cWe shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.\u201dWeeks later, in a meeting with President Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Mr. Peduto urged Mr. Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh\u2019s intention to be a testing ground.Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber\u2019s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city\u2019s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers.Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber\u2019s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street.\u201cThere\u2019s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,\u201d said Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh\u2019s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so.Last month, Uber officially announced that the self-driving fleet would go into action in Pittsburgh. Mr. Peduto, who had been informed a few days earlier by Uber, sent a congratulatory text message to Mr. Kalanick. Uber\u2019s chief was in Pittsburgh at the time and invited the mayor to be the city\u2019s first driverless-car passenger.\u201cI feel fortunate that I have the ear of a C.E.O. of one of the biggest privately held companies,\u201d he said.An article on Sunday about Uber\u2019s introduction of self-driving cars to Pittsburgh misstated the surname of the city\u2019s assistant chief of police.

The European Union\u2019s decision takes direct aim at some of the country\u2019s generous tax policies, calling them illegal incentives in Apple\u2019s case.But it is a big payday to forgo, prompting criticism from left-wing lawmakers, government workers and even some local fans of Apple. European officials calculate that Apple\u2019s tax bill may rise to $21.3 billion when interest is included.The money would go a long way toward funding hospitals, schools and other social programs. At the height of austerity, Ireland cut government salaries by double-digit percentages, halted investment in public works and introduced a series of new taxes.In Cork, unemployment still hovers around 8 percent, or roughly the national average, after reaching highs of about 15 percent. Many young people still must emigrate in search of jobs.\u201cThat money could create at least 100,000 jobs,\u201d said Mick Barry, a Cork lawmaker from the Anti-Austerity Alliance, a small political party. \u201cIt would have a transformative effect.\u201dThis tug of war over Apple\u2019s money is part of a broader identity crisis in Ireland since the downturn.Much of the country\u2019s long-term economic growth has been tied to attracting international companies through low taxes and flexible working conditions. Almost 200,000 Irish workers, or roughly 10 percent of the total work force, are now employed by overseas companies, according to government statistics.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have a problem with government\u2019s appeal, but where were they during the financial crisis when Irish workers could have done with the same help?\u201d said Declan Connolly, 39, an information technology worker for Cork\u2019s local government.Almost a third of his colleagues have either been let go or not been replaced when they retired. Extra taxes on his income and pension have left him with roughly 10 percent less cash in his pocket.\u201cThe Irish government never did do as much for us as they are now doing for Apple,\u201d Mr. Connolly added.Cork, with a population of about 125,000, is a contradictory blend of Silicon Valley chic and Irish-style austerity.A Starbucks in a refurbished 19th-century building on the banks of the River Lee, which meanders though the city center, attracts a techie crowd of 20-something millennials, speaking languages as varied as Chinese and Czech. High-end stores like Tommy Hilfiger line the main thoroughfare, and luxury sedans carry tech and pharmaceutical executives to meetings.Yet only a few blocks away, where street stall vendors once sold fruit and vegetables, pawnshops and mostly empty casinos dot the streets. Posters at a government agency offer tips on how to deal with spiraling personal debt.A longtime port town, Cork in recent decades has made itself an attractive hub for multinationals. Companies can tap into a steady stream of graduates from the local university, along with lucrative tax breaks on any research and development carried out in the city. Rents are roughly half those in Dublin.Apple was at the leading edge of this movement, putting down roots in the early 1980s, when the company was a mere minnow in the tech world. Three decades on, Cork\u2019s suburbs are littered with newly built office parks, where glass-fronted buildings are emblazoned with logos from some of the world\u2019s largest companies, like Dell Technologies, Intel and Eli Lilly and Company.Apple, with its fortresslike compound, is one of the area\u2019s largest employers. Its army of over 5,000 workers has been a boon for the local economy, pumping in millions of dollars through income tax, rents and spending at fashionable restaurants and luxury stores.When Apple arrived, its workers mostly assembled computers and other devices. But as labor costs sent production to Asia, the company\u2019s Cork offices have now switched gears, mostly providing global customer and sales support.\u201cCork and Apple have stuck together through thick and thin,\u201d said Des Cahill, the city\u2019s mayor, who will meet company executives in San Francisco this week as part of an annual trade visit to drum up new investment. \u201cWe\u2019re like an old married couple.\u201dJust a few minutes\u2019 walk from Apple\u2019s main campus, Cork shows a different side. Austere concrete government housing stands crumbling in the late-summer sun. And social workers say many local residents stand little chance of landing well-paying jobs at Apple, mostly because of a lack of high-tech skills.For Charlie Harrington, a paramedic, the Apple tax standoff comes down to fairness.Like most people in Cork, Mr. Harrington, 53, said international companies \u2014 and the jobs they created \u2014 were more than welcome in the city. But he doesn\u2019t think tax rules are equally applied.When he recently refused to pay a new property tax, authorities took the money directly from his paycheck. If the government was so quick to penalize his small-scale tax avoidance, Mr. Harrington asked, then how could it protect Apple?\u201cIf the big guys don\u2019t pay and the government helps them, then everyone else will ask why we are paying too,\u201d he said over a cup of tea in a living room decorated with family photos. \u201cThey owe the money, so they should just pay it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Wearable Tech Deals, New Player Data Is Up for Grabs", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe University of Michigan football team took the field for its season opener on Sept. 3 accompanied by Michael Jordan, the team\u2019s honorary captain for the game, in uniforms bearing his signature Jumpman logo. Such pageantry is the fruit of a new apparel contract, worth about $170 million, between the university and Nike.But one significant aspect of the deal, among the richest in college sports, was not apparent to the crowd. A clause in the contract could, in the future, allow Nike to harvest personal data from Michigan athletes through the use of wearable technology like heart-rate monitors, GPS trackers and other devices that log myriad biological activities.The most ambitious projects are still on the drawing board. But at Michigan, a range of devices could eventually collect data including \u201cspeed, distance, vertical leap height, maximum time aloft, shot attempts, ball possession, heart rate, running route\u201d and other measurements, according to the contract.\u201cMy question is, how would players\u2019 interests be represented?\u201d Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist who runs the University of Southern California Center for Body Computing, said, noting that college athletes\u2019 designation as amateurs gave them limited leverage to influence such deals.Michigan\u2019s contract, obtained by several news media organizations, including The New York Times, stipulates that the data collection be anonymous and comply with \u201call applicable laws.\u201dBut privacy experts say those stipulations provide limited security given the threat of hacking and the lack of regulation in this area. The experts also say that the data, if matched to certain players \u2014 something the experts say could prove less difficult than it sounds \u2014 could harm their career prospects and, depending on what is measured, reveal intimate details.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of protections for players,\u201d said Tatiana Melnik, a health care lawyer, who noted that the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act applied to medical records but not biometric data like that covered by Nike\u2019s contract.She, too, said college athletes might lack say over how their data was used.\u201cHow does a player know you\u2019re not going to turn around and share this information with the N.F.L.?\u201d she said.The contract appears to give Michigan a degree of veto power, saying the data \u201cshall be subject to university approval.\u201dKurt Svoboda, an athletics department spokesman, suggested that was an important caveat.\u201cWe would evaluate each request on its own merits and utilize our approval rights in the best interests of U.M. and our student-athletes,\u201d he said in an email.A Nike spokesman, Josh Benedek, said in a statement that although the company had not yet collected athlete data under its college contracts, \u201cNike has a long history of securely measuring athlete performance, specifically through our Nike Sports Research Lab scientists.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to use athlete science to inform footwear and apparel advancements for performance and safety. We take athlete data, privacy and security seriously.\u201dThe quandary presented by wearable tech data in college sports extends well beyond Nike\u2019s deals with Michigan and Tennessee, which signed a contract with similar language in 2014.Catapult, an Australian company that uses GPS hardware to measure how hard an athlete has worked, has attained numerous American clients over the last few years, including Notre Dame and Florida State. In those cases, in contrast with the Nike-Michigan arrangement, the teams own the data, a Catapult spokesman said.The Michigan contract particularly alarmed some experts because of what they perceived as its broad latitude.Although it restricts collection of data to games, practices and other events where coaches or staff appear in official capacities and covers some measurements, like heart rate, wording in the contract leaves the door open to tracking many other attributes, like temperature and sweat production.Wearable tech, although still in its infancy, is booming, and companies are hunting for advancements.\u201cThere\u2019s an arms race for technology advancements,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a time in history in technology and athletics where the lines have blurred as much as now.\u201dChristine Sublett, an information security consultant who counts wearable tech and medical device companies as clients, was concerned about the potential for hacking.\u201cSomebody who is motivated and has the right tools \u2014 and we\u2019re not talking complex or expensive tools here \u2014 could get access to this data while it\u2019s in transit, or in storage where it hasn\u2019t been encrypted,\u201d she said.Hackers could use the data to influence sports wagering, knowing more about the physical condition of teams and possibly players.\u201cThis is a place where there\u2019s lots of money to be made, which means people will be motivated,\u201d Sublett said.Melnik, the health care lawyer, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a huge benefit to the player and the school \u2014 they can get treated faster, and potential long-term damage can be contained.\u201dThe primitive state of regulation and conversation in this area reflects the nature of smart clothing, which has barely been commercialized. But privacy and athletes\u2019 rights advocates worry the technology will outpace the adoption of legal limits and standards.\u201cI have to wonder if Michigan knows what they\u2019ve just done,\u201d said Katrina Karkazis, a bioethicist at Stanford.She added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve seen the size of the hornets\u2019 nest they\u2019ve hit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and Watch Updates: What You Really Need to Know", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "Supported byTech FixFor those wondering what to do with the plethora of information, here is what you really need to know: You need not rush to upgrade your iPhone or Apple Watch if you recently bought one. The people who may want to jump to buy one of the new devices are those who have owned their current iPhone for more than two years.Yet for all smartphone owners, the biggest change to the iPhone may be the omission of the headphone jack, a connector that many have been attached to for decades. Apple said it left out the headphone jack in favor of other benefits, like cramming in faster chips and a better battery.\u201cThe reason to move on comes down to one word: courage,\u201d Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for marketing, said on Wednesday. \u201cThe courage to move on, do something new that betters all of us.\u201dIf the headphone jack removal is the biggest change, that underlines how much of what Apple unveiled on Wednesday was incremental. So there is no need to stampede to an Apple store to snap up the new products when they become available this month, unless your gadget is so out-of-date that it is time to get with 2016.Here is what you need to know about Apple\u2019s new iPhone 7 and Apple Watch, with tips on how to prepare for the death of the headphone jack if you plan to buy a new Apple phone.So what is new? The iPhones have a new processor that is about 40 percent faster than the previous models. They also include a physical home button with force sensitivity for the first time, a feature that responds with a vibration when the button is pressed. As a result, the button no longer depresses when it is pressed, which might make it more durable than previous iterations.The new iPhones also include improved cameras capable of capturing a wider color range. The larger model, the 7 Plus, has two cameras on the rear that work together to improve zooming capability.Other than that, the iPhones will continue to come in silver, gold and pink, with two new colors: matte black and shiny black. The antenna bands, which were thick lines wrapping around the back of the older iPhones, are no longer visible on the new iPhones, making the devices look cleaner.The biggest change is the item that is missing: The 3.5-millimeter audio port for plugging in earphones and speakers. Apple says it sacrificed the port to make more room for faster processors and better battery life while making the device water and dust resistant.\u201cIt\u2019s all fighting for space within that same enclosure,\u201d Mr. Schiller said about the many components in a smartphone, including the headphone jack.The new iPhones will start shipping to customers on Sept. 16 with a starting price of $649 for the iPhone 7 and $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus. They can be ordered online beginning on Friday.What can consumers do about the removal of the audio jack? For many people, plugging in headphones has become a habit that helped turn their phone into a moving stereo or video player on their daily commute or at the gym.Coping with the change depends on the type of audio accessories you use. For consumers who want to cling to their wired audio gear, Apple is making the transition less painful by including a converter with the new iPhones. Basically, that is a dongle with a Lightning connector on one side, for plugging into the iPhone, and an audio port on the other end, for plugging in the audio accessory.So the good news: You won\u2019t have to buy new audio gear. But on the downside, you will have to carry a tiny, easy-to-lose dongle; replacements cost $9.The new watch, Series 2, is also faster than the previous one. It will start shipping on Sept. 16 with a starting price of $370.These are still incremental upgrades from the first version of the Watch. The biggest change is a new ceramic finish for the high-end version of Apple Watch, called Edition, which has a starting price of $1,250.Apple also revised the operating system powering the Apple Watch, called WatchOS. The new version, WatchOS 3, will introduce a more intuitive interface and be included with the new Apple Watch. WatchOS 3 will also be available as a free software update for the last Apple Watch.In the end, Apple\u2019s product event on Wednesday may have been more about theater than substantive changes to its devices.\u201cThe iPhone 7 packed few surprises,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research. \u201cThis event was a big test of Apple\u2019s ability to continue to tell a compelling story around its annual product upgrades.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Phone Makers Could Cut Off Drivers. So Why Don\u2019t They?", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "Supported byThe court filings paint a grisly picture: As Ashley Kubiak sped down a Texas highway in her Dodge Ram truck, she checked her iPhone for messages. Distracted, she crashed into a sport utility vehicle, killing its driver and a passenger and leaving a child paralyzed.With driving fatalities rising at levels not seen in 50 years, the growing incidence of distracted driving is getting part of the blame. Now a lawsuit related to that 2013 Texas crash is raising a question: Does Apple \u2014 or any cellphone maker or wireless company \u2014 have a responsibility to prevent devices from being used by drivers in illegal and dangerous ways?The product liability lawsuit, filed against Apple by families of the victims, contends that Apple knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Ms. Kubiak from texting dangerously. The suit is unlikely to succeed, legal experts said, and a Texas magistrate in August preliminarily recommended the case\u2019s dismissal on grounds that it was unlikely that lawyers could prove that the use of the iPhone caused the fatal accident.Ms. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. Her lawyer, Jason Cassel, said she now keeps her phone in the back seat.\u201cThe mere fact she\u2019s putting her phone in her back seat in her purse shows she realizes how tempting it is to look down when we get a beep, chime, vibration,\u201d Mr. Cassel said. \u201cShe never wants to be near the possibility\u201d of being tempted to answer it.The product liability case has brought to light a piece of evidence that legal and safety experts say puts Apple in a quandary \u2014 one it shares with other wireless companies. In Apple\u2019s case, the evidence shows, the company has a patent for technology designed to prevent texting while driving, but it has not deployed it.Apple, Verizon, AT&T and other companies caution about the risks of distracted driving \u2014 and they acknowledge that laws and public education aimed at curbing the behavior are not working. It suggests to legal experts that they can foresee that their product can be used for illegal, dangerous and sometimes deadly activity.AT&T even suggests that the behavior has addictive qualities, meaning drivers cannot help themselves. But the companies \u2014 though they offer manual ways to shut down texting on the road \u2014 do not deploy technology that takes the decision out of drivers\u2019 hands altogether.\u201cThe technology exists \u2014 we just don\u2019t have the stomach to implement it,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. In 2012, the safety board sent a letter to the wireless industry association urging the companies to prevent drivers from using their phones while driving.\u201cTechnology got us into this situation. Technology will get us out,\u201d she said. However, she added, \u201cWe\u2019re so afraid to tell people what they should do that you can kind of get away with murder under these conditions.\u201dGenerally, companies have taken the position that text-blocking technology is embryonic and unreliable. They argue that they cannot shut down a driver\u2019s service without the potential of mistakenly shutting off a passenger\u2019s phone or that of someone riding on a train or bus.Instead, companies have taken the approach of simultaneously warning and enabling, a mixed message that underscores a complex swirl of economic, technological and social factors. Perhaps the most pointed question is this: Even if the technology worked to perfection, would people accept having their service blocked? After all, the idea of mobile phone service is to let people communicate on the go.David Teater, formerly of the National Safety Council and now a private consultant on road safety, who lost his own son to a distracted driver, said companies clearly feared the consequences of cutting off service for their paying customers. It\u2019s an industry, he said, in which one of the most frightening words is \u201cchurn\u201d \u2014 meaning the loss of a customer to a competitor.\u201cIf you\u2019re at Apple or you\u2019re at Samsung, do you want to be the first to block texting and driving?\u201d he said. \u201cA customer might say, \u2018If Apple does it, then my next phone is a Samsung.\u2019\u201dBut to Mr. Teater, that\u2019s just an excuse. \u201cIf Apple had deployed this technology 10 years ago, there would be more people alive today,\u201d he said. \u201cThink about it from a parent\u2019s perspective: How would you feel knowing Apple had the ability to prevent your teen from ever texting and driving, and they chose not to?\u201dIn the Apple case in Texas, lawyers who brought the suit had unearthed a fascinating document: a patent filing that Apple made in 2008, which the lawyers said was granted in 2014, for technology that would \u201clock out\u201d a driver\u2019s phone by using sensors to determine if the phone was moving and in use by a driver. If so, it would prevent certain functions, like texting.In the patent, Apple says such technology is necessary because: \u201cTexting while driving has become so widespread that it is doubtful that law enforcement will have any significant effect on stopping the practice,\u201d and \u201cTeens understand that texting while driving is dangerous, but this is often not enough motivation to end the practice.\u201dIt is unclear whether Apple has developed the lockout technology.While texting is on the rise, people are increasingly driving and using Snapchat and Instagram, or taking selfies, or playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. The phone is at the center of all the activity.Apple says it has taken other steps to address distracted driving. Its CarPlay integrates with some cars so drivers can use voice commands to control some functions of the car and the phone, including letting them orally compose text messages and listen to incoming ones. The technology, Apple says, \u201callows you to stay focused on the road.\u201d\u201cWe discourage anyone from allowing their iPhone to distract them by typing, reading or interacting with the display while driving,\u201d Apple said in response to questions. The company did not directly address whether it could or should shut down phone functions. Rather, it indicated that the responsibility was with the driver.\u201cFor those customers who do not wish to turn off their iPhones or switch into Airplane Mode while driving to avoid distractions, we recommend the easy-to-use Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode features,\u201d the statement said.These approaches put the onus on drivers to make decisions each time they enter a car or receive a message. In addition, voice-activated systems raise other concerns, said David Strayer, an expert on driver attention at the University of Utah, who said he had studied CarPlay and the feature allowed drivers to perform some functions that could take their attention off the road.\u201cIt does not eliminate driver distraction \u2014 not even close,\u201d Dr. Strayer said.Technology is already on the market that can block a driver from having to make a decision. One company, Cellcontrol, sells a device that mounts on the dash and that uses high-frequency sound waves to identify a phone\u2019s location. If the phone\u2019s user is in the driver\u2019s seat, the device can lock out prohibited services.The $129 device, which looks like a small turtle shell, \u201cis very accurate,\u201d said Cellcontrol\u2019s chief technology officer, Joe Breaux. The hiccup is that the technology can sometimes turn off the phone of a passenger sitting behind the driver.Apple, in its patent, said it was developing \u201ca process in which hand-held computing devices can provide a lockout mechanism without requiring any modifications or additions to the vehicle.\u201d It would use motion and scenery sensors to determine if the phone was moving, and its location.By not putting the technology in place, Apple has \u201cfailed in their social responsibility,\u201d said Christopher Kutz, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, who specializes in the moral and legal principles of liability. \u201cThey should\u2019ve done it, and even done it at a market risk.\u201dHe likened the situation to that of gunmakers who could stop selling high-capacity magazines but choose not to.At the same time, Mr. Kutz said, there was little precedent for companies to shut off communications services for safety reasons. In other industries, he said, companies have taken such precautions \u2014 for instance, some manufacturers have technology that will shut down a machine if a worker does not keep two hands on it.In the case of distracted driving, Apple is not the only tech giant recognizing the dangerous behavior and not preventing it. Verizon, like Apple, suggests that current laws are insufficient. \u201cWhile text messaging is banned for drivers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, many people continue to do it, despite knowing the dangers,\u201d Verizon says on a site that promotes free apps and other services available for iPhone and Android that can detect if a phone is being used by a driver and prevent texting.The Verizon messaging app has a driving mode that, when in use, detects if someone is connected to a car\u2019s Bluetooth system and delivers an automatic response to the sender that the recipient is driving, said Kelly Crummey, a Verizon spokeswoman. However, the message still arrives on the recipient\u2019s phone, allowing the opportunity to check it, Ms. Crummey said.That technology suggests it is possible to identify a driver and apply the technology more broadly \u2014 to, say, social media \u2014 but Ms. Crummey said Verizon didn\u2019t have the same kind of control over Facebook, Twitter or other functions. Further, she said, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to turn off all phone functions, like maps or navigation, that drivers rely on.AT&T encourages the use of a free app, Drivemode, that can stop incoming texts. \u201cEveryone knows texting and driving is dangerous, yet when a text message comes in, it\u2019s difficult not to respond,\u201d AT&T says in promoting the app.Of course, services like these must be activated by the user and can be bypassed. And AT&T may have identified the reason such solutions don\u2019t work: People find themselves so drawn to their devices that elements of addiction are at play.In fact, AT&T commissioned research by an addiction expert who, in an AT&T news release in 2014, said that using a phone sets off releases of a neurochemical called dopamine that makes it hard to resist the ping. \u201cIf that desire for a dopamine fix leads us to check our phones while we\u2019re driving, a simple text can turn deadly,\u201d David Greenfield, who founded the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction, said in the AT&T news release.But if the behavior has addictive qualities, can drivers really be expected to police themselves? And should automated blocking be the answer?\u201cDistracted driving is never O.K.,\u201d AT&T said, adding that it had promoted \u201cIt Can Wait,\u201d a public service campaign to discourage texting and driving.CTIA \u2014 the Wireless Association, in its response to questions, said, \u201cLaws, consumer education and technology are pivotal, and we\u2019ve seen this three-prong approach work to stop people from this dangerous practice.\u201dIt hasn\u2019t worked well enough, some say.Apple, as one of the great cultural influencers, might have the power to change the conversation \u2014 to make it fashionable to choose safety over the rush of an incoming text, Mr. Kutz said.\u201cThey\u2019ve made themselves a norm maker,\u201d he said. \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Why Now?", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This is the year artificial intelligence came into its own for mainstream businesses, at least as a marketing feature.Salesforce chose this date to pre-empt Oracle, the world\u2019s largest business software company, which on Sunday evening began its annual customer event in San Francisco. High on Oracle\u2019s list of new features: real-time analysis of enormous amounts of data. Oracle calls its product Oracle A.I.There are big pushes in A.I. in agriculture, manufacturing, aviation and pretty much every other sector of the economy.It\u2019s all very exciting, the way great possibilities are, and clearly full of great buzzwords and slogans. But will other companies see any value in all this or understand if A.I. has value for them?\u201cNo one really knows where the value is,\u201d said Marc Benioff, co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cI think I know \u2014 it\u2019s in helping people do the things that people are good at, and turning more things over to machines.\u201dMr. Benioff wasn\u2019t selling Einstein\u2019s capabilities short. He was talking about the long-term value of artificial intelligence, which is passing through a familiar phase \u2014 a technology that is strange and new, that sometimes overpromises what it can do and is headed for uses not easily seen at the start.Cloaked inside terms like deep learning and machine intelligence, A.I. is essentially a series of advanced statistics-based exercises that review the past to indicate the likely future, or look at current customer choices to figure out where to put more or less energy.Perhaps a better question than \u201cWhat is the value?\u201d of this explosion of advanced statistics is \u201cWhy now?\u201d That shows both the opportunity and why many companies are scared about missing out.Much of today\u2019s A.I. boom goes back to 2006, when Amazon started selling cheap computing over the internet. Those measures built the public clouds of Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, among others. That same year, Google and Yahoo released statistical methods for dealing with the unruly data of human behavior. In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone, a device that began a boom in unruly-data collection everywhere.Suddenly, old A.I. experiments were relevant, and money and cheap data resources were available for building new algorithms. Ten years later, computing is cheaper than ever, companies live online and in their phone apps, and sensors are bringing even more unruly data from more places.Amazon, Google and the rest have exceptional A.I. resources for sale, but many older companies are wary of turning their data over to these upstarts. That, along with fear of a competitor getting on top of A.I. first, is a big motivation for some to try things out.Salesforce is selling Einstein as a system that can work predictive magic without having to look at your data, in what Mr. Benioff calls a \u201cdemocratizing\u201d move that will create millions of A.I. users who are not engineers.He said this on his way to attend a series of customer focus groups around the country, however \u2014 strong evidence that customers don\u2019t get it yet, even if they\u2019re willing to try it.\u201cThere\u2019s fear of Google and Microsoft controlling everything, and there\u2019s a desire to apply A.I. to anything that\u2019s digital,\u201d said Michael Biltz, managing director of Accenture\u2019s technology vision practice. \u201cPeople are going to have to experiment, most likely first on pain points like security and product marketing.\u201dHow will we know when the A.I. revolution has taken hold? A technology truly matures when it disappears. We don\u2019t marvel at houses with electricity now, or the idea of driving to work at 60 miles an hour. We can say \u201cphone\u201d and mean a hand-held computer with NASA-level processing power and a professional-quality camera for taking selfies with our drones.A.I. is probably heading for the same places, invisibly sorting through lots of data everywhere to continuously update and automate most of our lives. Goodness knows what the weird new tech thing will be about at that point.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Really Missing From the New iPhone: Cutting-Edge Design", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtForget about the headphone jack for a second.Apple has squandered its once-commanding lead in hardware and software design. Though the new iPhones include several new features, including water resistance and upgraded cameras, they look pretty much the same as the old ones. The new Apple Watch does too. And as competitors have borrowed and even begun to surpass Apple\u2019s best designs, what was iconic about the company\u2019s phones, computers, tablets and other products has come to seem generic.This is a subjective assessment, and it\u2019s one that Apple rebuts. The company says it does not change its designs just for the sake of change; the current iPhone design, which debuted in 2014, has sold hundreds of millions of units, so why mess with success? In a video accompanying the iPhone 7 unveiling on Wednesday, Jonathan Ive, Apple\u2019s design chief, called the device the \u201cmost deliberate evolution\u201d of its design vision for the smartphone.It\u2019s not just that a few new Apple products have been plagued with design flaws. The bigger problem is an absence of delight. I recently checked in with several tech-pundit friends for their assessment of Apple\u2019s aesthetic choices. \u201cWhat was the last Apple design that really dazzled you?\u201d I asked.Apple\u2019s design difficulties prompt two questions: How bad is this problem? And how can Apple solve it?The real danger is in Apple\u2019s long-term reputation. Much of Apple\u2019s brand is built on design and on a sense that everything it delivers is a gift from the vanguard.But in assessing the iPhone 6, then new, Mr. Vinh felt Apple had gone astray. Whereas the iPhone 5 had sharp, sophisticated lines that set it apart from everything else, \u201cthe iPhone 6\u2019s form seems uninspired, harkening back to the dated-looking forms of the original iPhone, and barely managing to distinguish itself from the countless other phones that have since aped that look,\u201d he wrote.That was in 2014. Now, two years later, we still have the same basic iPhone design. For years, Apple has released a redesigned iPhone every other year, but now we\u2019re going to go three years without a new iPhone look.And while Apple has slowed its design cadence, its rivals have sped up. Last year Samsung remade its lineup of Galaxy smartphones in a new glass-and-metal design that looked practically identical to the iPhone. Then it went further. Over the course of a few months, Samsung put out several design refinements, culminating in the Note 7, a big phone that has been universally praised by critics. With its curved sides and edge-to-edge display, the Note 7 pulls off a neat trick: Though it is physically smaller than Apple\u2019s big phone, it actually has a larger screen. So thanks to clever design, you get more from a smaller thing \u2014 exactly the sort of advance we once looked to Apple for.But the setbacks from Apple\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t likely to last.

But for owners of iPhones that are at least two years old, these are going to be major upgrades \u2014 if you find a way to cope with the lack of a headphone jack.Perhaps more important, Apple was trying to cobble together a credible story for the future from these incremental moves \u2014 that a wireless world is coming and that it will be the leader in that world.The problem for Apple is that the steps along the way to achieving its goals aren\u2019t always that exciting. This is one of those years: There are lots of incremental improvements, but nothing stands out as a must-have. Someday, Apple is telling us, all these increments will add up to something unimaginably amazing. Right now, though, the moves look puzzling \u2014 we really did not get a good defense for removing the headphone jack \u2014 and we may just have to live with the confusion.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a deep love for music,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt inspires us, and it\u2019s a key part of our product experience.\u201dMr. Cook said the company had 17 million subscribers after about a year for Apple Music and added that the music service would be the \u201cpremier destination for exclusive music,\u201d nodding to the idea that the company will use its huge war chest to lock up deals with artists.Apple also announced a new version of iWork, its suite of productivity apps that rival Microsoft Office and Google\u2019s productivity apps. The tweaked version of iWork will include real-time collaboration, meaning multiple people can work on documents and presentation slides at the same time. It\u2019s good that these changes are coming to iWork, but Microsoft and Google have been offering real-time collaboration tools for years already.But Apple has lately faced more competition from rivals, especially Google, whose cheap and simple Chromebook has become one of the most-used machines at schools. For both companies \u2014 and lately for other tech rivals, including Amazon \u2014 the education market functions as a gateway. Get them early, win them for life.The gleaming white finish is in some ways a return to the past for Apple. (Remember all those white computers from the early 2000s?) But beyond that, it\u2019s always interesting when Apple discovers a new material for use in its devices. You usually notice some new process or material start in one product and then wend its way throughout the company\u2019s lineup over a few years\u2019 time. In other words, three years from now, we may have all-white, ceramic phones. A man can dream, anyway.The addition of GPS gives the Apple Watch a slight edge against Fitbit\u2019s Blaze, a comparable smartwatch that lacks GPS. But until we get to try the software, it\u2019s tough to tell how the new Apple Watch\u2019s fitness capabilities will compare to accessories from Fitbit. Fitbit\u2019s products are popular partly because the apps are so well designed for monitoring health statistics, including footsteps, calories and weight. So GPS isn\u2019t necessarily the magic bullet.Removing the port for standard headphones means users now have to connect their headphones to the iPhone through the charging port.\u201cFrom the start we designed Lightning to be a great digital audio connector,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.The update may have its detractors in the days after the announcement, but Apple has a long history of making hardware changes that the industry eventually follows, including the decision to change floppy disk sizes in the old Mac days and, more recently, the decision to take away laptop ports. Apple will include new Lightning earbuds, and an adapter, in the box.Why remove the headphone jack, a technology that people seem to like? Mr. Schiller summed it up in one word: \u201cCourage.\u201dPerhaps more important than the earbuds themselves is the wireless technology Apple is using to power them. The company is using Bluetooth, and Apple says its chips improve the technology by connecting faster and using less power. If Apple has perfected a new, proprietary way of doing this, it could prove an important innovation for lots of future wireless products, including home devices, cars and wearables.I\u2019m sure there are minor differences \u2014 the antenna band is different \u2014 but it seems too rich to call it a new design. Too rich, except for Apple.One area where I do give Apple points on the iPhone is the focus on the camera. Apple made a strategic decision a few years ago to plow a lot of development resources into the iPhone camera. That has paid off: The iPhone\u2019s camera has long surpassed most other smartphone cameras, and for many people, it\u2019s better than most stand-alone cameras. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus continue that trend. The Plus model features two cameras, which allows for super-zooming. Even the smaller phone\u2019s camera includes features to improve your snapshots. If the pictures Apple showed off are any guide, the iPhone\u2019s camera is fast closing in on all but the most high-end of cameras. Look forward to more of those \u201cShot on iPhone\u201d billboards.An earlier version of this article misstated the technology Apple is using for its wireless earbuds. It is Bluetooth, improved in a way that Apple says will make it faster and less power-hungry; it is not the case that Apple is not using Bluetooth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ireland to Appeal Tax Ruling in Apple Case", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move comes despite increasing division among Irish ministers over whether to appeal the ruling issued by Europe\u2019s competition authorities.Several lawmakers have questioned such a move, given that the tax penalty is equivalent to what the country pays annually to fund its national health care system. That debate has intensified since Ireland has faced almost a decade of austerity after the financial crisis.Despite the tension, the Irish government unanimously backed the appeal against the tax ruling, though the country\u2019s Parliament will be reconvened on Wednesday to debate the decision.\u201cI believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland\u2019s interests,\u201d Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, said in a statement on Friday.A review of the country\u2019s corporate tax system will also be held to evaluate the complicated structures that multinational companies in Ireland often use to reduce their overall tax obligations. The review, whose details will be outlined in the coming days, will not look at the country\u2019s 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, one of the lowest in the West.\u201cWe need to ensure that Ireland\u2019s corporation tax code meets these new standards while remaining competitive,\u201d Mr. Noonan added, in reference to a push by governments worldwide to crack down on complex practices used by companies to reduce their overall tax payments.Mr. Cook, in an interview with the Irish broadcaster RTE, said Europe\u2019s tax clawback was political motivated, \u201cmaddening\u201d and would be overturned on appeal.\u201cThe finding is wrongheaded,\u201d Mr. Cook told RTE. \u201cIt\u2019s not true: There wasn\u2019t a special deal between Ireland and Apple.\u201dA spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.This week\u2019s ruling over how Ireland treated Apple and its tax practices has led to an increasingly bitter debate between Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top competition official, and those who argue that her agency has overstepped its remit. Many have claimed that the commission does not have the right to review national tax rules, and that it should not retroactively decide on how certain tax practices should work.\u201cAll of us benefit when businesses pay their fair share of tax,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the interest of the individuals and businesses who do pay tax, if others aren\u2019t paying their share.\u201dThe appeals by the Irish government and Apple are expected to last years. Mr. Cook has said the tech giant will set aside money \u2014 based on the calculations of Apple\u2019s back taxes \u2014 in an escrow account if the court eventually sides with the commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Pui-Wing\u2019s Week in Tech: Yahoo\u2019s Hacking, Self-Driving Cars and the Future of Twitter", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsA few things stand out to me about this attack. It\u2019s obviously terrible for everyone whose information has been breached, and it also comes at a terrible time for Yahoo, which is in the process of selling most of its assets to Verizon. What happens to that sale, now, seems in question; this sort of disclosure could affect aspects of the deal, including the price. After all, although Yahoo has long been in decline, the company still has a loyal user base that has stuck with it for email and other web services. To the extent that those people are scared away by this breach, Verizon may well want to reconsider.What do you think? Are the endless Yahoo acquisition talks going to get even more endless now?But it\u2019s unclear how that might affect the price of the deal, or if Verizon will walk away from Yahoo. Hackings now happen all the time and to almost every corporate entity. So Verizon couldn\u2019t very well build in an escape clause on a deal for an industrywide problem, though it may have some leverage to chip away at price or some other deal conditions.All I know is that a horde of lawyers and investment bankers must be getting well paid right now to figure it all out.I suspect that like me, you\u2019ve noticed a huge change in Silicon Valley recently. From Uber to Tesla to Google to Apple, much of the industry has become obsessed with cars. Where we used to talk about smartphones and apps, we now talk about electric engines, location mapping and ride sharing.I\u2019m personally gratified to see this happening; cars are expensive, inefficient and environmentally problematic, exactly the sort of big challenge that techies want to fix. But I\u2019ve also heard grumbling both inside and outside the Valley that companies here are biting off more than they can chew in attacking the auto industry. Do you agree?Did I really just say that? Eyeroll.Finally, let\u2019s talk about my favorite pastime, Twitter. Several big things happened with the slow-growing 140-character social network. First, the 140 characters got a bit looser. As of this week, when you add images, links or other multimedia elements to your tweet, they won\u2019t count against the character limit. In other words, tweets got just a bit longer.These deals are something of a strategy shift for the company. It\u2019s looking to become a kind of TV network, the place you\u2019ll turn to first when you want to watch something. I think this is a great idea. Livestreaming sports, awards shows and other news events can be a hassle today \u2014 you\u2019ve got to find a link, usually log in with your cable-company account, and then you\u2019re often presented with some slow, blurry stream that makes you tear your hair out. Twitter, thankfully, is trying to solve this. It could be pretty handy.But it also seems a little bit of an odd game plan to save the company, right?But for now at least, I don\u2019t see it. The 13-year-olds are into Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest, even Musical.ly. Twitter? Not on their radar screen.Maybe Twitter needs to try something else, like making money off how brands use it for customer service. That sounds incredibly enterprise-y, but those boring businesses are often more predictable and profitable.Google isn\u2019t surprising. We\u2019ve heard rumors for years that the search company, which has perennially failed at building social apps, is interested in the microblogging network. But an acquisition by Salesforce is a stranger idea. I don\u2019t immediately get how it would work, and there\u2019s a very high chance that a business-focused cloud company could ruin the freewheeling network. But if Salesforce thinks of some out-of-the-box way to use Twitter as a customer service and lead-generation network, that could be lucrative.Anyway, thanks for joining me! I hope you spend the weekend bracing for Mike\u2019s return. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A High-Stakes Bet: Turning Google Assistant Into a \u2018Star Trek\u2019 Computer", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtGoogle is one of the most valuable companies in the world, but its future, like that of all tech giants, is clouded by a looming threat. The search company makes virtually all of its money from ads placed on the World Wide Web. But what happens to the cash machine if web search eventually becomes outmoded?That worry isn\u2019t far-fetched. More of the world\u2019s computing time keeps shifting to smartphones, where apps have supplanted the web. And internet-connected devices that may dominate the next era in tech \u2014 smartwatches, home-assistant devices like Amazon\u2019s Echo, or virtual reality machines like Oculus Rift \u2014 are likely to be free of the web, and may even lack screens.But if Google is worried, it isn\u2019t showing it. The company has long been working on a not-so-secret weapon to avert its potential irrelevance. Google has shoveled vast financial and engineering resources into a collection of data mining and artificial intelligence systems, from speech recognition to machine translation to computer vision.But Google has much grander aims for the Assistant. People at the company say that Sundar Pichai, who took over as Google\u2019s chief executive last year after Google was split into a conglomerate called Alphabet, has bet the company on the new tech. Mr. Pichai declined an interview request for this column, but at Google\u2019s developer conference in May, he called the development of the Assistant \u201ca seminal moment\u201d for the company.If the Assistant or something like it does not take off, Google\u2019s status as the chief navigator of our digital lives could be superseded by a half-dozen other assistants. You might interact with Alexa in your house, with Siri on your phone, and with Facebook Messenger\u2019s chatbot when you\u2019re out and about. Google\u2019s search engine (not to mention its Android operating system, Chrome, Gmail, Maps and other properties) would remain popular and lucrative, but possibly far less so than they are today.The Assistant, in Google\u2019s most far-out vision, would always be around, wherever you are, on whatever device you use, to handle just about any informational task.Consider this common situation: Today, to book a trip, you usually have to load up several travel sites, consult your calendar and coordinate with your family and your colleagues. If the Assistant works as well as Google hopes, all you might have to do is say, \u201cO.K., Google, I need to go to Hong Kong next week. Take care of it.\u201dBased on your interactions with it over the years, Google would know your habits, your preferences and your budget. It would know your friends, family and your colleagues. With access to so much data, and with the computational power to interpret all of it, the Assistant most likely could handle the entire task; if it couldn\u2019t, it would simply ask you to fill in the gaps, the way a human assistant might.Computers have made a lot of everyday tasks far easier to accomplish, yet they still require a sometimes annoying level of human involvement to get the most out of them. The Assistant\u2019s long-term aim is to eliminate all this busywork.If it succeeds, it would be the ultimate expression of what Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, once described as the perfect search engine: a machine that \u201cunderstands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want.\u201dAt this point, a few readers may be recoiling at the potential invasion of autonomy and privacy that such a machine would necessitate.The Assistant would involve giving ourselves over to machines more fully. We would trust them not just with our information but increasingly with our decisions. Many people are already freaked out by what Google, Facebook and other tech companies know about us. Would we be willing to hand over even more power to computers?Those are important questions, but they are also well down the road. For now, the more pressing question for the Assistant is: Will it even work?Google has technological advantages that suggest it could build a more capable digital assistant than others have accomplished. Many of the innovations that it has built into its search engine \u2014 including its knowledge graph database of more than a billion people, places and things, and the 17 years it has spent trying to understand the meaning of web queries \u2014 will form the Assistant\u2019s brain.Google has also been one of the leaders in machine learning, the process that allows computers to discover facts about the world without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is at the heart of a number of recent advances, including Google Photos\u2019 uncanny capacity to search through your images for arbitrary terms (photos of people hugging, for instance).\u201cWe are in the process of transforming into a machine-learning company,\u201d Jeff Dean, who is in charge of Google Brain, the company\u2019s artificial intelligence project, told me this year. For each problem Google solves this way, it gets better at solving other problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a boulder going downhill gathering more momentum as it goes,\u201d Mr. Dean said.That\u2019s an amazing technological feat. But as Brian pointed out, it\u2019s also pretty useless. Why does your friend care if you know his dog\u2019s a Shih Tzu?This gets to a deeper difficulty. The search company might have the technical capacity to create the smartest assistant around, but it\u2019s not at all clear that it has the prowess to create the friendliest, most charming or most useful assistant. Google needs to nail not just Assistant\u2019s smarts, but also its personality \u2014 a new skill for Google, and one that its past forays into social software (Google Plus, anyone?) don\u2019t speak highly of.\u201cWhen I was trying to book a movie, it didn\u2019t really narrow things down for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there were some times it was wrong. I asked it to show me my upcoming trip, and it didn\u2019t get that.\u201dOf course, it\u2019s still early. Mr. Sullivan has high hopes for the Assistant. It would be premature to look at the technology today and get discouraged about its future, especially since Google sees this as a multiyear, perhaps even decade-long project. And especially if Google\u2019s future depends on getting this right.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Moves Toward a Wireless Future, One Tweak at a Time", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "Supported byA big step in that direction is the removal of a headphone jack from the latest version of the iPhone, called the iPhone 7.\u201cBasically, Apple has shifted from one killer feature per upgrade, such as a larger screen, to a variety of compelling improvements that will appeal to a range of buyers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research.For more than a decade, Apple has experienced explosive revenue and earnings growth thanks to new hit products, including the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. That streak stopped with the release of the Apple Watch last year, though executives maintain that sales have exceeded expectations.But there are probably plenty more dollars to be wrung from Apple\u2019s existing products. This update to the iPhone has been a cause for excitement \u2014 and controversy \u2014 among Apple fans.Removing the port for headphones from the iPhone means they now connect only wirelessly or through a charging port. The redesign also encourages users to upgrade to Apple\u2019s new wireless earbuds, AirPods, which cost $160.While the updates to the iPhone were incremental, Apple executives hinted that the iPhone changes were part of a companywide effort to wirelessly connect everything inside a home. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, explained how his company\u2019s technology could be the central way to control all sorts of home wireless devices.\u201cThis is Apple\u2019s way of saying that someday the smartphone experience will be wireless,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. But will it be enough to reignite iPhone sales? \u201cNot by itself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this along with the other tech upgrades like cameras and processors should drive high interest for those needing to upgrade, as well as draw interest by new customers too.\u201dTalk about a wireless future had people already looking toward big changes that could be in store for next year, the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and beyond. Mr. Bajarin, for example, expects Apple to introduce wireless charging to the iPhone in the near future. Should wireless connections become a bigger part of Apple\u2019s future, it is not a leap to imagine closer integration between the company\u2019s various devices and its software meant for cars, called CarPlay.This isn\u2019t the first time Apple has risked angering customers by moving away from a traditional design. Its desktop computers accommodated a 3\u00bd-inch disk, rather than the standard 5\u00bc-inch floppy disk; and more recently it eliminated the CD drive and several ports from its laptops. Some customers considered those changes shocking, even downright hostile acts. They got over it.\u201cApple has a history of doing what it wants and making people believe that it\u2019s the best idea ever,\u201d said Julie A. Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cThe company has an affluent customer base that has in the past paid to upgrade because it cares about the quality of the experience.\u201dOther cosmetic changes were made to the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which look much like their predecessors and will have starting prices of $650 and $770. The phones will come in new colors, including a shiny, jet black and matte black, in addition to the existing options of silver, gold and rose gold.Apple also unveiled an updated version of the Apple Watch that includes GPS tracking, which would make it more appealing to runners. It has a faster operating system that lets apps work more quickly and could make performing some tasks easier on the watch than on an iPhone. The Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $370. And the original Apple Watch, rebranded Apple Watch Series 1, starts at $270.The company emphasized that the Apple Watch was a useful tool for monitoring health, one of the few functions that users have embraced, and announced a partnership with Nike. It also made the new version water-resistant and added tracking for swimmers.\u201cThe watch is still missing a killer app,\u201d Ms. Ask said, noting that some of the functions that the Apple Watch performs especially well, such as payments, have not taken off.The Apple Watch still accounts for such a tiny portion of the company\u2019s revenue that Apple doesn\u2019t break out the number when it reports quarterly earnings. But Mr. Cook revealed on Wednesday that Apple was now the No. 2 global watch brand, measured by revenue, behind Rolex, and that Apple\u2019s was the top-selling smartwatch.The overall market for wearable devices is growing. In the United States, 63.7 million adults, or about a quarter of the population, use a wearable device. That number is expected to increase by more than 17 percent next year to 74.8 million adults, according to the research firm eMarketer.Apple has grown increasingly dependent on software and services for growth. On earnings calls with analysts, the company has emphasized the role that software and services play in keeping customers hooked on Apple\u2019s products. Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, estimates that services such as Apple Music account for nearly one-third of Apple\u2019s quarterly profits.Mr. Cook underscored that idea at the event with updates on Apple Music and the App Store. Mr. Cook said that Apple Music had 17 million subscribers and that the company would work to nail down more exclusive deals with artists. He also said that the hit game Super Mario would come to the App Store and that Pok\u00e9mon Go would be available on the Apple Watch.Advertisement"}

The case, she said, would stand up in court.\u201cI don\u2019t think the courts will hear any kind of political opinions or feeling or what\u2019s in your stomach or whatever,\u201d she said at a briefing in Brussels. \u201cThey want the facts of the case, and that, of course, is what we have to produce.\u201dAmerican lawmakers and officials are firm that the European Commission, the executive arm of the bloc, does not have the right to go after Apple in this way. American officials said such moves by Europe undermined efforts to collect taxes in the United States, which has been eyeing companies\u2019 overseas cash, including Apple\u2019s $215 billion stockpile.In the past, Apple has dangled the prospect of bringing back its cash if American authorities offered a tax break. Mr. Cook, in the interview on Thursday, did not say whether the so-called repatriation of such funds would hinge on changes to American tax law.In regard to the European case, Mr. Cook said Apple would set aside funds \u2014 based on the calculations of back taxes \u2014 in an escrow account should it lose its appeal. Europe has ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros, or $14.5 billion, plus interest.Still, Mr. Cook, like American officials, took issue with Europe\u2019s retroactively issuing penalties. He said that while it was legitimate to discuss whether Apple paid sufficient tax on its global operations, it was unfair to recoup funds on past activities in Ireland.\u201cThe European Commission\u2019s overreach in this regard is unbelievable to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing a sports game or winning a championship, and then later finding out the goals are subsequently treated differently.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Salesforce.com has also suggested that the deal would give Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals by combining its own software services with the information held by the social network, two of the people said.The comments came in response to a questionnaire sent by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, a step that allows interested third-party companies, including competitors, to comment on prospective takeovers.Salesforce.com\u2019s concerns do not necessarily mean that Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, the region\u2019s tough antitrust chief, will open an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s purchase of LinkedIn, though on Thursday she raised her own questions about how digital data should be treated in future competition cases.Ricardo Cardoso, a European Commission spokesman, declined to comment on Salesforce.com\u2019s response to the competition questionnaire.A Microsoft spokeswoman, Jennifer Crider, declined to comment on the European Commission questionnaire, though she said the company had already received antitrust clearance in the United States and Canada and was working with other global authorities on similar approval. The company has yet to submit its LinkedIn deal to European competition authorities, but it is likely to do so by early November, at the latest.\u201cWe expect to close before the end of this calendar year,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement on Thursday.A Salesforce.com spokeswoman, Chi Hea Cho, said the company had been contacted by the European Commission as part of its review of the proposed deal. The company also made similar efforts in the United States to highlight the potential competition problems with the deal, but it failed to win over American authorities, said another person with knowledge of the matter.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, was dismissive of the complaints from Mr. Benioff\u2019s company.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to continue working to bring price competition to a C.R.M. market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices today,\u201d said Mr. Smith, using the initials for customer relationship management, the software category in which Salesforce is the leader.While Salesforce.com\u2019s criticism of the acquisition could appear to be just sour grapes after it lost out on buying LinkedIn, its questions about how Microsoft\u2019s control of data would potentially hinder rivals are gaining traction with some European officials.One possibility would be for Microsoft to combine LinkedIn\u2019s information on people\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and messaging activity on the social network with its own Office software, providing the tech giant with an advantage over rivals offering similar services. In previous statements, Microsoft said its own offerings did not overlap with LinkedIn\u2019s and that competing services like Facebook, which also collect large amounts of data, also existed.Similar data-related concerns were raised in Europe when Facebook bought WhatsApp, the messaging app, in 2014 for $19 billion. The region\u2019s authorities have been regularly criticized, particularly by European telecommunications operators, for approving that deal despite complaints that it would limit consumer choice.\u201cThe questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly, on second reference, to a Microsoft spokeswoman.

The $610 billion Apple, though, has made few acquisitions, even to help it pioneer smartphones. While McLaren is a high-tech supercar and Formula One business, it is still hard to see it taking Apple\u2019s vehicular ambitions far.Apple executives might enjoy such a bauble. The design guru Jony Ive has a penchant for Aston Martins and Bentleys. Eddy Cue, head of software and services, sits on Ferrari\u2019s board. But Apple\u2019s typical market is far bigger than the rarefied one for $1 million automobiles. And the technology of designing racecars does not trickle down very fast \u2014 BMW retains an aura of tech leadership and refinement despite dropping its Formula One team years ago.Over the last year Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., has, according to reports, sniffed around the electric-car maker Tesla Motors, the entertainment giant Time Warner, the video-streaming site Netflix, the music service Tidal, the camera maker GoPro and the software producer Adobe. The spread of technology, Apple\u2019s lack of hit new products and its giant cash hoard \u2014 more than $230 billion \u2014 explain why both outsiders and some insiders might fancy and even start exploring all kinds of options.Perhaps the promise and challenges of autonomous electric cars will force Apple to change its habits. Even the dedicated carmaker Tesla, for example, used a Lotus-produced chassis and body for its first model. But the simpler explanation probably applies. Fancy can run free when a company has so much cash. A McLaren deal is probably already no more than a dot disappearing over the horizon.Advertisement"}

Most other outlets give you several people\u2019s perspectives on a story, usually second hand. On Snapchat, you see dozens of people\u2019s snaps showing different parts of a story \u2014 in this case people showing their homes getting flooded, going to shelters, dealing with the aftermath. It was an incredibly emotionally resonant way to depict the kind of news story that can otherwise seem remote.Also, it\u2019s fun to take pictures of my face as a bee.I think this is a good, necessary and long overdue thing. I\u2019ve had many friends tell me of their continuous rejections on Airbnb. Here\u2019s to hoping it actually curbs the discrimination.One big test of success here \u2014 other than sales \u2014 will be what other smartphone manufacturers do now. If we suddenly start seeing the headphone jack disappearing from all high-end phones, Apple will have won the argument.Speaking of Nintendo, today I\u2019d like to focus on something that got a little bit less attention during the Big Apple keynote: Super Mario.Yes, that\u2019s right, the world\u2019s most beloved plumber is coming to the iPhone rather soon \u2014 before the end of the year, Nintendo said \u2014 in the Japanese video game giant\u2019s first ever Mario franchise on iOS. It\u2019s called Super Mario Run, and it\u2019s a neat-looking side-scroller you can play with one hand, even on the subway.This is a watershed moment for Nintendo, long considered a laggard in its approach to mobile gaming. As you may well know, the advent of the iPhone \u2014 and Android \u2014 was kind of a big deal. The mass adoption of smartphones upended entire industries, like GPS navigation companies, mapping sites, and yes, even video game makers. More and more people who once looked to consoles, desktop PCs or even hand-held devices to get their gaming fix are now playing iPhone games, downloading them directly from the app store without the hassle of going to buy a new video game DVD or another console.That\u2019s a massive shift in a mega-market, something that came virtually overnight. And Nintendo, the world\u2019s pre-eminent legacy video game company, has really struggled to recalibrate.I take this Mario thing as a big deal. But tell me your thoughts on the matter.But really the deeper story here is that smartphones are unstoppable. Everyone in tech keeps looking for the next big thing, but to me the biggest story in tech continues to be the way smartphones keep swallowing up every other gadget. The best smartphone cameras are now much better than any snapshot camera you can buy, and for most people, a phone is the only camera they need. The Nintendo announcement shows that phones have now completely consumed mobile gaming, too.My own prediction: TV is next. Last night I watched the first episode of Season 2 of \u201cNarcos\u201d on my phone.Have a great vacation, Mike!Advertisement"}

Sometimes friends become enemies. Enemies become friends. And \u201cfrenemies\u201d stay somewhere in between \u2014 just don\u2019t share a secret with them.So it is with Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company and arguably the most influential company in the tech industry, and Uber, the still young ride-hailing service that also happens to be one the most valuable privately held companies in the world.There may have been a time when Google and Uber were friends. GV, the current name of Alphabet\u2019s investment arm, invested in Uber, after all. Uber certainly benefited from working with Google\u2019s mobile operating system, and it has long used Google\u2019s maps (though it is working on its own now).But somewhere along the way, the two started to drift apart. Google has been working on a self-driving-car project for years and has been testing the vehicles on the streets of Silicon Valley. Last year, Uber hired some of the best minds in the autonomous-vehicle world from Carnegie Mellon University and created its own self-driving-car research center.And last week, Uber acquired a self-driving-truck start-up founded and heavily populated by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 former Google employees. To top it off, Uber plans to start testing self-driving Uber cars in Pittsburgh next month.Google has a history of executives who serve on the boards of companies that could soon be competitors, of course. Eric E. Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, was a member of Apple\u2019s board when his company was developing Android, a direct competitor to the Apple iPhone.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Really Missing From the New iPhone: Cutting-Edge Design", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtForget about the headphone jack for a second.Apple has squandered its once-commanding lead in hardware and software design. Though the new iPhones include several new features, including water resistance and upgraded cameras, they look pretty much the same as the old ones. The new Apple Watch does too. And as competitors have borrowed and even begun to surpass Apple\u2019s best designs, what was iconic about the company\u2019s phones, computers, tablets and other products has come to seem generic.This is a subjective assessment, and it\u2019s one that Apple rebuts. The company says it does not change its designs just for the sake of change; the current iPhone design, which debuted in 2014, has sold hundreds of millions of units, so why mess with success? In a video accompanying the iPhone 7 unveiling on Wednesday, Jonathan Ive, Apple\u2019s design chief, called the device the \u201cmost deliberate evolution\u201d of its design vision for the smartphone.It\u2019s not just that a few new Apple products have been plagued with design flaws. The bigger problem is an absence of delight. I recently checked in with several tech-pundit friends for their assessment of Apple\u2019s aesthetic choices. \u201cWhat was the last Apple design that really dazzled you?\u201d I asked.Apple\u2019s design difficulties prompt two questions: How bad is this problem? And how can Apple solve it?The real danger is in Apple\u2019s long-term reputation. Much of Apple\u2019s brand is built on design and on a sense that everything it delivers is a gift from the vanguard.But in assessing the iPhone 6, then new, Mr. Vinh felt Apple had gone astray. Whereas the iPhone 5 had sharp, sophisticated lines that set it apart from everything else, \u201cthe iPhone 6\u2019s form seems uninspired, harkening back to the dated-looking forms of the original iPhone, and barely managing to distinguish itself from the countless other phones that have since aped that look,\u201d he wrote.That was in 2014. Now, two years later, we still have the same basic iPhone design. For years, Apple has released a redesigned iPhone every other year, but now we\u2019re going to go three years without a new iPhone look.And while Apple has slowed its design cadence, its rivals have sped up. Last year Samsung remade its lineup of Galaxy smartphones in a new glass-and-metal design that looked practically identical to the iPhone. Then it went further. Over the course of a few months, Samsung put out several design refinements, culminating in the Note 7, a big phone that has been universally praised by critics. With its curved sides and edge-to-edge display, the Note 7 pulls off a neat trick: Though it is physically smaller than Apple\u2019s big phone, it actually has a larger screen. So thanks to clever design, you get more from a smaller thing \u2014 exactly the sort of advance we once looked to Apple for.But the setbacks from Apple\u2019s rivals aren\u2019t likely to last. Apple can\u2019t afford to rest on its past successes for long.Advertisement"}

But that model may soon be challenged by two giants of online media: Amazon and Pandora Media.Both companies are set to introduce new versions of their streaming services in coming weeks, charging as little as $5 a month, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process was ongoing. The plans will put pressure on incumbent players like Spotify and Apple Music and offer the music industry a major test regarding the value of streaming music \u2014 including the crucial question of whether discounts will be enough to entice people to pay anything when virtually every song is also available free.The pricing model of $10 a month, the standard rate charged by most on-demand streaming services, has been compared to the 99 cents that Apple charged for song downloads when it opened the iTunes music store in 2003 \u2014 a simple and comprehensible amount that established in consumers\u2019 minds the value of music in the internet age.But many in the business have argued that $10 a month is too high for casual listeners. At $120 a year, it costs more than most people have historically paid for music. According to MusicWatch, a market research firm, the average music customer in the United States will pay about $67 this year on recorded music, up from $55 last year but down from $80 in 1999, around the peak of the CD market.The streaming market is divided between internet radio services like Pandora, which offer songs tailored to listeners\u2019 tastes but do not let them choose exactly what songs to hear, and so-called on-demand services, like Spotify and Apple Music, which let users pick specific songs and create playlists.Pandora is expected to make the first move by unveiling, perhaps as early as this week, an expanded version of its $5 subscription platform. That service, which is currently limited to removing ads on its internet radio streams, will soon begin offering customers new features like the ability to skip more unwanted songs and store several hours\u2019 worth of playlists online, according to three people with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s plans.By Christmas, according to these people, Pandora wants to introduce a fully developed competitor to Spotify and Apple Music, with a catalog of tens of millions of songs that a listener can gain access to on demand. That version is expected to cost $10 a month, in line with the current market.For both companies, the new streaming offerings represent variations on the existing models, with a mix of new features that are intended to entice casual listeners into paying a minimal fee without eroding the ranks of customers who are willing to pay more.Amazon and Pandora have spent months negotiating new licensing terms with record companies and music publishers to allow their new streaming offerings, and they are close to completing those deals, according to the people briefed on the plans. Representatives of both companies declined to comment.That episode, technology executives say, was a window into a little-understood reality of the streaming business: that prices are indirectly enforced through the licensing contracts that services sign with record companies.Yet while the headline prices have been stuck at $10 a month, analysts and music executives say that a range of discounts and promotions has made it difficult to gauge what customers are really willing to pay. Most offer family plans, student discounts and introductory trials.Major corporate players like Amazon and Pandora do not face such basic questions of financial viability. But there are still doubts about whether lower price points will make any difference to consumers. YouTube makes virtually any song available free, and, much to the chagrin of the record companies, it is widely considered the most popular online source for music around the world. Spotify, in addition to its $10 premium service, also has a free version supported by advertising.Russ Crupnick, the managing partner of MusicWatch, the market research company, said his research showed that subscribers to premium services like Spotify were pleased with the product and willing to pay. Furthermore, such customers were also likely to pay for other media subscriptions, like to Netflix, Showtime and so on.But for less engaged consumers, he said, particularly those who are satisfied with radio or free streaming on YouTube, it may take much more to get them to buy a subscription.\u201cI don\u2019t know that you get the casual listener to automatically be a superfan just by lowering the price,\u201d Mr. Crupnick said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Talking to Vehicle Technology Companies", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "Supported byThe tech giant has been talking with McLaren, the automaker known for its Formula One racecars, about an investment in the company, according to two people briefed on the talks who asked to remain anonymous because the discussions were confidential.Apple is also in talks with Lit Motors, a San Francisco start-up that has developed an electric self-balancing motorcycle, about a potential acquisition, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Apple has already hired several former Lit Motors engineers.Even as many Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Tesla and Uber, have embarked on electric and driverless car initiatives, Apple has kept quiet. Yet internally, it has pursued a car project, called Project Titan, which has had ups and downs in leadership and direction. The layoffs at the project this month came after the appointment of an Apple veteran, Bob Mansfield, to take over the effort.Inside Apple, employees recently described the company\u2019s efforts to build a car as a project lacking vision and in complete disarray. The recent layoffs, followed by Apple\u2019s pursuit of talent and expertise from outside companies, are part of the company\u2019s effort to \u201creboot\u201d the project, said people with knowledge of the layoffs.Apple declined to comment, as did Lit Motors. Wayne Bruce, a spokesman for McLaren, said in an emailed statement that the company was \u201cnot in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.\u201dBut McLaren did not deny having had conversations with Apple. In a phone call, Mr. Bruce added: \u201cThe nature of our business means we regularly have conversations with all sorts of parties, but those conversations remain confidential. We\u2019re not in a position to confirm or deny any previous conversation.\u201dA partnership with McLaren would allow Apple to tap into the carmaker\u2019s high-end automotive technology, forged by years of building Formula One racecars and selling sports cars topping $1 million.For years, McLaren has been recognized as an innovator in automotive technology. As one example, the company pioneered the use of a single device to control a car\u2019s engine, transmission and electrical systems.McLaren\u2019s sales are steadily growing, but the company\u2019s bet on research took a bite from its profit. In 2015, McLaren, which is backed by private shareholders, sold 1,654 cars, five more than the year before. Its profit slid 64 percent to about $7 million, from $19.4 million in 2014, in part because of increased spending on research.Unlike a more traditional automaker, McLaren does not have a large car production business to protect and could tap Apple\u2019s resources to make its technology available to the masses \u2014 if Apple decides to move forward with building its own automobile.An acquisition of Lit Motors could also help Apple rethink its strategy with building an electric car and bring engineering talent into the company.Mark Scott contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Has a Potent Weapon in the Tablet Wars: Low Prices", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "Supported byNow, five years after unveiling that first tablet, Amazon is coming out with a new model of the device that takes the company\u2019s single-minded obsession with offering the lowest practical price to new extremes.It is doing so at a time when the overall tablet market is no longer the growth juggernaut it once was, with weak sales from the likes of Apple and Samsung. One notable exception to the downward trend is Amazon, which is seeing sales rise because its devices are so inexpensive.\u201cThey\u2019re obviously doing something right because they continue to grow in a market that is overall declining,\u201d said Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at IDC, the technology research company.The latest Amazon tablet is the Fire HD 8, a new model of the company\u2019s 8-inch touch-screen device.The most remarkable thing about the device is the price, which, at $89.99, represents a 40 percent drop from the previous 8-inch Fire\u2019s price of $149.99. More striking is the contrast to Apple\u2019s 8-inch iPads, which start at $399 for the latest generation and $269 for an earlier model.There is nothing new about Amazon\u2019s fixation on undercutting its competitors on price. In tablets, it has seemed more aggressive about lowering prices. Last year, it introduced a 7-inch tablet that sells for $49.99, a few dollars more than Apple charges for a leather iPhone case.The success of that low-price Fire device provided a big lift to Amazon\u2019s tablet sales, which have more than doubled on a unit basis this year compared with the same period last year, said Kevin Keith, general manager of Amazon\u2019s Fire tablet business.The global tablet market is no longer a growth business, falling 11.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. Amazon ranked fifth during that period, accounting for 4.1 percent of sales, IDC estimates.Apple \u2014 the top tablet maker \u2014 has reported that the number of iPads it sold during that period fell 9 percent, though its iPad revenue rose 7 percent because of sales of high-end versions.If Amazon\u2019s approach to tablet pricing sounds unprofitable, that is because it is, at least directly. The company views them as a way to entice people to become more enthusiastic Amazon customers by, for example, encouraging the purchase of $99-a-year Prime memberships, which include a Netflix-like video service, music and other forms of entertainment that can be consumed on the devices.\u201cWe aim to break even on our hardware and make money when customers use our devices, not when we sell devices,\u201d said Mr. Keith. \u201cWe feel like that\u2019s a great model for our business.\u201dAmazon squeezes additional revenue out of its tablets in other ways, too. It sends advertisements to the lock screens of Fire tablets. If customers do not want to see the ads, they can pay Amazon $15 to remove them. This is not something Apple is likely to do, and die-hard fans of the iPad, which many say has a polish that other tablets lack, will not be swayed merely by price.Despite the overall decline in the market, Amazon\u2019s Mr. Keith says he thinks there are still opportunities for Amazon tablet sales to grow. Its prices are low enough that Amazon customers are buying multiple tablets for their homes and giving them as gifts.\u201cWe don\u2019t think the market is saturated yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have plenty of runway.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren: What Apple Teaches Us About Taxes", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 APPLE got a big surprise last week when the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect more than $14 billion in back taxes from the company. The global giant had been attributing billions of dollars in profits to a phantom head office, allowing it to pay a tax rate of 1 percent or lower.Both Apple and Ireland are appealing the decision, but the commission\u2019s announcement was the latest sign that multinational corporations are running out of places to hide from paying taxes. The door is now open for Congress to fix our own corporate tax code, which has allowed the biggest multinationals to shirk their obligations for decades.The Apple ruling is big, but it is only the latest international effort to end the deals that American multinationals have used to pay near-zero tax rates. The European Commission is investigating Luxembourg\u2019s tax arrangements for Amazon and McDonald\u2019s, and last year the European Court of Justice struck down tax advantages to companies and their subsidiaries selling e-books throughout Europe. Also last year, Britain enacted a new tax to target profits siphoned off by international companies \u2014 nicknamed, without much subtlety, the \u201cGoogle tax.\u201dIt\u2019s not just Europe. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20 nations are coordinating on a global effort to end the cross-border games that allow companies to avoid taxation by moving money among various subsidiaries. Multinational corporations are especially worried about losing access to Cayman Island-style tax rates in European countries where they can also get rule of law, political stability and an educated professional class of attorneys and consultants.The Treasury Department has pushed back against the European Commission over the Apple case, concerned about the impact on the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s authority. But Treasury has also finalized new country-by-country reporting requirements that could help expose the jaw-dropping variety of tax-dodging schemes multinational companies employ. At the Group of 20 summit meeting in China last weekend, President Obama reiterated his support for a cooperative global effort to end the international tax shell game.Now that they are feeling the sting from foreign tax crackdowns, giant corporations and their Washington lobbyists are pressing Congress to cut them a new sweetheart deal here at home. But instead of bailing out the tax dodgers under the guise of tax reform, Congress should seize this moment to take three crucial steps to repair our broken corporate tax code.First, Congress should increase the share of government revenue generated from taxes on big corporations \u2014 permanently. In the 1950s, corporations contributed about $3 out of every $10 in federal revenue. Today they contribute $1 out of every $10, despite their reliance on federal investments to start and expand their businesses. The National Science Foundation helped fund some of the initial work of Google\u2019s founders. Apple\u2019s consumer products still rely on technology that originated in federally funded research. To usher in the next generation of prosperous American companies \u2014 and to make the investments we need to sustain broad-based economic growth \u2014 the current generation of corporate winners must step up and pay its fair share.Second, Congress should encourage investment in jobs here in the United States. Giant corporations are pushing corporate tax reform proposals that offer a lower permanent tax rate for earnings generated abroad than earnings generated at home. That is nuts. Preferential tax treatment, either through special rates or deferred due dates, creates a huge financial incentive for American companies to build businesses and create jobs abroad rather than in the United States. Our tax code should favor jobs and businesses at home \u2014 period.Third, Congress should level the playing field for small businesses. Small companies in Massachusetts don\u2019t stash profits in the Netherlands. They can\u2019t hire a team of accountants to set up a \u201creverse hybrid mismatch\u201d to slash their taxes. This puts small businesses at a competitive disadvantage as they end up shouldering more of the burden of paying for education, infrastructure, research, the military and everything else our nation relies on to succeed.I have been pushing Congress to take these steps since I arrived in the Senate in 2013. The common refrain from Republicans who oppose these measures is that taking them would encourage American companies to flee abroad. But as other nations step up to prevent tax avoidance, that case gets weaker and weaker. And we have the leverage to tighten our tax code because these companies want what America offers: the world\u2019s wealthiest consumers, the world\u2019s best work force, the world\u2019s most reliable legal system and the world\u2019s deepest capital markets.For years, corporate tax dodgers have taken full advantage of all the benefits of being American companies, while searching out every possible way to avoid paying American taxes. Now that other leading countries are starting to get tough on tax enforcement, these tax dodgers suddenly want to move their money back to the United States. When they do, they should pay their fair share, just as working families and small businesses have been all along.Elizabeth Warren is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and Watch Updates: What You Really Need to Know", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixFor those wondering what to do with the plethora of information, here is what you really need to know: You need not rush to upgrade your iPhone or Apple Watch if you recently bought one. The people who may want to jump to buy one of the new devices are those who have owned their current iPhone for more than two years.Yet for all smartphone owners, the biggest change to the iPhone may be the omission of the headphone jack, a connector that many have been attached to for decades. Apple said it left out the headphone jack in favor of other benefits, like cramming in faster chips and a better battery.\u201cThe reason to move on comes down to one word: courage,\u201d Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for marketing, said on Wednesday. \u201cThe courage to move on, do something new that betters all of us.\u201dIf the headphone jack removal is the biggest change, that underlines how much of what Apple unveiled on Wednesday was incremental. So there is no need to stampede to an Apple store to snap up the new products when they become available this month, unless your gadget is so out-of-date that it is time to get with 2016.Here is what you need to know about Apple\u2019s new iPhone 7 and Apple Watch, with tips on how to prepare for the death of the headphone jack if you plan to buy a new Apple phone.So what is new? The iPhones have a new processor that is about 40 percent faster than the previous models. They also include a physical home button with force sensitivity for the first time, a feature that responds with a vibration when the button is pressed. As a result, the button no longer depresses when it is pressed, which might make it more durable than previous iterations.The new iPhones also include improved cameras capable of capturing a wider color range. The larger model, the 7 Plus, has two cameras on the rear that work together to improve zooming capability.Other than that, the iPhones will continue to come in silver, gold and pink, with two new colors: matte black and shiny black. The antenna bands, which were thick lines wrapping around the back of the older iPhones, are no longer visible on the new iPhones, making the devices look cleaner.The biggest change is the item that is missing: The 3.5-millimeter audio port for plugging in earphones and speakers. Apple says it sacrificed the port to make more room for faster processors and better battery life while making the device water and dust resistant.\u201cIt\u2019s all fighting for space within that same enclosure,\u201d Mr. Schiller said about the many components in a smartphone, including the headphone jack.The new iPhones will start shipping to customers on Sept. 16 with a starting price of $649 for the iPhone 7 and $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus. They can be ordered online beginning on Friday.What can consumers do about the removal of the audio jack? For many people, plugging in headphones has become a habit that helped turn their phone into a moving stereo or video player on their daily commute or at the gym.Coping with the change depends on the type of audio accessories you use. For consumers who want to cling to their wired audio gear, Apple is making the transition less painful by including a converter with the new iPhones. Basically, that is a dongle with a Lightning connector on one side, for plugging into the iPhone, and an audio port on the other end, for plugging in the audio accessory.So the good news: You won\u2019t have to buy new audio gear. But on the downside, you will have to carry a tiny, easy-to-lose dongle; replacements cost $9.The new watch, Series 2, is also faster than the previous one. It will start shipping on Sept. 16 with a starting price of $370.These are still incremental upgrades from the first version of the Watch. The biggest change is a new ceramic finish for the high-end version of Apple Watch, called Edition, which has a starting price of $1,250.Apple also revised the operating system powering the Apple Watch, called WatchOS. The new version, WatchOS 3, will introduce a more intuitive interface and be included with the new Apple Watch. WatchOS 3 will also be available as a free software update for the last Apple Watch.In the end, Apple\u2019s product event on Wednesday may have been more about theater than substantive changes to its devices.\u201cThe iPhone 7 packed few surprises,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research. \u201cThis event was a big test of Apple\u2019s ability to continue to tell a compelling story around its annual product upgrades.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Moves Toward a Wireless Future, One Tweak at a Time", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA big step in that direction is the removal of a headphone jack from the latest version of the iPhone, called the iPhone 7.\u201cBasically, Apple has shifted from one killer feature per upgrade, such as a larger screen, to a variety of compelling improvements that will appeal to a range of buyers,\u201d said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research.For more than a decade, Apple has experienced explosive revenue and earnings growth thanks to new hit products, including the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad. That streak stopped with the release of the Apple Watch last year, though executives maintain that sales have exceeded expectations.But there are probably plenty more dollars to be wrung from Apple\u2019s existing products. This update to the iPhone has been a cause for excitement \u2014 and controversy \u2014 among Apple fans.Removing the port for headphones from the iPhone means they now connect only wirelessly or through a charging port. The redesign also encourages users to upgrade to Apple\u2019s new wireless earbuds, AirPods, which cost $160.While the updates to the iPhone were incremental, Apple executives hinted that the iPhone changes were part of a companywide effort to wirelessly connect everything inside a home. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, explained how his company\u2019s technology could be the central way to control all sorts of home wireless devices.\u201cThis is Apple\u2019s way of saying that someday the smartphone experience will be wireless,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. But will it be enough to reignite iPhone sales? \u201cNot by itself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this along with the other tech upgrades like cameras and processors should drive high interest for those needing to upgrade, as well as draw interest by new customers too.\u201dTalk about a wireless future had people already looking toward big changes that could be in store for next year, the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and beyond. Mr. Bajarin, for example, expects Apple to introduce wireless charging to the iPhone in the near future. Should wireless connections become a bigger part of Apple\u2019s future, it is not a leap to imagine closer integration between the company\u2019s various devices and its software meant for cars, called CarPlay.This isn\u2019t the first time Apple has risked angering customers by moving away from a traditional design. Its desktop computers accommodated a 3\u00bd-inch disk, rather than the standard 5\u00bc-inch floppy disk; and more recently it eliminated the CD drive and several ports from its laptops. Some customers considered those changes shocking, even downright hostile acts. They got over it.\u201cApple has a history of doing what it wants and making people believe that it\u2019s the best idea ever,\u201d said Julie A. Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. \u201cThe company has an affluent customer base that has in the past paid to upgrade because it cares about the quality of the experience.\u201dOther cosmetic changes were made to the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which look much like their predecessors and will have starting prices of $650 and $770. The phones will come in new colors, including a shiny, jet black and matte black, in addition to the existing options of silver, gold and rose gold.Apple also unveiled an updated version of the Apple Watch that includes GPS tracking, which would make it more appealing to runners. It has a faster operating system that lets apps work more quickly and could make performing some tasks easier on the watch than on an iPhone. The Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $370. And the original Apple Watch, rebranded Apple Watch Series 1, starts at $270.The company emphasized that the Apple Watch was a useful tool for monitoring health, one of the few functions that users have embraced, and announced a partnership with Nike. It also made the new version water-resistant and added tracking for swimmers.\u201cThe watch is still missing a killer app,\u201d Ms. Ask said, noting that some of the functions that the Apple Watch performs especially well, such as payments, have not taken off.The Apple Watch still accounts for such a tiny portion of the company\u2019s revenue that Apple doesn\u2019t break out the number when it reports quarterly earnings. But Mr. Cook revealed on Wednesday that Apple was now the No. 2 global watch brand, measured by revenue, behind Rolex, and that Apple\u2019s was the top-selling smartwatch.The overall market for wearable devices is growing. In the United States, 63.7 million adults, or about a quarter of the population, use a wearable device. That number is expected to increase by more than 17 percent next year to 74.8 million adults, according to the research firm eMarketer.Apple has grown increasingly dependent on software and services for growth. On earnings calls with analysts, the company has emphasized the role that software and services play in keeping customers hooked on Apple\u2019s products. Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, estimates that services such as Apple Music account for nearly one-third of Apple\u2019s quarterly profits.Mr. Cook underscored that idea at the event with updates on Apple Music and the App Store. Mr. Cook said that Apple Music had 17 million subscribers and that the company would work to nail down more exclusive deals with artists. He also said that the hit game Super Mario would come to the App Store and that Pok\u00e9mon Go would be available on the Apple Watch.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yesterday, Outraged by Apple\u2019s Tax Dodge. Today, by Its Tax Bill.", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax avoidance has become a lightning rod as the presidential campaign has taken on a strong populist cast, and leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress have demanded that companies be forced to pay their fair share. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have vowed to crack down on deals that allow companies to relocate their headquarters overseas to lower their tax bills, and the Treasury Department has made limiting international loopholes a priority.And for at least some American politicians, the anger stems from a simple calculation: The tax money that the European Union extracts from Apple should be going to the United States Treasury, not that they have figured out how to make that happen.Most lawmakers and business groups do not see it that way. They defended Apple by arguing that the European Union was overstepping its authority and reinterpreting international tax law to unfairly penalize the company. Some called it a new brand of protectionism.In Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe.The European Commission \u201cis using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view,\u201d Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend\u2019s meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies.He pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion, saying legislation that prevents companies from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the United States \u201cwill see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration.\u201dThe European Commission\u2019s ruling has even managed to forge a rare moment of agreement between the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who is likely to become the next leader of his party in the Senate.\u201cThis decision is awful,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement. \u201cSlamming a company with a giant tax bill \u2014 years after the fact \u2014 sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201dMr. Schumer said in an interview that he and Mr. Ryan had been discussing possibilities for a corporate tax overhaul for next year. He said he was optimistic about the prospect of requiring corporate money to return to the United States at a lower tax rate, with some of the proceeds being used to fund a large investment in infrastructure.The action taken by the European Union, he said, should be an impetus to get moving on such legislation.\u201cThe European Union is going to grab this money, instead of the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big signpost here for us. Let\u2019s get moving.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect our U.S. tax base. That money sitting over there should be here in the U.S., not in Ireland and not in the E.U.\u201dThe bipartisan \u201cconsensus\u201d that the corporate tax rate should be cut in exchange for loopholes closures emerged in President Obama\u2019s first term, yet Congress has not formally drafted a bill, much less voted on one. Tax experts said that without a deep cut in the tax rate, companies like Apple would be better off paying back taxes in Europe than repatriating their overseas cash.\u201cThis is not taking 13 billion euros out of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s pocket and U.S. taxpayers\u2019 pocket and putting it into Europe,\u201d said Jeffery M. Kadet, a tax lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be bringing this money back to the U.S. anyway.\u201d\u201cJust because it happens to be an American company, to say that the European Union should not take action, I think, is the height of hypocrisy,\u201d Mr. Avi-Yonah said.\u201cThe royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U.S. should be taxed in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cBut Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U.S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland.\u201dBlaming Apple and the Internal Revenue Service, he added, \u201cWhen Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them.\u201dIt remains to be seen if corporate tax reform will be a priority for the next administration, but the language used by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on the campaign trail suggests that it is a strong possibility.Mrs. Clinton has released a formal proposal to prevent so-called corporate inversions and to reward companies that keep their operations in the United States. Mr. Trump, who has called for a boycott of Apple products, has threatened to punish companies that relocate to other countries by imposing taxes on products they sell in the United States.The news that a corporate giant might have evaded billions of dollars in taxes could become another populist rallying cry.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders did so well in the campaign this year,\u201d Mr. Gascoigne, of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said. \u201cPeople are fed up with the kinds of back-room deals that are happening at the large multinational companies at the expense of the American people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Driver? Bring It On. How Pittsburgh Became Uber\u2019s Testing Ground", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber\u2019s unprecedented test? The answer is not much.There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don\u2019t know where the Uber cars will travel.It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley\u2019s boldest experiments \u2014 and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities.The mayor\u2019s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs \u2014 essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years.When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city\u2019s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-sharing services in 2014, Pittsburgh\u2019s mayor and the state\u2019s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh\u2019s politicians stay out of the way.The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber.But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber\u2019s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks.\u201cI feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,\u201d said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city\u2019s South Side neighborhood.\u201cThis is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that\u2019s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was \u201cfrankly surprised at how long a leash\u201d Uber got.Mr. Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and said the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal.\u201cThere is no technology that is fail-proof and there is no tech that can guarantee there won\u2019t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,\u201d he said.In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, \u201cOur work would not be possible without the support we\u2019ve received from city leaders.\u201dUber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own.By this decade, the university\u2019s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students.For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state\u2019s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed.Officials from Pennsylvania\u2019s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths.\u201cWe\u2019d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn\u2019t pursue this technology,\u201d said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.In Pittsburgh, Mr. Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Mr. Peduto\u2019s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Mr. Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Mr. Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission\u2019s proposed ban on ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Mr. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber\u2019s driverless cars.\u201cTravis\u2019s vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,\u201d Mr. Peduto said. \u201cWe shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.\u201dWeeks later, in a meeting with President Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Mr. Peduto urged Mr. Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh\u2019s intention to be a testing ground.Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber\u2019s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city\u2019s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers.Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber\u2019s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street.\u201cThere\u2019s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,\u201d said Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh\u2019s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so.Last month, Uber officially announced that the self-driving fleet would go into action in Pittsburgh. Mr. Peduto, who had been informed a few days earlier by Uber, sent a congratulatory text message to Mr. Kalanick. Uber\u2019s chief was in Pittsburgh at the time and invited the mayor to be the city\u2019s first driverless-car passenger.\u201cI feel fortunate that I have the ear of a C.E.O. of one of the biggest privately held companies,\u201d he said.An article on Sunday about Uber\u2019s introduction of self-driving cars to Pittsburgh misstated the surname of the city\u2019s assistant chief of police. He is Scott Schubert, not Schuster.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ending Apple\u2019s Offshore Tax Dodge", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:While the editorial is spot on in calling for an end to the deferral process, it sorely missed the mark in characterizing President Obama\u2019s proposed repatriation rate as \u201creasonable.\u201d Tax holidays incentivize bad business behavior and reward companies that extract wealth from communities with a deep discount and a clean conscience.A 14 percent rate on repatriated funds previously held offshore is a handout to large multinational corporations at the expense of small-business owners and our customers. Far from reasonable, it\u2019s been estimated by the Main Street Alliance that the proposed holiday rate would be a $20 billion gift to Apple.With their nearly unlimited access to capital and ability to buy in bulk, industry giants like Apple already hold a competitive edge over small to mid-sized businesses, which can\u2019t afford to hire high-priced tax accountants and lawyers to devise tax avoidance schemes.To level the playing field for Main Street businesses, Congress must act to end deferral, stop incentivizing offshoring of revenues with tax holidays, and hold all companies accountable to pay what they owe when they owe it.DEBORAH FIELDPortland, Ore.The writer, a small-business owner and former accountant, is a member of the Main Street Alliance.To the Editor:I find it infuriating that Apple, Microsoft, Google and many other highly successful so-called American companies have found legal ways to avoid paying anywhere close to a fair share of taxes on their profits. Their executives and shareholders win and the rest of us lose.I find it even more infuriating when pharmaceutical companies play the same tax avoidance game, but also jack up the prices of essential and unique medications by several hundred percent, and expect taxpayers to foot the bill through federal insurance programs.How many ordinary Americans are disadvantaged by these practices \u2014 people who are not earning the big bonuses and dividends generated by these practices, but rather have to pay the increased taxes to cover them? Come on, Congress, do something. At least pretend you represent the people.DON CARLSONBostonTo the Editor:Apple and other companies are only doing what our laws and those of their host countries abroad allow them to do. The problem, as you point out, lies with our own tax laws and enforcement. A way forward would be to apply basic accounting principles to reformulate our tax policies. These include:1. Profits should generally be taxed in the country in which business is conducted and profits are generated.2. Profits should be taxed in the year in which they are generated.3. Like individual American citizens, American businesses should be taxed at home each year on their combined \u201cworldwide\u201d income.4. Corporations should be entitled to an offsetting American credit for taxes paid to foreign countries if we have bilateral tax treaties with those countries. This should allow us to modify our current deferral policy of profits not taxed until repatriated.To further discourage tax inversion and offshore profit harboring, we must review our own tax rates and make them more competitive with other nations, while also persuading countries like Ireland that are members of the World Trade Organization not to adopt a very low-rate, tax haven or \u201cpirate\u201d status.CHERIAN THACHENKARYAtlantaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Salesforce Is Said to Question Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal in Europe", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe competition questions have focused on whether Microsoft\u2019s proposed deal would hinder access by people and companies to the vast collection of data held by LinkedIn. Salesforce.com has also suggested that the deal would give Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals by combining its own software services with the information held by the social network, two of the people said.The comments came in response to a questionnaire sent by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, a step that allows interested third-party companies, including competitors, to comment on prospective takeovers.Salesforce.com\u2019s concerns do not necessarily mean that Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, the region\u2019s tough antitrust chief, will open an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s purchase of LinkedIn, though on Thursday she raised her own questions about how digital data should be treated in future competition cases.Ricardo Cardoso, a European Commission spokesman, declined to comment on Salesforce.com\u2019s response to the competition questionnaire.A Microsoft spokeswoman, Jennifer Crider, declined to comment on the European Commission questionnaire, though she said the company had already received antitrust clearance in the United States and Canada and was working with other global authorities on similar approval. The company has yet to submit its LinkedIn deal to European competition authorities, but it is likely to do so by early November, at the latest.\u201cWe expect to close before the end of this calendar year,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement on Thursday.A Salesforce.com spokeswoman, Chi Hea Cho, said the company had been contacted by the European Commission as part of its review of the proposed deal. The company also made similar efforts in the United States to highlight the potential competition problems with the deal, but it failed to win over American authorities, said another person with knowledge of the matter.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, was dismissive of the complaints from Mr. Benioff\u2019s company.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to continue working to bring price competition to a C.R.M. market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices today,\u201d said Mr. Smith, using the initials for customer relationship management, the software category in which Salesforce is the leader.While Salesforce.com\u2019s criticism of the acquisition could appear to be just sour grapes after it lost out on buying LinkedIn, its questions about how Microsoft\u2019s control of data would potentially hinder rivals are gaining traction with some European officials.One possibility would be for Microsoft to combine LinkedIn\u2019s information on people\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and messaging activity on the social network with its own Office software, providing the tech giant with an advantage over rivals offering similar services. In previous statements, Microsoft said its own offerings did not overlap with LinkedIn\u2019s and that competing services like Facebook, which also collect large amounts of data, also existed.Similar data-related concerns were raised in Europe when Facebook bought WhatsApp, the messaging app, in 2014 for $19 billion. The region\u2019s authorities have been regularly criticized, particularly by European telecommunications operators, for approving that deal despite complaints that it would limit consumer choice.\u201cThe questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly, on second reference, to a Microsoft spokeswoman.

{"Headline": "Allo\u2019s Tryout: 5 Days With Google\u2019s Annoying Office Intern", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "Supported byTech FixYou may now have more messaging apps than you have close friends.\u201cHaving more apps than close friends doesn\u2019t help, as something will have to go,\u201d Mr. Dunbar said in an email, though he noted that the various messaging apps serve different purposes. Younger people are shying away from chatting on Facebook, for example, to have more private conversations on apps like WhatsApp.With that backdrop in mind, I tested Allo for five days and compared it with the apps that are most similar to it: Google Hangouts, Apple iMessage and Facebook Messenger.After weighing the pros and cons, my advice is that people can hold off on downloading Allo, largely because its artificially intelligent assistant was unhelpful. But if Allo matures, users will probably want to ditch the Hangouts app.First, some context about Allo. Google announced the app in May, aiming to highlight the company\u2019s push into artificial intelligence. Its older chat app, Hangouts, will remain, but Google will emphasize that product\u2019s use as a videoconferencing and messaging app for businesses.To understand how Allo works, it\u2019s easiest to think of the app\u2019s A.I. assistant as an office intern who is lurking in the background, eager to chime in. The assistant analyzes messages you have typed or dictated and, when appropriate, springs into action with automatically generated phrases you can choose to reply with or suggestions for Google searches that may help accomplish tasks.When you\u2019re having a conversation with another person, for example, the assistant suggests ways it can help. Saying \u201cWant to see a movie tonight?\u201d prompts the assistant to offer a Google search for movie showtimes or to reply with suggestions like \u201cSure, what time?\u201d or \u201cNot really.\u201dHere is where Allo became frustrating for me. Asking an assistant to search \u201cmovie showtimes tonight\u201d should load a list of movies and corresponding showtimes. Instead, Google\u2019s assistant shows a list of movies without showtimes; only after tapping on a film can you ask for times.Sometimes that doesn\u2019t even work. Asking for showtimes for the movie \u201cSnowden\u201d loaded movies playing at a movie theater called UA Snowden Square Stadium 14. Not helpful \u2014 unless, of course, you live in Columbia, Md.Allo also tries to guess what your written response might be to certain types of phrases, questions or photos. With photos, the app occasionally identifies what\u2019s inside the photo to generate a suggested reaction. So when you receive a photo of a dog, Allo loads responses like \u201cadorable.\u201dThis feature ran into several problems. When I sent a picture to a friend of my cat sitting inside my car, Allo suggested this response to the friend: \u201cWhat a cute car!\u201d (Sorry, Allo, but my Prius is the opposite of cute.)For now, Allo\u2019s artificial assistance feels limited. So if I were a manager seeking an assistant, I probably wouldn\u2019t hire Allo. But I would politely tell the candidate to reapply after getting more experience.Each messaging app has its own purpose, but Allo has the most in common with Facebook Messenger, iMessage and Google Hangouts. That\u2019s because all four are capable of adding some personality with stickers and emojis.So I tested Messenger, iMessage and Hangouts against Allo to determine their pros and cons. The highlights:\u25a0 iMessage, Hangouts and Messenger work on mobile devices and computers. Allo works only on Android and iOS mobile devices, though Google plans to expand Allo to computers later.\u25a0 iMessage and Messenger support third-party apps, adding features like sending money to friends within messages. Google has no plans to support outside apps in Allo.\u25a0 Messenger has more sticker packs than Allo, which has only about 25.\u25a0 IMessage stickers are more fun to use. In iMessage, stickers can be placed on top of messages and photos \u2014 add a cartoon mustache to your selfie, for example. On Allo, stickers can be sent only as stand-alone messages.\u25a0 The Hangouts app is very much like Allo, without the half-baked assistant. Allo has more entertaining stickers, including a muscular yellow bull that appears to be twerking. The big difference between the two is that the Hangouts app relies primarily on your contacts list linked to a Google Mail account, whereas Allo pulls contacts from your device\u2019s phone book.The upshot: iMessage and Messenger have more features than Allo. There are two major features missing from Allo: the ability to chat using a computer and using third-party apps and games to do more within messages.With Allo, Google has the opportunity to stand out by offering superior artificial intelligence. Neither Messenger nor Allo has great A.I. yet, but Google\u2019s assistant has a better start.Finally, there is privacy to consider. It\u2019s tough to say how Allo will fare in terms of security until encryption experts take a close look at the app.Here\u2019s what we know so far: By default, Apple\u2019s iMessage service is end-to-end encrypted, which means a message is encrypted when it is sent from your device and remains encrypted when it passes through Apple\u2019s server and reaches the recipient. Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger both lack end-to-end encryption, so at some point when messages pass through their servers, they can see your messages.Allo has end-to-end encryption turned off by default because its server needs to see the messages to work its A.I. magic. However, Allo includes a mode called Incognito with full encryption enabled, which people can use for private conversations, similar to a private mode on a web browser. But, of course, the A.I. features do not work in Incognito.So Allo is a step ahead of Hangouts and Messenger for privacy. But by default (and by design), it is not as secure as iMessage.I recommend waiting for Allo to become available on computers and for its A.I. to become smarter.

But before we move to Asian tech, let\u2019s start by talking about things closer at hand. In other words, Apple.Chinese consumers crave not only what\u2019s new, but also what stands out as new. Apple still very much has a hold on the Chinese consumer, but many may well wait another year to see what Apple does for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, when there may be more of a wow factor.That said, a part of me thinks the new wireless headphones could be a hit in China. More so than a new iPhone, they broadcast that a user is willing to drop a solid chunk of change to keep up on tech trends. That formula has worked well for Apple in the past in China, though it would have helped if they made the AirPods in gold and rose gold options.What else is going on in Chinese transportation business that you think Americans should know about?I do also think we could see some political issues crop up as the technology is more widely used. The Chinese government will want to give its local companies a leg up and it has also been uncomfortable letting foreign companies collect data within China and beam it elsewhere, so it could be we see some roadblocks go up to foreign autonomous driving technology down the line.So, what do you think? How bad is this for Samsung?There was an editorial in the Korean newspaper, the Chosun Ilbo, faulting Samsung for the technological mistakes that led to this issue. Certainly that matters, but it seems a bit beside the point. With the supply chain as complex as it is, mistakes will occasionally happen. The thing that Samsung can control, and should do better at, is communicating with its customers.So anyway \u2026 have a good flight back!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Has a Potent Weapon in the Tablet Wars: Low Prices", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, five years after unveiling that first tablet, Amazon is coming out with a new model of the device that takes the company\u2019s single-minded obsession with offering the lowest practical price to new extremes.It is doing so at a time when the overall tablet market is no longer the growth juggernaut it once was, with weak sales from the likes of Apple and Samsung. One notable exception to the downward trend is Amazon, which is seeing sales rise because its devices are so inexpensive.\u201cThey\u2019re obviously doing something right because they continue to grow in a market that is overall declining,\u201d said Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at IDC, the technology research company.The latest Amazon tablet is the Fire HD 8, a new model of the company\u2019s 8-inch touch-screen device.The most remarkable thing about the device is the price, which, at $89.99, represents a 40 percent drop from the previous 8-inch Fire\u2019s price of $149.99. More striking is the contrast to Apple\u2019s 8-inch iPads, which start at $399 for the latest generation and $269 for an earlier model.There is nothing new about Amazon\u2019s fixation on undercutting its competitors on price. In tablets, it has seemed more aggressive about lowering prices. Last year, it introduced a 7-inch tablet that sells for $49.99, a few dollars more than Apple charges for a leather iPhone case.The success of that low-price Fire device provided a big lift to Amazon\u2019s tablet sales, which have more than doubled on a unit basis this year compared with the same period last year, said Kevin Keith, general manager of Amazon\u2019s Fire tablet business.The global tablet market is no longer a growth business, falling 11.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. Amazon ranked fifth during that period, accounting for 4.1 percent of sales, IDC estimates.Apple \u2014 the top tablet maker \u2014 has reported that the number of iPads it sold during that period fell 9 percent, though its iPad revenue rose 7 percent because of sales of high-end versions.If Amazon\u2019s approach to tablet pricing sounds unprofitable, that is because it is, at least directly. The company views them as a way to entice people to become more enthusiastic Amazon customers by, for example, encouraging the purchase of $99-a-year Prime memberships, which include a Netflix-like video service, music and other forms of entertainment that can be consumed on the devices.\u201cWe aim to break even on our hardware and make money when customers use our devices, not when we sell devices,\u201d said Mr. Keith. \u201cWe feel like that\u2019s a great model for our business.\u201dAmazon squeezes additional revenue out of its tablets in other ways, too. It sends advertisements to the lock screens of Fire tablets. If customers do not want to see the ads, they can pay Amazon $15 to remove them. This is not something Apple is likely to do, and die-hard fans of the iPad, which many say has a polish that other tablets lack, will not be swayed merely by price.Despite the overall decline in the market, Amazon\u2019s Mr. Keith says he thinks there are still opportunities for Amazon tablet sales to grow. Its prices are low enough that Amazon customers are buying multiple tablets for their homes and giving them as gifts.\u201cWe don\u2019t think the market is saturated yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have plenty of runway.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The European Union\u2019s decision takes direct aim at some of the country\u2019s generous tax policies, calling them illegal incentives in Apple\u2019s case.But it is a big payday to forgo, prompting criticism from left-wing lawmakers, government workers and even some local fans of Apple. European officials calculate that Apple\u2019s tax bill may rise to $21.3 billion when interest is included.The money would go a long way toward funding hospitals, schools and other social programs. At the height of austerity, Ireland cut government salaries by double-digit percentages, halted investment in public works and introduced a series of new taxes.In Cork, unemployment still hovers around 8 percent, or roughly the national average, after reaching highs of about 15 percent. Many young people still must emigrate in search of jobs.\u201cThat money could create at least 100,000 jobs,\u201d said Mick Barry, a Cork lawmaker from the Anti-Austerity Alliance, a small political party. \u201cIt would have a transformative effect.\u201dThis tug of war over Apple\u2019s money is part of a broader identity crisis in Ireland since the downturn.Much of the country\u2019s long-term economic growth has been tied to attracting international companies through low taxes and flexible working conditions. Almost 200,000 Irish workers, or roughly 10 percent of the total work force, are now employed by overseas companies, according to government statistics.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have a problem with government\u2019s appeal, but where were they during the financial crisis when Irish workers could have done with the same help?\u201d said Declan Connolly, 39, an information technology worker for Cork\u2019s local government.Almost a third of his colleagues have either been let go or not been replaced when they retired. Extra taxes on his income and pension have left him with roughly 10 percent less cash in his pocket.\u201cThe Irish government never did do as much for us as they are now doing for Apple,\u201d Mr. Connolly added.Cork, with a population of about 125,000, is a contradictory blend of Silicon Valley chic and Irish-style austerity.A Starbucks in a refurbished 19th-century building on the banks of the River Lee, which meanders though the city center, attracts a techie crowd of 20-something millennials, speaking languages as varied as Chinese and Czech. High-end stores like Tommy Hilfiger line the main thoroughfare, and luxury sedans carry tech and pharmaceutical executives to meetings.Yet only a few blocks away, where street stall vendors once sold fruit and vegetables, pawnshops and mostly empty casinos dot the streets. Posters at a government agency offer tips on how to deal with spiraling personal debt.A longtime port town, Cork in recent decades has made itself an attractive hub for multinationals. Companies can tap into a steady stream of graduates from the local university, along with lucrative tax breaks on any research and development carried out in the city. Rents are roughly half those in Dublin.Apple was at the leading edge of this movement, putting down roots in the early 1980s, when the company was a mere minnow in the tech world. Three decades on, Cork\u2019s suburbs are littered with newly built office parks, where glass-fronted buildings are emblazoned with logos from some of the world\u2019s largest companies, like Dell Technologies, Intel and Eli Lilly and Company.Apple, with its fortresslike compound, is one of the area\u2019s largest employers. Its army of over 5,000 workers has been a boon for the local economy, pumping in millions of dollars through income tax, rents and spending at fashionable restaurants and luxury stores.When Apple arrived, its workers mostly assembled computers and other devices. But as labor costs sent production to Asia, the company\u2019s Cork offices have now switched gears, mostly providing global customer and sales support.\u201cCork and Apple have stuck together through thick and thin,\u201d said Des Cahill, the city\u2019s mayor, who will meet company executives in San Francisco this week as part of an annual trade visit to drum up new investment. \u201cWe\u2019re like an old married couple.\u201dJust a few minutes\u2019 walk from Apple\u2019s main campus, Cork shows a different side. Austere concrete government housing stands crumbling in the late-summer sun. And social workers say many local residents stand little chance of landing well-paying jobs at Apple, mostly because of a lack of high-tech skills.For Charlie Harrington, a paramedic, the Apple tax standoff comes down to fairness.Like most people in Cork, Mr. Harrington, 53, said international companies \u2014 and the jobs they created \u2014 were more than welcome in the city. But he doesn\u2019t think tax rules are equally applied.When he recently refused to pay a new property tax, authorities took the money directly from his paycheck. If the government was so quick to penalize his small-scale tax avoidance, Mr. Harrington asked, then how could it protect Apple?\u201cIf the big guys don\u2019t pay and the government helps them, then everyone else will ask why we are paying too,\u201d he said over a cup of tea in a living room decorated with family photos. \u201cThey owe the money, so they should just pay it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Upgrades Autopilot in Cars on the Road", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "Supported byTesla Motors, always ahead of the automotive curve, is conducting a remarkable technological feat.Starting this week and continuing in the coming days, the company is using the cellular network to beam new software to update the Autopilot driver-assistance system on approximately 70,000 of its cars. Tesla\u2019s ability to communicate with its vehicles to download major enhancements and fixes, much as Apple updates iPhones, is beyond the capability of other automakers.But then, no other automaker has an on-the-road system as experimental as Autopilot, or perhaps the need to make midcourse corrections to such a fundamental feature of its vehicles.The company has described the Autopilot update as intended to avoid the sort of errors that contributed to a Tesla owner\u2019s fatal crash in May on a Florida highway. The most evident change might be visual and audible reminders that drivers should keep their hands on the steering wheel.It is an implicit scale-back of the company\u2019s original promotion of Autopilot, introduced last October, as essentially a self-driving car system. At the time, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, said Autopilot was \u201cprobably better than a person right now.\u201dBut the company also acknowledged then that Autopilot was also only a beta system \u2014 a technical term for an experimental version. As such, the update now underway is a tacit acknowledgment that the self-driving-car experiment Tesla has been conducting on the public highways is still very much a work in progress.\u201cThey\u2019re able to take a risk and put a system out that they admit wasn\u2019t fully baked,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a research director at the Gartner Group. \u201cBut they have this ability to improve it. It\u2019s much more of a software mind-set. You get it out there and then you do software patches to fix the bugs.\u201dThe approach, Mr. Ramsey added, comes with some risk. \u201cYou have live human beings in there,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018so you can debate whether that\u2019s the best way to do it.\u201dTesla declined to comment for this article.The policy guidelines do raise concerns about semiautonomous systems that \u2014 like Autopilot \u2014 are designed to perform many of the driving duties but still require human drivers to stay alert and be ready to take control at a moment\u2019s notice. Otherwise, the technology could be considered \u201can unreasonable risk to safety and subject to recall.\u201dAnthony Foxx, secretary of transportation, said at a news conference this week that the new guidelines were not aimed at Tesla. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is still investigating the Florida accident.The question now is how just how new and improved Autopilot actually is \u2014 and whether a software download is sufficient to address what Tesla\u2019s many critics say are the inherent shortcomings of the autonomous driving system.One of those perceived drawbacks is Autopilot\u2019s assumption that an attentive driver can and will take over control of the car in the event of an emergency. Researchers at other companies at work on self-driving cars \u2014 including Ford Motor and Google \u2014 have concluded that this so-called handoff can never happen quickly enough to be fully safe.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The new Tesla software, called Version 8.0, also makes a significant change to the way Autopilot scans the road and recognizes objects. The previous version depended heavily on the forward-looking camera to sense surroundings. In the fatal Florida collision, the camera did not see a white tractor-trailer against a bright sky.The new version of Autopilot relies more heavily on the car\u2019s radar to identify other vehicles and potential obstacles, and to decide when to steer to avoid a problem or apply the brakes.The elevation of radar might seem a modest difference. But it runs counter to the widely held view that radar, while highly accurate in measuring distance, is less precise in determining the shape and size of objects.\u201cI\u2019m not completely sure how Tesla is able to recognize and classify objects\u201d with radar, said Jeremy Carlson, a senior automotive analyst at the forecaster IHS Markit. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear there are changes in the new software in the radar sensor that are doing something in a very different way.\u201dOther automakers argue that cameras are better at recognizing and classifying objects.\u201cRadar is good at telling the distance to an object but not very good at recognizing what it is,\u201d said Hideki Hada, general manager of Toyota Motor\u2019s integrated vehicle systems group in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cCameras can tell what an object is, but it\u2019s not so good at telling the distance. So you need both.\u201dDespite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.Companies at work on fully self-driving cars contend that conventional cameras and radar are not sufficient to enable a vehicle to sense and respond to its surroundings. They plan to incorporate an additional technology: a laser-powered type of radar called lidar.Tesla argues that its current technology is adequate for Autopilot\u2019s purposes. But in a Sept. 11 conference call announcing the upgrade, Mr. Musk acknowledged the challenge of using radar to identify objects.The world, he said, looks \u201cweird\u201d in radar. Metal objects, because they strongly reflect radar waves, can appear larger than they are. Wood and plastic can appear \u201cas transparent as glass.\u201d Radar sensors tend to give \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2014 instances when they think the car should brake when it actually doesn\u2019t need to.The new Autopilot software has algorithms to adjust for radar\u2019s distortions, according to Mr. Musk. And if the radar sees a large, dense, metal object \u2014 like a truck \u2014 the radar sensor can slow or brake the car, even if the camera system can\u2019t identify the object, he said.Mr. Musk predicted that the new Autopilot system was \u201creally going to be beyond what people expect\u201d and would make the Tesla Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle \u201cby far\u201d the safest cars on the road.Mr. Ramsey, the research director at Gartner, noted that Tesla was able to release Autopilot last year without having committed to a crucial engineering question \u2014 Is the radar or the camera the primary sensor? \u2014 knowing the company could modify and improve it later.\u201cThey can take a risk like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes them truly distinct from other automakers.\u201dWhether public experiments are the best approach to highway safety is another matter. \u201cI\u2019m sure they are very confident the cars are safe,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said, \u201cbut they are kind of doing trial and error.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Phone Makers Could Cut Off Drivers. So Why Don\u2019t They?", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe court filings paint a grisly picture: As Ashley Kubiak sped down a Texas highway in her Dodge Ram truck, she checked her iPhone for messages. Distracted, she crashed into a sport utility vehicle, killing its driver and a passenger and leaving a child paralyzed.With driving fatalities rising at levels not seen in 50 years, the growing incidence of distracted driving is getting part of the blame. Now a lawsuit related to that 2013 Texas crash is raising a question: Does Apple \u2014 or any cellphone maker or wireless company \u2014 have a responsibility to prevent devices from being used by drivers in illegal and dangerous ways?The product liability lawsuit, filed against Apple by families of the victims, contends that Apple knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Ms. Kubiak from texting dangerously. The suit is unlikely to succeed, legal experts said, and a Texas magistrate in August preliminarily recommended the case\u2019s dismissal on grounds that it was unlikely that lawyers could prove that the use of the iPhone caused the fatal accident.Ms. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. Her lawyer, Jason Cassel, said she now keeps her phone in the back seat.\u201cThe mere fact she\u2019s putting her phone in her back seat in her purse shows she realizes how tempting it is to look down when we get a beep, chime, vibration,\u201d Mr. Cassel said. \u201cShe never wants to be near the possibility\u201d of being tempted to answer it.The product liability case has brought to light a piece of evidence that legal and safety experts say puts Apple in a quandary \u2014 one it shares with other wireless companies. In Apple\u2019s case, the evidence shows, the company has a patent for technology designed to prevent texting while driving, but it has not deployed it.Apple, Verizon, AT&T and other companies caution about the risks of distracted driving \u2014 and they acknowledge that laws and public education aimed at curbing the behavior are not working. It suggests to legal experts that they can foresee that their product can be used for illegal, dangerous and sometimes deadly activity.AT&T even suggests that the behavior has addictive qualities, meaning drivers cannot help themselves. But the companies \u2014 though they offer manual ways to shut down texting on the road \u2014 do not deploy technology that takes the decision out of drivers\u2019 hands altogether.\u201cThe technology exists \u2014 we just don\u2019t have the stomach to implement it,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. In 2012, the safety board sent a letter to the wireless industry association urging the companies to prevent drivers from using their phones while driving.\u201cTechnology got us into this situation. Technology will get us out,\u201d she said. However, she added, \u201cWe\u2019re so afraid to tell people what they should do that you can kind of get away with murder under these conditions.\u201dGenerally, companies have taken the position that text-blocking technology is embryonic and unreliable. They argue that they cannot shut down a driver\u2019s service without the potential of mistakenly shutting off a passenger\u2019s phone or that of someone riding on a train or bus.Instead, companies have taken the approach of simultaneously warning and enabling, a mixed message that underscores a complex swirl of economic, technological and social factors. Perhaps the most pointed question is this: Even if the technology worked to perfection, would people accept having their service blocked? After all, the idea of mobile phone service is to let people communicate on the go.David Teater, formerly of the National Safety Council and now a private consultant on road safety, who lost his own son to a distracted driver, said companies clearly feared the consequences of cutting off service for their paying customers. It\u2019s an industry, he said, in which one of the most frightening words is \u201cchurn\u201d \u2014 meaning the loss of a customer to a competitor.\u201cIf you\u2019re at Apple or you\u2019re at Samsung, do you want to be the first to block texting and driving?\u201d he said. \u201cA customer might say, \u2018If Apple does it, then my next phone is a Samsung.\u2019\u201dBut to Mr. Teater, that\u2019s just an excuse. \u201cIf Apple had deployed this technology 10 years ago, there would be more people alive today,\u201d he said. \u201cThink about it from a parent\u2019s perspective: How would you feel knowing Apple had the ability to prevent your teen from ever texting and driving, and they chose not to?\u201dIn the Apple case in Texas, lawyers who brought the suit had unearthed a fascinating document: a patent filing that Apple made in 2008, which the lawyers said was granted in 2014, for technology that would \u201clock out\u201d a driver\u2019s phone by using sensors to determine if the phone was moving and in use by a driver. If so, it would prevent certain functions, like texting.In the patent, Apple says such technology is necessary because: \u201cTexting while driving has become so widespread that it is doubtful that law enforcement will have any significant effect on stopping the practice,\u201d and \u201cTeens understand that texting while driving is dangerous, but this is often not enough motivation to end the practice.\u201dIt is unclear whether Apple has developed the lockout technology.While texting is on the rise, people are increasingly driving and using Snapchat and Instagram, or taking selfies, or playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. The phone is at the center of all the activity.Apple says it has taken other steps to address distracted driving. Its CarPlay integrates with some cars so drivers can use voice commands to control some functions of the car and the phone, including letting them orally compose text messages and listen to incoming ones. The technology, Apple says, \u201callows you to stay focused on the road.\u201d\u201cWe discourage anyone from allowing their iPhone to distract them by typing, reading or interacting with the display while driving,\u201d Apple said in response to questions. The company did not directly address whether it could or should shut down phone functions. Rather, it indicated that the responsibility was with the driver.\u201cFor those customers who do not wish to turn off their iPhones or switch into Airplane Mode while driving to avoid distractions, we recommend the easy-to-use Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode features,\u201d the statement said.These approaches put the onus on drivers to make decisions each time they enter a car or receive a message. In addition, voice-activated systems raise other concerns, said David Strayer, an expert on driver attention at the University of Utah, who said he had studied CarPlay and the feature allowed drivers to perform some functions that could take their attention off the road.\u201cIt does not eliminate driver distraction \u2014 not even close,\u201d Dr. Strayer said.Technology is already on the market that can block a driver from having to make a decision. One company, Cellcontrol, sells a device that mounts on the dash and that uses high-frequency sound waves to identify a phone\u2019s location. If the phone\u2019s user is in the driver\u2019s seat, the device can lock out prohibited services.The $129 device, which looks like a small turtle shell, \u201cis very accurate,\u201d said Cellcontrol\u2019s chief technology officer, Joe Breaux. The hiccup is that the technology can sometimes turn off the phone of a passenger sitting behind the driver.Apple, in its patent, said it was developing \u201ca process in which hand-held computing devices can provide a lockout mechanism without requiring any modifications or additions to the vehicle.\u201d It would use motion and scenery sensors to determine if the phone was moving, and its location.By not putting the technology in place, Apple has \u201cfailed in their social responsibility,\u201d said Christopher Kutz, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, who specializes in the moral and legal principles of liability. \u201cThey should\u2019ve done it, and even done it at a market risk.\u201dHe likened the situation to that of gunmakers who could stop selling high-capacity magazines but choose not to.At the same time, Mr. Kutz said, there was little precedent for companies to shut off communications services for safety reasons. In other industries, he said, companies have taken such precautions \u2014 for instance, some manufacturers have technology that will shut down a machine if a worker does not keep two hands on it.In the case of distracted driving, Apple is not the only tech giant recognizing the dangerous behavior and not preventing it. Verizon, like Apple, suggests that current laws are insufficient. \u201cWhile text messaging is banned for drivers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, many people continue to do it, despite knowing the dangers,\u201d Verizon says on a site that promotes free apps and other services available for iPhone and Android that can detect if a phone is being used by a driver and prevent texting.The Verizon messaging app has a driving mode that, when in use, detects if someone is connected to a car\u2019s Bluetooth system and delivers an automatic response to the sender that the recipient is driving, said Kelly Crummey, a Verizon spokeswoman. However, the message still arrives on the recipient\u2019s phone, allowing the opportunity to check it, Ms. Crummey said.That technology suggests it is possible to identify a driver and apply the technology more broadly \u2014 to, say, social media \u2014 but Ms. Crummey said Verizon didn\u2019t have the same kind of control over Facebook, Twitter or other functions. Further, she said, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to turn off all phone functions, like maps or navigation, that drivers rely on.AT&T encourages the use of a free app, Drivemode, that can stop incoming texts. \u201cEveryone knows texting and driving is dangerous, yet when a text message comes in, it\u2019s difficult not to respond,\u201d AT&T says in promoting the app.Of course, services like these must be activated by the user and can be bypassed. And AT&T may have identified the reason such solutions don\u2019t work: People find themselves so drawn to their devices that elements of addiction are at play.In fact, AT&T commissioned research by an addiction expert who, in an AT&T news release in 2014, said that using a phone sets off releases of a neurochemical called dopamine that makes it hard to resist the ping. \u201cIf that desire for a dopamine fix leads us to check our phones while we\u2019re driving, a simple text can turn deadly,\u201d David Greenfield, who founded the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction, said in the AT&T news release.But if the behavior has addictive qualities, can drivers really be expected to police themselves? And should automated blocking be the answer?\u201cDistracted driving is never O.K.,\u201d AT&T said, adding that it had promoted \u201cIt Can Wait,\u201d a public service campaign to discourage texting and driving.CTIA \u2014 the Wireless Association, in its response to questions, said, \u201cLaws, consumer education and technology are pivotal, and we\u2019ve seen this three-prong approach work to stop people from this dangerous practice.\u201dIt hasn\u2019t worked well enough, some say.Apple, as one of the great cultural influencers, might have the power to change the conversation \u2014 to make it fashionable to choose safety over the rush of an incoming text, Mr. Kutz said.\u201cThey\u2019ve made themselves a norm maker,\u201d he said. \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren: What Apple Teaches Us About Taxes", "Date": "2016-09-08", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 APPLE got a big surprise last week when the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect more than $14 billion in back taxes from the company. The global giant had been attributing billions of dollars in profits to a phantom head office, allowing it to pay a tax rate of 1 percent or lower.Both Apple and Ireland are appealing the decision, but the commission\u2019s announcement was the latest sign that multinational corporations are running out of places to hide from paying taxes. The door is now open for Congress to fix our own corporate tax code, which has allowed the biggest multinationals to shirk their obligations for decades.The Apple ruling is big, but it is only the latest international effort to end the deals that American multinationals have used to pay near-zero tax rates. The European Commission is investigating Luxembourg\u2019s tax arrangements for Amazon and McDonald\u2019s, and last year the European Court of Justice struck down tax advantages to companies and their subsidiaries selling e-books throughout Europe. Also last year, Britain enacted a new tax to target profits siphoned off by international companies \u2014 nicknamed, without much subtlety, the \u201cGoogle tax.\u201dIt\u2019s not just Europe. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20 nations are coordinating on a global effort to end the cross-border games that allow companies to avoid taxation by moving money among various subsidiaries. Multinational corporations are especially worried about losing access to Cayman Island-style tax rates in European countries where they can also get rule of law, political stability and an educated professional class of attorneys and consultants.The Treasury Department has pushed back against the European Commission over the Apple case, concerned about the impact on the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s authority. But Treasury has also finalized new country-by-country reporting requirements that could help expose the jaw-dropping variety of tax-dodging schemes multinational companies employ. At the Group of 20 summit meeting in China last weekend, President Obama reiterated his support for a cooperative global effort to end the international tax shell game.Now that they are feeling the sting from foreign tax crackdowns, giant corporations and their Washington lobbyists are pressing Congress to cut them a new sweetheart deal here at home. But instead of bailing out the tax dodgers under the guise of tax reform, Congress should seize this moment to take three crucial steps to repair our broken corporate tax code.First, Congress should increase the share of government revenue generated from taxes on big corporations \u2014 permanently. In the 1950s, corporations contributed about $3 out of every $10 in federal revenue. Today they contribute $1 out of every $10, despite their reliance on federal investments to start and expand their businesses. The National Science Foundation helped fund some of the initial work of Google\u2019s founders. Apple\u2019s consumer products still rely on technology that originated in federally funded research. To usher in the next generation of prosperous American companies \u2014 and to make the investments we need to sustain broad-based economic growth \u2014 the current generation of corporate winners must step up and pay its fair share.Second, Congress should encourage investment in jobs here in the United States. Giant corporations are pushing corporate tax reform proposals that offer a lower permanent tax rate for earnings generated abroad than earnings generated at home. That is nuts. Preferential tax treatment, either through special rates or deferred due dates, creates a huge financial incentive for American companies to build businesses and create jobs abroad rather than in the United States. Our tax code should favor jobs and businesses at home \u2014 period.Third, Congress should level the playing field for small businesses. Small companies in Massachusetts don\u2019t stash profits in the Netherlands. They can\u2019t hire a team of accountants to set up a \u201creverse hybrid mismatch\u201d to slash their taxes. This puts small businesses at a competitive disadvantage as they end up shouldering more of the burden of paying for education, infrastructure, research, the military and everything else our nation relies on to succeed.I have been pushing Congress to take these steps since I arrived in the Senate in 2013. The common refrain from Republicans who oppose these measures is that taking them would encourage American companies to flee abroad. But as other nations step up to prevent tax avoidance, that case gets weaker and weaker. And we have the leverage to tighten our tax code because these companies want what America offers: the world\u2019s wealthiest consumers, the world\u2019s best work force, the world\u2019s most reliable legal system and the world\u2019s deepest capital markets.For years, corporate tax dodgers have taken full advantage of all the benefits of being American companies, while searching out every possible way to avoid paying American taxes. Now that other leading countries are starting to get tough on tax enforcement, these tax dodgers suddenly want to move their money back to the United States. When they do, they should pay their fair share, just as working families and small businesses have been all along.Elizabeth Warren is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Upgrades Autopilot in Cars on the Road", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla Motors, always ahead of the automotive curve, is conducting a remarkable technological feat.Starting this week and continuing in the coming days, the company is using the cellular network to beam new software to update the Autopilot driver-assistance system on approximately 70,000 of its cars. Tesla\u2019s ability to communicate with its vehicles to download major enhancements and fixes, much as Apple updates iPhones, is beyond the capability of other automakers.But then, no other automaker has an on-the-road system as experimental as Autopilot, or perhaps the need to make midcourse corrections to such a fundamental feature of its vehicles.The company has described the Autopilot update as intended to avoid the sort of errors that contributed to a Tesla owner\u2019s fatal crash in May on a Florida highway. The most evident change might be visual and audible reminders that drivers should keep their hands on the steering wheel.It is an implicit scale-back of the company\u2019s original promotion of Autopilot, introduced last October, as essentially a self-driving car system. At the time, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, said Autopilot was \u201cprobably better than a person right now.\u201dBut the company also acknowledged then that Autopilot was also only a beta system \u2014 a technical term for an experimental version. As such, the update now underway is a tacit acknowledgment that the self-driving-car experiment Tesla has been conducting on the public highways is still very much a work in progress.\u201cThey\u2019re able to take a risk and put a system out that they admit wasn\u2019t fully baked,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a research director at the Gartner Group. \u201cBut they have this ability to improve it. It\u2019s much more of a software mind-set. You get it out there and then you do software patches to fix the bugs.\u201dThe approach, Mr. Ramsey added, comes with some risk. \u201cYou have live human beings in there,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018so you can debate whether that\u2019s the best way to do it.\u201dTesla declined to comment for this article.The policy guidelines do raise concerns about semiautonomous systems that \u2014 like Autopilot \u2014 are designed to perform many of the driving duties but still require human drivers to stay alert and be ready to take control at a moment\u2019s notice. Otherwise, the technology could be considered \u201can unreasonable risk to safety and subject to recall.\u201dAnthony Foxx, secretary of transportation, said at a news conference this week that the new guidelines were not aimed at Tesla. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is still investigating the Florida accident.The question now is how just how new and improved Autopilot actually is \u2014 and whether a software download is sufficient to address what Tesla\u2019s many critics say are the inherent shortcomings of the autonomous driving system.One of those perceived drawbacks is Autopilot\u2019s assumption that an attentive driver can and will take over control of the car in the event of an emergency. Researchers at other companies at work on self-driving cars \u2014 including Ford Motor and Google \u2014 have concluded that this so-called handoff can never happen quickly enough to be fully safe.After Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was killed driving a Tesla Model S in the first fatality involving a self-driving car, questions have arisen about the safety of the car\u2019s technology.The new Tesla software, called Version 8.0, also makes a significant change to the way Autopilot scans the road and recognizes objects. The previous version depended heavily on the forward-looking camera to sense surroundings. In the fatal Florida collision, the camera did not see a white tractor-trailer against a bright sky.The new version of Autopilot relies more heavily on the car\u2019s radar to identify other vehicles and potential obstacles, and to decide when to steer to avoid a problem or apply the brakes.The elevation of radar might seem a modest difference. But it runs counter to the widely held view that radar, while highly accurate in measuring distance, is less precise in determining the shape and size of objects.\u201cI\u2019m not completely sure how Tesla is able to recognize and classify objects\u201d with radar, said Jeremy Carlson, a senior automotive analyst at the forecaster IHS Markit. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear there are changes in the new software in the radar sensor that are doing something in a very different way.\u201dOther automakers argue that cameras are better at recognizing and classifying objects.\u201cRadar is good at telling the distance to an object but not very good at recognizing what it is,\u201d said Hideki Hada, general manager of Toyota Motor\u2019s integrated vehicle systems group in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cCameras can tell what an object is, but it\u2019s not so good at telling the distance. So you need both.\u201dDespite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.Companies at work on fully self-driving cars contend that conventional cameras and radar are not sufficient to enable a vehicle to sense and respond to its surroundings. They plan to incorporate an additional technology: a laser-powered type of radar called lidar.Tesla argues that its current technology is adequate for Autopilot\u2019s purposes. But in a Sept. 11 conference call announcing the upgrade, Mr. Musk acknowledged the challenge of using radar to identify objects.The world, he said, looks \u201cweird\u201d in radar. Metal objects, because they strongly reflect radar waves, can appear larger than they are. Wood and plastic can appear \u201cas transparent as glass.\u201d Radar sensors tend to give \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2014 instances when they think the car should brake when it actually doesn\u2019t need to.The new Autopilot software has algorithms to adjust for radar\u2019s distortions, according to Mr. Musk. And if the radar sees a large, dense, metal object \u2014 like a truck \u2014 the radar sensor can slow or brake the car, even if the camera system can\u2019t identify the object, he said.Mr. Musk predicted that the new Autopilot system was \u201creally going to be beyond what people expect\u201d and would make the Tesla Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle \u201cby far\u201d the safest cars on the road.Mr. Ramsey, the research director at Gartner, noted that Tesla was able to release Autopilot last year without having committed to a crucial engineering question \u2014 Is the radar or the camera the primary sensor? \u2014 knowing the company could modify and improve it later.\u201cThey can take a risk like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes them truly distinct from other automakers.\u201dWhether public experiments are the best approach to highway safety is another matter. \u201cI\u2019m sure they are very confident the cars are safe,\u201d Mr. Ramsey said, \u201cbut they are kind of doing trial and error.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Daily Report: Uber and Google, Ride-Sharing \u2018Frenemies\u2019", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsSilicon Valley is a bit like junior high school. Sometimes friends become enemies. Enemies become friends. And \u201cfrenemies\u201d stay somewhere in between \u2014 just don\u2019t share a secret with them.So it is with Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company and arguably the most influential company in the tech industry, and Uber, the still young ride-hailing service that also happens to be one the most valuable privately held companies in the world.There may have been a time when Google and Uber were friends. GV, the current name of Alphabet\u2019s investment arm, invested in Uber, after all. Uber certainly benefited from working with Google\u2019s mobile operating system, and it has long used Google\u2019s maps (though it is working on its own now).But somewhere along the way, the two started to drift apart. Google has been working on a self-driving-car project for years and has been testing the vehicles on the streets of Silicon Valley. Last year, Uber hired some of the best minds in the autonomous-vehicle world from Carnegie Mellon University and created its own self-driving-car research center.And last week, Uber acquired a self-driving-truck start-up founded and heavily populated by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 former Google employees. To top it off, Uber plans to start testing self-driving Uber cars in Pittsburgh next month.Google has a history of executives who serve on the boards of companies that could soon be competitors, of course. Eric E. Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, was a member of Apple\u2019s board when his company was developing Android, a direct competitor to the Apple iPhone. Steve Jobs, legend has it, was not very happy about it.So perhaps that junior high lesson stands: Watch what you say around your frenemies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tesla and Apple Could Be Good for Each Other", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsGreat partnerships are often forged when each party enjoys a surplus of something the other needs, and there\u2019s little conflict in their ambitions. By that logic, two of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known firms, Apple and Tesla Motors, really need each other right now. An investment in Tesla by Apple in return for some of the carmaker\u2019s innovation dust might be just the ticket.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is revamping the company\u2019s approach to self-driving cars and its broader role in the future of transportation. He just fired some of the company\u2019s autonomous car team, according to The New York Times.At Tesla, the founder, Elon Musk, needs billions of dollars of capital as he ramps up the company toward its target of making 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018. He could also use an injection of corporate credibility as his proposed deal to buy his solar-panel venture SolarCity, also publicly traded, appears to be running into unanticipated headwinds.The idea of Apple acquiring Tesla in its entirety isn\u2019t new. It surfaced even before Mr. Cook poached some of Mr. Musk\u2019s engineers a year ago. That move prompted Mr. Musk to tell a German newspaper: \u201cIf you don\u2019t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.\u201d But it might not require a full purchase to address the strategic challenges of the two companies \u2014 which, arguably, are each becoming most prominent in areas where the other could fairly easily help.Mr. Musk\u2019s hurdles are the most obvious. The entrepreneur who runs the $30-odd billion Tesla is struggling to persuade investors of the merits of his plan for Tesla to acquire SolarCity. The deal, worth $2.6 billion when announced in early August, is supposed to create a \u201cvertically integrated sustainable energy company.\u201d Last week the deal was publicly panned by James S. Chanos, a prominent hedge fund manager. By the math of the all-share deal, its market-implied chances of success have been falling, too. Shares of SolarCity closed on Monday nearly 25 percent below Tesla\u2019s offer price.The acquisition and the potential conflicts it throws up are a distraction for Mr. Musk from Tesla\u2019s carmaking ambitions, not to mention from the task of proving the safety of the company\u2019s Autopilot feature after a fatal crash in May. Even if investors decide to back him in buying SolarCity, any slippage in either company\u2019s plan could hurt its ability to hit up investors for additional funding. Both need regular cash injections \u2014 over $2 billion each last year \u2014 to fund operating and capital investment outflows.Apple could easily address Tesla\u2019s capital problem by buying, say, a 20 percent stake. While dilutive to existing owners \u2014 including Mr. Musk, who owns about 21 percent \u2014 that would bring in nearly $8 billion at $215 a share, just under a 5 percent premium to Monday\u2019s market closing price.For Apple, with more than $230 billion of idle cash, the investment would be close to a rounding error. Its shareholders would probably rejoice at converting a sliver of money in the bank for a placeholder in an emerging leader in self-driving cars. Unlike a full purchase, buying a minority stake will not dilute Apple\u2019s profitability, either. The company has projected gross margins of around 38 percent in its next fiscal quarter.Now, what could Tesla do for Apple? With a market capitalization north of $600 billion, Mr. Cook\u2019s business is doing fine at the moment. Shares of the company have gained some 5 percent since the iPhone 7 was unveiled earlier this month. Pre-orders for the new handset have been robust despite reviews that largely called it an incremental advance on its predecessor. Features like wireless earbuds are novel, but hardly game-changing.Many analysts, investors and observers want Apple to develop more new products. Its last big product introduction, of watches, was a relative dud. Since the devices went on sale in April 2015, Apple\u2019s shares have fallen 8 percent, and investors fret that the company has been running short of new ideas. At the same time, shares of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, have rallied by nearly 50 percent.One area in which Alphabet appears to be further ahead is self-driving vehicles. Apple doesn\u2019t talk publicly about its plans in the car business, but earlier this month it fired dozens of staff members and closed parts of its so-called Titan project, focused on autonomous cars.Ideas are something Mr. Musk has in abundance. In addition to running Tesla and creating SolarCity, he\u2019s trying to make a going concern of space travel and freight through Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. In his spare time, he also hatched the Hyperloop, an idea to use air pressure to speed human beings through tubes at extraordinary speeds.In that respect, he resembles Steven P. Jobs. Even when Apple was in its relative infancy in 1986, its co-founder bankrolled the creation of Pixar, the animation studio. For two decades, that side project put him in conflict with some of the media companies whose content would become a key attraction for iPhone users. In 2006, a year before introducing the handset that changed the world, Mr. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney for $7.4 billion in stock; Disney put him on its board.With competition no longer an issue, Mr. Jobs became a consigliere to Disney\u2019s boss, Robert A. Iger, who told Fortune after the Apple founder died: \u201cWe would stand in front of a whiteboard and talk about ideas. And every once in a while he\u2019d come to me thinking the sky\u2019s falling apart and that our business was screwed. And I\u2019d say, \u2018Tell me how.\u2019\u201dThat sort of relationship would probably be hard to develop between a chief executive and a subordinate \u2014 one argument against Apple swallowing Tesla whole. But as a collaboration, with shared goals and running businesses that work together rather than competing for talent and customers, a functional Cook-Musk partnership might serve both companies\u2019 shareholders.As part of the deal, Apple could fold its wobbly car operations into a joint venture with Tesla, add a couple of directors to Tesla\u2019s board \u2014 helping to handle deals with the likes of SolarCity \u2014 and bring Mr. Musk onto its own. Of course, the two executives would have to be capable of playing nice. Mr. Musk might have to walk back his crack last year that Apple was the \u201cTesla graveyard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At various moments, he had to take over the wheel and turn through intersections where locals are known to speed. When a truck driver backed out into the road illegally, he put his foot on the brake, immediately taking control of the car.If the safety engineer felt unsafe, he could at any time smack down a big red button in the center console \u2014 suspiciously similar to a seat ejector switch from a James Bond film \u2014 to disengage from self-driving mode. To turn the self-driving feature back on, he need only press a sleek steel button next to an embossed nameplate stamped on the console.If I felt unsafe as a passenger, I could also request that the driver take over the vehicle, or press a button on a screen facing the back seat that would end the ride. I also monitored the infrared environment the car had rendered from the screen, a 3-D world updating in real time, and took a selfie from a camera built into the console. After the ride, Uber texts to passengers an animated GIF of the 3-D modeled route taken, along with the selfie.But for most of the ride, I felt safe. In self-driving mode, turns and stops were near seamless, and I often had to check in with my driver to see whether he or the computer was steering the car. I did grow a bit nervous a few times when watching how close the computer drove us to cars parked on the right side of a street. Though, admittedly, that could have been my mind playing tricks on me by being more vigilant than usual about my surroundings.Raffi Krikorian, engineering director of Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Center, located in the city\u2019s industrial Strip District, put it this way: \u201cPittsburgh is the double-black diamond of driving.\u201dThe challenge expressed in Mr. Krikorian\u2019s ski analogy is one that Uber has taken to heart. From the company\u2019s point of view, the self-driving vehicle operates more safely than any human driver.My driverless Uber stopped far behind cars in front of us at intersections. It stayed exactly at the speed limit \u2014 25 miles per hour where we drove \u2014 even when there was no traffic around. At one stoplight, the car waited for the green signal before turning right. The human drivers behind us were not pleased.As my ride in Boron 6 wound down \u2014 in total, I traveled roughly 20 miles in the vehicle \u2014 it was hard not to feel like a celebrity, or perhaps more like a Martian. Other motorists gawked, and a boy on a Razor scooter gaped at me from a corner, waving to his mother to come look.But how they will get rich from it remains unclear. Much of Uber\u2019s success has been based on the premise that people could share their idle cars with the public by driving during their spare time. A self-driving car obviates the need for human drivers, a clear source of tension among Uber drivers today. Company executives said self-driving cars would be only one part of Uber\u2019s business in the future, with a mix of drivers and autonomous vehicles.All of these companies face an uncertain regulatory environment for driverless vehicles that could impede the rollouts of the cars across the country.There will be delays and bugs, such as the one I encountered my first time behind the wheel when the self-driving car didn\u2019t drive itself. That\u2019s the whole point of the pilot test. The wealth of sensors and recording equipment will see what happens \u2014 warts and all \u2014 \u201cso we can learn more about what makes drivers and riders comfortable and safe,\u201d said Emily Duff Bartel, a product manager at the Advanced Technologies Center.For me, it took about 10 minutes of troubleshooting to work through the glitches, but Boron 6 eventually turned on and started driving itself. That is, after a little bit of human intervention.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when the Chinese government television news channel reported that a driver of a Tesla with autonomous features had been killed in a crash.

{"Headline": "How Tesla and Apple Could Be Good for Each Other", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsGreat partnerships are often forged when each party enjoys a surplus of something the other needs, and there\u2019s little conflict in their ambitions. By that logic, two of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known firms, Apple and Tesla Motors, really need each other right now. An investment in Tesla by Apple in return for some of the carmaker\u2019s innovation dust might be just the ticket.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is revamping the company\u2019s approach to self-driving cars and its broader role in the future of transportation. He just fired some of the company\u2019s autonomous car team, according to The New York Times.At Tesla, the founder, Elon Musk, needs billions of dollars of capital as he ramps up the company toward its target of making 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018. He could also use an injection of corporate credibility as his proposed deal to buy his solar-panel venture SolarCity, also publicly traded, appears to be running into unanticipated headwinds.The idea of Apple acquiring Tesla in its entirety isn\u2019t new. It surfaced even before Mr. Cook poached some of Mr. Musk\u2019s engineers a year ago. That move prompted Mr. Musk to tell a German newspaper: \u201cIf you don\u2019t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.\u201d But it might not require a full purchase to address the strategic challenges of the two companies \u2014 which, arguably, are each becoming most prominent in areas where the other could fairly easily help.Mr. Musk\u2019s hurdles are the most obvious. The entrepreneur who runs the $30-odd billion Tesla is struggling to persuade investors of the merits of his plan for Tesla to acquire SolarCity. The deal, worth $2.6 billion when announced in early August, is supposed to create a \u201cvertically integrated sustainable energy company.\u201d Last week the deal was publicly panned by James S. Chanos, a prominent hedge fund manager. By the math of the all-share deal, its market-implied chances of success have been falling, too. Shares of SolarCity closed on Monday nearly 25 percent below Tesla\u2019s offer price.The acquisition and the potential conflicts it throws up are a distraction for Mr. Musk from Tesla\u2019s carmaking ambitions, not to mention from the task of proving the safety of the company\u2019s Autopilot feature after a fatal crash in May. Even if investors decide to back him in buying SolarCity, any slippage in either company\u2019s plan could hurt its ability to hit up investors for additional funding. Both need regular cash injections \u2014 over $2 billion each last year \u2014 to fund operating and capital investment outflows.Apple could easily address Tesla\u2019s capital problem by buying, say, a 20 percent stake. While dilutive to existing owners \u2014 including Mr. Musk, who owns about 21 percent \u2014 that would bring in nearly $8 billion at $215 a share, just under a 5 percent premium to Monday\u2019s market closing price.For Apple, with more than $230 billion of idle cash, the investment would be close to a rounding error. Its shareholders would probably rejoice at converting a sliver of money in the bank for a placeholder in an emerging leader in self-driving cars. Unlike a full purchase, buying a minority stake will not dilute Apple\u2019s profitability, either. The company has projected gross margins of around 38 percent in its next fiscal quarter.Now, what could Tesla do for Apple? With a market capitalization north of $600 billion, Mr. Cook\u2019s business is doing fine at the moment. Shares of the company have gained some 5 percent since the iPhone 7 was unveiled earlier this month. Pre-orders for the new handset have been robust despite reviews that largely called it an incremental advance on its predecessor. Features like wireless earbuds are novel, but hardly game-changing.Many analysts, investors and observers want Apple to develop more new products. Its last big product introduction, of watches, was a relative dud. Since the devices went on sale in April 2015, Apple\u2019s shares have fallen 8 percent, and investors fret that the company has been running short of new ideas. At the same time, shares of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, have rallied by nearly 50 percent.One area in which Alphabet appears to be further ahead is self-driving vehicles. Apple doesn\u2019t talk publicly about its plans in the car business, but earlier this month it fired dozens of staff members and closed parts of its so-called Titan project, focused on autonomous cars.Ideas are something Mr. Musk has in abundance. In addition to running Tesla and creating SolarCity, he\u2019s trying to make a going concern of space travel and freight through Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. In his spare time, he also hatched the Hyperloop, an idea to use air pressure to speed human beings through tubes at extraordinary speeds.In that respect, he resembles Steven P. Jobs. Even when Apple was in its relative infancy in 1986, its co-founder bankrolled the creation of Pixar, the animation studio. For two decades, that side project put him in conflict with some of the media companies whose content would become a key attraction for iPhone users. In 2006, a year before introducing the handset that changed the world, Mr. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney for $7.4 billion in stock; Disney put him on its board.With competition no longer an issue, Mr. Jobs became a consigliere to Disney\u2019s boss, Robert A. Iger, who told Fortune after the Apple founder died: \u201cWe would stand in front of a whiteboard and talk about ideas. And every once in a while he\u2019d come to me thinking the sky\u2019s falling apart and that our business was screwed. And I\u2019d say, \u2018Tell me how.\u2019\u201dThat sort of relationship would probably be hard to develop between a chief executive and a subordinate \u2014 one argument against Apple swallowing Tesla whole. But as a collaboration, with shared goals and running businesses that work together rather than competing for talent and customers, a functional Cook-Musk partnership might serve both companies\u2019 shareholders.As part of the deal, Apple could fold its wobbly car operations into a joint venture with Tesla, add a couple of directors to Tesla\u2019s board \u2014 helping to handle deals with the likes of SolarCity \u2014 and bring Mr. Musk onto its own. Of course, the two executives would have to be capable of playing nice. Mr. Musk might have to walk back his crack last year that Apple was the \u201cTesla graveyard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Rethinking Strategy on Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is rethinking what it plans to do about self-driving cars, just as other big tech companies appear ready to plow ahead with competing efforts.In a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.The job cuts are the latest sign of trouble with Apple\u2019s car initiative. The company has added resources to the project \u2014 code-named Titan \u2014 over the last two years, but it has struggled to make progress. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort.Apple is not the only big tech company pursuing autonomous driving technology. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has tested self-driving cars on the road for years, but its focus has been on designing the underlying software and systems to make that technology work. Tesla has a self-driving feature within its cars that has come under scrutiny in recent months after a fatal accident was connected to its use.Separately, Uber, in a limited test in Pittsburgh next week, plans to start picking up passengers in self-driving cars. Last month, Uber also acquired the start-up Otto for about $700 million, a purchase that brought with it some of the top minds in robotics and autonomous technology.And automakers like Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have all said they expect to put a number of self-driving vehicles on the road in five years or less.But Apple has stood out from the others mainly \u2014 as is often the case with the company \u2014 for its secrecy. Apple has never acknowledged that it is working on a car, though Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said the automotive industry is undergoing a drastic change and, earlier this year, he seemed to confirm the existence of the car project at its annual shareholders meeting.\u201cDo you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren\u2019t sure what was going to be downstairs?\u201d Mr. Cook said at the meeting. \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be Christmas Eve for a while.\u201dApple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a \u201creboot\u201d of the car project, the people briefed on it said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Electric cars rely not on the internal combustion engine, but on technologies more prevalent in the consumer electronics world: batteries, sensors and software. In addition, self-driving cars could change the traditional notions of public transportation and car ownership.Apple started looking seriously into building an electric car about two years ago. It expanded the project quickly, poaching experts in battery technology and so-called machine vision, as well as veterans from the automobile industry.The team also pulled in staff members from other divisions across Apple, growing to more than 1,000 employees in about 18 months. But as the project grew rapidly, it encountered a number of problems, and people working on it struggled to explain what Apple could bring to a self-driving car that other companies could not, according to the people briefed on the project.Steven Zadesky, a longtime Apple employee initially charged with heading the car effort, left the company for personal reasons this year. His departure opened the door for Mr. Mansfield, who worked closely with Apple\u2019s co-founder, Steve Jobs, but left the company\u2019s executive team in 2013.He had all but retired from Apple except for the occasional visit to the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. He was coaxed into coming back to oversee the project, which could represent a new market for Apple as sales of its flagship iPhone are slowing.Apple has also made some headway in the space. The company has a number of fully autonomous vehicles in the middle of testing, using limited operating routes in a closed environment, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s plans. Like other companies in the space, that technology is likely a number of years away from seeing mainstream consumer use, they added.Katie Benner and Mike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Rather, they want to foster \u201cpublic understanding\u201d and set \u201cbest practices\u201d for work in artificial intelligence.\u201cWe passionately believe in the potential for it to transform in a positive way our world,\u201d said Mustafa Suleyman, head of applied A.I. for DeepMind, an artificial intelligence development company acquired by Google in 2014. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s critical now to start to think about new models of engagement with the public, new models of collaboration across the industry and new models of transparency around the work that we do.\u201dThe group released eight tenets that are evocative of Isaac Asimov\u2019s original \u201cThree Laws of Robotics,\u201d which appeared in a science fiction story in 1942. The new principles include high-level ideals such as, \u201cWe will seek to ensure that A.I. technologies benefit and empower as many people as possible.\u201dNevertheless, at least one of the tenets implies that the companies realize they could be drawn into sticky ethical situations, and it calls on engineers to oppose the use of artificial intelligence technology in weapons or other tools that could be used to violate human rights.\u201cWith the hyperbole about A.I. over the last two to four years, there have been concerns in an echo chamber of anxiety that the government itself will be misinformed,\u201d said Eric Horvitz, managing director for Microsoft Research.The researchers said they were talking with other companies like Apple and research laboratories like the new nonprofit research group OpenAI about participating in their organization.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ireland to Appeal Tax Ruling in Apple Case", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "Supported byThe move comes despite increasing division among Irish ministers over whether to appeal the ruling issued by Europe\u2019s competition authorities.Several lawmakers have questioned such a move, given that the tax penalty is equivalent to what the country pays annually to fund its national health care system. That debate has intensified since Ireland has faced almost a decade of austerity after the financial crisis.Despite the tension, the Irish government unanimously backed the appeal against the tax ruling, though the country\u2019s Parliament will be reconvened on Wednesday to debate the decision.\u201cI believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland\u2019s interests,\u201d Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, said in a statement on Friday.A review of the country\u2019s corporate tax system will also be held to evaluate the complicated structures that multinational companies in Ireland often use to reduce their overall tax obligations. The review, whose details will be outlined in the coming days, will not look at the country\u2019s 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, one of the lowest in the West.\u201cWe need to ensure that Ireland\u2019s corporation tax code meets these new standards while remaining competitive,\u201d Mr. Noonan added, in reference to a push by governments worldwide to crack down on complex practices used by companies to reduce their overall tax payments.Mr. Cook, in an interview with the Irish broadcaster RTE, said Europe\u2019s tax clawback was political motivated, \u201cmaddening\u201d and would be overturned on appeal.\u201cThe finding is wrongheaded,\u201d Mr. Cook told RTE. \u201cIt\u2019s not true: There wasn\u2019t a special deal between Ireland and Apple.\u201dA spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.This week\u2019s ruling over how Ireland treated Apple and its tax practices has led to an increasingly bitter debate between Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top competition official, and those who argue that her agency has overstepped its remit. Many have claimed that the commission does not have the right to review national tax rules, and that it should not retroactively decide on how certain tax practices should work.\u201cAll of us benefit when businesses pay their fair share of tax,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the interest of the individuals and businesses who do pay tax, if others aren\u2019t paying their share.\u201dThe appeals by the Irish government and Apple are expected to last years. Mr. Cook has said the tech giant will set aside money \u2014 based on the calculations of Apple\u2019s back taxes \u2014 in an escrow account if the court eventually sides with the commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yesterday, Outraged by Apple\u2019s Tax Dodge. Today, by Its Tax Bill.", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "Supported byTax avoidance has become a lightning rod as the presidential campaign has taken on a strong populist cast, and leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress have demanded that companies be forced to pay their fair share. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have vowed to crack down on deals that allow companies to relocate their headquarters overseas to lower their tax bills, and the Treasury Department has made limiting international loopholes a priority.And for at least some American politicians, the anger stems from a simple calculation: The tax money that the European Union extracts from Apple should be going to the United States Treasury, not that they have figured out how to make that happen.Most lawmakers and business groups do not see it that way. They defended Apple by arguing that the European Union was overstepping its authority and reinterpreting international tax law to unfairly penalize the company. Some called it a new brand of protectionism.In Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe.The European Commission \u201cis using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view,\u201d Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend\u2019s meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies.He pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion, saying legislation that prevents companies from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the United States \u201cwill see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration.\u201dThe European Commission\u2019s ruling has even managed to forge a rare moment of agreement between the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who is likely to become the next leader of his party in the Senate.\u201cThis decision is awful,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement. \u201cSlamming a company with a giant tax bill \u2014 years after the fact \u2014 sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201dMr. Schumer said in an interview that he and Mr. Ryan had been discussing possibilities for a corporate tax overhaul for next year. He said he was optimistic about the prospect of requiring corporate money to return to the United States at a lower tax rate, with some of the proceeds being used to fund a large investment in infrastructure.The action taken by the European Union, he said, should be an impetus to get moving on such legislation.\u201cThe European Union is going to grab this money, instead of the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big signpost here for us. Let\u2019s get moving.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect our U.S. tax base. That money sitting over there should be here in the U.S., not in Ireland and not in the E.U.\u201dThe bipartisan \u201cconsensus\u201d that the corporate tax rate should be cut in exchange for loopholes closures emerged in President Obama\u2019s first term, yet Congress has not formally drafted a bill, much less voted on one. Tax experts said that without a deep cut in the tax rate, companies like Apple would be better off paying back taxes in Europe than repatriating their overseas cash.\u201cThis is not taking 13 billion euros out of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s pocket and U.S. taxpayers\u2019 pocket and putting it into Europe,\u201d said Jeffery M. Kadet, a tax lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be bringing this money back to the U.S. anyway.\u201d\u201cJust because it happens to be an American company, to say that the European Union should not take action, I think, is the height of hypocrisy,\u201d Mr. Avi-Yonah said.\u201cThe royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U.S. should be taxed in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cBut Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U.S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland.\u201dBlaming Apple and the Internal Revenue Service, he added, \u201cWhen Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them.\u201dIt remains to be seen if corporate tax reform will be a priority for the next administration, but the language used by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on the campaign trail suggests that it is a strong possibility.Mrs. Clinton has released a formal proposal to prevent so-called corporate inversions and to reward companies that keep their operations in the United States. Mr. Trump, who has called for a boycott of Apple products, has threatened to punish companies that relocate to other countries by imposing taxes on products they sell in the United States.The news that a corporate giant might have evaded billions of dollars in taxes could become another populist rallying cry.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders did so well in the campaign this year,\u201d Mr. Gascoigne, of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said. \u201cPeople are fed up with the kinds of back-room deals that are happening at the large multinational companies at the expense of the American people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the New Apple iPhone Have a Headphone Jack? Rumormongers Say It Won\u2019t", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 If Apple had its way, this week would play out like Christmas for 5-year-olds. First, unbelievable anticipation. Then, great surprise. At the end, immense satisfaction.Anyone who cares enough about the iPhone to know that a new model is being released this month already knows what it is supposed to be like: a little thinner, a little faster and equipped with superior cameras on the Plus model.By far the most controversial feature, however, is the one that will be missing: a headphone jack. A standard element of technology that can be traced back to 1878 and the invention of the manual telephone exchange, the jack is apparently going the way of the floppy disk and the folding map. The future will be wireless.We know about this potential absence thanks to a global information chain, one that shadows the supply and manufacturing chain that produces Apple\u2019s products. The shadow chain is intended to ferret out Apple rumors: promoting them, discussing them and then discussing them some more, long before they become facts.This rumor mill is both a gift to Apple and a burden, a sign that it has not lost its magic and a warning that everyone is on watch for the moment it does. No other company is tracked quite so relentlessly.Things have not quite worked out that way.\u201cWhen Steve Jobs was around, there was still that hope they could surprise you,\u201d said Gene Munster, an Apple analyst. \u201cToday, that hope is largely gone.\u201dFor anyone not ready to go wireless, the story said, wired earphones would plug into the iPhone via Apple\u2019s Lightning connector, which is typically used for charging power. Traditional headphones would presumably work through a converter.This was big. \u201cHeadphones are one of the most basic functions, so this is something that\u2019s going to affect users of all kinds,\u201d said Eric Slivka, editor in chief of MacRumors.com. \u201cI immediately knew it would be an extremely controversial topic all the way until launch.\u201d\u201cAny thinner and I\u2019ll lose it into the time-space continuum forever,\u201d one commenter joked.MacRumors exists for these kinds of moments. So does AppleInsider, Cult of Mac, 9to5Mac and similar sites in various languages, all of which picked up the news and chewed it over. During the next six weeks, helped along by further stories on Chinese blogs, the mainstream media picked it up as well.A Fast Company article announced that Apple would be dropping the jack \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s True,\u201d read the headline \u2014 and added that the iPhone would probably support wireless charging and be waterproof.Some commentators explained that even if people used adapters with their old headphones, they were gaining things, too. Other commentators noted that people complained that Apple never innovated anymore, and yet here it was innovating, and people were complaining anyway.Perhaps it is better to be forewarned about what the future holds rather than be forced to confront it abruptly. \u201cWe soften the blow,\u201d said Neil Hughes, managing editor of AppleInsider. \u201cCan you imagine that if no one saw it coming and Apple just dropped this on Wednesday? People would lose their minds.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ve reached peak iPhone,\u201d said Seth Weintraub, of 9to5Mac.But only for the moment. Even as the Apple faithful wait to see all these rumors confirmed, the scuttlebutt and speculation have started about next year\u2019s model. It will be the iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary, which means the stakes are going up.\u201cApple is hopefully turning on the development afterburners,\u201d Mr. Weintraub said. \u201cWe hear it wants the phone to resemble a sleek glass slab. It\u2019s supposed to be a statement, a really big deal.\u201dAssuming, of course, the rumors are true.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Allo\u2019s Tryout: 5 Days With Google\u2019s Annoying Office Intern", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYou may now have more messaging apps than you have close friends.\u201cHaving more apps than close friends doesn\u2019t help, as something will have to go,\u201d Mr. Dunbar said in an email, though he noted that the various messaging apps serve different purposes. Younger people are shying away from chatting on Facebook, for example, to have more private conversations on apps like WhatsApp.With that backdrop in mind, I tested Allo for five days and compared it with the apps that are most similar to it: Google Hangouts, Apple iMessage and Facebook Messenger.After weighing the pros and cons, my advice is that people can hold off on downloading Allo, largely because its artificially intelligent assistant was unhelpful. But if Allo matures, users will probably want to ditch the Hangouts app.First, some context about Allo. Google announced the app in May, aiming to highlight the company\u2019s push into artificial intelligence. Its older chat app, Hangouts, will remain, but Google will emphasize that product\u2019s use as a videoconferencing and messaging app for businesses.To understand how Allo works, it\u2019s easiest to think of the app\u2019s A.I. assistant as an office intern who is lurking in the background, eager to chime in. The assistant analyzes messages you have typed or dictated and, when appropriate, springs into action with automatically generated phrases you can choose to reply with or suggestions for Google searches that may help accomplish tasks.When you\u2019re having a conversation with another person, for example, the assistant suggests ways it can help. Saying \u201cWant to see a movie tonight?\u201d prompts the assistant to offer a Google search for movie showtimes or to reply with suggestions like \u201cSure, what time?\u201d or \u201cNot really.\u201dHere is where Allo became frustrating for me. Asking an assistant to search \u201cmovie showtimes tonight\u201d should load a list of movies and corresponding showtimes. Instead, Google\u2019s assistant shows a list of movies without showtimes; only after tapping on a film can you ask for times.Sometimes that doesn\u2019t even work. Asking for showtimes for the movie \u201cSnowden\u201d loaded movies playing at a movie theater called UA Snowden Square Stadium 14. Not helpful \u2014 unless, of course, you live in Columbia, Md.Allo also tries to guess what your written response might be to certain types of phrases, questions or photos. With photos, the app occasionally identifies what\u2019s inside the photo to generate a suggested reaction. So when you receive a photo of a dog, Allo loads responses like \u201cadorable.\u201dThis feature ran into several problems. When I sent a picture to a friend of my cat sitting inside my car, Allo suggested this response to the friend: \u201cWhat a cute car!\u201d (Sorry, Allo, but my Prius is the opposite of cute.)For now, Allo\u2019s artificial assistance feels limited. So if I were a manager seeking an assistant, I probably wouldn\u2019t hire Allo. But I would politely tell the candidate to reapply after getting more experience.Each messaging app has its own purpose, but Allo has the most in common with Facebook Messenger, iMessage and Google Hangouts. That\u2019s because all four are capable of adding some personality with stickers and emojis.So I tested Messenger, iMessage and Hangouts against Allo to determine their pros and cons. The highlights:\u25a0 iMessage, Hangouts and Messenger work on mobile devices and computers. Allo works only on Android and iOS mobile devices, though Google plans to expand Allo to computers later.\u25a0 iMessage and Messenger support third-party apps, adding features like sending money to friends within messages. Google has no plans to support outside apps in Allo.\u25a0 Messenger has more sticker packs than Allo, which has only about 25.\u25a0 IMessage stickers are more fun to use. In iMessage, stickers can be placed on top of messages and photos \u2014 add a cartoon mustache to your selfie, for example. On Allo, stickers can be sent only as stand-alone messages.\u25a0 The Hangouts app is very much like Allo, without the half-baked assistant. Allo has more entertaining stickers, including a muscular yellow bull that appears to be twerking. The big difference between the two is that the Hangouts app relies primarily on your contacts list linked to a Google Mail account, whereas Allo pulls contacts from your device\u2019s phone book.The upshot: iMessage and Messenger have more features than Allo. There are two major features missing from Allo: the ability to chat using a computer and using third-party apps and games to do more within messages.With Allo, Google has the opportunity to stand out by offering superior artificial intelligence. Neither Messenger nor Allo has great A.I. yet, but Google\u2019s assistant has a better start.Finally, there is privacy to consider. It\u2019s tough to say how Allo will fare in terms of security until encryption experts take a close look at the app.Here\u2019s what we know so far: By default, Apple\u2019s iMessage service is end-to-end encrypted, which means a message is encrypted when it is sent from your device and remains encrypted when it passes through Apple\u2019s server and reaches the recipient. Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger both lack end-to-end encryption, so at some point when messages pass through their servers, they can see your messages.Allo has end-to-end encryption turned off by default because its server needs to see the messages to work its A.I. magic. However, Allo includes a mode called Incognito with full encryption enabled, which people can use for private conversations, similar to a private mode on a web browser. But, of course, the A.I. features do not work in Incognito.So Allo is a step ahead of Hangouts and Messenger for privacy. But by default (and by design), it is not as secure as iMessage.I recommend waiting for Allo to become available on computers and for its A.I. to become smarter. At the moment, Allo\u2019s assistant will waste more time than it saves when it comes to helping you make plans, and it will probably make conversations more awkward.Google said it was still improving and refining its algorithms, and Allo\u2019s assistant will get better over time.Once Allo\u2019s assistant matures, the Hangouts app will become redundant and you\u2019ll be able to delete it from your device. The catch, of course, is that Allo\u2019s A.I. won\u2019t become sophisticated until more people use it and share feedback.For now, if I really need help, I\u2019m going to request a competent intern.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Pui-Wing\u2019s Week in Tech: Yahoo\u2019s Hacking, Self-Driving Cars and the Future of Twitter", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "Supported byBitsA few things stand out to me about this attack. It\u2019s obviously terrible for everyone whose information has been breached, and it also comes at a terrible time for Yahoo, which is in the process of selling most of its assets to Verizon. What happens to that sale, now, seems in question; this sort of disclosure could affect aspects of the deal, including the price. After all, although Yahoo has long been in decline, the company still has a loyal user base that has stuck with it for email and other web services. To the extent that those people are scared away by this breach, Verizon may well want to reconsider.What do you think? Are the endless Yahoo acquisition talks going to get even more endless now?But it\u2019s unclear how that might affect the price of the deal, or if Verizon will walk away from Yahoo. Hackings now happen all the time and to almost every corporate entity. So Verizon couldn\u2019t very well build in an escape clause on a deal for an industrywide problem, though it may have some leverage to chip away at price or some other deal conditions.All I know is that a horde of lawyers and investment bankers must be getting well paid right now to figure it all out.I suspect that like me, you\u2019ve noticed a huge change in Silicon Valley recently. From Uber to Tesla to Google to Apple, much of the industry has become obsessed with cars. Where we used to talk about smartphones and apps, we now talk about electric engines, location mapping and ride sharing.I\u2019m personally gratified to see this happening; cars are expensive, inefficient and environmentally problematic, exactly the sort of big challenge that techies want to fix. But I\u2019ve also heard grumbling both inside and outside the Valley that companies here are biting off more than they can chew in attacking the auto industry. Do you agree?Did I really just say that? Eyeroll.Finally, let\u2019s talk about my favorite pastime, Twitter. Several big things happened with the slow-growing 140-character social network. First, the 140 characters got a bit looser. As of this week, when you add images, links or other multimedia elements to your tweet, they won\u2019t count against the character limit. In other words, tweets got just a bit longer.These deals are something of a strategy shift for the company. It\u2019s looking to become a kind of TV network, the place you\u2019ll turn to first when you want to watch something. I think this is a great idea. Livestreaming sports, awards shows and other news events can be a hassle today \u2014 you\u2019ve got to find a link, usually log in with your cable-company account, and then you\u2019re often presented with some slow, blurry stream that makes you tear your hair out. Twitter, thankfully, is trying to solve this. It could be pretty handy.But it also seems a little bit of an odd game plan to save the company, right?But for now at least, I don\u2019t see it. The 13-year-olds are into Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest, even Musical.ly. Twitter? Not on their radar screen.Maybe Twitter needs to try something else, like making money off how brands use it for customer service. That sounds incredibly enterprise-y, but those boring businesses are often more predictable and profitable.Google isn\u2019t surprising. We\u2019ve heard rumors for years that the search company, which has perennially failed at building social apps, is interested in the microblogging network. But an acquisition by Salesforce is a stranger idea. I don\u2019t immediately get how it would work, and there\u2019s a very high chance that a business-focused cloud company could ruin the freewheeling network. But if Salesforce thinks of some out-of-the-box way to use Twitter as a customer service and lead-generation network, that could be lucrative.Anyway, thanks for joining me! I hope you spend the weekend bracing for Mike\u2019s return. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Talking to Vehicle Technology Companies", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant has been talking with McLaren, the automaker known for its Formula One racecars, about an investment in the company, according to two people briefed on the talks who asked to remain anonymous because the discussions were confidential.Apple is also in talks with Lit Motors, a San Francisco start-up that has developed an electric self-balancing motorcycle, about a potential acquisition, according to three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Apple has already hired several former Lit Motors engineers.Even as many Silicon Valley companies, including Google, Tesla and Uber, have embarked on electric and driverless car initiatives, Apple has kept quiet. Yet internally, it has pursued a car project, called Project Titan, which has had ups and downs in leadership and direction. The layoffs at the project this month came after the appointment of an Apple veteran, Bob Mansfield, to take over the effort.Inside Apple, employees recently described the company\u2019s efforts to build a car as a project lacking vision and in complete disarray. The recent layoffs, followed by Apple\u2019s pursuit of talent and expertise from outside companies, are part of the company\u2019s effort to \u201creboot\u201d the project, said people with knowledge of the layoffs.Apple declined to comment, as did Lit Motors. Wayne Bruce, a spokesman for McLaren, said in an emailed statement that the company was \u201cnot in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.\u201dBut McLaren did not deny having had conversations with Apple. In a phone call, Mr. Bruce added: \u201cThe nature of our business means we regularly have conversations with all sorts of parties, but those conversations remain confidential. We\u2019re not in a position to confirm or deny any previous conversation.\u201dA partnership with McLaren would allow Apple to tap into the carmaker\u2019s high-end automotive technology, forged by years of building Formula One racecars and selling sports cars topping $1 million.For years, McLaren has been recognized as an innovator in automotive technology. As one example, the company pioneered the use of a single device to control a car\u2019s engine, transmission and electrical systems.McLaren\u2019s sales are steadily growing, but the company\u2019s bet on research took a bite from its profit. In 2015, McLaren, which is backed by private shareholders, sold 1,654 cars, five more than the year before. Its profit slid 64 percent to about $7 million, from $19.4 million in 2014, in part because of increased spending on research.Unlike a more traditional automaker, McLaren does not have a large car production business to protect and could tap Apple\u2019s resources to make its technology available to the masses \u2014 if Apple decides to move forward with building its own automobile.An acquisition of Lit Motors could also help Apple rethink its strategy with building an electric car and bring engineering talent into the company.Mark Scott contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "IPhone 7 Review: Though Not Perfect, New iPhones Keep Apple\u2019s Promises", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixApple\u2019s iPhone, just short of 10 years old, has hit puberty.For Apple customers, this creates a difficult choice. While upgrading iPhones in the past was typically a no-brainer, now people must wrestle with whether to deal with the hassle of having no audio jack. Many people could simply upgrade to last year\u2019s model, the iPhone 6S, which is also a fast phone with great cameras and still has the jack.Yet after testing the new iPhone 7 and its larger sibling, the 7 Plus, for five days, I have hopped on the 7 train. While it is irritating not to have an audio jack \u2014 Apple nixed the 3.5 millimeter port to make room for faster chips, better batteries and to make the iPhone water-resistant \u2014 and the older physical home button feels better to press than the new virtual one, the new iPhones deliver on Apple\u2019s promises.The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are tremendously fast \u2014 more than double the speed of the two-year-old iPhone 6 \u2014 and their cameras produce superb, vivid photos. The battery life is improved, and the iPhones survived water torture tests.The bottom line: Those who have been waiting years to buy a new phone are in store for a major upgrade with the iPhone 7.Apple understood that parting with the audio jack would be painful. So it made two moves:1) The new iPhones include a converter, or a dongle with a Lightning connector on one side, for plugging into the iPhone, and an audio port on the other end, for plugging in an audio accessory.2) Also included in the box: A pair of wired earbuds with a Lightning connector.For iPhone owners who relied on Apple\u2019s included earbuds, the Lightning earbuds solve that problem. But for consumers hoarding lots of wired audio gear, the converter solution is less convenient since the adapter is tiny and easy to lose. If you have a pair of great wired headphones, your best bet is to leave the converter connected to the headphones so you don\u2019t forget it.The most convenient workaround to not having a headphone jack is to make the leap to wireless earphones. Apple\u2019s wireless AirPods, due for release in October, cost $159 and come in a box that resembles a dental-floss dispenser. They connect to the iPhone\u2019s Bluetooth connection via a proprietary chip in the earphones, called W1.This makes setting AirPods up extremely easy: When you open the box next to the iPhone, the earphones automatically pair with the device. (The box also charges AirPods.) From there, you simply put the earphones on and start listening to music or podcasts; removing the earphones causes the audio to pause.Here is where AirPods fell short for me: Sometimes when listening to podcasts, a glitch caused the podcasts to rewind and replay a small segment \u2014 an eerie echo. In addition, when using AirPods outside, there was occasional interference, causing the audio to crackle and cut out.An Apple spokeswoman said the company was looking into the podcast issue, adding that the AirPods I tested were early hardware and that bugs should be resolved by the time they are released next month.Over all, AirPods sound decent, with loud bass and clear audio quality, comparable to the wired earbuds that Apple has included in iPhones for years. They aren\u2019t, however, sufficient for drowning out the thunderous prattle of a loud co-worker.While AirPods do a good job staying in your ears, they look odd, like dangling short white stubs. They evoked mockery from one of my editors, who said, \u201cCigarettes belong in your mouth, not your ears, Brian.\u201dThe most compelling improvement on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is the sharp speed increase. Spurred by faster chips, everything \u2014 switching between apps, opening the camera \u2014 feels snappier. The iPhone 7 battery also gets about two hours more juice than the 6S.Using the app Geekbench 4, I tested the speeds of the iPhone 7, 6S and 6. The iPhone 7 was 39 percent faster than the 6S and 114 percent faster than the 6. So people who bought the 6S last year can probably skip upgrading to the 7, but those holding onto a 6 and anything older will benefit from a tremendous performance gain.Apple also improved the iPhone cameras. Like the 6S devices, the iPhone 7 devices carry 12-megapixel sensors. The difference is that both the new iPhones include optical image stabilization, a feature that helps photos remain clear even when your hands are shaky. The larger model, the 7 Plus, also includes a second camera on the back. The two cameras work together to show the photo\u2019s main subject clearly while gently blurring the background.In my tests comparing photos taken with the iPhone 6S, 7 and 7 Plus, as well as a competitor, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7, photos taken with the 7 Plus had noticeably better detail when reviewed on a large computer monitor. But when reviewing photos taken with each camera side by side on a smaller smartphone screen, the differences were negligible.So while the new iPhones have great cameras, I wouldn\u2019t let that drive your buying decision. If you prefer a larger screen for reading and watching videos, consider the 7 Plus, but if you prefer something easier to carry in a pocket and type on using one hand, go for the 7. (The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch screen; the 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen.)Lastly, Apple made changes to the new iPhones to improve durability. The iPhones are designed to be water-resistant. In my tests, they survived a swim in a water pitcher. The physical home button was replaced with a force-sensitive virtual one. It remains to be seen if the new home button will be more durable. In the past, one of the first components to wear out on older iPhones was the home button.There are two types of tech consumers: Those who upgrade on a fairly regular cycle (about every two years with smartphones) to embrace new technology, and those who upgrade only when they feel they need to.If you\u2019re in the former camp and own an iPhone that is at least two years old, the decision is obvious: The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are great upgrades. But if you just bought the iPhone 6S last year, the improvements will be incremental, and you may want to save your money for the next iPhone.If you\u2019re in the latter group, it\u2019s a tougher question. If you have, say, the four-year-old iPhone 5, you will see a great improvement with an iPhone 6S or a 7. Your decision may come down to how much the lack of a headphone jack and physical home button bothers you. Audiophiles with lots of wired accessories, for example, may find using a converter too inconvenient.But taking the leap to the 7 may be a wise bet, even for late technology adopters. Apple is likely to continue making iPhones without headphone jacks, and next year\u2019s iPhone will have a full-screen face with the virtual button built directly into the screen, according to two people at the company who spoke on condition of anonymity because the product details are private. Apple declined to comment on next year\u2019s iPhones.To compete with Apple, rivals may also eliminate the audio jack to make room for faster processors, better batteries and more durable parts. (A little-known fact: Lenovo beat Apple to removing the audio jack in its new smartphone, Moto Z, released this year.)Sooner or later, consumers will probably look back at the iPhone\u2019s puberty phase and accept that changes had to be made for the smartphone to mature. I, for one, am looking forward to a future with fewer wires.An earlier version of this article misstated a difference between the 6S devices and the iPhone 7 devices. Both of the iPhone 7 models will have optical image stabilization, as opposed to only one of the 6S models. It is not the case that neither of the 6S models had the feature.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Rethinking Strategy on Self-Driving Cars", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is rethinking what it plans to do about self-driving cars, just as other big tech companies appear ready to plow ahead with competing efforts.In a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.The job cuts are the latest sign of trouble with Apple\u2019s car initiative. The company has added resources to the project \u2014 code-named Titan \u2014 over the last two years, but it has struggled to make progress. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort.Apple is not the only big tech company pursuing autonomous driving technology. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has tested self-driving cars on the road for years, but its focus has been on designing the underlying software and systems to make that technology work. Tesla has a self-driving feature within its cars that has come under scrutiny in recent months after a fatal accident was connected to its use.Separately, Uber, in a limited test in Pittsburgh next week, plans to start picking up passengers in self-driving cars. Last month, Uber also acquired the start-up Otto for about $700 million, a purchase that brought with it some of the top minds in robotics and autonomous technology.And automakers like Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have all said they expect to put a number of self-driving vehicles on the road in five years or less.But Apple has stood out from the others mainly \u2014 as is often the case with the company \u2014 for its secrecy. Apple has never acknowledged that it is working on a car, though Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said the automotive industry is undergoing a drastic change and, earlier this year, he seemed to confirm the existence of the car project at its annual shareholders meeting.\u201cDo you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren\u2019t sure what was going to be downstairs?\u201d Mr. Cook said at the meeting. \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be Christmas Eve for a while.\u201dApple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a \u201creboot\u201d of the car project, the people briefed on it said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.Electric cars rely not on the internal combustion engine, but on technologies more prevalent in the consumer electronics world: batteries, sensors and software. In addition, self-driving cars could change the traditional notions of public transportation and car ownership.Apple started looking seriously into building an electric car about two years ago. It expanded the project quickly, poaching experts in battery technology and so-called machine vision, as well as veterans from the automobile industry.The team also pulled in staff members from other divisions across Apple, growing to more than 1,000 employees in about 18 months. But as the project grew rapidly, it encountered a number of problems, and people working on it struggled to explain what Apple could bring to a self-driving car that other companies could not, according to the people briefed on the project.Steven Zadesky, a longtime Apple employee initially charged with heading the car effort, left the company for personal reasons this year. His departure opened the door for Mr. Mansfield, who worked closely with Apple\u2019s co-founder, Steve Jobs, but left the company\u2019s executive team in 2013.He had all but retired from Apple except for the occasional visit to the company\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. He was coaxed into coming back to oversee the project, which could represent a new market for Apple as sales of its flagship iPhone are slowing.Apple has also made some headway in the space. The company has a number of fully autonomous vehicles in the middle of testing, using limited operating routes in a closed environment, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s plans.

Even the man who invented the web, Tim Berners-Lee, says he frequently throws up his hands.\u201cSometimes I will think that I bought something and I press the button, \u2018Buy this,\u2019 and I don\u2019t realize it didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said in a recent interview. \u201cWe are long overdue for a payments user interface for the web.\u201dResponding to the frustrations of Mr. Berners-Lee and hundreds of millions of online shoppers, the web\u2019s governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, has brought together the giants of the internet including Google, Facebook and Apple to fix the clumsiness of paying for things online.Now, a new global standard for online payments \u2014 a sort of Amazon one-click payment system for the entire internet \u2014 is being completed by the consortium and its members.Google, one of the authors of the standard, has recently introduced it in certain new versions of its Chrome browser. Other browser companies have said they intend to follow.The standard will provide a uniform way for users to input their credit cards and payment systems to any web browser so that they can be used for any purchase on the web. After the card details are entered once, they will automatically be called up as choices for all future transactions.This will be somewhat like the existing auto-fill functions that browsers have. But with the new standard, all the data fields will be filled in invisibly, requiring just one click.On the security side, rather than sending along all the credit card details, the browser will generate a one-time payment token that will avoid leaving your credit card number in countless databases around the world.Numerous efforts to modernize the payment system have failed to take off. And this one could fizzle, too, if online merchants, web browsers or consumers fail to adopt the new standard.The new standard will also face competition from the Amazons and PayPals of the world, as well as from the credit card networks, all of which want to be the primary destination for payments, rather than just one option.But payment analysts are hopeful about the new effort because it will not require consumers or merchants to use a new method of payment. Instead it will be equally open to any existing card or payment app, and it will channel them into a single place that most consumers already use \u2014 the web browser \u2014 where everything can be stored and used.\u201cInstead of simplifying the world, we have been fragmenting it into a million apps,\u201d said Eric Shea, a payments consultant at Kurt Salmon Digital. \u201cIf we can get back to that single integrated solution that everyone has on their phone and their desktop, that is the way to move forward and get adoption.\u201dDave Birch, a consultant who has been working on electronic payments for over two decades, said the web browser stood the best chance of providing a unified and more secure portal for payments.\u201cThere\u2019s a convergence going on,\u201d said Mr. Birch, who currently works for Consult Hyperion. \u201cIn the future you will have one experience \u2014 it won\u2019t matter if you are at the store or on the phone. It will pop up on your phone, you will put your thumb on it and you will be done.\u201dThe W3C project represents a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, the current giants of online payments. Both have gained business and fees with their more streamlined checkout processes.Neither company has participated in the current W3C effort and they are likely to continue to provide an alternative to customers who don\u2019t want to enter their details into their browsers.But the W3C has managed to bring in about 40 of the biggest players in online commerce, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and American Express as well as Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent.All met last week in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the specifications that they will introduce on different time frames to users around the world.In the version that Google released, when customers shopping at participating merchants hit the buy button, they are given a drop-down menu of their stored shipping addresses and credit cards.The customer can click on the address and card to be used, enter the three-digit security code on the card and hit \u201cpay now.\u201d Other browser companies may choose to use a fingerprint instead of the security code.\u201cWe wanted to remove what we jokingly call the Nascar effect of checkout, where you see five or seven logos for the different cards and payment methods you can use,\u201d said Zach Koch, the top Google executive on the project. \u201cThis is really fast, where a user can say, \u2018Tap, tap, buy.\u2019\u201dThe fees from transactions will still go to existing financial institutions like credit card companies and banks, unless customers choose a new online payment method like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. Apple Pay takes a piece of each transaction; Samsung Pay does not.But the bigger goal behind the W3C project is to create a standard, seamless and secure way to pay for things electronically in a future that will most likely include virtual reality stores, chat-based transactions and machines making payments to other machines (an autonomous car paying for a parking spot, for instance).The standard will also make it easy to include new payment methods like Bitcoin or the Chinese payment provider Tencent.\u201cThis involves quite radical changes to the way people think about payments,\u201d said Ian Jacobs, the W3C staff member leading the effort. \u201cAs a standards body it is our job to be sure it is an open playing field.\u201dThe need to create a better way to pay for things online was evident from the web\u2019s beginnings in the 1990s, Mr. Berners-Lee said. At some of the earliest meetings of the W3C, which he founded, there were discussions about creating a way to pay for things online that didn\u2019t require people to send credit card details over the internet.The failure to come up with a standard and secure way to do this led to the hodgepodge of payment screens consumers encounter today. It also made an opening for PayPal, which created a way for shoppers to pay on different sites using a single password.Mr. Birch said the main hurdle to accomplishing more seamless payments in the past was online merchants, who did not want to give up control over any part of the checkout process.But merchants have expressed increasing frustration with the high rate of abandoned online transactions and the frequency of credit card fraud.More than half of online purchases now happen on mobile phones, but Shopify has said that only 40 percent of the customers who start filling a shopping cart online finish their transactions.Shopify, which manages the online stores and checkout processes for 300,000 merchants, has been closely involved with the W3C effort and is planning to immediately offer the new standard to its merchants, as is Groupon.\u201cWe are betting a lot on it,\u201d said Jason Normore, the director of engineering at Shopify. \u201cEven though it cuts out a piece of our offering, it makes commerce better for everyone.\u201dApple will be one of the most interesting players to watch, given that it has both the Safari browser, which is part of the W3C effort, and Apple Pay, which could be seen as a competing offering.In the new operating system that Apple released last week, it is possible, for the first time, to shop online using the Safari browser and check out with Apple Pay. After hitting \u201cPay With Apple Pay,\u201d the customer is asked to provide a fingerprint on a phone, and the transaction is complete.The W3C standard will provide a similar experience on any browser \u2014 on a computer or phone \u2014 but will also allow customers to choose from any credit card or payment method they have entered into their browsers.Apple has so far been a part of the W3C group writing the standards, which will allow it to integrate non-Apple Pay choices into its browser.Mr. Berners-Lee said he hoped that more standardized payments would open up new types of online commerce that aren\u2019t possible now. He has long been interested in micropayments that would allow newspapers or small producers of content to be paid a few cents at a time, which isn\u2019t possible in a world with only credit cards.\u201cDifferent things call for different payments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are all interoperable you can separate the market for goods being sold from the payment back end.\u201dAn article on Monday about one-click shopping on the internet misstated the fee structure of one online payment method. While Apple Pay charges a fee on each transaction, Samsung Pay does not.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Samsung to Recall 2.5 Million Galaxy Note 7s Over Battery Fires", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A ubiquitous source of power in most modern technology, lithium-ion batteries keep cellphones, laptops, electric cars and airplanes running. They are also the source of many problems, with some overheating, catching fire and even exploding.In a potentially damaging episode, Samsung, the world\u2019s biggest maker of smartphones, announced on Friday that it would recall its Galaxy Note 7 model after discovering a flaw in the battery cell that could result in fires. The company will replace 2.5 million phones sent to stores and consumers, in one of the industry\u2019s largest recalls.The recall puts Samsung, which has been trying to match the success of the Apple iPhone, in a precarious position.The smartphone industry is grappling with slowing demand and intense competition. Samsung was regaining swagger with its high-end phone models, like the Note 7, in which the screens appear to spill off the side.But the battery fires threaten to undermine Samsung\u2019s efforts, giving an edge to Apple. The recall comes just days before Apple is expected to unveil the latest version of its iPhone.The ultimate scale of the damage to Samsung\u2019s reputation and finances will depend on how quickly the company deals with the issues and how costly they turn out to be. Along with the expense of fixing the phones, Samsung could face lost sales if consumers grow wary of its products.Samsung said it expected that manufacturing replacement phones would take two weeks. Consumers who have already bought the phones will receive replacements before new phones go on sale, the company said. Samsung did not indicate the cost of the recall.\u201cIf you look at previous instances in tech history where there have been recalls, as long as it doesn\u2019t drag on to the point that the company becomes the butt of a joke, then it should be minor,\u201d said Bryan Ma, an analyst at IDC, a technology research firm.\u201cIf it becomes like a Pinto, where you don\u2019t want to buy it because it explodes, that would be a bad situation,\u201d he said, referring to the 1971 Ford car that became famous for erupting in flames after rear-end collisions. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ll get past it.\u201dSamsung said that, so far, 35 battery episodes involving the Note 7 had been registered. Reports of the problem first started to emerge online, as consumers posted photographs and videos of the charred remains of phones they said had burst into flames, usually while being recharged.Samsung said it thought the problem came from a \u201cminute flaw\u201d in the production of the batteries. Samsung would not name the supplier involved.The recall covers 10 countries where the phones have been sold. Samsung said the recall would not affect China, since the models sold there used a battery from a different supplier.\u201cWe acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market, but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest-quality products to our customers,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible.\u201dThe recall is a major blow to Samsung, which had just started to regain its competitive footing. The company faces pressures across its product line, with Apple on the high end and new Chinese brands on the lower end.Samsung was gaining traction with the latest Galaxy phones. The phones\u2019 smooth, tapered edges, which make them more comfortable to hold, have been a hit with consumers.In the second quarter, Samsung\u2019s global smartphone sales rose 5.5 percent from a year earlier while Apple\u2019s fell 15 percent, giving Samsung 22.4 percent of the market compared to Apple\u2019s 11.8 percent, according to IDC. While some of that growth came from Samsung\u2019s lower-end phones, IDC said that a significant part had also come from new demand for its higher-end phones, which contributed a disproportionate amount of profit.Samsung had high expectations for the latest Galaxy phone, which was released last month, to help continue the momentum.The Note 7 is 5.7 inches from corner to corner, making it a large phone sometimes referred to as a phablet \u2014 a combination of phone and tablet. It sells in the United States for about $900 to $1,000 without subsidies from a wireless carrier.The phones were released just ahead of Apple\u2019s traditional release time in autumn, before the important holiday shopping season. Apple is set to show off its latest iPhone on Sept. 7. With the new iPhone, Apple is expected to make major upgrades to both the hardware and software, as it generally does every two years.\u201cYou have to applaud Samsung for moving quickly,\u201d said Ben Wood, mobile analyst at CCS Insight in Berlin. \u201cBut they can\u2019t afford to miss the run up to the holiday season, so they have to fix this problem fast.\u201dLightweight and powerful, lithium-ion batteries are the go-to for technology, since they don\u2019t take up much room and can quickly recharge repeatedly without wearing out. But they are also far from perfect.The batteries, which include volatile and flammable chemical compounds, can become unstable if overheated or punctured. If that happens, the battery can burst into flames or explode.More recently, battery problems have cropped up with increasing frequency among lower-end devices. In America, airline companies began banning hoverboards from flights after it became apparent that some of the products would occasionally burst into flames. There have also been increased reports of e-cigarette batteries spontaneously detonating.Analysts, in part, attribute the issues to the low standards and few regulations in the global electronics supply chain that sprawls across China. As smaller Chinese companies have jumped at opportunities to make their own devices, some have cut corners, leading to a number of problems, including the occasionally combusting battery.For Samsung, the recall strikes at the heart of what has long been considered its greatest strength: its management of the supply chain.Samsung owns the facilities that produce many of the components in its smartphones \u2014 including screens, chips and batteries. The system allows it to keep closer tabs on production.Yet much like Apple, Samsung also manages a large network of suppliers.That means it must coordinate the production of a high number of parts that come from factories in disparate places run on tight margins. It must also double-check the quality of each product, which can be exceptionally challenging given that production processes are complex and factories are sometimes known to sacrifice quality for profit.\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is this comes from Samsung, who have such prowess and competence in manufacturing and supply chain,\u201d Mr. Ma of IDC said. \u201cYou would think this wouldn\u2019t happen to a company like that, but somehow it slipped through.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Su-Hyun Lee from Seoul, South Korea.

{"Headline": "Protecting Humans and Jobs From Robots Is 5 Tech Giants\u2019 Goal", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "Supported byFive major technology companies said Wednesday that they had created an organization to set the ground rules for protecting humans \u2014 and their jobs \u2014 in the face of rapid advances in artificial intelligence.The organization has been created at a time of significant public debate about artificial intelligence technologies that are built into a variety of robots and other intelligent systems, including self-driving cars and workplace automation.The industry group introduced a set of basic ethical standards for engineering development and scientific research that its five members have agreed upon.In a conference call on Wednesday, five artificial intelligence researchers representing the companies said they thought the technology would be a major force in the world for social and economic benefits, but they acknowledged the potential for misuse in a wide variety of ways.They said their effort was not intended to be an enforcement organization to force technology companies into self-regulation. Rather, they want to foster \u201cpublic understanding\u201d and set \u201cbest practices\u201d for work in artificial intelligence.\u201cWe passionately believe in the potential for it to transform in a positive way our world,\u201d said Mustafa Suleyman, head of applied A.I. for DeepMind, an artificial intelligence development company acquired by Google in 2014. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s critical now to start to think about new models of engagement with the public, new models of collaboration across the industry and new models of transparency around the work that we do.\u201dThe group released eight tenets that are evocative of Isaac Asimov\u2019s original \u201cThree Laws of Robotics,\u201d which appeared in a science fiction story in 1942. The new principles include high-level ideals such as, \u201cWe will seek to ensure that A.I. technologies benefit and empower as many people as possible.\u201dNevertheless, at least one of the tenets implies that the companies realize they could be drawn into sticky ethical situations, and it calls on engineers to oppose the use of artificial intelligence technology in weapons or other tools that could be used to violate human rights.\u201cWith the hyperbole about A.I. over the last two to four years, there have been concerns in an echo chamber of anxiety that the government itself will be misinformed,\u201d said Eric Horvitz, managing director for Microsoft Research.The researchers said they were talking with other companies like Apple and research laboratories like the new nonprofit research group OpenAI about participating in their organization.Advertisement"}

But before we move to Asian tech, let\u2019s start by talking about things closer at hand. In other words, Apple.Chinese consumers crave not only what\u2019s new, but also what stands out as new. Apple still very much has a hold on the Chinese consumer, but many may well wait another year to see what Apple does for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, when there may be more of a wow factor.That said, a part of me thinks the new wireless headphones could be a hit in China. More so than a new iPhone, they broadcast that a user is willing to drop a solid chunk of change to keep up on tech trends. That formula has worked well for Apple in the past in China, though it would have helped if they made the AirPods in gold and rose gold options.What else is going on in Chinese transportation business that you think Americans should know about?I do also think we could see some political issues crop up as the technology is more widely used. The Chinese government will want to give its local companies a leg up and it has also been uncomfortable letting foreign companies collect data within China and beam it elsewhere, so it could be we see some roadblocks go up to foreign autonomous driving technology down the line.So, what do you think? How bad is this for Samsung?There was an editorial in the Korean newspaper, the Chosun Ilbo, faulting Samsung for the technological mistakes that led to this issue. Certainly that matters, but it seems a bit beside the point. With the supply chain as complex as it is, mistakes will occasionally happen. The thing that Samsung can control, and should do better at, is communicating with its customers.So anyway \u2026 have a good flight back!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A High-Stakes Bet: Turning Google Assistant Into a \u2018Star Trek\u2019 Computer", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtGoogle is one of the most valuable companies in the world, but its future, like that of all tech giants, is clouded by a looming threat. The search company makes virtually all of its money from ads placed on the World Wide Web. But what happens to the cash machine if web search eventually becomes outmoded?That worry isn\u2019t far-fetched. More of the world\u2019s computing time keeps shifting to smartphones, where apps have supplanted the web. And internet-connected devices that may dominate the next era in tech \u2014 smartwatches, home-assistant devices like Amazon\u2019s Echo, or virtual reality machines like Oculus Rift \u2014 are likely to be free of the web, and may even lack screens.But if Google is worried, it isn\u2019t showing it. The company has long been working on a not-so-secret weapon to avert its potential irrelevance. Google has shoveled vast financial and engineering resources into a collection of data mining and artificial intelligence systems, from speech recognition to machine translation to computer vision.But Google has much grander aims for the Assistant. People at the company say that Sundar Pichai, who took over as Google\u2019s chief executive last year after Google was split into a conglomerate called Alphabet, has bet the company on the new tech. Mr. Pichai declined an interview request for this column, but at Google\u2019s developer conference in May, he called the development of the Assistant \u201ca seminal moment\u201d for the company.If the Assistant or something like it does not take off, Google\u2019s status as the chief navigator of our digital lives could be superseded by a half-dozen other assistants. You might interact with Alexa in your house, with Siri on your phone, and with Facebook Messenger\u2019s chatbot when you\u2019re out and about. Google\u2019s search engine (not to mention its Android operating system, Chrome, Gmail, Maps and other properties) would remain popular and lucrative, but possibly far less so than they are today.The Assistant, in Google\u2019s most far-out vision, would always be around, wherever you are, on whatever device you use, to handle just about any informational task.Consider this common situation: Today, to book a trip, you usually have to load up several travel sites, consult your calendar and coordinate with your family and your colleagues. If the Assistant works as well as Google hopes, all you might have to do is say, \u201cO.K., Google, I need to go to Hong Kong next week. Take care of it.\u201dBased on your interactions with it over the years, Google would know your habits, your preferences and your budget. It would know your friends, family and your colleagues. With access to so much data, and with the computational power to interpret all of it, the Assistant most likely could handle the entire task; if it couldn\u2019t, it would simply ask you to fill in the gaps, the way a human assistant might.Computers have made a lot of everyday tasks far easier to accomplish, yet they still require a sometimes annoying level of human involvement to get the most out of them. The Assistant\u2019s long-term aim is to eliminate all this busywork.If it succeeds, it would be the ultimate expression of what Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, once described as the perfect search engine: a machine that \u201cunderstands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want.\u201dAt this point, a few readers may be recoiling at the potential invasion of autonomy and privacy that such a machine would necessitate.The Assistant would involve giving ourselves over to machines more fully. We would trust them not just with our information but increasingly with our decisions. Many people are already freaked out by what Google, Facebook and other tech companies know about us. Would we be willing to hand over even more power to computers?Those are important questions, but they are also well down the road. For now, the more pressing question for the Assistant is: Will it even work?Google has technological advantages that suggest it could build a more capable digital assistant than others have accomplished. Many of the innovations that it has built into its search engine \u2014 including its knowledge graph database of more than a billion people, places and things, and the 17 years it has spent trying to understand the meaning of web queries \u2014 will form the Assistant\u2019s brain.Google has also been one of the leaders in machine learning, the process that allows computers to discover facts about the world without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is at the heart of a number of recent advances, including Google Photos\u2019 uncanny capacity to search through your images for arbitrary terms (photos of people hugging, for instance).\u201cWe are in the process of transforming into a machine-learning company,\u201d Jeff Dean, who is in charge of Google Brain, the company\u2019s artificial intelligence project, told me this year. For each problem Google solves this way, it gets better at solving other problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a boulder going downhill gathering more momentum as it goes,\u201d Mr. Dean said.That\u2019s an amazing technological feat. But as Brian pointed out, it\u2019s also pretty useless. Why does your friend care if you know his dog\u2019s a Shih Tzu?This gets to a deeper difficulty. The search company might have the technical capacity to create the smartest assistant around, but it\u2019s not at all clear that it has the prowess to create the friendliest, most charming or most useful assistant. Google needs to nail not just Assistant\u2019s smarts, but also its personality \u2014 a new skill for Google, and one that its past forays into social software (Google Plus, anyone?) don\u2019t speak highly of.\u201cWhen I was trying to book a movie, it didn\u2019t really narrow things down for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there were some times it was wrong. I asked it to show me my upcoming trip, and it didn\u2019t get that.\u201dOf course, it\u2019s still early. Mr. Sullivan has high hopes for the Assistant. It would be premature to look at the technology today and get discouraged about its future, especially since Google sees this as a multiyear, perhaps even decade-long project. And especially if Google\u2019s future depends on getting this right.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Software Is Booming. But Why Now?", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This is the year artificial intelligence came into its own for mainstream businesses, at least as a marketing feature.Salesforce chose this date to pre-empt Oracle, the world\u2019s largest business software company, which on Sunday evening began its annual customer event in San Francisco. High on Oracle\u2019s list of new features: real-time analysis of enormous amounts of data. Oracle calls its product Oracle A.I.There are big pushes in A.I. in agriculture, manufacturing, aviation and pretty much every other sector of the economy.It\u2019s all very exciting, the way great possibilities are, and clearly full of great buzzwords and slogans. But will other companies see any value in all this or understand if A.I. has value for them?\u201cNo one really knows where the value is,\u201d said Marc Benioff, co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cI think I know \u2014 it\u2019s in helping people do the things that people are good at, and turning more things over to machines.\u201dMr. Benioff wasn\u2019t selling Einstein\u2019s capabilities short. He was talking about the long-term value of artificial intelligence, which is passing through a familiar phase \u2014 a technology that is strange and new, that sometimes overpromises what it can do and is headed for uses not easily seen at the start.Cloaked inside terms like deep learning and machine intelligence, A.I. is essentially a series of advanced statistics-based exercises that review the past to indicate the likely future, or look at current customer choices to figure out where to put more or less energy.Perhaps a better question than \u201cWhat is the value?\u201d of this explosion of advanced statistics is \u201cWhy now?\u201d That shows both the opportunity and why many companies are scared about missing out.Much of today\u2019s A.I. boom goes back to 2006, when Amazon started selling cheap computing over the internet. Those measures built the public clouds of Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, among others. That same year, Google and Yahoo released statistical methods for dealing with the unruly data of human behavior. In 2007, Apple released the first iPhone, a device that began a boom in unruly-data collection everywhere.Suddenly, old A.I. experiments were relevant, and money and cheap data resources were available for building new algorithms. Ten years later, computing is cheaper than ever, companies live online and in their phone apps, and sensors are bringing even more unruly data from more places.Amazon, Google and the rest have exceptional A.I. resources for sale, but many older companies are wary of turning their data over to these upstarts. That, along with fear of a competitor getting on top of A.I. first, is a big motivation for some to try things out.Salesforce is selling Einstein as a system that can work predictive magic without having to look at your data, in what Mr. Benioff calls a \u201cdemocratizing\u201d move that will create millions of A.I. users who are not engineers.He said this on his way to attend a series of customer focus groups around the country, however \u2014 strong evidence that customers don\u2019t get it yet, even if they\u2019re willing to try it.\u201cThere\u2019s fear of Google and Microsoft controlling everything, and there\u2019s a desire to apply A.I. to anything that\u2019s digital,\u201d said Michael Biltz, managing director of Accenture\u2019s technology vision practice. \u201cPeople are going to have to experiment, most likely first on pain points like security and product marketing.\u201dHow will we know when the A.I. revolution has taken hold? A technology truly matures when it disappears. We don\u2019t marvel at houses with electricity now, or the idea of driving to work at 60 miles an hour. We can say \u201cphone\u201d and mean a hand-held computer with NASA-level processing power and a professional-quality camera for taking selfies with our drones.A.I. is probably heading for the same places, invisibly sorting through lots of data everywhere to continuously update and automate most of our lives. Goodness knows what the weird new tech thing will be about at that point.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Companies Like Apple Dodge Taxes and Their Own Investors", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAs an investor, one who has been entrusted with helping to safeguard other people\u2019s money over many years, I value the high degree of disclosure required from American public companies. Corporations and the world in which they operate change every day, so investors need to know the risks their money faces.No area of business demonstrates the need for full disclosure as much as one that has been in the news a lot lately: large American companies\u2019 shifting profits overseas to minimize tax bills, or to avoid taxes altogether. These schemes are starting to attract the attention of regulators and governments who view them more as tax dodges than as legitimate financial arrangements.Given the risks, the last thing investors need is less disclosure. But the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency responsible to ensure that companies are being open and honest, is considering exactly that: scaling back the information available to the public.This is the wrong direction. We need more information, not less.When the S.E.C. was created in the 1930s, we did not have multinational companies with scores of foreign subsidiaries or the constant risk of government crackdowns on shady tax maneuvers. Today, there are an estimated $2.3 trillion in Fortune 500 company revenues currently booked in tax havens.Lately, these companies have been running into opposition from government regulators. Apple has accumulated billions in profits and, with the assistance of tax-haven-based subsidiaries, managed to pay little tax on those profits to any national government anywhere in the world. As a result of its near-zero tax arrangement with Ireland, Apple will now be embroiled for years in lawsuits relating to a ruling by Europe\u2019s antitrust enforcer, which ordered the company to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes.Earlier this year, French tax authorities raided the Paris offices of Google, and Spanish tax authorities did the same in Madrid. Both countries are calling for billions in back taxes.Several years ago, members of the British government called for a consumer boycott of Starbucks because the company paid no taxes in Britain (all of its revenue was offset by \u201cexpenses\u201d paid in other jurisdictions).Incredibly, even though the blowback against egregious tax practices is a substantial risk to multinational companies and a significant threat for shareholders, it is often impossible for investors to determine how healthy a company really is and whether or not the profits are merely a reflection of aggressive tax planning.The S.E.C.\u2019s mandate is to require companies to provide full disclosure to a \u201creasonable investor.\u201d But no reasonable investor could have known the full scope of Apple\u2019s overseas tax shelters, which were not detailed in the company\u2019s financial releases. That took multiple investigators with subpoena power working for a United States Senate subcommittee nearly a year. And there was no obvious way for investors to know the particulars of Apple\u2019s Irish deal or how risky it might prove to be.And even when disclosures are made, the sheer complexity of a company\u2019s international taxes can make even the most elemental decision impossible. During the dispute of a management buyout of Dell Computer earlier this year, two experts in valuation science, using similar methods and principles, were asked to come up with a ballpark figure for Dell\u2019s true value. Their estimates differed by $28 billion, largely because they reached different conclusions about the company\u2019s overseas taxes.With companies engaging in high-risk tax avoidance, the investing public needs more information, clearly expressed. Investors should, at a minimum, be given a list of all countries in which a company operates, the revenue and earnings attributed to each country, and the amount of taxes paid in each. There might still be disputes but at least investors would be working from the same numbers.Nothing in the current S.E.C. rules requires even that simple statement from companies. If we are going to protect the integrity of the market, we should start by requiring companies to report exactly how they are doing business, including where they pay taxes and how much. The world has changed, and our rules must change with it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Opens the iMessage Door, and the Ephemera Rushes In", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic's NotebookApple built an empire on hermetically sealed systems with sleek, minimalist designs. Nowhere was its strategy more evident than in iMessage, the company\u2019s instant messaging system that offered a free, elegant chatting solution exclusive to Apple devices. Until last week, that is, when Apple updated its software, cracked open iMessage and allowed the ephemera of the outside internet to seep in.Now, click on an unassuming arrow in the chat window, and you\u2019ll throw open a junk drawer of digital tchotchkes scavenged from web properties new and old. GIFs, stickers and supersized emoji dominate this digital playground, while text \u2014 actual words \u2014 becomes almost an afterthought.But unlike the freewheeling world of the outside web, where we grab and go as we please, Apple is steering users toward a tightly curated selection of non-textual toys. None would look out of place at a 3-year-old\u2019s birthday party. Many come at a price. Welcome to Apple\u2019s sanitized, monetized version of internet culture.These features mimic the aesthetics of the open internet, which is obsessed with nostalgia and is not exactly subtle. But they can\u2019t replicate the feeling of collecting digital miscellany in our travels across the internet, remixing the material and sending it along to friends who might appreciate the find. The programmatic iMessage sucks the spontaneity from the experience. It standardizes the strange.Several new features, meanwhile, blow up iMessage\u2019s intimate chat experience to help it compete with the social networks. A handy GIF keyboard jumps off the reaction-GIF empire that Tumblr built, calling up video loops of broadly accessible cultural references (Honey Boo Boo dancing, two Minions giggling) to convey a range of emotional states. Another feature lets you finger-paint directly onto your photos, just like you can on Snapchat. But mostly, this thing feels like Facebook. A new class of iMessage apps \u2014 yes, apps within an app \u2014 lets chatters play Words With Friends, send money through Square or make dinner reservations on OpenTable, all right within the chat window. It feels like iMessage is trying to swallow the rest of your phone.The camera is in here, and so too can be Fandango, ESPN, and, if you want, Carrot, a snarky robot that reads you the weather report for $3.99. In many of these cases, the service is so slight that exchanging actual words would work just fine: Want to see \u201cSnowden\u201d at 10:15? Did you catch the Nats game? It\u2019s 77 and sunny \u2014 greeaaaaat. It\u2019s not clear why every shade of human interaction needs to be mediated by its own app.Here\u2019s one theory: Each tap into the iMessage world sends you further away from your chat bubbles and deeper into Apple\u2019s labyrinth of special features. Follow the path to its inevitable conclusion, and all of a sudden, you\u2019re no longer talking with your friends. You\u2019re shopping.Five clicks into iMessage, you\u2019ll arrive at Apple\u2019s brand-new sticker shop. Offering colorful sets of illustrations to drag and drop into your chats, it\u2019s one of iMessage\u2019s most tantalizing new destinations. If our chat windows function as modern living rooms, stickers offer the opportunity to appoint our walls with art from cutting-edge digital creators.iMessage is the iPhone\u2019s most trafficked feature. Its chats facilitate an endless combination of social interactions and emotional expressions. But Apple\u2019s shop suggests that all conversations would improve from a Party City-style redecoration, with generic celebratory sentiments and Disney-branded flair.\u201cStickers\u201d sound inherently childish, but they don\u2019t have to be. The stickerification of chats was pioneered by Line, a Japanese chat giant that swept Asia and is lately making a bid for western audiences. Line loves corporate synergy, too, heralding sticker sets starring Snoopy, Super Mario and Hello Kitty.But even as it attempts world chat domination, Line services online subcultures. Dozens of sticker sets feature gay characters, and more than one \u2014 \u201cFangirl\u2019s Activities\u201d and \u201cI Love KPOP\u201d \u2014 depicts anime girls in various states of obsession. Then there\u2019s the sex stuff. The \u201cUMAOTOKO\u201d sticker shows two men in horse costumes, uh, stretching together. The most risqu\u00e9 sticker I could find in Apple\u2019s version was in a set called \u201cFailmoji.\u201d It\u2019s a hand-drawn butt with the caption \u201cFART!!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ending Apple\u2019s Offshore Tax Dodge", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:While the editorial is spot on in calling for an end to the deferral process, it sorely missed the mark in characterizing President Obama\u2019s proposed repatriation rate as \u201creasonable.\u201d Tax holidays incentivize bad business behavior and reward companies that extract wealth from communities with a deep discount and a clean conscience.A 14 percent rate on repatriated funds previously held offshore is a handout to large multinational corporations at the expense of small-business owners and our customers. Far from reasonable, it\u2019s been estimated by the Main Street Alliance that the proposed holiday rate would be a $20 billion gift to Apple.With their nearly unlimited access to capital and ability to buy in bulk, industry giants like Apple already hold a competitive edge over small to mid-sized businesses, which can\u2019t afford to hire high-priced tax accountants and lawyers to devise tax avoidance schemes.To level the playing field for Main Street businesses, Congress must act to end deferral, stop incentivizing offshoring of revenues with tax holidays, and hold all companies accountable to pay what they owe when they owe it.DEBORAH FIELDPortland, Ore.The writer, a small-business owner and former accountant, is a member of the Main Street Alliance.To the Editor:I find it infuriating that Apple, Microsoft, Google and many other highly successful so-called American companies have found legal ways to avoid paying anywhere close to a fair share of taxes on their profits. Their executives and shareholders win and the rest of us lose.I find it even more infuriating when pharmaceutical companies play the same tax avoidance game, but also jack up the prices of essential and unique medications by several hundred percent, and expect taxpayers to foot the bill through federal insurance programs.How many ordinary Americans are disadvantaged by these practices \u2014 people who are not earning the big bonuses and dividends generated by these practices, but rather have to pay the increased taxes to cover them? Come on, Congress, do something. At least pretend you represent the people.DON CARLSONBostonTo the Editor:Apple and other companies are only doing what our laws and those of their host countries abroad allow them to do. The problem, as you point out, lies with our own tax laws and enforcement. A way forward would be to apply basic accounting principles to reformulate our tax policies. These include:1. Profits should generally be taxed in the country in which business is conducted and profits are generated.2. Profits should be taxed in the year in which they are generated.3. Like individual American citizens, American businesses should be taxed at home each year on their combined \u201cworldwide\u201d income.4. Corporations should be entitled to an offsetting American credit for taxes paid to foreign countries if we have bilateral tax treaties with those countries. This should allow us to modify our current deferral policy of profits not taxed until repatriated.To further discourage tax inversion and offshore profit harboring, we must review our own tax rates and make them more competitive with other nations, while also persuading countries like Ireland that are members of the World Trade Organization not to adopt a very low-rate, tax haven or \u201cpirate\u201d status.CHERIAN THACHENKARYAtlantaAdvertisement"}
