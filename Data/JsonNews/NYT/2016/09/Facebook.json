{"Headline": "U.S. Open Today: Another Short Match for Novak Djokovic", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory over his French countryman Lucas Pouille on Tuesday, Ga\u00ebl Monfils rolled into his first United States Open semifinal, having not lost a set in the tournament.Read our continuing coverage of the U.S. Open here.But his semifinal opponent, Novak Djokovic, has had an even smoother road to the final four. The top-seeded Djokovic, who was nursing a wrist injury at the beginning of the Open, got another break Tuesday night when Jo-Wilfried Tsonga retired after two sets because of a knee injury .Djokovic\u2019s second-round opponent, Jiri Vesely, could not play because of a forearm injury. His third-round opponent, Mikhail Youzhny, retired after six games with a hamstring injury. Djokovic, who was leading, 6-3, 6-2, when Tsonga retired, has played only two full matches in the tournament. He has about nine and a half sets under his belt, compared with Monfils\u2019s 15.Djokovic is in the United States Open semifinals for the 10th consecutive year. Monfils, the No. 10 seed, has played in only one major semifinal, at the French Open in 2008. Since then, he had lost all six of his quarterfinal matches at Grand Slam tournaments before winning Tuesday.Djokovic, 29, and Monfils, 30, have played against each other since they were juniors. Djokovic says Monfils was the better player in those days. But on the ATP Tour, Djokovic has dominated, winning all 12 of their matches.Read the complete article here. Kerber, who won the Australian Open in January and reached the final of Wimbledon and the Rio Olympics this summer, has yet to drop a set at the United States Open.\u201cI know that I can beat everybody, and this is what gives me also a lot of confidence and motivation for going out there and playing with a lot of emotion,\u201d said Kerber, a 28-year-old German.Kerber can end Serena Williams\u2019s 186-week reign at No. 1, if Williams does not reach the final.In the semifinals, Kerber will meet Caroline Wozniacki, who defeated Anastasija Sevastova, 6-0, 6-2. Early in the first set, Sevastova, who was playing her first Grand Slam quarterfinal, sustained an ankle injury.Wozniacki, a two-time U.S. Open finalist, came into that match ranked lower than the relatively unknown Sevastova, who was 48th. Wozniacki, who has battled injuries this year, has fallen to 74th.But playing in New York, where she has a home, suits her. She reached the Open semifinals for the fifth time.Kerber and Wozniacki have never met at a Grand Slam event, but Kerber leads the head-to-head matchup, 7-5.\u25a0 There will be no meeting in the women\u2019s doubles semifinals between Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza, the dominant doubles team that split up this summer. Mirza and her new partner, Barbora Strycova lost to Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic, 7-6 (3), 6-1, in quarterfinals Tuesday. Hingis and her new partner, Coco Vandeweghe, play their quarterfinal against Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova on Wednesday.Look around the world at all the tennis lessons, and all the time and money invested in hitting a lot of tennis balls back and forth over the net. In an hourlong lesson, forehands and backhands typically dominate the first 50 minutes, and there may be a few token serves or returns thrown in at the end.But in matches, statistics at the United States Open show, short clearly dominates long.In matches through Sunday, 69 percent of men\u2019s points and 64 percent of women\u2019s points were over in four or fewer shots. Only 12 percent of points in men\u2019s matches and 11 percent of points in women\u2019s matches were rallies of nine shots or more.Performance in the first four shots had a direct correlation to winning the match. In men\u2019s matches through Sunday at the Open, the winner won 84 percent of the short rallies. It was 88 percent at last year\u2019s Open.Read the complete article here. \u2014 CRAIG O\u2019SHANNESSYAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buy Movie Tickets on Facebook? Fandango Makes It Possible", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 By making it easy for people to buy movie tickets online or through a smartphone app, Fandango has experienced breakneck growth over the last two years. A couple of taps and presto! The seats are yours.But that, Fandango has decided, is no longer good enough.To keep growing \u2014 and, with any luck, help theaters and studios entice Americans, particularly young ones, to go to the movies at all \u2014 Fandango will alter course. Instead of relying on customers to come to it, Fandango will also go to them: Over the weekend, for instance, Fandango will begin selling tickets to Hollywood movies directly on Facebook.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about purchasing ease, it\u2019s also about bringing along groups of people,\u201d Mr. Yanover said. \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to see this movie. Why don\u2019t you come along? Great. Boom. Done.\u201dJulie Ask, an analyst with Forrester who was privately briefed by Fandango on its plans, offered an enthusiastic appraisal.\u201cConsumers, particularly young ones, find it inconvenient to hop into different silos to get something done,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want it all in one place. That sounds obnoxious, I know \u2014 the definition of a \u2018first-world problem\u2019 \u2014 but it\u2019s true, and Fandango is solving it for them.\u201dFacebook represents only one area of expansion for Fandango, which NBCUniversal owns. On Tuesday, Fandango began allowing users of Apple\u2019s enhanced iPhone messaging app to buy tickets without leaving a texting conversation. Anyone using Apple\u2019s new iOS 10 operating system can tap on a Fandango applet while on the Messages page. Posters for films playing in theaters pop up. Tapping a poster brings up a display of nearby theaters and showtimes, along with purchasing options.A Fandango interface designed for Snapchat (again, allowing users to buy tickets without toggling between apps or leaving the platform) is on the way. \u201cThis is about Fandango appearing in these environments in an organic, natural way \u2014 the way people communicate with each other now, the way they actually discover, plan and buy,\u201d Mr. Yanover said.Although Mr. Yanover is not ready to show his full hand, he said in an interview at Fandango headquarters that additional offerings were in the works. Might Fandango, for instance, introduce ticket-buying on YouTube, where it operates a popular channel, Movieclips, stocked with trailers and snippets of old films? Mr. Yanover smiled, but declined to comment.Social networks are crucial marketing tools for Hollywood, but actually acquiring customers has remained an elusive goal, in part because companies like Facebook have been more focused on other priorities. But that is changing. \u201cThere is now an arms race to offer more and more services and keep people in their environments longer,\u201d Ms. Ask said.Anything that increases ticket sales is likely to be warmly embraced by studio executives and theater buyers, who have been fighting to keep moviegoing relevant as in-home entertainment options proliferate. About 513 million people went to the movies over the summer, a 3.5 percent decline compared with a year earlier, according to studio data. For the year so far, attendance is up about 1.2 percent.\u201cThe social aspect of what Fandango is doing is really important for Hollywood,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at comScore. \u201cMost people do not go to the movies alone, and there is the potential here to turn a two-ticket purchase into a four-ticket purchase.\u201dFandango is facing competition from a start-up called Atom Tickets. Incubated by Lionsgate, with additional financing from Disney and 21st Century Fox, Atom has promoted itself as a way for theaters and studios to increase group sales by making it easier for friends to plan outings. The Atom app, introduced this year, has also made discounts, particularly for less popular showtimes, part of its mission, along with concession stand preorders.But Fandango is the giant in this segment of the industry, servicing about 27,700 movie screens in the United States and growing quickly. So far this year, ticketing revenue is up 51 percent compared with the same period last year, according to a Fandango spokesman. In 2015, Fandango grew by 81 percent. About 70 percent of Fandango tickets are sold on mobile devices.\u201cWe\u2019re really proud of our growth, and people will still come to us, but we\u2019ve spent a lot of time watching how movie discovery and planning is changing,\u201d Mr. Yanover said. \u201cAnd I think these offerings we are unveiling are an important shift, not just for Fandango, but for Hollywood as a whole.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "IndyCar\u2019s Newest Champion, Simon Pagenaud, Had Fast Assimilation to America", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven after he started racing cars, Simon Pagenaud was known as the son of the grocer in Montmorillon, France, about 220 miles southwest of Paris. His father, Christian, also the son of a grocer, would make it big there, eventually running a hypermarket franchise for E.Leclerc.\u201cIt is a very small town, 7,000 people, in the countryside,\u201d Pagenaud said in an interview last week in New York. \u201cI could sit in my dad\u2019s lap and drive, and the policemen wouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201dPagenaud loved fast cars from the time he was 4, when he watched Ayrton Senna battle the Frenchman Alain Prost in Formula One races. But that Pagenaud became the IndyCar Series champion, winning the season\u2019s final race last Sunday in the process, is a testament to his persistence.He knew he had to speak English to make it as a driver, so he paid close attention in school, took advanced classes for five years and watched TV with subtitles. Pagenaud said he now spoke English 95 percent of the time while living near Charlotte, N.C., as a driver for the formidable car owner Roger Penske.\u201cI dream in English, and I swear in English,\u201d Pagenaud, 32, said, laughing.He decided early on to model his career after Senna, the indomitable Brazilian who won three world championships before he was killed while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. But Pagenaud is not planning to return to race in Europe any time soon.Pagenaud still has goals to attain in North America \u2014 namely, to win the Indianapolis 500, his sport\u2019s most prestigious event. His nine career IndyCar victories, which include five this past season, have come on road courses, not on oval tracks like Indianapolis Motor Speedway.There also are not many rides better than those offered by Penske. Pagenaud\u2019s teammates have included Helio Castroneves and Juan Pablo Montoya, and Pagenaud can also dabble in sports car racing, another love.Pagenaud has also overcome a sizable setback. In 2006, he beat Graham Rahal to win $2 million toward a berth in the Champ Car World Series, then a competitor of IndyCar. Pagenaud raced for one year, and then the Champ Car World Series folded.\u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019ll go home and do something else, I guess,\u2019\u201d he said.Then Gil de Ferran, a French-born Brazilian who won the 2003 Indianapolis 500 for Penske, stepped in and offered Pagenaud a ride in a sports car in the American Le Mans Series. Pagenaud drove in the series for two years before driving for two lower-tier IndyCar teams.\u201cThat changed my life,\u201d Pagenaud said of getting the call from de Ferran. \u201cHe taught me a lot, for sure. He is what I call my Yoda.\u201dDe Ferran, 48, who won 12 of 51 career races in Champ Car and IndyCar, hired Pagenaud because he thought he had the intelligence and guile not just to win races, but to keep improving. It also helped that Pagenaud was French.\u201cWe kind of saw eye to eye from Day 1,\u201d de Ferran said last week. \u201cIt helps me understand him. My father is French, so I kind of understand the culture firsthand. I understand the idiosyncrasies.\u201dDe Ferran laughed when he said, \u201cI know some bad words in French, so it made it easy to joke around a little with him.\u201dDe Ferran added: \u201cOne of the key things with him is that the Simon you see today is not the Simon you\u2019ll see tomorrow. He\u2019s one of those rare sportsmen who uses the opportunity to work on his craft and consistently evolve over time. How far is he going to go? I don\u2019t know.\u201dPagenaud drew Penske\u2019s attention by winning four IndyCar races in three full seasons for the team co-owned by Sam Schmidt, a former driver who was paralyzed in a 2000 crash. Penske\u2019s team, newly organized, scuffled in 2015, but Pagenaud returned with a vengeance in 2016.\u201cWe had something very special happen this year, for sure,\u201d he said.Had the phone call from de Ferran never come, Pagenaud said, he might be a trader on Wall Street or back in France, working for his father at a 250-employee store that sells everything from groceries and dishwashers to gasoline, haircuts and laptops.Pagenaud said he planned to return to Montmorillon soon for a reception in his honor. Driving championships are not common in France \u2014 Prost won the last of his four world championships in 1993, and the manufacturer Renault won its last title in 2006 \u2014 so French fans have suddenly flocked to Pagenaud\u2019s Facebook page and Twitter feed.In addition to his championship, Pagenaud marveled at how he had raced alongside Castroneves and Montoya.\u201cThey were such big names,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to watch them on TV. Something I wished for was just to say hi to those guys.\u201dNow that Pagenaud has been able to run away from them on the racetrack for a full season, he considers himself an ambassador for open-wheel racing in North America. He flew directly to New York from his last race in Northern California for a round of media appearances.Other than returning to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, not far from his hometown, he said he could do everything he wanted on racetracks in North America.\u201cI feel so proud of what we accomplished,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of my job, but do I enjoy talking about it? Yes, I do. I\u2019m tired. I want to go home. But yes, this is a reward.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is not crying wolf (pelts). This is real.What are you talking about?Instead, a handful have simply decided to do something about it. But not the same thing. And not everyone.Why do I care?Plus, this is a season with, perhaps, more designer and brand switcheroos than ever before, which means the clothes you are about to see, and wear, may suddenly start to look notably different from what you may have expected.O.K. Let\u2019s start with the switcheroos. Who\u2019s going where?There\u2019s also some city-hopping going on, with Albert Kriemler, recipient of the Couture Council\u2019s award for Artistry in Fashion, bringing the Akris show to New York for the first time (and because his signature luxury architectural tailoring has a major American following in women in the C-suite). For his part, Olivier Theyskens \u2014 the longhaired, fragile romantic of the goth set and erstwhile Theory designer \u2014 is returning to Paris, a city he left seven years ago after stints at Nina Ricci and Rochas, to introduce a new namesake label.Thakoon Panichgul and his Thakoon line are also back after a fallow season, and with a new owner (Bright Fame Fashion) and a new approach to business: straight-to-consumer e-commerce and his own retail store. And finally, also back on schedule in New York is Tom Ford, who introduced his own women\u2019s line in New York in 2010, decamped for London in 2011, spent a season in Los Angeles and one in the digital space, and is now trumpeting a see-now, shop-now model (also known as see-now, buy-now and see-now, have-now), among other changes.What is this see-now, shop-now thing?But wait: Isn\u2019t this season spring-summer? Why would they sell spring clothes now?It is, officially, the spring-summer season \u2014 unless you are Tom Ford, in which case you are showing fall-winter, because, well, it is fall-winter. But many of his see-now, shop-now compatriots are creating \u201cseasonless\u201d collections instead that include coats, cashmeres, silks and lingerie dresses, which is pretty much the panoply of options everyone needs anyway now that global warming has played havoc with predictable weather patterns.Another old division fast going by the wayside in response to reality: The former divide between men\u2019s wear and women\u2019s wear, an increasingly pass\u00e9 fashion throwback to a more discriminatory time. Mr. Ford, Burberry, Rag & Bone and Bottega Veneta will all show collections for both sexes concurrently this month. This makes sense, given that they are all designed to express the same brand values, not to mention the fact that shopping is not a gender-specific pastime.Anything else we need to know?But what does it all mean?To be absolutely honest, no one knows. Sartorial spaghetti is being thrown at the wall to see what sticks. But something will, and then the whole sparkly, chiffon-clad edifice could tip. In some ways, it depends on how you react. So be prepared. They\u2019ll be watching.Advertisement"}

Facebook might, too. WhatsApp could have to follow tougher telecom standards.A new set of rules, expected to be unveiled by European Union officials on Wednesday, is likely to put new pressure on American tech companies.Europe calls it consumer protection. Silicon Valley calls it protectionism.In some ways, they are both right.The aim? To give the bloc\u2019s roughly 500 million consumers unfettered access to services like movie streaming, online shopping and cloud computing, no matter where they live. At the same time, the proposals would force some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies to comply with stringent competition, privacy and copyright rules.For many executives from American tech companies, such plans, which will still take years to come into effect and which will be subject to intense lobbying, feel like another round of protectionism. And while Europe\u2019s policy makers balk at these claims, the fact that Google, Facebook and Microsoft, among others, will be the most affected by the digital revamp has again highlighted how much Europeans rely on American tech when using digital services in their daily lives.The plans to be announced by the Brussels-based European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, include:The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\u25a0 Providing financial incentives to telecom operators like Deutsche Telekom and Orange to invest in the region\u2019s mobile and broadband networks. Operators may be given greater control over their internet infrastructure, potentially restricting competitors\u2019 use of these networks. Companies say such limits are needed to guarantee a return on the billions of dollars of digital investment. Consumer groups argue that it may lead to higher prices.Europe\u2019s proposals, which could still be subject to last-minute changes before being published, were confirmed by six people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the reforms had not yet been made public.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact of life that most innovative companies come from the West Coast,\u201d said Andrej Savin, an internet governance professor at the Copenhagen Business School. \u201cThe proposals coming from Brussels definitely have the American companies in mind.\u201dWith a roughly 90 percent market share, Google\u2019s search engine in Europe is more dominant than it is in the United States, where Microsoft\u2019s Bing service still holds its own. Facebook has more European users than American ones, while Germany and Britain remain two of Amazon\u2019s largest international markets.The latest digital reforms \u2014 either on purpose or by coincidence, depending on people\u2019s viewpoints \u2014 take aim at that dominance, and potentially give European publishers and telecom companies a helping hand to compete head-on with their American rivals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France\u2019s Burkini Debate Reverberates Around the World", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe burkini swimsuit is freedom and happiness and lifestyle changes \u2014 you can\u2019t take that away from a Muslim, or any other woman, that chooses to wear it,\u201d Ms. Zanetti said.\u201cI wanted to introduce a full range of clothing to suit a Muslim woman \u2014 or any woman \u2014 that wanted a bit of modesty and wanted to participate in any sporting activities,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was also my aim for them not to be judged for who they are, or where they\u2019re from, and who people think they\u2019re representing.\u201dHere is a look at how the battle over the burkini has played out in various places.Not everyone in Britain is wild about the burkini, of course.This summer a Facebook page was created with the apparent aim of shaming women wearing bikinis on the beaches of Morocco, a majority-Muslim kingdom and former French protectorate. \u201cOur slogan is: No to vice in an Islamic Moroccan nation,\u201d the country\u2019s news media quoted the creator of the page, identified as Aicha Amal, as saying. The page has been taken down.Long before the French ban, many private hotels and pools in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia \u2014 all governed by France in the past \u2014 had put up signs banning the burkini, or variations of it, some citing hygiene. But the bans did not come from the government.Burkinis caused a stir years ago in Algeria when they started appearing on beaches. \u201cJust walk along the Algerian coast to find that most Algerian women shun the swimsuit,\u201d the website Algeria Focus reported in 2014. \u201cThe general trend is modesty, so we see more and more women dressed in a burkini.\u201dOn the beaches of Dakar, the mostly Muslim capital of the overwhelmingly Muslim country of Senegal, no one seems to notice or care what anyone wears.One recent hot afternoon, male bathers wore jeans, white briefs or board shorts into the water. Women were soaking in long dresses, burkinis, bikinis and one-piece swimsuits.The article claimed that a member of the French Parliament had said that women wearing burkinis \u201cshould be sent back to their country, Burkina Faso.\u201dThe story, even though it was satire, prompted outrage. In the region, jokes by Western politicians or news publications are sensitive, especially when the butt of the joke is a former French colony.In anything-goes Berlin, which is as comfortable with intellectuals, nudists and clubbers with body piercings as it is with newly arrived Syrian refugees, the burkini is just another outfit.There are no national regulations governing religious dress, and the German government has indicated that it will not support bans on burkinis.In the bustling working-class and multicultural Wedding district of Berlin, Julia Friese, a journalist, showed up at one pool in a burkini and said she felt \u201cinvisible.\u201dAs in any country, there are naysayers. In June, the mayor of Neutraubling, a small town in Bavaria, banned the wearing of burkinis in public pools. In the state of Brandenburg, the parliamentary group of Alternative for Germany, the populist nationalist party, has demanded that burkinis be banned.But such views seem to be in the minority. After the parents of a Muslim girl in Frankfurt asked that she be exempted from swimming classes that included boys, the Federal Administrative Court in September 2013 ruled that she could wear a burkini as a compromise.In Italy, which has a sizable population of Muslim immigrants, the French burkini bans have elicited strong reactions.Some interpreted Mr. Elzir\u2019s post as suggesting that nuns should be banned from wearing their habits at the beach. But Mr. Elzir countered that he had merely posted a photograph that spoke for itself.\u201cI just wanted to get people to stop and think,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I posted the photo alone, without writing a single word. I didn\u2019t want to take sides but rather to spur a healthy debate.\u201dIn Russia, the burkini has been banned or rebuked in some quarters as an affront to hygiene and local culture.The Rus health resort in Yessentuki, a city at the base of the Caucasus Mountains, banned women this month from wearing full-body swimsuits, saying that guests had complained; the resort\u2019s head doctor called the swimsuit unhygienic.A correspondent for the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets showed up on a Moscow beach wearing a burkini to see how locals would react, and found that while most people were not bothered, some objected rudely.\u201cIf you\u2019re bundling yourself up in a burkini, it\u2019s better to stay home, to sit in warmth, in a comfy chair, to enjoy life,\u201d one observer told the interviewer. \u201cHere, you should undress and sunbathe.\u201dStill, others called for a live-and-let-live attitude. \u201cLet her swim,\u201d another Moscovite told the newspaper. \u201cShe\u2019s not scaring anyone.\u201dAmerican Muslims have greeted France\u2019s burkini ban with bemusement and dismay.The sisters have sold burkinis at a pop-up store \u2014 one is called The Hepburn \u2014 to appeal to fashion-conscious women. Women interviewed by the newspaper rejected the notion that burkinis encouraged radicalism, and compared it to the conservative attire of Orthodox Jews or Catholic clergy.Reporting was contributed by Aida Alami from Marrakesh, Morocco; Jaime Yaya Barry and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal; Victor Homola from Berlin; Lincoln Pigman from Moscow; and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.videoAdvertisement"}

We come here also to suffer again?\u201dThe demonstrators called for a federal investigation, citing distrust of San Diego County\u2019s district attorney, Bonnie Dumanis, and demanding the release of video footage of the shooting.\u201cCommunity input is important to us, which is why we solicited feedback about our officer-involved shooting review and video release policy in town hall meetings,\u201d said a San Diego County district attorney\u2019s office spokeswoman, Tanya Sierra. \u201cOur goal is to foster a peaceful and respectful dialogue.\u201dThe leaders of several county law enforcement departments and agencies, including Chief Jeff Davis of the El Cajon police, signed an agreement in August generally supporting the release of video in officer-involved shootings.After spending several hours protesting in front of the Police Department on Wednesday morning, demonstrators marched toward the scene of the shooting, chanting, \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201dThe Tuesday episode began after the police received several reports of an African-American man in his 30s \u201cwalking in traffic, not only endangering himself but also motorists,\u201d Chief Davis said at a Tuesday night news conference.At least one of the reports came from a woman who identified herself as Mr. Olango\u2019s sister, Chief Davis said, though he added that the police could not immediately confirm her identity because she was not cooperating. The man was mentally ill and unarmed, she told the police.An officer arrived near the Broadway Village Shopping Center in the north-central section of the city shortly after 2 p.m., confronting Mr. Olango, who was wearing jeans and a black tank top, behind a restaurant. Mr. Olango put his hand in his pants pocket and refused to comply with police orders, leading the officer to draw a gun, Chief Davis said. A second officer arrived and prepared to use a Taser against Mr. Olango, who continued to be uncooperative.Soon after, Chief Davis said, the man quickly pulled an object from his pocket and took \u201cwhat appeared to be a shooting stance,\u201d leading the two officers to act simultaneously: One discharged his Taser, the other his gun, the chief said.In it, a tearful woman repeatedly screams, \u201cYou killed my brother.\u201d A female officer approaches the grieving woman and asks for the victim\u2019s name. Distraught, the woman identifies Mr. Olango before walking away.\u201cI can\u2019t think. You killed my brother in front me! I can\u2019t think,\u201d she says through tears. He was 30, she said.Witnesses interviewed by local reporters were irate, insisting that the man had been unarmed. Michael Rodriguez, who said he had witnessed the shooting, told reporters he had left a nearby apartment when he saw police officers with their guns out surrounding a black man. He said that the man had his hands up and was \u201cscared to death.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s jerking, he\u2019s confused, he runs this way, and as soon as he runs this way, they discharge,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said.But Chief Davis and Lt. Rob Ransweiler, a spokesman for the El Cajon Police Department, denied those reports, saying that a phone that contained a video had been volunteered by a witness, and that no phones had been confiscated.\u201cI\u2019m sure at some point in time, that video will become public,\u201d Lieutenant Ransweiler said.Roxana Popescu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I would never forgive myself if something happened to my nephew.\u201dMr. Castile had been pulled over by the police in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region at least 49 times in a 13-year span, often for minor infractions: turning into a parking lot without signaling; failing to repair a broken seatbelt; driving at night with an unlit license plate; driving with tinted windows.A sequence of events in the fatal shooting in Charlotte, N.C., based on what can be seen in four videos.As a high-profile athlete, Ms. Williams used the weight of her celebrity to convey the despair that has gripped many black Americans after multiple police killings, most of them men. Her post also highlighted the awareness of black Americans that they are often regarded with suspicion by the authorities during everyday activities.The cognizance, which many say is nothing new but is being talked about more frequently because of the national discussion on police shootings, has bred movements like Black Lives Matter and hashtag trends like #shoppingwhileblack.The roster of black victims since then has included Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Keith Scott, Tamir Rice.He added that he was \u201cnot that confident that things are going to go well and that my son is going to return home.\u201d\u201cI feel like that we are treated differently than other people,\u201d she said, pausing tearfully.\u201cWe are black people and we shouldn\u2019t have to feel like this.

This is the battle for that empty seat, and there are five candidates who want it.Here\u2019s what else is happening:We officially nominate today as a perfect day.Expect plenty of sun, a soft breeze, and a cloud or two to make its way across the sky, for a bit of variety.Luckily, similarly splendid candidates are in the forecast this week.In other news:Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr were running as Democratic-Republicans, and the president, John Adams, and Charles Pinckney were running as Federalists.The Democratic-Republicans prevailed, but here\u2019s where it gets tricky: At the time, votes did not distinguish between candidates for president and vice president.So when Jefferson and Burr tied, the decision of who would become president was left to the House of Representatives, which was controlled by the Federalists.Alexander Hamilton, a staunch Federalist, loathed Aaron Burr and made it known.He must have had a way with words, because Jefferson \u2014 the lesser of two evils, in Hamilton\u2019s opinion \u2014 was elected president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peres and the Passing of Hope", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThink what you will of Peres \u2014 and he was an early supporter during the 1970s of settlements in the West Bank as well as a politician who never won a clear mandate from Israelis to be their leader \u2014 he was a man of restless creativity. He thought big about Middle Eastern peace. He dreamed big of prosperity allied to security for Israelis and Palestinians. He lived big, unrequited to the end.His convictions evolved. In response to the wave of messianic religious Zionism with its claim to the entire biblical Land of Israel, he arrived at the utter certainty that, on the contrary, land had to be given up for peace. Holding the West Bank ad infinitum was untenable. The Oslo Accord of 1993, which he helped negotiate, was testament to his boldness. As he declared at Rabin Square in Tel Aviv almost two years ago: \u201cIsrael will be giving up its future if it sees the status quo as its desire.\u201dThese were statesmen, not salesmen; Israelis steeped in their land who looked beyond the next news cycle. They were ready to accept limited risk to get Israel out of the business of running the lives of others, Palestinians or Egyptians. They were conscious of the particular responsibilities \u2014 military but also ethical \u2014 of leaders of the Jewish state.In contrast, Netanyahu has merely endured. He has been static in thought, going nowhere.If the passing of Peres contains a message to Netanyahu and to Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, it must surely be: Imagine!I am not holding my breath. Israel is bereft because it has lost a father.Instead, in those six months, Peres swung this way and that, revealing his hesitations. As the historian Avi Shlaim has written, the Palestinians \u201cregarded Rabin as much more reliable than Peres because with Rabin yes meant yes and no meant no, whereas with Peres both yes and no meant maybe.\u201dThe killing in Gaza of a leading Hamas operative in January 1996 led to a wave of horrific Palestinian suicide attacks against Israelis over the next two months. These weakened Peres; they undermined Oslo. So, too, did his decision to start a massive but inconclusive bombing campaign in Lebanon. In short, in Shlaim\u2019s words, his \u201cattempt to change his image from Mr. Peace to Mr. Security only damaged his credibility.\u201d Netanyahu edged Peres by 50.4 percent to 49.5 percent.By that narrow margin was the dream of Peres and Rabin defeated. An arid political season has ensued. And so in Peres\u2019s death the loss feels acute.I began by saying that a void fills the soul. It does, for those like myself who love Israel. But because of the politics of the past two decades, fewer people love Israel today, more people are reflexively hostile. In Peres, a noble idea of the Jewish State clung on against the dismal tide.And now?Advertisement"}

She posted a message in Bad News Women, a private group made up of black female artists, and suggested meeting to discuss police brutality and the response from visual artists. Ms. Leigh\u2019s New Museum connection provided the physical space, and the initial gathering gave members a chance to exhale collectively.\u201cAt least you knew you would be in a space with people who were your support system; there was some commiseration there,\u201d the artist Nontsikelelo Mutiti said of the initial meetings. \u201cThose moments were really key for me.\u201dThe intent of the newly formed group is to foster a sharper discourse and cultivate strategies for the Black Lives Matter movement.

The officer then aims directly at the man\u2019s forehead and pulls the trigger, killing him.\u201cIsn\u2019t this what\u2019s happening in the USA right now?\u201d writes one viewer. \u201cWe\u2019re killing innocent people.\u201dInspired by the videos that have captured police killings and defined the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, West Africans are increasingly deploying social media in nations where corruption and abuse by security forces sometimes occur with few repercussions.In America, videos of white police officers shooting unarmed black men have caused a social uprising, exposing what many people see as a deadly national bias in law enforcement.So, just as in the United States and other places where social media has enabled protest, citizens who feel marginalized are using the videos to seek justice when law enforcement officers abuse their authority.\u201cThere is a general sense that law officials can do pretty much whatever they want,\u201d said Vincent Foucher, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, who has worked extensively in West Africa. \u201cImages are a very powerful way to bring up these issues.\u201dIn Nigeria, capturing law enforcement abuse is so popular that people send in videos and photos taken from scenes of military brutality, bribery by public officials and other misconduct to one of the nation\u2019s biggest television stations, which shows them in a segment called \u201cEye Reports\u201d during its main news program.\u201cThey are now part of the reporting of the good, the bad and the ugly of the country\u2019s social life,\u201d says Lanre Arogundade, the coordinator of the International Press Center in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital.Human rights workers say that the practice of sharing videos in West Africa is a natural extension of longstanding frustrations with abuse of power in the region. But even with today\u2019s ability to capture and broadcast evidence immediately, the videos have not always produced tangible results. Often the clips are hard to verify, and few prosecutions have followed, experts say. Scenes of police officers seeking checkpoint bribes or beating civilians sometimes amount to no more than a handful of Facebook comments expressing indignation.But little by little, many of the videos shared on social media are chipping away at impunity and in some cases drawing widespread attention to problems that the authorities are finding hard to ignore.\u201cThese have led to, if not prosecutions, at least more awareness and discussion of violations, and that is really important,\u201d said Sabrina Mahtani, West Africa researcher for Amnesty International.In areas where law and order is scant, videos are sometimes shared online by supporters of the police \u2014 as a cautionary tale of what happens to wrongdoers who are rightly, if violently, punished for doing bad things. But once they make their way across social media, they are sometimes cited as evidence of abuse by security forces, evoking outrage and injustice.In the video of the officer shooting the man in Ivory Coast, for instance, one onlooker can be heard saying, \u201cAgain, do it again!\u201d after the officer shoots the man the first time. Others in the crowd appear to egg on the officer, and at the end of the clip, another person off camera can be heard saying, \u201cDon\u2019t film him, don\u2019t film him,\u201d adding, \u201cYou are going to get that police officer in trouble.\u201dBut as the video made its way across the internet, it prompted an uproar in Abidjan, the nation\u2019s economic capital, where the officer was arrested and an official investigation was opened. In a statement widely reported by the local news media, the chief of the Ivorian national police force said it \u201cwill not tolerate behavior from its officers that is contrary to the ethics of human rights.\u201dIn July, Sheriff Shittu, who is not a law enforcement officer, was stuck on a highway in Lagos watching a scene he felt deserved the collective outrage of the internet.A soldier was beating a bus conductor, waving a gun and threatening to shoot the man. Other soldiers joined in, shouting, \u201cWe\u2019re going to kill him.\u201dMr. Shittu said he was inspired by the success of American videos in drawing attention to violence by law enforcement officers and had seen videos of similar episodes shared online that resulted in soldiers being disciplined in Nigeria.\u201cIn the past nothing would happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s changing now.\u201dOne of the officers at the scene that day posted the video on his Facebook page, apparently for bragging rights. But it was shared across social media, prompting denunciations from Guinean human rights organizations.The Guinean government, which passed measures in 2011 aimed at cracking down on forced confessions, suspended 13 officers over the episode and opened an investigation into using torture to extract confessions.Cellphone-armed citizens certainly have not put a halt to abuses of authority. In Nigeria, the military has been accused of killing countless civilians in recent years. And in some nations, government opposition forces and protesters have been threatened, beaten, jailed or sometimes killed without consequence, even when the abuse was captured on video.Monique Koumate, who was pregnant with twins, arrived at a hospital in distress and died before she entered. En route to the morgue, her relatives noticed that the fetuses, apparently still alive, were moving inside Ms. Koumate\u2019s body. They rushed back to the hospital but were unable to summon help. Desperate to save the babies, one relative placed Ms. Koumate\u2019s corpse on the sidewalk and sliced open her stomach, pulling out the babies and resting them on her stomach.It was too late. They were dead.The gruesome scene went viral online. A Twitter hashtag #MoniqueKoumate was created, and accusations were aired that the hospital had turned away Ms. Koumate because she could not pay for care.The public outrage prompted the hospital to investigate and led to a report by the National Order of Doctors of Cameroon citing deficiencies and calling for better maternal health care.But police abuse is still the focus of many people, with numerous Facebook and WhatsApp groups in the region dedicated to sharing videos on the topic.In Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, passers-by were already recording when Yasmine Bilkis Ibrahim pulled out her phone to film an officer screaming and waving his gun at a terrified unarmed man after an apparent traffic altercation.\u201cI will kill you,\u201d the officer yelled at the man. \u201cAnd nothing will come of it.\u201dMs. Ibrahim, 24, made an immediate link to what is happening in the United States. \u201cIf people can use such videos in America to demand justice, I believe we can also demand justice using the same method,\u201d she said.Brima Kamara, a spokesman for the Sierra Leone police, said he belongs to a WhatsApp group, called \u201cTalk With the Police,\u201d made up of police officers, politicians and regular citizens.People often submit video clips to the group, alleging police misbehavior. One recent submission showed two officers fighting. The men were suspended and sent back to the police academy for more training, Mr. Kamara said.He said the videos help improve the police force in a nation still recovering from a brutal civil war that ended 14 years ago.\u201cWe often advise officers to be careful of their actions in public because at this age they can\u2019t get away with crimes or actions,\u201d Mr. Kamara said. \u201cNow with the involvement of social media and the smartphones, everything goes public in just a minute.\u201dSean Lyngaas contributed reporting from Abidjan, Ivory Coast; and Tony Iyare from Lagos, Nigeria.videovideovideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fox Settles With Gretchen Carlson Over Roger Ailes Sex Harassment Claims", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFox News\u2019s parent company spent $20 million on Tuesday to settle a lawsuit brought by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson, whose allegations of sexual harassment toppled the network\u2019s powerful chairman, Roger Ailes, and engulfed the company in crisis.But if the settlement was meant to signal the close of a damaging chapter for the network, it fell short. Fox\u2019s newsroom was hit minutes later by a new shock wave: Greta Van Susteren, one of the channel\u2019s best-known and longest-serving hosts, was leaving, effective immediately.Network officials insisted that the timing was coincidental. But the settlement, combined with Ms. Van Susteren\u2019s abrupt departure, underscored the continuing tumult inside Fox News, whose newsroom, once proudly defiant, has been besieged this summer by new allegations of harassment and persistent rumors about turnover in the on-air and executive ranks.These days, it seems, the end of one Fox drama is only the start of another.Stars like Megyn Kelly and Bill O\u2019Reilly have contracts that expire next year, and Ms. Van Susteren\u2019s exit on Tuesday was taken as an unsettling sign of change. It is unclear whether Fox News, without Mr. Ailes at the helm, can maintain its political clout in a disruptive election season.The uproar is somewhat puzzling for Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, who control Fox News\u2019s owner, 21st Century Fox. They say they have taken extraordinary steps to address problems at the network, which is still the highest-ranked cable news network in the country, beginning with their swift removal of Mr. Ailes.Specialists in employment law described the $20 million payout to Ms. Carlson \u2014 a figure confirmed by a person briefed on the agreement \u2014 as among the largest-known settlements for a single-plaintiff sexual harassment suit. (Mr. Ailes, who received $40 million from Fox as part of his exit agreement, is not paying any portion of the settlement.)Fox has also settled with at least two other women who came forward with complaints about Mr. Ailes, the person said.And the company issued a rare public apology to Ms. Carlson, \u201cfor the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve.\u201dThe reasons behind Ms. Van Susteren\u2019s departure remained murky, but people on both sides of the negotiations pointed to an icy meeting in July between Ms. Van Susteren and Rupert Murdoch as a turning point in her tenure.Days after Mr. Ailes\u2019s exit, Ms. Van Susteren met with Mr. Murdoch in his second-floor office inside Fox\u2019s Manhattan headquarters. The anchor, accompanied by her husband and agent, John P. Coale, requested more favorable terms to her contract \u2014 which was not immediately up for renewal \u2014 and cited an exit clause that allowed her to leave the network in the event that Mr. Ailes was no longer chairman.Mr. Murdoch was not impressed, both sides say. \u201cIt was tense,\u201d Mr. Coale recalled in a telephone interview on Tuesday.Late last week, Ms. Van Susteren informed Fox that she planned to invoke her exit clause. But she woke up on Tuesday fully expecting to tape her prime-time show, \u201cOn the Record,\u201d that evening. Instead, Mr. Coale said, \u201csomeone came to our house and delivered two letters\u201d from the network. The message: \u201cShe\u2019s out.\u201dIt was so abrupt that a large-scale poster of Ms. Van Susteren, who routinely beat the cable competition in her 7 p.m. time slot, was still displayed outside Fox\u2019s Manhattan building when the announcement went out. (The poster was removed later on Tuesday.) Inside the channel\u2019s Washington bureau, newspapers sat untouched outside Ms. Van Susteren\u2019s still-full office.Mr. Coale, in the interview, echoed that sentiment. \u201cThere\u2019s so much chaos\u201d at Fox, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to work there.\u201dAsked why his wife had exercised the exit clause, Mr. Coale said, \u201cThere\u2019s more than meets the eye,\u201d adding that there \u201cmight be litigation in the future.\u201d But he provided no further details. Ms. Van Susteren, on Facebook, wrote that she had to leave the network now because of a time limit on her exit clause.Brit Hume, a veteran Fox political anchor, took over hosting duties for Ms. Van Susteren\u2019s show on Tuesday and is expected to continue through the election. \u201cI count Greta a friend and I\u2019m sorry to see her go,\u201d Mr. Hume said at the conclusion of Tuesday\u2019s broadcast.Although she has been a Fox fixture since 2002, Ms. Van Susteren does not command the same star power as Ms. Kelly or Mr. O\u2019Reilly. Fox News executives on Tuesday dismissed the notion that her departure signaled tough times ahead, noting that the channel has scored record ratings this year. \u201cFox News has never been stronger,\u201d the network\u2019s co-presidents, Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine, said in a statement.Ms. Van Susteren\u2019s exit was viewed by Fox officials as a less consequential development than the company\u2019s settlement with Ms. Carlson, whose suit initially faced a legal challenge from Mr. Ailes.Most of the remarks that she attributed to Mr. Ailes in her lawsuit \u2014 including lines like, \u201cI think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then you\u2019d be good and better and I\u2019d be good and better\u201d \u2014 were taken straight from those recordings, the person said.Officials at 21st Century Fox became aware of the recordings about three weeks after Ms. Carlson filed her lawsuit, the person said, after Ms. Carlson\u2019s lawyers spoke to investigators from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the law firm hired to look into the accusations against Mr. Ailes. (About 20 women at Fox have come forward during the firm\u2019s inquiry to describe inappropriate behavior by Mr. Ailes.)In a sign that Ms. Carlson is not going to shrink from the spotlight, she recently hired the power publicist Cindi Berger of PMK BNC to represent her. She issued a statement on Tuesday saying she was \u201cready to move on to the next chapter of my life, in which I will redouble my efforts to empower women in the workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Clinton-Trump Debate Expected to Be Rare Draw in a Polarized Age", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe uniquely uncivil presidential campaign is about to produce one of the biggest civic gatherings in decades: For 90 minutes on Monday night, a polarized nation will pause to watch the first head-to-head encounter between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Not all viewers will watch from their living rooms. At the Dreamland Theater in tiny Nantucket, Mass., so many are expected for a debate-watching party that the town assigned a police officer to stand watch in case of rowdiness.In Paris, many of those abroad for Fashion Week are setting middle-of-the-night alarms so they can watch the debate live \u2014 at 3 a.m. local time. \u201cI need to feel like I\u2019m part of this,\u201d said Laura Brown, InStyle\u2019s editor in chief.And in Richardson, Tex., the Alamo Drafthouse had to switch to a bigger room after overwhelming interest in a screening with refreshments like a \u201cbuild a wall around it\u201d taco salad.Mass experiences \u2014 built around news events like the moon landing, and pop culture moments for older generations like the \u201cWho shot J. R.?\u201d episode of \u201cDallas\u201d \u2014 are rare in an age of fragmented media and the drift toward partisan outlets, where viewers can effectively choose their own news.\u201cIt\u2019s a throwback to a phenomenon that has essentially disappeared in the era of digital media,\u201d said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News. \u201cThis is Americans gathering around the electronic hearth.\u201dTelevision networks and online streaming sites, including Facebook and Twitter, will carry the same feed on Monday, showing a spare debate stage at Hofstra University, on Long Island, a format that predates the blaring graphics and space-age sets that now dominate television news.Still, even if a large portion of the country is watching, what Americans see may be as much about their beliefs and preferred news outlets as what transpires onstage.About 8 percent of registered voters remain undecided, according to the New York Times/CBS News poll, a thin if crucial sliver of the electorate. And after Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump conclude on Monday, viewers are likely to return to their ideological silos, absorbing instant analysis from left-leaning anchors on MSNBC or commentators at right-leaning outlets like Breitbart News.The debate itself will be subject to instant, blow-by-blow interpretation on social media.The event\u2019s impact is unlikely to rival that of, say, 1960, when John F. Kennedy\u2019s smooth performance in the first televised debate helped sway voters against his opponent, Richard Nixon. That debate aired without commentary \u2014 or graphics and captions on the screen. \u201cJournalists were of the opinion they should wait and ruminate and think about what went down, and then, a day or a week later, talk about it,\u201d Mr. de Leon said.Mr. Trump has unleashed a blizzard of falsehoods, exaggerations and outright lies in the general election. Here's our analysis of 31 untruths from Sept. 15-21.Tom Sander, who runs a program on civic engagement at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said he was worried that voters might not have a chance to remove partisan blinders.\u201cMany of us come to these events more to confirm what we already think we know, rather than to search for common ground,\u201d Mr. Sander said.The candidates may hope otherwise. Mrs. Clinton has told donors privately that she expects 100 million people to watch the debate, and that 60 million of those viewers may be focusing on the campaign for the first time, a prime opportunity for her to make inroads.Many may tune in merely for the spectacle.\u201cIt\u2019s like waiting for the Ali-Frazier fight,\u201d said Dick Cavett, the longtime talk-show host, referring to the highly anticipated boxing bouts between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in the 1970s. Mr. Cavett said he would cut short a dinner on Monday to ensure he would be in front of a TV by 9 p.m.\u201cThere\u2019s possible drama and fireworks and insults and horror and disaster and potential enlightenment,\u201d Mr. Cavett said. \u201cIt would attract anybody.\u201d15 PhotosSome in TV noted that the 2008 meeting between Joseph R. Biden and Sarah Palin attracted 70 million viewers, more than any of that year\u2019s presidential debates, a sign that civic interest may be less of a draw than seeing a colorful candidate like Ms. Palin \u2014 or Mr. Trump.The 1980 Carter-Reagan debate scored a record audience in part because it was the only head-to-head matchup between the candidates in a precable era. But Neal Shapiro, a former president of NBC News, recalled that Mr. Reagan\u2019s unusual background as a Hollywood actor spurred interest.\u201cPeople wanted to see, would they really feel comfortable with Reagan as president?\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cPeople were wondering, \u2018Can I live with this guy?\u2019\u201dThe first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012 drew 67 million viewers. Advertisers, anticipating even more this time, are using the opportunity to unveil new ads with themes that may resonate with Americans focused on the campaign.Audi\u2019s commercial shows a man and woman, both hotel valets, battling for the right to drive an Audi RS7 luxury car, and features the slogan \u201cChoose the next driver wisely.\u201d American flags, and ice sculptures of a donkey and an elephant, convey the message that the car, as an Audi vice president for marketing put it, is \u201ca metaphor for the importance of America.\u201dIn a spot set for Monday night, Tecate, a Mexican beer label owned by Heineken, features a view of the Mexican border and a Trump-like voice-over that declares, \u201cThe time has come for a wall \u2014 a tremendous wall.\u201d The wall is revealed as a knee-high resting place for Tecate beers, \u201ca wall that brings us together.\u201dThe ad, airing on networks including Fox News and Univision, is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d about a political point of view or affiliation, said Felix Palau, a vice president at Tecate.\u201cTecate, being a Mexican beer, is a perfect protagonist of a story where a wall brings people together in a very fun way,\u201d Mr. Palau said.The debate\u2019s biggest televised competition on Monday is likely to be another program featuring intricate strategies and crushing blows: \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d on ESPN. And one famous political junkie says he may flip the channel \u2014 for a few minutes, at least \u2014 to the action on the gridiron.\u201cThe president\u2019s fired up about \u2018Monday Night Football,\u2019\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, playfully told reporters who asked if President Obama planned to watch the debate.\u201cThere will be millions of people across the country who are quite interested to see the two candidates onstage together for the first time,\u201d Mr. Earnest added. \u201cI imagine the president will be one of them.\u201dSapna Maheshwari, Amy Chozick and Michael Shear contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Victory for Press Freedom in 1735 Set an Important Precedent", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.More than half a century after A.J. Liebling declared that freedom of the press \u201cis guaranteed only to those who own one,\u201d the quip seems doubly out of date. For one thing, anyone with access to the internet can now be said to \u201cown one\u201d and to enjoy the freedoms of the First Amendment with abandon. At the same time, the people Liebling had in mind, owners of the press in the more institutional sense, find their guarantee of freedom less than ironclad.The enemies of unfettered journalism in the United States these days include prosecutors crying \u201cnational security\u201d in hot pursuit of leakers; a presidential candidate who vows, if elected, to \u201copen up\u201d the libel laws so that when journalists offend \u201cwe can sue them and win lots of money\u201d; and, in one bizarre case, a vengeful Silicon Valley billionaire bankrolling lawsuits aimed at driving an impertinent website out of business.Many of the questions at the heart of the matter are the same ones that have been asked since before there was a First Amendment: Are opinions protected no matter how obnoxious? Are public figures fairer game than private citizens? Is it a crime to publish material that undermines the authority of government? Is a statement libel if it\u2019s true?So Richard Kluger decided this was an apt time to revisit the story of John Peter Zenger\u2019s New-York Weekly Journal, culminating in an August 1735 courtroom drama that put those questions to the test.Kluger\u2019s last venture into the history of American journalism was \u201cThe Paper,\u201d his monumental 1986 autopsy of The New York Herald Tribune, and he brings the same gifts to this more modest book: vivid storytelling built on exacting research, a knack for animating the context and an exquisite sense of balance that honors this country\u2019s essential press freedom without romanticizing its champions.The champions of \u201cIndelible Ink\u201d are Lewis Morris and James Alexander, two colonial lawyers and power brokers whose motives are anything but pure. The context is a colonial America ruled, or more often misruled, by crown-appointed governors and swayed by mighty factions \u2014 the land barons who farm vast estates versus the merchant princes who control trade.Morris, a calculating but intemperate attorney, is a holder of large estates, and also large grudges, mostly against powerful figures who seek to thwart his ambitions. Alexander is \u201cprobably the foremost and perhaps wealthiest lawyer in New York,\u201d a longtime political adviser to Morris and a prolific wordsmith.As the central drama begins, Morris has already helped engineer the ouster of two royal governors and has locked horns with a third, William Cosby. When Cosby proves tenacious, Morris and Alexander decide to wheel in a novel piece of artillery: a newspaper.\u201cTo understate the matter, the printing trade was not much encouraged in colonial America,\u201d Kluger observes. Although imperial rules had relaxed a bit from the previous century, when a defamatory publication could subject the offender to \u201cthe amputation of the ears,\u201d the colonies had inherited British common law, which essentially defined as \u201cseditious libel\u201d anything that annoyed anyone in power. The prevailing legal text of the time declared that not only was truth not a defense against prosecution, it also compounded the offense, \u201csince the greater appearance there is of truth in any malicious invective, so much the more provoking it is.\u201d Speaking ill of a public figure, the prevailing jurisprudence added, \u201chas a direct tendency to breed in the people a dislike of their governors and incline them to faction and sedition.\u201dSomehow Morris and Alexander persuade Peter Zenger, a German-American printer, to risk everything by pushing the limits of official tolerance. Whether Zenger was moved by profit, idealism or something else is unknown, as is almost everything else about the man. Kluger resorts to a lot of \u201cwas probably\u201d and \u201cwe can only imagine\u201d and \u201cmight well have\u201d to sketch a speculative portrait of a young immigrant from the German Palatinate who takes up an apprenticeship with a printer and eventually sets up his own shop, producing religious tracts and works in German and Dutch. There is nothing in the record to suggest that he would publish \u201cAmerica\u2019s first printed expression of overt political dissent.\u201d The reason Zenger became the sole defendant and languished in jail when authorities ultimately cracked down on his little weekly is that while writers \u2014 first and foremost James Alexander, who supplied most of Zenger\u2019s content \u2014 hid behind pen names, printers were obliged by law to sign their work.The New-York Weekly Journal debuted on Nov. 5, 1733, four compact pages of gray type. The first sign that this publication was different appeared on Page 2, a lively report on an assembly election \u201cthat modern journalists would recognize as creditable reportage.\u201d Subsequent issues contained little eyewitness reporting, but increasingly bold satire and polemic aimed (though the target was not named) at Governor Cosby. The newspaper\u2019s complaints against the governor\u2019s corruption and abuse of power were often vague, undocumented and hyperbolic, including the assertion that Cosby was \u201cbut one degree removed from an idiot.\u201d Kluger makes no attempt to defend the newspaper as an ancestor of modern journalism, although you can trace a line of descent from \u00adZenger\u2019s weekly to the Gawker school.After failing repeatedly to persuade a grand jury to indict Zenger, Governor Cosby\u2019s men find a way to haul the printer into a court presided over by a Cosby crony. The judge signals his leaning \u00adearly on by disbarring Zenger\u2019s lawyers and appointing a far less experienced \u00addefender. But the Zenger defense team springs a surprise: After opening remarks, the court-appointed defender yields to a legal virtuoso, Andrew Hamilton of Philadelphia, \u201cthe most accomplished barrister in the American colonies,\u201d famed for having \u201cthe vivacity, wit and incandescent presence of a great Shakespearean actor.\u201dWhat ensues is a gripping courtroom confrontation that Kluger reconstructs mainly from the detailed notes of the defense lawyers, there being no official transcript. Alexander\u2019s strategy is daring, bordering on subversive. He concedes that \u00adZenger published the offending material, but asserts that it was no crime because the material was true. Moreover, he argues that, British common law be damned, there is a \u201cnatural right\u201d to complain about abusive rulers \u2014 to \u201cput their neighbors upon their guard against the craft or even \u00adviolence of men in \u00adauthority.\u201dThe chief justice has instructed the jurors that their role is solely to rule on the facts of the case, leaving to him the question of whether the facts add up to a crime. But the jury goes rogue and after the briefest of deliberations declares \u00adZenger not guilty.The Zenger case did not change the law; courts in Britain and the colonies continued to treat affronts to the government as criminal. But the principle that truth cannot be libel has been recognized in American common law for well over a century; and Kluger makes a convincing case that The New-York Weekly Journal and the jurors who balked at convicting Zenger 40 years before the Revolution \u201chelped implant in the public mind that open protest against an imposed and arguably unjust government was both a societal necessity and a civil right.\u201dIn an epilogue, Kluger flashes forward to the case of Edward Snowden, the intelligence insider who exposed the government\u2019s invasion of our phones and emails, to demonstrate that \u201cfree expression remains nearly as imperiled\u201d today as in the 18th century. Whatever you think of Snowden, that\u2019s a stretch. No journalist has been indicted \u2014 or silenced \u2014 for publishing Snowden\u2019s secrets. A more immediate menace to a robust press is the insatiable appetite of Google and Facebook, sucking away what\u2019s left of the advertising revenues that support aggressive reporting. But that\u2019s another book.A review on Sept. 18 about \u201cIndelible Ink: The Trials of John Peter Zenger and the Birth of America\u2019s Free Press,\u201d by Richard Kluger, misstated the legal impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in the case of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan in 1964. The court ruled that a public official cannot prevail in a libel suit against a publisher without showing actual malice on the publisher\u2019s part, even if the statements in question were false and defamatory. The ruling did not in fact \u201cfully secure\u201d the \u201cprinciple that truth cannot be libel\u201d \u2014 that principle has been part of American common law for well over a century.Bill Keller, a former executive editor of The Times, is editor in chief of The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that covers criminal justice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Inequality Problem: Real Income Gains Are Brief and Hard to Find", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneWorking families finally got a raise.Households all the way down the income scale made more money last year. The average incomes of the poorest fifth of the population increased 6.6 percent after three consecutive years of decline. And the official poverty rate declined to 13.5 percent from 14.8 percent in 2014, the sharpest decline since the late 1960s.\u201cThis shows the importance of robust labor markets,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cIf working-age Americans are going to get ahead, it is through a paycheck.\u201dAnd yet this positive news \u2014 while clearly undermining Donald J. Trump\u2019s unbridled pessimism about the American economy \u2014 does not justify unbridled celebration, either.\u201cThe next question is why did it take such a long time for things to look good?\u201d said Arloc Sherman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy analysis group. As Sheldon H. Danziger of the Russell Sage Foundation put it, it\u2019s great news that men\u2019s earnings from work increased 1.5 percent. But they are still lower than in the 1970s.The answer does not just involve sluggish growth. It is also about its distribution. Gains may be finally trickling down to those at the bottom of the ladder. But the numbers still offer a lopsided picture, with a gargantuan share of income rising to the top. While the bottom fifth of households increased their share of the nation\u2019s income, by the census\u2019s definition, to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent, the richest 5 percent kept 21.8 percent of the pie, the same as in 2014.\u201cThere\u2019s an inequality problem,\u201d Mr. Sherman added.Against the backdrop of the last few decades, the income gains revealed on Tuesday underscore how difficult the American economy has made it for average workers to get ahead. In nearly every successive economic cycle, progress came slower and harder than in the previous one.The data, which measured how Americans were doing six years into the economic recovery, show that incomes in the middle, measured in 2015 dollars, were still 1.6 percent below the previous peak of $57,423 a household, which was attained in 2007, just before the economy sank into what has come to be known as the Great Recession.How does that look compared to the nation\u2019s recent history? After the economy slipped into recession in 1969, it took only three years for incomes in the middle to rebound and surpass their previous peak. After the downturn of 1973, it took five; after back-to-back recessions in 1981 and 1982, it took seven.And, except for the long expansion that ran from 1991 through 2000, it has been getting worse. The economic growth from late 2001 to about the end of 2007 never even managed to deliver incomes above the previous peak for the typical household, reached near the end of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. The expansion underway today may not get there, either.Today, median household incomes are still 2.4 percent below the absolute peak they hit in 1999 \u2014 when Facebook had yet to come into existence, the big news in the music business was Napster, and the good times in Silicon Valley were about to come crashing down with the collapse of the dot-com bubble.At the bottom of the ladder, households at the 10th percentile \u2014 those poorer than 90 percent of the population \u2014 are still a bit poorer than they were in 1989. Americans have managed to develop an internet economy, invent social media and build driverless cars since then, but not to improve the lot of those at the bottom.Of course, the Census Bureau\u2019s numbers on income and poverty don\u2019t add up to a perfect representation of families\u2019 means. For one thing, they include only \u201cmoney income\u201d \u2014 excluding in-kind government benefits like housing vouchers or food stamps. They don\u2019t include the impact of taxes, ignoring the earned-income tax credit, which provides substantial help to families with low earnings.The current census data does suggest that growth can ultimately bring prosperity to average Americans. Still, it also points to the persistence of wide inequality as being at the center of the story.Across the entire bottom 60 percent of the distribution, households are taking home a smaller slice of the pie than they did in the 1960s and 1970s. The 3.4 percent of income that households in the bottom fifth took home last year was less than the 5.8 percent they had in 1974. With their share shrinking with almost every economic cycle, it is hardly a surprise that it takes longer for them to experience any income gains at all. Growth, alone, is not adding to their prosperity as it once did.By contrast, households in the top 5 percent have profited nicely from America\u2019s expansions. In 2015, they took in $350,870, on average. That is 4.9 percent more than in 1999 and 37.5 percent more than in 1989.Historical precedent suggests the latest economic expansion is getting long in the tooth. Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser in President Obama\u2019s first term, says there are better than even odds today that the United States will tip into a recession within three years. In July, Deutsche Bank said the probability of a recession within the next 12 months had jumped to 60 percent, the highest since August 2008. JPMorgan thinks the odds are 37 percent.For all but Americans at the very top, that means that the punch bowl may well be taken away again before the party really gets going. That is not how a well-functioning economy should work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hopes for Democracy\u2019s Spread Meet With Harsh Facts", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Democracy 2016WASHINGTON \u2014 These are tough days for enthusiasts of the world\u2019s steady march of democracy.A wave of nationalism \u2014 led by calls to raise the drawbridges against outsiders and their influence \u2014 has ushered in strongmen in places where, just a few years ago, democratic institutions seemed inevitably on the rise. Across the globe, the effects are clear: When nativism becomes a rallying call, tolerance and a willingness to compromise, the lubricants of liberal democracy, often seep away. The effects are dramatic. For a long while, American officials convinced themselves that Russia was gradually edging toward integrating itself in Western institutions, and the values they represent.But President Vladimir V. Putin has squeezed the life out of independent news media and any meaningful dissent in Russia. Increasingly, to oppose his government is to risk ending up dead.President Xi Jinping, who many in the Obama Administration thought four years ago would bring a modern, technocratic veneer to Chinese rule, and restrain its worst tendencies toward brutality, has veered in directions few in the administration predicted. The digital Great Wall is higher and thicker than ever. Newspapers and other publications have been shuttered, and his government has jailed dissidents on the vague charge of causing \u201cdisorderly\u201d debate. In Turkey, a freely elected leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, used a coup attempt against his government to execute what was clearly a preplanned purge that has cast thousands into prison, from schoolteachers to journalists. Washington has been reluctant to protest. It needs its bases in Turkey for the conflict in Syria. More than five years after the Obama administration urged President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to step down in the face of the protests, it is delivering arms and aid to his successor once removed, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a former general whose iron-fisted rule exceeds anything Mr. Mubarak ever managed to pull off. Yet Egypt\u2019s cooperation is so needed to keep a lid on the Middle East that the State Department is extraordinarily hesitant to condemn a situation in which democracy is a distant memory. Poland, the most effective of the newer members of NATO, has turned to a right-wing government, as has Hungary. In Austria, a presidential election in a few weeks could see the election of Norbert Hofer, who leads an anti-immigrant party.It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. The end of Cold War rivalries, China\u2019s growing wealth and integration with the world economy, the benefits of global trade and the internet\u2019s ability to wipe away traditional borders were supposed to make variations on the theme of democratic rule the inevitable choice.That was the meaning of \u201cThe End of History and the Last Man,\u201d Francis Fukuyama\u2019s 1992 book, which posited that the fall of the Berlin Wall was \u201cthe end point of mankind\u2019s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\u201d There are a few bright spots.In 1998, Indonesia looked like it might break apart after the fall of Suharto. Today it is an unruly but real democracy. From Africa to Latin America, there are stirrings of democratic instincts in places where they had rarely taken root. Yet ask around the world, and it is clear that the Western democracies that were supposed to be the model for a new, interconnected world look a lot less attractive than they once did. Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi deride the \u201cAmerican model\u201d as a prescription for disorder and decay. The election drama unfolding in the United States has fueled that argument, prompting many to question whether the style of democracy America preaches, for all its obvious benefits, brings out the worst instincts in an electorate.How did this happen? In a world where the internet was supposed to make everyone aware of the benefits of more direct democracy, how did the forces of order and authoritarianism roar back? How does one explain the rise of My-Country-First candidates like Donald J. Trump and the French far-right politician Marine Le Pen, both of whom have said that promoting democracy around the world is not a goal? The answers so far seem unsatisfying. Yes, the economic downturn that swept the world starting in 2007 left untold millions behind, and many have never caught up. A McKinsey Global Institute study concluded that roughly two-thirds of households in the world\u2019s wealthy countries saw their disposable income stagnate in the decade after the downturn, a sharp change from the decade before. The well-documented populist anger at elites, and the income inequality those elites represent, are often blamed for the backlash that has followed. But that is the kind of problem that working democracies are supposed to self-correct. Without question, Twitter, Facebook and the advent of mobile communications brought down dictators during the Arab Spring. It is hard to imagine the furious, seemingly spontaneous gatherings seen in Tahrir Square in Cairo and on the streets of Aleppo, Syria, without instant communications. Twitter, however, is better at starting a revolution than completing one. It can help organize a protest but not a government. That requires a set of skills that the street revolutionaries in Egypt, somewhat na\u00efvely, told Secretary of State Hillary Clinton they were uninterested in pursuing. It wasn\u2019t their job to create a new government, they told her on a visit to Egypt in the spring of 2011, not long after Mr. Mubarak was packed off to jail. She left dumbstruck, she told a reporter in her office shortly afterward.\u201cIf you don\u2019t organize, if you don\u2019t pick candidates, if you don\u2019t participate in the process, the Islamists are going to win,\u201d she recounted telling the protesters. They ignored her. Soon after the Islamists won the election, a countercoup put the generals back in charge, and now both the Muslim Brotherhood, which provided the first successor to Mr. Mubarak, and many of the protesters are locked up. Even in established democracies, the era of instant communications is having effects that few predicted. Mr. Trump has capitalized on those changes better than any politician in modern memory, brilliantly outmaneuvering 16 rivals who did not realize that the rules had changed.\u201cModern media enhances transparency, but that is a two-edged sword for democracy,\u201d said Joseph S. Nye Jr., the Harvard professor who wrote, most recently, \u201cIs the American Century Over?\u201d (He concluded that it has a lot of gas left.) \u201cMore people have information that allows them to participate, but leaders have less time and space for the deliberation and compromise that Madison believed were essential to effective democratic government.\u201d In fact, if there is a lesson of the past decade, it may be that information overload rarely translates into a political impetus to find middle ground. Mr. Trump\u2019s we\u2019ll-build-a-wall speech went viral, and people took sides. Instant video playback, and instant fact-checks, make it increasingly harder for politicians to gradually reverse positions without being called on it. While facts are available more readily than ever, they often seem to be afterthoughts. Witness the surge in Google searches in Britain about the meaning of leaving the European Union. The big surge happened the day after the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote, not before.What\u2019s clear is that Americans have to rethink the automatic assumption that the world secretly wants to replicate American-style, or even Western-style, democracies. Many do, but as Henry Kissinger noted lately, we fooled ourselves into thinking that our biggest challengers from the last century were now committed to integrating themselves into Western-designed, democratically-based institutions in this century. \u201cThe problem with the American view of Russia is that we have always thought of Russia as an incipient NATO country,\u201d Mr. Kissinger said last month at a forum in Kent, Conn. \u201cThat it would gradually slide into an orbit and accept a so-called rules-based system. But Russia has a different history and a different culture.\u201dSo do the Chinese and the Egyptians and the Turks. The leaders of those countries feel less pressure than they did a decade ago to open their societies. Democracy is hardly dead; for billions around the world, it remains a cherished dream. But the end of history, it turns out, looks more and more like another beginning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should You Intervene When a Parent Harshly Disciplines a Child in Public?", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA woman in a Walmart in Texas last week who took photos of a man pushing a shopping cart with his daughter\u2019s hair wrapped around its handle helped touch off a debate about when, or if, a bystander should intervene when a parent harshly disciplines a child in public.The woman, Erika Burch, was with her husband, Robert, in the store in Cleveland, Tex., about 45 miles north of Houston on Sept. 19 when they spotted the girl walking extremely close to the cart. Her head was leaning at an odd angle as the man dragged her alongside the cart by her hair, Ms. Burch said in an interview.Mr. Burch, 44, said the girl, who the police said was 5, was crying: \u201cPlease stop! I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d He added that she was \u201cjust begging the man to let her go.\u201dMs. Burch, 25, intervened.She said she spoke to the man three times to try to get him to stop, each time raising her voice. Ms. Burch said the man told her, \u201cI grew up just fine,\u201d and began cursing at her. She called 911, and a police officer who was in the store about a shoplifting case was there within minutes.\u201cWe do not condone the father\u2019s actions in this incident, but we must gather all the facts and evidence,\u201d he wrote, adding that the father let go of the girl\u2019s hair \u201cpretty quickly.\u201d\u201cThere have been forensic interviews conducted with county child advocacy group, and digging into the past behavior and history of the family (none found),\u201d the chief wrote.No charges have been filed, and the man was not identified by the police. The chief said that \u201cmany intervention plans\u201d were in place and that the child was \u201cdoing great,\u201d adding that the family has \u201ca very strong mother.\u201dBut Mr. Burch said the circumstances demanded action. \u201cThis is what is wrong with America today,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s too scared to get involved anymore.\u201dSo what should observers do in situations like this one? We asked the experts.\u201cIf you wait for something to get worse before doing anything, it definitely can get worse and then it becomes harder to connect and be of help,\u201d she said.The person intervening may feel alone but really is not, she said.\u201cIf someone is being abusive to a child in public, just imagine what happens behind closed doors,\u201d he said in an email.\u201cYou may feel guilty that you may be getting that parent in trouble, or that you may be making a mistake and misinterpreting the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, think about how inaction can lead to the injury, danger or death to the child. Now think about that guilt.\u201d\u2022 Other experts cautioned that involving the authorities right away might cause the situation to escalate. The parent might be frustrated or having a bad day and not necessarily be abusive.If you believe a child is \u201ctruly being hurt or assaulted, you do need to step in and do something about it,\u201d she said.In that case, be very firm with the parent, but if that person confronts you, alert a security guard or the police immediately. \u201cYou have to be safe yourself,\u201d Dr. McDavid said.Ms. Burch said the thought crossed her mind that the man in Walmart might have a gun. She said that she watched closely for any sudden movements, but that she would not relent.\u201cHe would have to shoot me right there,\u201d she said.\u201cWhile some might argue there\u2019s a moral or ethical responsibility, we do not as a society criminalize a failure to report a crime,\u201d he said in an email.Some states have \u201cgood Samaritan laws\u201d that protect those who intervene from civil claims if they acted in good faith.\u2022 Avoid being angry, stern or confrontational, Professor Otuyelu said.Be warm, friendly and concerned. Speak in an even and soft tone and ask politely if the person needs help. Gently but firmly point out that the child could get seriously hurt and that the person\u2019s behavior needs to stop immediately.\u2022 Collect yourself before you talk and withhold judgment, Ms. Simmons said.\u201cIt really starts with no one as a parent wants to be told we\u2019re doing something wrong or we\u2019re a bad parent,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a recipe for something to blow up in your face.\u201d\u2022 Professor Otuyelu suggested: \u201cHello, I don\u2019t mean to get into your business or tell you how to parent, but I noticed that\u201d and fill in the sentence with what you observed.\u2022 Mr. Baker recommended: \u201cI remember when my children were that age. They can be a handful. Do you need any help?\u201d\u2022 Dr. McDavid recalled a shrieking child and a screaming mother waiting to check out at a grocery store: \u201cI said to them \u2018Hey, are you O.K.?\u2019 I said to the child, \u2018Can you stand there quietly while we wait in line?\u2019 They both calmed right down.\u201d\u2022 Ms. Simmons said sometimes you have to act in the moment. She recalled an airplane passenger seated near a child who was crying and acting out. The passenger made a hand puppet out of an airsickness bag to distract the child and it worked, she said.\u201cIf you bring a genuine care and desire out of love and respect, people will get that,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

And that was enough to persuade Mr. Davis; he even volunteered to send a photo.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t embarrassed\u201d by the contents of the memos, Mr. Usher recalled.As a manager, Mr. Davis appeared to be concerned about the dress code (\u201cOn days you have to work, and you think you should be off, you wear slouchy dress attire,\u201d he complained), idle conversation (\u201cDo your jobs and keep your mouth shut!\u201d he once wrote, in all capital letters) and office furniture (\u201cI am paying you to work \u2014 not slouch in your chair with your feet up on a desk or table\u201d).Their marriage lasted until 1971, and according to \u201cPapa\u2019s Girl,\u201d a 2007 biography of Ms. Bonfils by Eva Hodges Watt, the couple were happier than some people had predicted. \u201cShe loved the fact that Mike had enough guts to behave outrageously,\u201d a family friend was quoted as saying.Mr. Davis\u2019s most recent moment in the business spotlight was in 2012, when the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corporation settled (for undisclosed terms) a lawsuit against him for fraud. It was reported that Mr. Davis had deceived Mr. Kerkorian into investing in Delta Petroleum Company, which soon failed, and that Mr. Davis had received a $5 million finder\u2019s fee in Delta stock for arranging the deal.Edward Michael Davis (everyone called him Mike) was born on March 1, 1931, although exactly where and to whom has been a matter of speculation. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that his birthplace was the Rosebud (Sioux) reservation in South Dakota, that he had served in the Army, and that both his parents and all six of his siblings had died.He was the longtime partner of Phyllis McGuire, the youngest of the McGuire Sisters, the midcentury pop-singing trio. Last month he talked to The Las Vegas Sun about helping her put her Las Vegas mansion, complete with an indoor Eiffel Tower replica, on the market.Posting on social media, old friends and colleagues agreed that Mr. Davis had been difficult to work for, but they found redeeming qualities. On Facebook, one consultant wrote, \u201cI remember the first time I was cussed out by him\u201d; a former employee saluted him as \u201ctruly one of a kind\u201d; and a colleague hailed him as \u201cone of the last of the great oil field wildcatters.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Is Said to Be Discussing a Possible Takeover", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwitter has long positioned itself as a global town square where anyone \u2014 celebrities, politicians, athletes, and you and me \u2014 can chat in 140-character messages and find out about whatever is happening in the moment.But with that premise not drawing enough new people to the social media service, Twitter is now rethinking whether it can survive as an independent company and is exploring several strategic options.Twitter, based in San Francisco, is talking with Salesforce.com, Google and others about a possible takeover of the company, people briefed on the discussions said on Friday. The talks are in the early stages, these people said, with no guarantee that a deal will be reached. In particular, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, is resistant to selling to some of the potential acquirers, they said.Twitter is also weighing a possible revamping that could involve divestitures and layoffs, the people said. Two divisions that Twitter is considering divesting itself of are Vine, the mobile six-second video service, and MoPub, a mobile advertising business, they said. The company is working with the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen & Company on its options.For two years, Twitter has been casting about for ways to attract new users and to become a social media destination on the order of Facebook. While people initially flocked to Twitter, its new-user growth has slowed sharply as people complained about how difficult it was to use the service. At the same time, Facebook and its suite of offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger continued to outpace Twitter in user growth and profitability, while five-year-old Snapchat has become the newest darling of the social media world.Lack of growth also began to erode advertiser demand, which had remained robust even as Twitter\u2019s overall number of users stagnated at around 313 million people. Advertisers aiming for big audiences tended to choose Facebook, while those looking for younger audiences have the option of Snapchat.Twitter has endured internal turmoil and a revolving door of executives and board members. Mr. Dorsey, a co-founder who became permanent chief executive of Twitter almost a year ago, has vowed to turn it around by making it easier to use and by emphasizing real-time elements that could make it more essential to people.But after several false starts, critics are skeptical that these efforts will work.On Friday, how interested Google or Salesforce might be in buying Twitter, along with the identities of other possible bidders, became something of a parlor guessing game in Silicon Valley. Google\u2019s name has surfaced in the past as a logical buyer because of the internet search company\u2019s size and digital portfolio. Media companies have also been considered possible suitors.Why Salesforce might be interested in Twitter was a head-scratcher to some people. Salesforce is an enterprise technology company that focuses on businesses and not individuals, as Twitter does.But Salesforce has publicly expressed interest in owning a social network, which the company believes can bolster its main business of selling software and services to business clients. Many companies use Twitter to handle customer service requests and complaints, for example.Compared with its social media and internet peers, Twitter is more susceptible to a takeover because it has only one class of stock. Companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, have multiple classes of shares, which gives their founders tight control over their companies and guarantee independence.Twitter has $3.6 billion in cash on hand and $1.6 billion of debt, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence. Microsoft paid a premium of nearly 50 percent for LinkedIn, although any sale of Twitter is unlikely to bring such a rich price.Leslie Picker and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edward Snowden Says Disclosures Bolstered Individual Privacy", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Edward J. Snowden, the former American intelligence contractor who leaked documents about surveillance programs, said on Friday that his disclosures had improved privacy for individuals in the United States, and he declared that \u201cbeing patriotic doesn\u2019t mean simply agreeing with your government.\u201dIn 2013, after The Guardian and The Washington Post published articles about widespread, secret National Security Agency surveillance and data collection programs, Mr. Snowden identified himself as the source of the information. He had fled to Hong Kong, with the aim of escaping to Latin America via Moscow, but his passport was annulled and he was left stranded in at a Moscow airport.\u201cI am legally prohibited from even speaking to the jury about my motivation, and this brings up the question of, \u2018Can there be a fair trial when you can\u2019t put forward a defense?\u2019 \u201d he said. One can speak to the judge during sentencing, he said, but not to the jury, and \u201cthat\u2019s not very democratic.\u201dMr. Snowden said he would consider serving a prison term as part of a plea bargain arranged before he leaves Russia.\u201cI would argue that being willing to disagree, particularly in a risky manner, is actually what we need more of today,\u201d he said, adding that he remained a patriot. \u201cWhen we have this incredible, often fact-free environment, where politicians can simply make a claim, and then it\u2019s reported, without actual critical analysis of what that means, what the effect would be \u2014 how do we actually steer democracy?\u201dMost people think of privacy in terms of their settings on Facebook, Mr. Snowden said. \u201cBut privacy is the fountainhead of all our rights, from which all rights are derived,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes you an individual.\u201dFreedom of speech, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have much room if you don\u2019t have the protected space.\u201dThe danger is there, he said, \u201cwhen everything you\u2019ve ever done, every purchase you\u2019ve ever made, everywhere you\u2019ve ever traveled with a cellphone in your pocket is suddenly available to third parties.\u201dAsked whether he had accomplished anything permanent with his revelations, he said: \u201cDo I think things are fixed? No. Can any single individual fix the world? No, that\u2019s too much. Have things improved?\u201dAnswering his own question, Mr. Snowden said, \u201cYes.\u201d There have been important changes in American and European laws, some internet companies are responding with full encryption and pushing back against government pressure, and people are more aware of the issue, he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s gotten a little better.\u201dBut the United States still distinguishes between its citizens and others when it comes to surveillance, because court approval is not necessary when American agencies want to monitor noncitizens outside the United States.Mr. Snowden said he was fully aware of Russia\u2019s anti-democratic traits, and he said he had spoken out against them \u2014 even though, as Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch who was also taking part in the Athens forum, noted, the Russian government is the only thing between Mr. Snowden and \u201ca jail cell.\u201dMr. Snowden denied engaging in self-censorship concerning Russia, adding that he did not think his opinions would have much influence in the country because he does not speak Russian very well.Asked what he did all day, marooned in Russia, Mr. Snowden joked, \u201cI speak in conferences in Athens mostly.\u201dBut then he added: \u201cI\u2019ve always been a sort of an indoor cat. My life has been the internet, and perhaps this is an explanation of why I was so moved by what I witnessed at the N.S.A.\u201d\u201cI am what I am,\u201d he said. \u201cI am never going to be the coolest guy on stage. But that\u2019s O.K., because that\u2019s not what I\u2019m going for.\u201d\u201cI think this is a worthy cause that makes me feel good about what I am doing, even if it doesn\u2019t get as much attention as the things I\u2019m sort of best known for,\u201d he said.Regarding the presidential election in the United States, Mr. Snowden said he would vote by absentee ballot but declined, \u201cas a privacy advocate,\u201d he said, with a rare touch of humor, to reveal his choice.Because of an editing error, an article on Sept. 17 about an assertion by Edward J. Snowden, the former American intelligence contractor, that his leaking of documents about surveillance programs had improved individual privacy in the United States referred incorrectly to the revocation of his passport in 2013. It was revoked while he was in Hong Kong, not after he had traveled to Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$100 Million Awarded in Contest to Rethink U.S. High Schools", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn organization announced on Wednesday that it had chosen the winners of $10 million grants in a competition to rethink the American high school.The organization \u2014 the XQ Institute, which is backed by Laurene Powell Jobs \u2014 is funding 10 schools, for a total of $100 million.One of the winners, the Somerville Steam Academy in Somerville, Mass., will operate without standard class periods and without separating students by age.Rise High in Los Angeles will be designed for students who are homeless or in foster care. It will share locations around the city with service providers, like medical or mental health centers, and will have a mobile classroom to teach or tutor students wherever they are.\u201cEach of these represent schools that don\u2019t exist today,\u201d said Russlynn H. Ali, chief executive of the XQ Institute and a former assistant secretary for civil rights at the federal Education Department.Ms. Ali said the organization received far more applications than it expected, so it decided to give more $10 million prizes.The winners are a mix of charter and district public schools, in small towns and large cities. Most of them are new, but some are existing schools that are being reimagined.\u201cThey are using time in very flexible ways,\u201d Ms. Ali said. \u201cThey are ensuring personalized learning using tech and time, embedded with rigor.

{"Headline": "Prince\u2019s Old Band Resurrects Him Through His Songs", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThursday night\u2019s show, the first of the brief run, offered the crowd of 1,500 the chance to experience Prince\u2019s music as performed by the musicians who helped define it: Wendy Melvoin (guitar); Lisa Coleman and Matt Fink (who\u2019s called Dr., on keyboards); Mr. Brown (bass); and Bobby Rivkin, known as Bobby Z (drums); as well as the bassist-guitarist Andr\u00e9 Cymone and the lead guitarist Dez Dickerson, who had played with Prince in the years before the Revolution.The group had previously reunited at First Avenue for a benefit for Mr. Rivkin after he had a heart attack in 2012, and according to Nathan Kranz, the club\u2019s general manager, Mr. Rivkin did most of the legwork in staging the current reunions. Mr. Dickerson said there was talk of getting back together at the Los Angeles memorial for Prince in May: \u201cThings were being sorted.\u201d The shows were finally booked in mid-June.\u201cLook at those smiling faces! That\u2019s what we want to see,\u201d Ms. Melvoin said from the stage on Thursday night, perhaps trying to nudge the mood toward celebration from something more somber, before the band surged into its opening song, \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201d She added, \u201cI expect to hear everyone singing.\u201dShe got her wish, on and off the stage. With no Prince anchoring the band, group vocals \u2014 harmonies, co-leads, trade-offs \u2014 were plentiful, and Ms. Melvoin stepped up front for rockers like \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d and \u201cRaspberry Beret.\u201d With Mr. Cymone and Mr. Dickerson joining the band, they recreated \u201c1999,\u201d alternating singers on each opening line. Mr. Cymone took lead on \u201cLittle Red Corvette,\u201d and a quick survey of the club showed that most everyone in it was singing along; ditto, later, for \u201cKiss,\u201d which the Revolution played in a way that was close to the original recording, unlike their boss, who had constantly changed the arrangement.A number of guests bolstered the show. The R&B singer Bilal was a welcome surprise, having not only aced the BET Awards\u2019 Prince tribute but also one at Carnegie Hall in 2013. At First Avenue, he proved a mellifluous falsetto for hire, especially on \u201cThe Beautiful Ones,\u201d whose climax he lifted with his nimble squall. Fans spied other familiar faces onstage: Susannah Melvoin (Wendy\u2019s sister, Prince\u2019s former girlfriend and the lead singer in the Family, a band he masterminded); Omar Baker, Prince\u2019s brother (resplendent in a white fedora and light-up shoes); the \u201cPurple Rain\u201d co-star Apollonia (who introduced the encore by tossing gold hoop earrings to the crowd, a motif in the movie); and Prince\u2019s ex-wife, Mayte Garcia.There were mementos available at the Revolution\u2019s merchandise table \u2014 four T-shirts, two hoodies \u2014 where a line of a dozen that had assembled by 7:13 p.m. had tripled by 7:20. (The club\u2019s doors had opened at 7.) But many in the audience were wearing two T-shirts that weren\u2019t for sale: designs featuring a list of the Revolution members\u2019 names or the contents of a lunchbox in \u201cStarfish & Coffee,\u201d a song on Prince\u2019s 1987 double album, \u201cSign o\u2019 the Times.\u201dMuch of Ms. Melvoin\u2019s stage patter revolved around the idea of the show\u2019s being not just in Prince\u2019s memory, but for his heavenly delectation. After a cheer following \u201cAmerica,\u201d she focused on the crowd. \u201cEverybody hear that?\u201d she asked. \u201cLet\u2019s help him hear this.\u201d When Ms. Melvoin and Ms. Coleman played \u201cSometimes It Snows in April\u201d as a duo, quiet and acoustic, Ms. Melvoin struggled to keep her composure; it was a clear highlight, particularly when she sang, \u201cAlways cry for love, never cry for pain,\u201d to some deeply felt shouts from the crowd.At the end of the night, one thing stood out \u2014 that the band didn\u2019t even try to copy Prince\u2019s singular guitar solos, in particular for \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d the inevitable show closer. The lack of flash for \u201cPurple Rain\u201d wasn\u2019t total (there were actual lighters in the air), but it nevertheless gave the song a rawer charge than usual. It was stark, yet fitting.

When doctors eased the sedation temporarily, Mr. Peres was responsive, squeezing Dr. Walden\u2019s hand at his direction.Doctors put Mr. Peres back to sleep to give his brain a chance to recover, and they will transfer him to the neurosurgical intensive care unit at Chaim Sheba Medical Center at Tel HaShomer, but they will allow the sedation to wear off again briefly on Wednesday afternoon to test his reactions.\u201cThis is a difficult time for the family, obviously, but Mr. Peres is not only a great leader but a great teacher of optimism,\u201d Dr. Walden said. \u201cWe are trying to adopt the optimism he taught us all those years.\u201dMr. Peres, one of the last living founders of the modern state of Israel, served in most senior major government positions and played a central role through much of the country\u2019s history as both warrior and peacemaker.The prime minister\u2019s office said in a separate statement that Mr. Netanyahu had spoken with the hospital director to check on Mr. Peres\u2019s condition.He shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr. Rabin and Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for the Oslo accords that were first signed in 1993. Mr. Peres became ill on the 23rd anniversary of the ceremony hosted by President Bill Clinton on the South Lawn of the White House.Mr. Peres later served as president of Israel, a more ceremonial post, from 2007 to 2014.Mr. Peres suffered a small heart attack this year and had a pacemaker implanted a week ago to deal with an irregular heart beat.Dr. Walden said Mr. Peres had given an hourlong speech on Tuesday but had complained afterward of \u201ca vague headache\u201d and was brought to the hospital.

{"Headline": "\u2018Human Glitter.\u2019 The Beckerman Twins Are Fashion Week Stars", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySam and Cailli Beckerman go through every waking moment as if they have just won the big prize on the fun wheel. They radiate optimism to an almost absurd degree. They dress bravely and outrageously.\u201cThey\u2019re two of the most authentically joyful human beings I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life,\u201d said Karen Robinovitz, the creative director and co-founder of Digital Brand Architects, an agency that represents them. \u201cI describe them as human glitter.\u201dFor the Beckermans, New York Fashion Week is a chance to see friends from the global fashion tribe and to reconnect with companies that pay them.Hanging out with them, however, you see that it\u2019s hard to determine where the marketing ends and real life begins, which, for the brands, is the point. As Sam put it, about a recent project: \u201cWe\u2019re Disney girls. We\u2019re obsessed.\u201dThey are also Chanel girls, H&M girls, Moschino girls, Coach girls, Refinery29 girls, Aldo girls and Kenzo girls. Does that leave anybody out?\u201cOh, yeah, we\u2019re Saks girls, too,\u201d Cailli said.What sets the Beckermans apart from other fashion bloggers, and what brands and designers love about them, is their over-the-top personal style. They often wear clashing, cartoonish, multilayered outfits that few others could pull off \u2014 say, Haruno Shibuya Army pants with blue faux-fur on the knees paired with Fenty x Puma sneakers and a Coach black leather vest.And there are two of them.\u201cI try to be like the Beckermans,\u201d Ms. Rocha said. \u201cI put on everything in the morning. And then I take it off. I\u2019m scared to be fun.\u201dThe Beckermans were once New York-based designers themselves. They lived in the city for 10 years. They graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology and had a short-lived clothing line, Beckerman, that showed in 2007 during fashion week.Creating and marketing a collection was stressful, they said. They much prefer attending other designers\u2019 shows, which combines all their favorite things: taking photographs, meeting people, seeing fresh fashion and dressing up.They arrived on Sept. 7 from Toronto, where they live together, schlepping five bags of checked luggage between them.\u201cNot the hard-shell kind, they don\u2019t expand enough,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThe stretchies.\u201dOn Thursday, after lunch with a friend and before a party hosted by the Gap and Refinery29, they rested briefly at the bar of the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown, where they were staying (they are not, for the record, Roosevelt girls).Though the observation commonly applies to identical twins, it\u2019s virtually impossible to tell Sam and Cailli apart. They both have long platinum blond hair parted in the middle and eyebrows dyed black. They both have the same full-throated laugh and voices like that of Melanie Griffith circa \u201cWorking Girl.\u201d They share email and social media accounts and sign off \u201cXo Sam and Cailli,\u201d so you can\u2019t ferret out distinctions online, either.In person, you\u2019re reduced to remembering that Cailli\u2019s face is ever-so-slightly rounder, and that Sam, by infinitesimal degrees, takes charge in social interactions. Knowing the awkwardness this induces in others, the women are fine with, and even encourage, treating them as one interchangeable unit.At the bar, Cailli wore Alexander Wang short shorts and thick-soled Chanel sandals that lit up, while Sam paired H&M leather shorts with her Chanel light-ups. Both wore on-brand Gap hashtag #DoYou T-shirts.They were excited for the whirlwind week ahead, but, then, every day is a whirlwind. In the last few months, working with various brands, they had traveled to the south of France (\u201cWe stayed in a villa\u201d), to a big mall in King of Prussia, Pa. (\u201cWe\u2019re mallrats\u201d), to Los Angeles (\u201cWe got to see our younger sister, Chloe\u201d), to Cuba and Vancouver, British Columbia, to Las Vegas for an electronic music festival (\u201cWe love dancing!\u201d) and to New York. Now they were back in the city before going to Toronto briefly and then Paris for more shows.\u201cI have to look through our Instagram to know what we did,\u201d Sam said jokingly, cracking herself and Cailli up.Soon their car and driver pulled up outside \u2014 provided for them, along with an accompanying hashtag to use, by Lexus. Crawling through traffic, they turned the S.U.V. into a mobile studio, snapping photos of their outfits and editing on their phones.\u201cThis is where we take the best selfies,\u201d Cailli said.Sam explained: \u201cThe lighting is great. You just have to make sure the seatbelt isn\u2019t showing too much.\u201dThe party was at a Gap pop-up shop in a raw storefront in TriBeCa. The Beckermans weren\u2019t required to do much more than show up, pick out some clothes from the racks and photograph themselves having fun wearing them.\u201cI saw their Chanel shoes and I was, like, please,\u201d Mr. Massel said. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to meet you guys for four years.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Massel appeared to be overheating in the Beckermans\u2019 presence. \u201cI\u2019m so sweaty,\u201d he said, whipping out his phone for a group selfie. \u201cI\u2019m so excited. I need to get a towel.\u201dTurning to a reporter, he said: \u201cNo one does fashion like them. You can\u2019t follow them for inspiration. You can\u2019t even try.\u201dIt takes work to look as stylishly kooky as the Beckermans. At the Gap party, under their outfits, they wore other outfits, Superman-style, so that they could quick-change for two more parties later that night.They also coordinated the entire week\u2019s looks in advance, as they do before every trip, dressing and photographing themselves at home so each outfit is cataloged on their iPhones.On Friday, amid another day of shows, appointments and parties, the Beckermans were fitted for the Jeremy Scott runway show. As friends and muses of the designer (\u201cWe\u2019re like his No. 1 hype girls,\u201d Cailli said), they would be sitting front row, wearing the kitschy, pop clothes Mr. Scott designs for his other label, Moschino, which seem tailor-made for them.At Moschino\u2019s Midtown headquarters, the sisters picked out complementary rather than matching outfits: rubber cowboy boots in pink and aqua and minidresses with a graphic image of animated characters, one Ren, the other Stimpy. \u201cWe try not to dress too twinny because we\u2019re already twinny,\u201d Sam said. (Or was it Cailli?)Katie Newman, a young publicist who helped the women select the outfits, said, \u201cI wish I could be your triplet.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re great girls,\u201d said Sam, who, like Cailli, is full of praise for nearly everyone and everything.Backstage after the show, the Beckermans gave Mr. Scott a congratulatory hug. The designer was asked what he loves about them.In a way, with their everyday outrageousness and unconditional love for clothes, the Beckermans resemble the fashion characters of a less commercial era. You got the sense that, even without the iPhones welded to fingers constantly typing out corporate-approved hashtags, Sam and Cailli would be doing the exact same thing they are doing now.Advertisement"}

The answer is almost universal: fear.Which brings us to Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and celebrated venture capital investor who had one of the first stakes in both Facebook and Airbnb.But Mr. Hoffman said he almost didn\u2019t make his political views \u2014 and the card game \u2014 so public because he worried, as did his family and friends (who originally counseled him against it), that he might become a target for Mr. Trump and his Twitter account \u2014 or worse.\u201cPeople are fearful that, especially in a circumstance where he might be in a position of extreme power as a potential presidential candidate, that that would be used in a retaliatory way, that would be used in vengeful way,\u201d Mr. Hoffman told me in an interview. \u201cEveryone gets worried about being attacked, and part of the logic and mechanics of bullies is that they cause people to be fearful that they\u2019ll be singled out and attacked.\u201dMr. Hoffman continued: \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing like on school grounds, when people won\u2019t go help the kid who is being bullied because they\u2019re worried that the bully will focus on them.\u201dMr. Hoffman articulated a view that is often whispered within the business community \u2014 among those who are voting against Mr. Trump \u2014 but rarely spoken aloud. I have talked to some of the top executives of the Fortune 500 companies in recent months, and I\u2019d be hard-pressed to name one who didn\u2019t at least roll his or her eyes when Mr. Trump\u2019s name was mentioned.Technology companies are afraid that Mr. Trump might criticize their approach to privacy, as he did with Apple. Wall Street banks worry he might seek to break them up. Health care companies are nervous that he might attack them over pricing. Multinationals are worried about trade. All of these are valid issues on the campaign trail \u2014 but with Mr. Trump, unlike other politicians, the criticism seems more personal and vitriolic.\u201cI\u2019ve had a whole bunch of those kinds of concerns from people around me,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cPeople who have legitimate concerns about, \u2018Would LinkedIn become a target for Trump\u2019s ire and attacks? Would he make Second Amendment jokes about your friends and family?\u2019\u201dChief executives like Howard Schultz of Starbucks, who has endorsed Hillary Clinton, have said positive things about the candidate they support \u2014 without going negative on the other candidate.However, only a handful of executives \u2014 mostly retired ones or entrepreneurs who work for themselves (think Mark Cuban, who has come out against Mr. Trump, or Kenneth Langone, who has castigated Mrs. Clinton) or those who seem to have been granted a special status (think Warren Buffett, a Trump foe) have been openly critical of either side.Mr. Hoffman said he had a theory for the silence.\u201cThere\u2019s two sets of things that cause people to be quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is there\u2019s a culture in America that business leadership is to be apolitical. It\u2019s like Michael Jordan\u2019s comment, \u2018Republicans buy Nikes too.\u2019\u201dAnother reason for reticence in the business community, Mr. Hoffman said: \u201cIt\u2019s fear for themselves, or fear they\u2019re attentive to bringing their communities into it.\u201d While these undercurrents are always there during big elections, they seem more pronounced than usual during this ferociously contentious cycle.\u201cI feel sympathetic to the folks, compassionate to the folks who fall silent in that fear,\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, who then proceeded to issue a call to arms. \u201cI think the only thing I would say is that precisely when you feel that fear, it\u2019s precisely the time where if you aspire to be a courageous leader, that fear is a signal to you that you should step forward.\u201dAfter all, if those who can afford to make their voices heard do not do so, who will?\u201cIf you are in a position of power and in a position of being able to make a difference and you are feeling fearful, think what everyone else is feeling,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.All these sentiments dovetail with the reactions Mr. Hoffman said he had received about his card game.\u201cI\u2019ve had a number of Republicans actually think it was terrifically funny,\u201d he said, explaining that he had asked some of them to provide promotional quotes about the game. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful maybe in the next week or two I might be able to persuade a couple of them, but thus far all of my requests to my friends for public quotes have been demurred \u2014 maybe out of fear of retaliation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No \u2018For Sale\u2019 Sign? Silicon Valley Buyers Aren\u2019t Deterred", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRedwood City JournalREDWOOD CITY, Calif. \u2014 Swell-looking home you\u2019ve got here. Ever think about selling it? How about to me, right now?That is increasingly the approach the house-hungry are using in Silicon Valley, where the number of homes on the market is so small that would-be buyers are driven to desperation. Their solution: seek out homes that are, in theory at least, not for sale.Sue Zweig grew up in this working-class community, back when people said it was for the newly wed and the nearly dead. Not long ago, when she was out walking her dog, she began to realize things were different. A woman pulled over, asked about houses for sale in the neighborhood and ended up spending 45 minutes poking around Ms. Zweig\u2019s living room and kitchen.Her four-bedroom house was not on the market then, and it was not on the market a year or so later when another eager buyer showed up. This time, Ms. Zweig, a nurse, and her husband, Steve Zweig, made a deal for $1.375 million, a seven-figure profit over what they had paid in 1987. They moved out of the house last year.Flushing out people before they are officially ready to sell \u2014 by a few weeks or a few years \u2014 has obvious benefits for buyers, but sellers say they can profit, too. It streamlines an expensive process that traditionally consumes many months.\u201cWe probably left money on the table,\u201d said Mr. Zweig, a retired digital printer. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t have to list it, didn\u2019t have to do open houses, didn\u2019t have to stage it.\u201dPeople of much more modest means are now echoing his tactics, even if they cannot extend his lavish terms.\u201cTechnology is making people impatient,\u201d said Steve Korn, a retired forklift facility manager who is now a real estate agent here. \u201cNo one wants a six-month slog anymore to get a new place or move on from an old place.\u201dTechnology is also fueling this boom in a more direct way. Tech companies, especially Facebook and Google, have plans to build new campuses and hire even more workers.That means even places like Redwood City, a longtime also-ran to neighbors like Atherton, Menlo Park and Palo Alto, are now hot. That\u2019s a windfall for longtime residents like the Zweigs, who moved to a coastal town 220 miles south and built a new house.Prices in their old Redwood City development have continued to soar, prompting some wishful dreams among those who remain.Michele and Mike Sweeney put a \u201cmake me move\u201d notice on their 2,060-square-foot house last year. That is a feature that the online real estate company Zillow offers to let owners solicit interest. Their demand was $1.9 million, significantly more than their house was worth.\u201cWe used to say around here, \u2018If it hits a million, we\u2019re all selling,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Sweeney, who works for a hospital. \u201cThat was not too long ago.\u201dThey were flooded with inquiries but did not make a deal. Now, according to Zillow, their house is rapidly approaching the price they wanted. \u201cI asked my son, \u2018Do you want to finish high school in Italy?\u2019\u201d Ms. Sweeney said.To entice people like the Sweeneys, who might sell under the right circumstances, some buyers and their agents are resorting to old-fashioned technologies: letters and phone calls.Colleen Foraker, a Sotheby\u2019s agent in Silicon Valley, prefers personal letters. \u201cIt acknowledges the formality and the importance of the request to a perfect stranger,\u201d she said.Her clients might have a particular neighborhood in mind, and perhaps a certain layout or yard size. Ms. Foraker sends letters to about 100 owners, describing her clients and exactly what they want. \u201cThey are looking for a spacious, newer, move-in-ready home that will accommodate energetic children, sports activities, hobbies and two large family dogs,\u201d one letter said.\u201cIn some parts of the country, you move into a house until your children are gone or you retire,\u201d Ms. Foraker said. \u201cPeople here look at their homes more as an investment. They think, \u2018If the right number comes along, I would think about what I would do next.\u2019\u201dEven in Silicon Valley, letter campaigns are still the exception rather than the rule. Ms. Foraker has done about eight in the last few years. Two succeeded. The more recent deal involved a $3 million house.\u201cThe odds are low, but this is not a community that likes to wait,\u201d said Michael Dreyfus, the owner of the Sotheby\u2019s office in Palo Alto.At least one real estate company thinks letters have an application far beyond Silicon Valley.\u201cWe decided low inventory is also a permanent condition in Denver, San Francisco, Austin, Boston, Seattle,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate company based in Seattle. With more wealth in those areas causing an influx of people, along with low interest rates, \u201cthere\u2019s no place for them all to live,\u201d he said.To shake inventory loose for its clients, Redfin will start this month to use letters to reach out to potential sellers in Denver. Local agents will work with buyers to craft targeted queries, just as Ms. Foraker does in Silicon Valley.Mr. Kelman, who says the goal is to approach 10,000 potential sellers, is frank about this being an experiment. Perhaps, as often happens during booms, the sellers might get an inflated sense of their property\u2019s worth.One Denver buyer\u2019s recent experience illustrated both the promise and the peril of these new solicitations. Charles Bogenberger, a software marketing manager, wanted to buy a condominium in the complex next to his office. His Redfin agent sent letters to the five people who owned units with four bedrooms, which was the floor plan Mr. Bogenberger wanted.Two responded. One said he would sell for $560,000 \u2014 far more than Mr. Bogenberger could pay. The other unit had been on the market but was now going to be rented. Those owners wanted $400,000. The deal will close this month.\u201cWithout the letters, I might still be a renter,\u201d Mr. Bogenberger said. And if the sellers, like their neighbors, had demanded too much? \u201cI might still be a renter.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trauma of Violent News on the Internet", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFuture TenseThe effect on audiences can be traumatic. Historically, traditional mass media has also shown graphic images and horrifying videos like terrorist attacks or the 1991 Rodney King beating while barraging audiences with related content. For some people, it may not matter through which medium they consume their news: A video is a video and an article an article, whether it\u2019s on a TV screen, laptop or newspaper.But there are several reasons to suspect that the emotional impact of such intimate social-media images or internet-derived news is different, and perhaps even longer-lasting in some cases, than that from old-media sources.Contact with violence through any media can lead to what is called vicarious traumatization \u2014 and may, for some people, be more upsetting than an unmediated experience.\u201cUnlike direct exposure to a collective trauma, which can end when the acute phase of the event is over, media exposure keeps the acute stressor active and alive in one\u2019s mind,\u201d the study concluded. \u201cIn so doing, repeated media exposure may contribute to the development of trauma-related disorders by prolonging or exacerbating acute trauma-related symptoms.\u201dThe main difference between traditional news and social media, Dr. Ramsden pointed out in her presentation, is that the latter \u201chas enabled violent stories and graphic images to be watched by the public in unedited horrific detail.\u201dAs younger generations eschew television and the print media, their only exposure to news may be on the internet, often through social media feeds. But whereas traditional news outlets are likely to issue a warning before broadcasting graphic images or decide to censor the most offensive content, such precautions are often ignored on the web, especially from individuals and less established outfits.Elsewhere on the internet, though, the unchecked invective that frequently accompanies disturbing content in the form of user comments can be offensive in its own right.\u201cI\u2019m traumatized by the violence that marginalized people suffer already,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through that. Posting videos is to shake people up, but I don\u2019t need it for evidence. I\u2019ve seen enough real-life violence.\u201d\u201cI was exercising a level of privilege others don\u2019t have access to,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a lived reality for people, and how dare I separate myself from it as if this doesn\u2019t affect me as well, as if it couldn\u2019t one day be me on that video.\u201dBut when he saw news breaking of Alton Sterling\u2019s shooting, he decided not to click on the video.\u201cI could not watch another lynching,\u201d he said.A key distinction between consuming news on the internet versus print or TV is the constant access and ability to sink into deep rabbit holes for the former, as the Boston Marathon study demonstrates.Even 24-hour cable news networks are no match for the near-infinite sprawl of the web, where countless sources, either with or without credentials, give obsessives a never-ending supply of material to sift through and modern technology supplies terabytes of raw firsthand data. If J.F.K. were assassinated today, we wouldn\u2019t be poring over a single, grainy Zapruder film; we\u2019d have scores of high-definition smartphone videos taken from all angles and thousands of eyewitness tweets.As for those rabbit holes, we have all been there after a traumatic public event: compulsively clicking through the internet for an additional journalistic report, one more personal account, yet another status update.\u201cThere\u2019s no shut-off valve on social media \u2014 it\u2019s endless,\u201d Mr. Torres said. \u201cIt can be incredibly overwhelming, and almost feel like a responsibility, like if you don\u2019t read every think piece, you\u2019re somehow a bad person and then you end up inflicting more hurt on yourself. You think, \u2018I should honor the victim.\u2019\u201dYou have the possibility to relive a traumatic video or news story on the internet \u201cover and over again, and you can fall deeper into that trauma,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThe people you follow on social media share similar interests, and are all sharing the same videos, and some are auto-play, you can\u2019t escape them. You have a higher level of exposure, and that can cause more despair and weariness.\u201dYet Mr. Smith also noted a heartening side to the social media outpouring that typically attends a tragic event.\u201cThere\u2019s community being built, sharing in that pain, sharing in that trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly for folks who don\u2019t live in large cities or in places that don\u2019t match their politics, who feel alienated, that\u2019s vital. They know there are other people out there that care as much as they do. It strengthens the resolve to keep talking about these issues.\u201dNevertheless, in Dr. Ramsden\u2019s study, extroverts and the \u201chypervigilant,\u201d those predisposed to compulsively following a news story, experienced higher levels of stress.\u201cIn a few weeks, the rest of us will go back to normal\u201d after a traumatic event, Dr. Ramsden said in an interview. \u201cThe hypervigilant people don\u2019t. They will continue to be very anxious and will consistently view\u201d distressing footage on the internet, especially YouTube.But the internet\u2019s unpredictability can cause problems even for those who maintain regular levels of vigilance. If you tune into a news program or read the hard news sections of a newspaper, you are presumably steeling yourself for potentially negative information.On social media, however, streams are relatively random in what they offer, as are links on sites that feed to media partners. (I have on more than one shameful occasion clicked on listicles that detail a varying number of celebrities who have killed people.) It\u2019s easy to shut off news from the traditional media: Simply don\u2019t turn on the TV to certain channels or open the newspaper. But there is no such filter on social media.Moreover, the juxtaposition between standard social media fare and violent imagery is profoundly jarring. If you log on to Facebook looking for cat videos and baby pictures but encounter a disturbing image, not only are you emotionally unprepared for it, but its placement within fluffy, upbeat content can be unsettling, as if bleakly reminding us that the same species that routinely produces adorable toddlers is also responsible for ISIS.Note that I previously mentioned that I clicked on those listicles about celebrities who have killed people. This may be the most subtle yet pernicious aspect of violent imagery or content on the internet: the viewer\u2019s complicity.While it\u2019s true that some agency is required to turn on and watch a TV, and more so to open up and read a print news publication, to a certain extent your free will as a consumer was limited with the traditional media of previous eras. News was presented to you at specific times \u2014 morning and evening, or weekly or monthly \u2014 and at restricted length, enough to fill a newspaper, magazine or 30-minute broadcast and no more. Most likely you stuck with whatever publications you subscribed to and news programs you normally watched and received their images in a relatively passive manner.On the internet, though, we actively follow intricate webs of links and often end up in lurid virtual precincts we have never previously visited. A front-page print newspaper photo of a dead civilian is unavoidable if you subscribe to that publication, and viewing it does not implicate you as somehow wanting to seek out an image of death.There is, too, the question of whether one wants to reward a news outlet that posts a disturbing video for cynical, revenue-generating reasons.\u201cThat\u2019s the paradox we\u2019re in now,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThe documentation I find to be necessary. But the motive of news sites is not completely altruistic. They\u2019re not posting it simply to help produce policy shifts. Everyone is competing for more and more clicks. But what other way are we going to spark this conversation?\u201dGraphic video, and all the additional trauma that comes with watching it, is the only tool, he said, that has produced any kind of results.\u201cOther things we\u2019ve tried haven\u2019t worked,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cJust telling people about these experiences hasn\u2019t worked. People don\u2019t believe it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buying a Mattress Online Was Easy. Now, About the Return.", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "Your MoneyWeb-based mattress retailers vow they\u2019ll take the product back if it flunks a comfy-sleep test. And they do, but it\u2019s not simple.Supported byHere is your mattress shopping bill of rights, 2016 edition:\u25a0 You are entitled to a multiple-night sleep test in your home.\u25a0 Returns should be free.\u25a0 Getting rid of the mattress should not require turning back flips and begging.Why bother? Let\u2019s begin with something that should have been obvious to mattress retailers decades ago but apparently was not: Buying bedding in a showroom is absurd. Most of us spend a quarter to a third of our lives on mattresses, and they are essential to our physical and mental health. So testing plastic-covered beds while fully clothed, under the florescent lights of a store with a commissioned salesclerk hovering over us, makes no sense whatsoever.Things are better now. All five of the companies I tested charged me nothing for the return. Only Saatva charges any shipping or delivery fee, and its $99 covered three guys showing up at my apartment with a plastic-wrapped mattress and carefully carrying it inside. The other four companies compress their mattresses and cram them into boxes for shipping, though Casper offers free courier delivery of the box in my neighborhood.I offer no recommendations on comfort. Mattresses are like shoes or bras or chairs in that different people with different bodies will have different needs.Saatva sent a crew to pick up its mattress, so there was no trouble there. (And it should have been hassle-free given that it snootily markets its product as a \u201cluxury purchase, unlike other online mattress sellers who stuff their beds in a box and leave it for you to handle.\u201d)Still, many things happened during the return process that I never could have predicted. It\u2019s not practical for individual consumers to recompress their beds, shove them in the original boxes and hand them back over to UPS or FedEx, though one early Tuft & Needle customer did manage to box up his mattress for return and stick the company with a $300 shipping bill.So the surprises began when Casper, Helix and Leesa dispatched the 1-800-Got-Junk truck to fetch my never-been-slept-on bedding. Under normal circumstances, the companies try to find a way to get returned mattresses to a needy person. Helix claims to have 3,000 donation partners in its database.But when it came to my mattresses, the local Salvation Army truck was booked until October, according to the customer service representatives at Tuft & Needle and Helix who tried to help me before calling in the junk haulers. Bedbug-fearing nonprofit groups and strict New York City regulations pose special challenges for the companies in my area, it turns out.Evan Cohen, the general manager of the 1-800-Got-Junk franchise that covers Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island, says that it manages to completely recycle 30 to 40 percent of the mattresses. The other mattresses go to transfer stations, where some parts of them may be recycled before the rest of the material ends up in a landfill.The potential environmental cost of returns is bad enough. But the companies must also pay 1-800-Got-Junk to haul the mattresses away. Mr. Cohen said that he would charge an individual $118 to haul away an old mattress. Mattress companies that hire the company to handle returned mattresses get a bulk discount.Still, those costs are high enough on mattresses that ranged from about $550 to about $950 for my full-size models to have the potential to cause serious problems for the companies. David Wolfe, chief executive of Leesa, said he was all for the unalienable right to an in-home trial. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to be helpful for the industry if people start to order multiple mattresses,\u201d he said.He urged consumers to thoroughly research any mattress purchase before starting an in-home trial. And you can\u2019t blame the guy for not wanting to end up like Zappos, where people frequently order piles of shoes with the intention of keeping just one or two pairs.All of the companies claim return rates below 10 percent. 1-800-Got-Junk reports having taken in about 9,000 mattresses this year on behalf of the various direct-selling mattress retailers it works with.In reality, the company could not find a charity partner near me. So it posed a challenge of sorts. I could find a worthy organization on my own and send Tuft & Needle an ad hoc receipt of sorts, with a signature from the recipient. Failing that, I could give the mattress to a friend or family member in need and provide similar proof. If that didn\u2019t work, I could post a note on Craigslist or Freecycle offering to give the mattress away. And if that wasn\u2019t possible, the junk truck was an option.Given that the other companies had already told me how hard it was to give a mattress away in New York City, I wasn\u2019t optimistic. But I posted a note on my personal Facebook page, and a friend I\u2019d made years ago and hadn\u2019t seen since popped up to tell me about a sex-trafficking victim her organization was helping. The client had just moved to a new apartment with her family and was sleeping on the floor. Could I help her? And sorry but no, the organization had no moving truck or anything like that.That was a heartwarming and unexpected ending to what was supposed to be a virtual shopping experience, but I need not have left my own apartment. Daehee Park, a co-founder of Tuft & Needle, said that if I had spoken up about the van rental bill and the time-consuming nature of the potential donation, the company might have hired a errand runner from Taskrabbit to handle it. \u201cWe try to do what we can,\u201d he said.Like Mr. Wolfe at Leesa, however, he does worry about people abusing their in-home testing privileges (though he declined The New York Times\u2019s offer to pay in full after all, as did the other companies). He and his competitors deserve enormous credit for trying to make free, in-home trials the price of admission for participating in the mattress industry, and all of us should demand the same deal from brick-and-mortar retailers.So now that the mattress start-ups have proved that they\u2019re serious about real-world sleep tests, please don\u2019t take undue advantage of them. \u201cYou can never prevent people from gaming a system,\u201d Mr. Park said.Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carolina Boy, 14, Held After Father Is Killed and 3 Are Shot at School", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 14-year-old boy in South Carolina killed his father at home, then went to a nearby elementary school and shot two boys and a teacher with a handgun on Wednesday, according to local authorities.The teenager, whose name was not released, was taken into custody around 2 p.m. at Townville Elementary School in Anderson County, about 100 miles northeast of Atlanta.One of the students was shot in the leg, one was shot in the foot and the teacher was shot in the shoulder, Capt. Garland Major of the Anderson County sheriff\u2019s office said.The student who was shot in the leg, Jacob Hall, was in critical condition on Wednesday night at the Greenville Health System Children\u2019s Hospital, according to the hospital. Ross Norton, a spokesman for AnMed Health Medical Center in Anderson, said the other student and the teacher were treated at the hospital and released two hours later.The father, identified as Jeffrey Osborne, 47, was found dead with a gunshot wound after a 911 call from family members, according to Greg Shore, the Anderson County coroner.The suspect\u2019s grandparents, who live nearby, got a phone call from their grandson, who was crying and upset, Mr. Shore said at a news conference on Wednesday night. They could not understand what he was saying and, concerned about what was wrong, went to his home and found their son \u2014 the gunman\u2019s father \u2014 had been shot, he said.The suspect drove about three miles to the school, though it was not clear where he got the vehicle.Sheriff John Skipper Jr. of Anderson County said the shootings happened outside the school, which has about 280 students.The teenager was caught without incident after the shootings by Jamie Brock, a 30-year volunteer firefighter, the department said. The remaining students were bused to Oak Dale Baptist Church, where they were reunited with their parents.The suspect\u2019s mother was at work and saw the news of the shootings on television, Mr. Shore said.The motive for the shootings was unclear and there was no known connection between the suspect and the school or the victims there, officials said. Captain Major said the teenager had been home-schooled.Joanne Avery, the superintendent of Anderson School District 4, said that the school did not have a full-time resource officer, but did have security cameras and an airlock entry system, and that employees had undergone active-shooter training.\u201cWe are heartbroken about this senseless act of violence, but we are so thankful for the quick response by law enforcement and school employees who prevented further injuries,\u201d she said.The police, notified of the shooting about 1:45 p.m., were at the school within seven minutes and caught the gunman \u201cwithin a matter of minutes,\u201d Dr. Avery said.School has been canceled for the rest of the week and counseling is available to students and staff members, she said.At one point, a group of armed police officers could be seen moving from one school entrance to another, and others could be seen on the school roof.Kimberly Poulin, a clerk for the County Council, said the school served a sparsely populated agricultural area.\u201cIt is very small,\u201d Ms. Poulin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small community.

But empty-nest syndrome has gained especial piquancy in a world in which parents and their college-bound offspring are in the habit of texting one another a few times a day, and in which accounts of shootings on campuses are repeated on social media with a frequency bordering on the abject.For many empty nesters, landing on the proper spot of the Umbilical Cord/Cold Arctic Gale continuum can be tricky.\u201cYou have got to leave your kids alone,\u201d Ms. Woodard said. \u201cThe only time you text is if you have something really slammin\u2019 to say. Something you know they\u2019re really into. Like, Duncan is a big golfer, so I\u2019ll text, \u2018Oh, no, Rory didn\u2019t!\u2019 That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.

One of my students told me, \u2018Another student came up to me and said, \u2018This old woman friended me on Facebook, I think it might be your mom or grandmother.\u2019 The \u2018old woman\u2019 was probably 45.\u201dIndeed, fences are usually built for a reason. Robert Lindquist, a freshman at the University of Connecticut who is majoring in digital media and design, has imposed a 48-hour-warning rule on visits from his family. \u201cIt started out as a joke,\u201d Mr. Lindquist said. \u201cI\u2019m going to school only an hour and a half away from my parents. It\u2019s not quite as inconvenient as I\u2019d intended.\u201dMr. Lindquist said: \u201cThe rule applies to any family member. We have a term, \u2018the Lindquist Confusion Factor,\u2019 because I have nine aunts and uncles. They\u2019re excellent people, but that many of them can be a little much if you\u2019re not prepared.\u201dAsked how his parents reacted to the demand, Mr. Lindquist said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall them being overjoyed.\u201dSome people view the concept of empty-nest syndrome itself as suspect. Shayla Rivera, a comedian, says in her stand-up act that she had to look up the term on the internet: \u201cWhite women get sad when the children leave the house. What?\u201dAsked about the routine, Ms. Rivera, who has a 31-year-old son and a 28-year-old daughter, emailed from Kosovo, where she was performing for American troops, \u201cAs I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, some of the North American vicissitudes were not part of my paradigm. They say that women actually go into their kids\u2019 room and smell their clothing! Are you kidding me? I spent 18 years shutting my son\u2019s door so the smell of dirty socks and other mysterious aromas wouldn\u2019t come into the house. When he left I had to go in there with sage, holy water and a priest.\u201dAll joking aside, Ms. Woodard said that working-class parents may feel a child\u2019s absence even more acutely. \u201cTheir house or apartment is smaller, so the kid\u2019s presence is missed more,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, working-class parents probably raised that kid on their own.\u201dRegardless of the factors when a household is decanted of its young people, it\u2019s clear that kids who leave their home need a lot of room to grow in, and that parents need to hone their listening skills.Once, when Ms. Coburn asked a Washington University student to give advice to a group of the school\u2019s parents, the young woman offered: \u201cSometimes we want your advice and sometimes we don\u2019t. The challenge is, we won\u2019t tell you which time is which.\u201d\u201cMost of them don\u2019t complain about their parents being in touch too much,\u201d Ms. Keneally said of her clients in their 20s. \u201cBut a lot of them talk to me about stuff that they wouldn\u2019t talk to their parents about: relationship problems, or things they\u2019re contemplating doing or not doing. Parents would jump in too quickly, or would be embarrassed about what the kid is proposing.\u201dIndeed, the greatest lesson for many empty nesters may be learning to be their child\u2019s coach or inspiration rather than a child\u2019s concierge or critic.In 2014, when students at Keene State College in New Hampshire injected a local event called the Pumpkin Festival with fire-starting and car-flipping, the president of the college chastised her students for failing to \u201cpumpkin responsibly.\u201d It seems only natural that a parent, on hauling the last box of his child\u2019s shinguards and Harry Potter effluvia into the unsupervised blankness of a dorm room, may fear the advent of pumpkin irresponsibility.In the end, empathy and patience are an empty nester\u2019s Xanax. I asked Ms. Woodard what she would say to her parents today about keeping in touch if she were a young person going off to college.Ms. Woodard didn\u2019t miss a beat: \u201cI would say, \u2018I\u2019ll hit you up.\u2019\u201dHenry Alford is the author of \u201cWould It Kill You to Stop Doing That?

{"Headline": "Oregon Refuge Occupiers Were Protesting, Lawyer Says", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The armed demonstrators who took over a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon this year were attempting to reclaim land that they believed was improperly seized by the federal government, a lawyer for one of the group\u2019s leaders told a packed courtroom on Tuesday.Marcus Mumford, the lawyer for Ammon Bundy, one of seven defendants on trial here on federal conspiracy and weapons charges, said in an opening statement that the group was trying to draw attention to the government\u2019s mismanagement of public lands, and to protest the treatment by federal agencies of ranching families in Oregon.\u201cMr. Bundy complied with the law \u2014 the government did not,\u201d Mr. Mumford told the 12-member jury. \u201cThe federal government didn\u2019t have the right to own\u201d the 187,000-acre refuge, established in 1908 as a land preserve by President Theodore Roosevelt.Ryan Bundy, who is acting as his own lawyer in the case, told the jury that for his part, he never sought to harm anyone, but felt a responsibility, derived from the principles of the Declaration of Independence \u2014 from which he quoted at length \u2014 to stand up to tyranny. \u201cWe had no intention to do evil, and the evidence will show this,\u201d he said.But federal prosecutors, in their opening presentation to the panel earlier on Tuesday, said the armed group had posed a threat of violence from the first day, when it cleared the refuge \u201cat gunpoint,\u201d until the final hours of the occupation, when the last holdouts told law enforcement officials that they were prepared to die.The occupiers\u2019 words and actions were never peaceful, Geoffrey A. Barrow, an assistant United States attorney, told the court. They trained in weapons and hand-to-hand combat while living at the refuge, Mr. Barrow said. They used earth movers to build defensive barricades.\u201cThey wanted the world to know that they had taken it from the federal government,\u201d he said.In all, 26 people were indicted on felony conspiracy, weapons and theft charges \u2014 with the government contending that the occupiers conspired to impede federal employees at the refuge from performing their duties by using force, intimidation or threats, and that they stole government property and took weapons into a federal property.The trial of the Bundys and five followers is the first of two expected trials stemming from the refuge seizure, and on Tuesday, the lawyers and defendants \u2014 three of whom are representing themselves \u2014 outlined the stories they said the evidence would show.Federal prosecutors intend to present physical evidence that suggests a threat far beyond mere words. On Tuesday, they filed a list of potential exhibits that included dozens of pistols and rifles recovered from the refuge site and thousands of rounds of ammunition.Other evidence listed by the prosecution was created by the defendants themselves, including videos and photos taken of one another on their cellphones, posts on Facebook and recordings of the almost daily statements that members of the occupation group made to reporters and television cameras at the refuge.Defense lawyers have said that the occupiers were legally exercising free speech rights, and that openly carrying a weapon in Oregon is also legal.Judge Anna J. Brown of United States District Court for the District of Oregon said in her jury instructions that disagreeing with the opinions of the defendants was not enough to support a guilty verdict.\u201cDefendants\u2019 political beliefs are not on trial,\u201d she said. \u201cDefendants cannot be convicted based on unpopular beliefs.\u201dWhether unpopular or not, what the defendants believed \u2014 and what they said about those beliefs at the time \u2014 will define much of the case. And at least one defense strategy so far is to suggest that maybe, at least in the case of David Fry, who was the last occupier to surrender and leave the refuge, those beliefs might not always have made sense.Mr. Fry\u2019s lawyer, Per C. Olson, said in his opening statement that Mr. Fry, 28, was not a leader of the group, or even really much of a participant, and had left his guns at home in Ohio before driving out to join the occupation in early January.\u201cHe was a little bit of an oddball, if you will,\u201d Mr. Olson said, with patterns of thought that were \u201cnot typical and not always rational.\u201dBut then, after Mr. Finicum\u2019s death, Mr. Olson said, Mr. Fry changed. Fearing a police raid on the compound, he began carrying a shotgun, and said in front a camera, \u201cI\u2019m prepared to make a stand \u2014 I\u2019m prepared to die,\u201d Mr. Olson said.Mr. Olson said jurors would see in that arc of psychology a man who had not committed a crime of trying to intimidate or impede anyone. \u201cIt was all in defense,\u201d Mr. Olson said.The trial is expected to last about two months.videoAdvertisement"}

A constitutional court must certify the vote for it to become official.Supporters of Mr. Ping, a former chairman of the African Union, who received 48.2 percent of the vote, declared the results fraudulent and demanded a recount. Gabon\u2019s capital, Libreville, was bracing for violence as election observers pleaded for peace.On Wednesday evening, a spokeswoman for the Communication Ministry said protesters had gathered in the streets in large numbers and set fire to a Parliament building. The military was dispatched to control the crowds and fired canisters of tear gas into the area.Early Thursday, Mr. Ping said that the presidential guard had attacked his party\u2019s headquarters, killing two people and wounding many others, according to Reuters.With re-election to the Central African country, Mr. Bongo will continue his family\u2019s reign over the presidency, which dates to the 1960s. His father, Omar Bongo, served as president for nearly 42 years before his death in 2009. That same year, his son, was voted into office in an election that led to violence after the results were announced.Critics accused Omar Bongo of enriching himself and his family with proceeds from the nation\u2019s oil and mineral resources while much of the population outside the government circle suffered. Mr. Ping has painted himself as an outsider, but for years he served in Omar Bongo\u2019s cabinet until breaking from the party recently.In his first term, Ali Bongo Ondimba, an avid conservationist, lured foreign investors and put into place industrial and agricultural programs to decrease unemployment and help remedy the Gabon\u2019s income gap. But those programs are in the early stage, and results have yet to reach most people, leaving many convinced he is no different from his father.Advertisement"}

So after a Norwegian author posted images about the terror of war with the photo to Facebook, the company removed it.The move triggered a backlash over how Facebook was censoring images. When a Norwegian newspaper, Aftenposten, cried foul over the takedown of the picture, thousands of people globally responded on Friday with an act of virtual civil disobedience by posting the image of Ms. Phuc on their Facebook pages and, in some cases, daring the company to act. Hours after the pushback, Facebook reinstated the photo across its site.\u201cAn image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our community standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography,\u201d Facebook said in a statement on Friday. \u201cIn this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time.\u201d\u201cMark Zuckerberg can resist the definition all he wants, claiming Facebook is a white hot tech company, not a media company,\u201d said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. \u201cBut it is now possible for a company to be both.\u201d\u201cMark Zuckerberg is the most powerful editor in chief in the world,\u201d Mr. Hansen, whose newspaper has a print circulation of 200,000, said in an interview on Friday. \u201cTomorrow, there will be another photo.

Nick Ut, the photographer who took the iconic image for The Associated Press, was traveling; the news agency said it was \u201cproud of the photo.\u201d\u201cWe are always looking to improve our policies to make sure they both promote free expression and keep our community safe, and we will be engaging with publishers and other members of our global community on these important questions going forward,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said.The commotion over the photo of Ms. Phuc, also known as the Napalm Girl picture, began when Tom Egeland, a Norwegian author, wrote a Facebook post in August that included seven photographs about the history of warfare. One of those was the image of Ms. Phuc, which was then removed by Facebook, citing its standards policy.Facebook uses a combination of algorithms and human moderators to review photos that can potentially break its rules. In this case, the photo was tagged for removal by one of Facebook\u2019s algorithms, which was then followed up by a human editor, according to a person at the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly.Mr. Hansen of Aftenposten, taking a stand on behalf of Mr. Egeland, asked his journalists to report on the author\u2019s case this week and also posted the Vietnam War photo on the newspaper\u2019s own Facebook page. Mr. Hansen said he received an email on Wednesday from the social network requesting that the image be taken down. Before he could respond, he said Facebook removed the newspaper\u2019s post without asking permission.On Friday, Norway\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, and cabinet ministers also posted the Vietnam War photo on their Facebook pages in a show of solidarity. \u201cFacebook gets it wrong when they censor such images,\u201d Ms. Solberg wrote in her post.Mr. Egeland, the Norwegian author whose Facebook post kicked off the global protest, said the company\u2019s reversal underlined how people can come together to force a tech giant to change its ways \u2014 even though he could still not post on his own Facebook page until his three-day exile expired.\u201cI hope that Facebook realized that this was a mistake,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI would love to go online right now and publish, \u2018We won!\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Saudi Arabia during the hajj, it\u2019s where you pay for your animal sacrifice.It costs 460 riyals, or about $120, to have a sheep slaughtered. The sacrifice, known as the hadi, is incumbent on all pilgrims, who must donate at least two-thirds of the meat to the poor.Modern pilgrims usually have a slaughterhouse near Mecca do this for them, via the local post office.How do you know your animal was sacrificed? By text message, of course.Outside Saudi Post in Mina, the sprawling tent city where pilgrims live for part of the hajj, Marwan Nabil, 22, who is from Yemen, began to worry when he had not received his confirmation.\u201cThe system is down, but don\u2019t worry, it will be done in an hour,\u201d said Faisal al-Harbi, a postal worker.It was all so neat and tidy.Not so in a humid, sweaty slaughterhouse on the edge of Mecca: Men in stained robes hauled flailing sheep into the building. One man dragged his prey by its leg, and another carried one of the animals on his back.Butchers in red T-shirts hacked with curved blades at skinned sheep hanging on hooks. Cleaners in yellow T-shirts dumped sheep guts into drains under the killing floor.Nearby, men in muddy clothes sat on a dirty red carpet, watching animals being chopped up. Outside the slaughterhouse, a Pakistani woman shook an empty plastic bag. \u201cMeat?\u201d she asked, hoping charitable locals would oblige.For pilgrims who are not strong enough to endure the long trek of the hajj, there are men with wheelchairs for hire who will push them from site to site, ritual to ritual.But it\u2019s not cheap. One wheelchair pusher told me he charged older clients 200 riyals, or about $53, for a day.I asked him how he set his price, and if he charged by weight.On the third day of the hajj, pilgrims throw rocks at three stone pillars near Jamarat Bridge in a re-enactment of Ibrahim (or Abraham) stoning the devil as he tries to follow God\u2019s commandment.Security officials this year are trying to limit the number of pilgrims who can go to Jamarat at any given time. To avoid dangerous backups, officials have instituted one-way pedestrian roads for pilgrims from the tent city of Mina to the Jamarat building. And directions flash in English and Arabic to keep people moving.I collected 49 small rocks in an empty water bottle for the ritual, and some more experienced pilgrims showed me how to carefully but purposefully throw my stones. Tip: Nobody likes a lefty. After throwing my first batch of stones with my left hand, I was politely corrected. I joked that any devil could duck my right-handed throw.How would people from stunningly different places, like Inner Mongolia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and New Jersey, interact? Who gets to kiss the rock lodged inside the Kaaba, the black cube that pilgrims circle seven times? What would I pray for on the second day atop Mount Arafat, a time and place in which our tradition tells us God answers petitions? Where do two million people poop?I\u2019m still working on my list (scroll down for video and snapshots), but I took some time to answer questions that readers submitted on nytimes.com.What is inside the Kaaba? Has it been rebuilt over the centuries? Do men and women walk around the Kaaba at the same time?\u2014 Swaroop Conjeevaram, North Royalton, OhioAre women and men allowed to circle the Kaaba together, or are the genders segregated?The Kaaba is renovated from time to time, but sparingly so, out of respect for the structure\u2019s importance to Islam.Men and women do walk around the Kaaba at the same time. In that way, it\u2019s a unique holy site in Islam where the sexes mix and undertake their rites together.What is the connection between the Kaaba and Allah?\u2014 Daan Bijdevaate, the NetherlandsMuslims believe that the prophet Ibrahim \u2014 the biblical Abraham \u2014 built the Kaaba to worship the one true God. Some think it sits on the site where Adam, the first human, had his own prayer space. In all cases, Muslims see it as the oldest house of worship for the one God; it is also called Beit Allah, House of God. The pilgrim, in turn, is a \u201cguest of the House of God.\u201dAre non-Muslims allowed to watch the hajj, such as tourists or visitors? \u2014 Sarah C., Santiago, ChileWhy are non-Muslims not allowed in Mecca?\u2014 Fabian Babich, Sydney, AustraliaAre Christians welcome to observe the rituals?\u2014 Erin Bunting, Aliquippa, Pa.Only on the live television broadcasts.

The Saudi government already limits the number of people allowed into Mecca during hajj to about two million; many countries have a lottery system to select pilgrims. I met a Palestinian man who had applied for seven years and, at 72, had worried that he might die before seeing the holy sites.How is it going with the bathroom situation?\u2014 Lynn Bender, Davis, Calif.I think the Saudis have gone to some effort to try to make bathrooms as available as possible. Nobody has peed in front of me, as happened to members of my family when they came here. But we are on the move so much that sometimes I have to hold it in for hours. Luckily, we\u2019re not eating much heavy food.

I have not seen many medic stations, but I have seen ambulances and hospitals. Also, pilgrims are constantly spraying one another with water to avoid overheating, and many places have structures that emit a fine mist to cool you down.Do people stay with the people they came with (or stay alone), or do they also connect with strangers and make new friends?\u2014 Ani Grosser, Lenox, Mass.Well, my mum was hoping I\u2019d find a husband here! Usually pilgrims come in delegations and stay with them in the same hotels, travel on the same buses and share the same meals.

She\u2019s always smiling and she\u2019s my favorite.Do young men and women try to make friends?\u2014 Mo Kareem, HoustonI don\u2019t see much mixing, and it\u2019s hard to see where it could happen, except perhaps while circulating the Kaaba. Men and women mostly pray separately, and they sleep in separate quarters. It\u2019s also forbidden for even married people to have sex during hajj, so I\u2019m guessing that any premarital mixing, which Islam already sees as sinful, would be considered doubly bad!I saw an ad for the hajj at a tour company and one package had animal sacrifice as an option. What is the deal with this?\u2014 Beth Harrison, Millburn, N.J.I wish I had that option! One requirement of the hajj is for each pilgrim to ritually slaughter an animal \u2014 sheep, cow, camel or goat \u2014 at the end. If your hajj package does not have a sacrifice option, which means the tour company does it on your behalf, you can also buy a coupon here in Mecca for a slaughterhouse to take care of it. Pilgrims who do it soon enough receive a confirmation by text message that their chosen animal has been slaughtered, and the government undertakes to distribute the meat to the poor around the world.I am interested to know your (inner) feelings about bikini and burkini before and after the hajj.\u2014 Mohammed Basith, New YorkIs there an off-season where one can do the full hajj but with fewer teeming multitudes?\u2014 Steven Adkins, Aucamville, FranceNice idea, but the full hajj can begin only on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar. The good news is that it\u2019s a lunar calendar, so sometimes hajj is in the winter, a lovely time to visit this desert plain.If you really can\u2019t handle crowds, there is always umrah, a kind of mini-pilgrimage Muslims can do anytime. You mainly circle the Kaaba and walk between the hills of Safa and Marwa, which are now enclosed within the sprawling (and air-conditioned) Grand Mosque.I get nervous and tetchy in crowds, but so far I\u2019ve done O.K. The fear melts away, and at some point you stop caring about the sweat and viruses everybody is sharing.The pilgrims\u2019 chants of \u201cHere I am, O Lord\u201d were barely audible over the crunch-crunch of plastic water bottles squashed underfoot as we jostled toward Mount Arafat on Sunday, the greatest day of the annual hajj. Muslims believe it is when God will answer all sincere prayers offered there.As the sun blazed, men and boys splashed the crowds gleefully with the last ounces from their bottles. Some ducked their heads under gushes from a supply tower, and a few kind souls offered to turn their spray bottles onto strangers\u2019 faces.At first I was disappointed to see the mess of bottles and mud, a cleaning man in bright yellow and green looking on helplessly: I had thought Arafat would be austere and clean. But the pilgrims\u2019 cheery mood brightened my own.Of course it was dirty. Two million people were walking together on a hot day to a rocky hill and sucking down bottles of water. Of course the cleaner couldn\u2019t sweep it up \u2014 yet; he could cause a deadly crush if he got in the way of that river of pilgrims. So I, too, crunched the bottles, tried not to slip, let people spray me with water. I even prayed.At the end of the hajj, men are required to shave their heads, and women to cut a lock of hair. At the busy barber complex near the Grand Mosque, they\u2019ll buzz you with a razor (disposable) or scissors for $4; a machine cut is $2.70. Signs around the mosque warn pilgrims not to cut hair inside the complex \u2014 it turns out some people like to D.I.Y. at Islam\u2019s holiest site.I mean no disrespect when I say Mecca is, well, a mecca for shopping. People have come here to pray, but even five times daily leaves time for the glittering gold shops that line Ajyad Street.This year\u2019s big sellers: lightweight rings and white, rose and yellow bracelets so finely spun that they feel like cotton candy on the wrist. Traders, as they do, lament that last year was better \u2014 instability throughout the Middle East has left fewer buyers for the higher-priced bling.For those with lighter wallets, children hawk velvet prayer rugs decorated with images of the Kaaba for $2.60. People sell flip-flops for the inevitable pilgrim who has lost her shoes somewhere around the Grand Mosque, calling out the prices in Urdu: \u201cPanj! Panj! Panj!\u201d Five! Five! Five! The pharmacy on Ajyad Street is constantly packed, doing a roaring trade in antibiotics \u2014 hajj flu again \u2014 and anti-diarrhea pills.Sitting next to a group of Saudi women who resembled large black crows in their billowing robes, double face veils and gloves, I noticed they all wore little rings that looked like miniature pedometers. When I asked how many miles one woman had walked that day, she laughed.It turned out the rings were electronic prayer counters. Muslims often keep track of individual prayers like \u201cI seek God\u2019s forgiveness,\u201d believing that they earn credit for a good deed, or hasana, with each supplication. Prayers uttered at the Grand Mosque are said to be worth 100,000 times those said elsewhere.One of the women, Hanan, showed me her counter: 266, and it was only noon. Then she thrust the device into my hands and told me to \u201ckeep it, so you can always count your prayers.\u201d I politely declined.The big and the small. For Syria. For refugees to find homes and acceptance. That children would go to sleep with full stomachs and mothers able to love and care for them. I prayed for my friend\u2019s mother who has cancer, and tried to remember all the other friends, most of them secular, who shyly asked me to sneak in a word for them.Right before we had to leave Arafat, I remembered Mum making me promise to pray for a husband, and so I did.On the second day of the hajj \u2014 this year, Sunday, Sept. 11 \u2014 pilgrims will clamber onto Mount Arafat to ask for God\u2019s forgiveness and make specific requests by prayer. Muslims believe that a supplication at that place at that time will be answered.Along with Mum\u2019s list, I\u2019ll be praying for the health of a friend\u2019s mother who is fighting cancer, and the continued happiness and health of my family and friends. A few friends who are secular Muslims like me asked that I throw in a word for them, and I will. God, if you are listening, peace would be really nice. I\u2019m not so sure about the husband.I have been asking all the people I meet in Mecca what they\u2019ll be praying for on Mount Arafat:\u25a0 Mervat, a 30-year-old cardiologist from Yemen, said she would ask \u201cto go to paradise with my parents\u201d and that her war-torn country might find peace.\u25a0 Sayida Bakri, 68, seeks for terrorism to be defeated and \u201cfor Egypt to stand on its feet\u201d after years of instability.\u25a0 Abd Aziz Hj Johari \u2014 who is 18 and from Brunei, and who wore a T-shirt proclaiming, \u201cI Love the Prophet\u201d \u2014 shrugged at my question. His mother, Siti Hayun Hj Abdul Qadi, patted him affectionately and said she would ask that her son \u201cbecome a good boy in the future, a good husband, especially, a good son.\u201dWhen I was a little girl and we traveled from Australia to Egypt to visit my mum\u2019s family, I remember the enchanting women with large baskets perched on their heads, walking casually down crowded market streets, their empty arms swaying freely. I see some Palestinian women doing the same thing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where I work as a correspondent in The Times\u2019s Jerusalem bureau.A good idea knows no borders.The hajj is hot and grueling, and pilgrims flock to the Aesra ice cream shop near the Grand Mosque, where there are separate lines for men and women. \u201cAfter worship, there\u2019s a treat,\u201d said Arar Hafsi, 51, an Algerian pilgrim, giggling.I met one young woman in a niqab, her face and body covered in heavy black cloth, clutching a plastic cup filled with swirls of mango and strawberry. She said, laughing, that maybe she had one after every prayer \u2014 that\u2019s five times a day.\u201cIs it good?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s all there is.\u201dI know you want to know, so: A woman wearing a niqab eats ice cream by filling the spoon, then raising her veil just a bit and sticking the spoon in her mouth.Qasim, 16, a worker I interviewed at the shop, gave free cups to me and Abdul-Rahman, the Saudi minder who follows me everywhere under the government\u2019s rules for journalists covering the hajj. The ice cream tasted good. Also: It\u2019s all there is.As the call to prayer sounded, I stood in a line of women on the street leading to the Grand Mosque and realized I would have no clean place to put my head during the full prostrations we make in a symbolic act of submission to God. I figured, never mind, this is the hajj, once in a lifetime. Then the woman standing next to me said, \u201cI\u2019ve made space for you.\u201d We had to pray very close together, our heads were touching on that tiny mat.Afterward, I thanked her. Her name is Samira, and she is a professor in Algeria. She kissed me on the cheek and said that was the way a Muslim should behave, and that I was her sister.One of the main hajj rituals is to walk seven times around the Kaaba, Islam\u2019s holiest site. My brother and sister, who did the hajj years ago, had told me about the pigeons that circle, seemingly in sync with the pilgrims, overhead. A sign from God? Perhaps, but helped along by the women selling bird feed to people who flung it joyously into the air around the Grand Mosque.A group of Nigerian teenagers stood in a corner, calling out \u201cZamzam, Zamzam, Zamzam!\u201d and passing out plastic cups of water. Zamzam is a well located within the Haram, the mosque that surrounds the Kaaba, Islam\u2019s holiest site. Muslims believe God made it bubble up as the second wife of Ibrahim (Abraham in the Judeo-Christian bible), tried to soothe her thirsting child. A half-liter bottle sells for $4.95 on the internet.I was spooked after reading an article saying Zamzam water had high levels of arsenic. But in the heat and exhaustion of the hajj, it tasted refreshing. I even stopped in front of an Egyptian man spraying people\u2019s faces with the water as a small good deed \u2014 he said he did the same during the 2011 uprisings in Cairo. But I was worried when I saw pilgrims returning their empty cups to the Nigerians \u2014 this is how hajj flu spreads!A Chinese woman showed me her Mandarin Quran. I saw women from Uzbekistan who had their national flag sewn onto their head scarves, and men with \u201cKurdistan\u201d emblazoned on their jackets. There were Pakistanis with beards dyed a cartoonish red, and one guy, who knows from where, in a gold sequined hat. He looked fabulous.It reminded me of the little mosque of my childhood in multicultural Canberra, Australia. I grew up thinking it was normal to worship next to Muslims from Bosnia and Vietnam, Afghanistan and Jordan.Walking around the Kaaba was like Canberra, writ large. There was something very incredible and lovely about being a tiny little human among tens of thousands of other humans, saying the same prayers and doing the same rituals.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the reporter\u2019s handedness. She joked that any devil could duck her right-handed throw, not her left-handed one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, the Unsinkable Candidate", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbroad in AmericaThis American presidential election is a dizzying wonder: a torrent of outrages, gaffes and prime-time dramas, where one story blurs into the next, most of it driven by the Republican contender, Donald J. Trump.With such a ferocious pace it\u2019s easy to lose sight of the details, especially when it comes to Mr. Trump. So here\u2019s a quick summary of what voters have learned in recent weeks.In a conventional race, any of these revelations, slanders or gaffes might be enough to torpedo a candidate. Not Mr. Trump.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Achilles heel is well known: A majority of Americans neither like nor trust her. If Mr. Trump is Teflon, Mrs. Clinton must be Velcro: Every transgression, real or perceived, from her decades-long career in politics stubbornly sticks to her.When it comes to Mr. Trump, though, his enduring popularity is a mystery.What\u2019s remarkable now is how, after months of withering scrutiny \u2014 including accusations of graft, malfeasance and racism \u2014 he remains apparently immune to the effects of negative news.This is a conundrum that has perplexed many New York Times readers who live abroad. \u201cTrump has sleaze written all over his face and behavior,\u201d Neil Douglas, a retired teacher from Canada, wrote in an email that echoed a common sentiment. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Americans see through his braggadocio?\u201dIn part, Mr. Trump\u2019s endurance is a product of sheer churn \u2014 the endless stream of his own provocations. \u201cThere\u2019s been so many scandals, so much outrage, that it\u2019s hard to focus on any one of them,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host and Trump critic.Mr. Sykes turned on Mr. Trump because he said that the candidate was damaging true conservatism. These days, that frequently brings him into conflict with callers to his own show, who refuse to countenance any criticism of Mr. Trump. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want their biases confirmed.\u201dThat points to another underlying theme of this election: the vicious polarization of America\u2019s news media. More voters than ever are getting their news from the walled gardens of Facebook and other social media sites, where like-minded views often reinforce one another. And on mainstream channels like Fox News, conspiracy theories that were once limited to the fringes of the internet are getting an airing. As a result, public trust in the media has collapsed.Can any story, or revelation, hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s Teflon qualities at this stage? Mr. Sykes, the radio host, said he believed Mr. Trump had fostered a \u201ccult of personality\u201d among conservatives that has few parallels in the history of American politics, \u201cexcept maybe in fiction.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he says, or what his ideas are,\u201d Mr. Sykes said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the persona. He\u2019s the strong man. And he\u2019s apparently figured out a way to bond with millions of Americans.\u201dWith seven weeks until the vote, Mrs. Clinton needs to find a way to break that bond. Her next opportunity could come at the first presidential debate, on Sept. 26, at Hofstra University on Long Island.Mr. Trump may ultimately do the work for her: His bluster, lies and insults could eventually drag him down. But to ensure victory, Mrs. Clinton will also need to overcome her handicap. The high levels of voter distrust, unique in a modern presidential front-runner, leave her vulnerable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Islam Karimov Dies at 78, Ending a Long, Ruthless Rule of Uzbekistan", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Islam Karimov, a ruthless autocrat who ruled Uzbekistan for almost three decades, died on Friday in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent. He was 78.A joint statement by the cabinet of ministers and Parliament announced the death, saying he had a stroke that led to multiple organ failure.The announcement followed a long, strange interlude during which Uzbek officials refrained from confirming the death even while the leaders of Turkey and Georgia expressed condolences, mosque leaders were barred from offering prayers for the president\u2019s health, and funeral arrangements were being made very publicly. A respected opposition website posted pictures of cemetery workers in Samarkand, the president\u2019s hometown, digging a fresh grave in a prominent location.The likeliest reason for the official silence was that top government officials had been unable to decide on the succession and did not want to announce that Mr. Karimov was dead until they could also say who would replace him, at least temporarily.The official statement said that the prime minister, Shavkat Mirziyoev, who is widely deemed to be the president\u2019s likeliest successor, would lead the funeral on Saturday and that Mr. Karimov would be buried in Samarkand in accordance with Muslim rites.It is by no means certain that Prime Minister Mirziyoev, who is considered a Kremlin ally, will succeed Mr. Karimov. Rustam Azimov, a deputy prime minister and finance minister, is a possible technocratic alternative.Mr. Karimov\u2019s glamorous older daughter, Gulnara Karimova, had once been seen as having a promising political future, but those prospects disintegrated in a public soap opera involving charges of bribery, money laundering, physical violence and even sorcery.Mr. Karimov rose through the ranks of the local Communist Party until the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev named him first secretary and effectively Uzbekistan\u2019s chief in 1989. He won a presidential election after independence in 1991 and used Soviet methods to govern the country.\u201cHe is the state and the state is him, and it has been that way for at least 25 years,\u201d said Steve Swerdlow, the director of Central Asia research at Human Rights Watch.\u201cIt is a police state where the power belongs completely to the security services,\u201d said Daniil Kislov, the Moscow-based editor in chief of a website, Ferghana.ru. \u201cThe special services will not allow for any alternative on the succession.\u201dThe immediate succession is expected to follow the Constitution, which mandates that the head of the Senate run the country for three months until new presidential elections can be organized. Mr. Karimov repeatedly manipulated elections or referendums to extend his rule well beyond the two terms mandated by the Constitution.Mr. Karimov jailed or exiled his political opponents and muzzled the news media. Political prisoners were estimated to number in the thousands. Torture was rife. He brushed aside any criticism that managed to bubble up despite the oppression.\u201cI am one of those who is criticized for staying too long,\u201d he said in 2014. \u201cBut I want to keep working. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201dWith him gone, there was some question about whether the Islamic State or other groups might try to exploit the transition. \u201cWhether or not the Islamic State sees a succession as an opportunity to create risks for the much-hated Russians remains an open question,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, an expert on Russia and chairman of the Eurasia Group, a risk advisory firm based in Washington.In 1999, Mr. Karimov made his position toward radical Islam abundantly clear.\u201cI am prepared to rip off the heads of 200 people, to sacrifice their lives, in order to save peace and calm in the republic,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf my child chose such a path, I myself would rip off his head.\u201dMr. Karimov responded by expelling American forces from Karshi-Khanabad Military Base, an important link in the supply chain for the forces propping up the government in Afghanistan against the Taliban.Eventually, supply needs trumped human rights issues, and the United States restored relations, even giving the Uzbekistan forces hundreds of surplus armored vehicles as American forces in Afghanistan were being drawn down.Opposition websites alleged that Mr. Karimov beat his daughter in a fit of rage before jailing some of her associates and confining her to her home, where she remains incommunicado.\u201cKarimov first slapped her on the face and then really started to beat Gulnara,\u201d according to an account, attributed to an unidentified security service insider and published in 2013 on the website of the opposition People\u2019s Movement of Uzbekistan.Ms. Karimova took to social media at the time to accuse her mother and her younger sister of dabbling in witchcraft. \u201cThe other part of the family destroys and is friends with sorcerers,\u201d Ms. Karimova wrote in a post on Instagram.Mr. Karimov\u2019s wife and daughters survive him, as do four grandchildren.Some analysts attributed Mr. Karimov\u2019s reclusiveness and violent tendencies toward opponents as well as relatives and associates \u2014 he was known to pitch heavy marble ashtrays at senior aides \u2014 to his early years in a Soviet orphanage.Islam Karimov was born on Jan. 30, 1938, in Samarkand. His official biography said his father had been an office worker. Other accounts suggested that his parents, overwhelmed by a large family and meager resources, put him in an orphanage, at first temporarily, but eventually left him there.He studied to become an engineer, worked at an airplane factory and joined the Communist Party in the early 1960s. He married in 1964, and he and his wife had a son, Petr, but soon divorced. The son is believed to have moved to Moscow decades ago and never returned.Mr. Karimov joined Gosplan, the central Soviet economic planning agency, in 1966 and married for the second time in 1967. He rose to become the finance minister for the Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan in 1983.By all accounts Mr. Karimov hated the political jockeying by different groups in the initial burst of freedom after independence in 1991 and worked to destroy all autonomous political, media and human rights organizations.His antipathy toward Islamic groups is sometimes linked to an episode that same year. With Soviet authority crumbling, Islamic vigilante groups had established security and social services that were lacking in the Fergana Valley, and after one extremist group seized a building, Mr. Karimov went to negotiate with its representatives. He soon found himself humiliated when a young religious leader forced him to pray publicly. Later, he banned mosques from broadcasting the call to prayer.Over the years, Mr. Karimov also closed off the country to outside observers and put the news media under government control \u2014 one reason the circumstances of his death remain unclear.Mr. Karimov never lost his love of Soviet methods, be it for strengthening the domestic intelligence services or fostering a centrally planned economy, even if it kept much of the population mired in poverty. He once infamously criticized the millions of Uzbeks who had gone to take menial jobs in Russia just to survive, calling them \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to work at home.Every year, the government forced about one million students and others to join Uzbekistan\u2019s annual cotton harvest to meet government-established quotas.\u201cHe was a Soviet man to the end,\u201d Mr. Kislov, the web journalist, said.Oleg Matsnev and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defending Against Hackers Took a Back Seat at Yahoo, Insiders Say", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Six years ago, Yahoo\u2019s computer systems and customer email accounts were penetrated by Chinese military hackers. Google and a number of other technology companies were also hit.The Google co-founder Sergey Brin regarded the attack on his company\u2019s systems as a personal affront and responded by making security a top corporate priority. Google hired hundreds of security engineers with six-figure signing bonuses, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in security infrastructure and adopted a new internal motto, \u201cNever again,\u201d to signal that it would never again allow anyone \u2014 be they spies or criminals \u2014 to hack into Google customers\u2019 accounts.Yahoo, on the other hand, was slower to invest in the kinds of defenses necessary to thwart sophisticated hackers that are now considered standard in Silicon Valley, according to half a dozen current and former company employees who participated in security discussions but agreed to describe them only on the condition of anonymity.When Marissa Mayer took over as chief executive of the flailing company in mid-2012, security was one of many problems she inherited. With so many competing priorities, she emphasized creating a cleaner look for services like Yahoo Mail and developing new products over making security improvements, the Yahoo employees said.The \u201cParanoids,\u201d the internal name for Yahoo\u2019s security team, often clashed with other parts of the business over security costs. And their requests were often overridden because of concerns that the inconvenience of added protection would make people stop using the company\u2019s products.Certainly, many big companies have struggled with cyberattacks in recent years. But Yahoo\u2019s security efforts appear to have fallen short, in particular, when compared with those of banks and other big tech companies.To make computer systems more secure, a company often has to make its products slower and more difficult to use. It was a trade-off Yahoo\u2019s leadership was often unwilling to make.In defense of Yahoo\u2019s security, a company spokeswoman, Suzanne Philion, said the company spent $10 million on encryption technology in early 2014, and that its investment in security initiatives will have increased by 60 percent from 2015 to 2016.\u201cAt Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure,\u201d she said.\u201cYahoo is already suffering. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll suffer more because of this,\u201d said Avivah Litan, a security analyst with the research firm Gartner.Ms. Mayer arrived at Yahoo about two years after the company was hit by the Chinese military hackers. While Google\u2019s response was public, Yahoo never publicly admitted that it had also been attacked.A former Google executive credited with creating the search company\u2019s simple, colorful aesthetic, Ms. Mayer turned her attention at Yahoo to beating Google at search, creating new mobile apps, and turning Yahoo into a video powerhouse with television-style broadcasts featuring big-name talent like Katie Couric.But in matters of security, Ms. Mayer, current and former employees said, was far more reactive. In 2010, Google announced it would start paying hackers \u201cbug bounties\u201d if they turned over security holes and problems in its systems. Yahoo did not do the same until three years later, after it lost countless security engineers to competitors and experienced a breach of more than 450,000 Yahoo accounts in 2012 and a series of humiliating spam attacks in 2013. Yahoo said it had paid out $1.8 million to bug hunters.In 2013, disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, showed that Yahoo was a frequent target for nation-state spies. Yet it took a full year after Mr. Snowden\u2019s initial disclosures for Yahoo to hire a new chief information security officer, Alex Stamos.Jeff Bonforte, the Yahoo senior vice president who oversees its email and messaging services, said in an interview last December that Mr. Stamos and his team had pressed for Yahoo to adopt end-to-end encryption for everything. Such encryption would mean that only the parties in a conversation could see what was being said, with even Yahoo unable to read it.Mr. Bonforte said he resisted the request because it would have hurt Yahoo\u2019s ability to index and search message data to provide new user services. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly thrilled with building an apartment building which has the biggest bars on every window,\u201d he said.The 2014 hiring of Mr. Stamos \u2014 who had a reputation for pushing for privacy and antisurveillance measures \u2014 was widely hailed by the security community as a sign that Yahoo was prioritizing its users\u2019 privacy and security.The current and former employees say he inspired a small team of young engineers to develop more secure code, improve the company\u2019s defenses \u2014 including encrypting traffic between Yahoo\u2019s data centers \u2014 hunt down criminal activity and successfully collaborate with other companies in sharing threat data.He also dispatched \u201cred teams\u201d of employees to break into Yahoo\u2019s systems and report back what they found. At competitors like Apple and Google, the Yahoo Paranoids developed a reputation for their passion and contributions to collaborative security projects, like Threat Exchange, a platform created by Yahoo, Dropbox, Facebook, Pinterest and others to share information on cyberthreats.But when it came time to commit meaningful dollars to improve Yahoo\u2019s security infrastructure, Ms. Mayer repeatedly clashed with Mr. Stamos, according to the current and former employees. She denied Yahoo\u2019s security team financial resources and put off proactive security defenses, including intrusion-detection mechanisms for Yahoo\u2019s production systems. Over the last few years, employees say, the Paranoids have been routinely hired away by competitors like Apple, Facebook and Google.Mr. Stamos, who departed Yahoo for Facebook last year, declined to comment. But during his tenure, Ms. Mayer also rejected the most basic security measure of all: an automatic reset of all user passwords, a step security experts consider standard after a breach. Employees say the move was rejected by Ms. Mayer\u2019s team for fear that even something as simple as a password change would drive Yahoo\u2019s shrinking email users to other services.\u201cYahoo\u2019s policy is that if we believe a user\u2019s password has been compromised, we lock the account until the user resets the password,\u201d Ms. Philion said.With the 500 million accounts involved in the breach disclosed last week, the stolen passwords were encrypted. Yahoo concluded the risk of misuse was low so it notified users and encouraged them to reset their passwords themselves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SpaceX\u2019s Explosion Reverberates Across Space, Satellite and Telecom Industries", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe explosion of a SpaceX rocket last Thursday will have an impact across the space industry, far beyond the losses on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral, Fla.An Israeli satellite operator\u2019s deal to sell itself to a Chinese company is imperiled. Planned launches of communications satellites that support international mobile phone service and digital television are delayed and put in doubt. NASA\u2019s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station will probably be disrupted.But last week\u2019s setback and a failed launch last year, when its rocket carrying a NASA cargo fell apart in flight, are raising questions about SpaceX, a company that has risen rapidly by offering lower costs and promising accelerated launch schedules.At this stage, there are more questions than answers. The key for SpaceX will be how quickly it can satisfy federal investigators, rebuild the damaged launchpad at Cape Canaveral and resume sending satellites into space. For commercial telecommunications customers, getting a satellite manufactured is time-consuming and expensive, taking two years or more and costing $200 million to $400 million each.The launch itself is a high-risk step, but once in orbit the satellites are money spinners. The upfront investment is paid back in a few years, and they then generate hefty profits for the remainder of their useful life, which could be as much as a decade.So once a satellite is ready to go, time on the ground \u2014 and delay \u2014 are financially painful. Among the commercial satellite operators lined up for SpaceX launches later this year are Iridium Communications, SES of Luxembourg, EchoStar and KT Corporation of South Korea.\u201cNo doubt SpaceX will fix the problems, but if you\u2019re a customer time is money,\u201d said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a former NASA administrator. \u201cThis will get customers looking at alternatives. It may give competitors an opening and slow down SpaceX.\u201dIn the market for launching large, geostationary communications satellites, the main SpaceX rival is Arianespace, a French multinational company. And there are others, notably International Launch Services, an American-Russian joint venture, which launches Russian-designed Proton rockets from Kazakhstan.But Arianespace, which has an excellent safety record, is considerably more expensive than SpaceX. And the safety and performance record of the Proton rockets lags behind that of the SpaceX workhorse, the Falcon 9.If the SpaceX launch timetable is delayed by a few months, industry analysts say, its customers will probably wait. If the delays stretch out further, other launch providers will look increasingly appealing.Recovering from delays to its aggressive launch schedule \u2014 without losing momentum \u2014 is the challenge for SpaceX, not a financial squeeze. In a statement on Friday, the company said its business was \u201crobust, with approximately 70 missions on our manifest worth over $10 billion.\u201dThe company said it was too early to predict when its launches might resume. In addition to the damaged launchpad, SpaceX has two others under construction. One is in Florida, which the company says should be ready in November. The other is at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, which SpaceX said was in \u201cthe final stages of an operational upgrade.\u201dA longer-term issue for SpaceX is whether the rocket explosion and its aftermath raise concerns about its plans to move into the field of manned spaceflights for NASA and for launching military and national security satellites for the Department of Defense. Its competitor for that business is the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.The list price for the SpaceX Falcon 9 is $62 million while the larger, more powerful Falcon Heavy is $90 million. There are further costs beyond the rocket itself, but analysts say SpaceX launches cost at least 50 percent less than what its main competitors charge. It has achieved that efficiency by streamlining production techniques, designing a stripped-down launchpad and stepping up the pace of launches.Each innovation adds risk, said Phil Smith, an analyst for the Tauri Group. But SpaceX, he added, has been approved by NASA for cargo missions and certified by the Air Force, both of which have high safety and performance standards.The explosion investigation and launchpad repair seem sure to scuttle SpaceX\u2019s aggressive launch plans this year. The company had hoped for as many as 18 rocket launches this year. It has had eight so far; last week\u2019s would have made nine. Over all, SpaceX has had 27 successful launches of Falcon 9 rockets.The Florida accident is also rippling through the insurance market. Insuring the risk of getting a satellite into space comes in two stages. The preflight insurance is intended to mainly cover the risk of damage to the rocket and satellite on their way to the launchpad. Premiums are a fraction of a percent.Launch policies, which take effect when the rocket is fired up, are costly, ranging from 5 to 15 percent historically.But the Falcon 9 exploded during a prelaunch test. So launch policies did not kick in. And the insurance payout will fall on the roughly two dozen preflight insurers.Richard Parker, managing director of Assure Space, an underwriting agency, is waiting to see the cause of the explosion. If it is a design or manufacturing flaw or an operational error, launch rates for SpaceX flights may well go up. His firm had underwritten a launch policy on last week\u2019s flight at 6 percent, he said.One business casualty of the explosion is the $285 million sale of Space Communications, an Israeli satellite operator, to a unit of a Chinese company, Xinwei Technology Group. That deal hinged on the launch of Spacecom\u2019s Amos-6 satellite, an Israeli design.The satellite was insured, but because of the explosion, Spacecom\u2019s five-year contract with Facebook and Eutelsat Communications of France to supply internet access to people in sub-Saharan Africa was canceled.Spacecom\u2019s stock price fell 9 percent on Thursday, and another 34 percent on Sunday. In a news conference on Sunday, Spacecom executives said they were trying to renegotiate the deal with Xinwei and exploring other options.Kenneth Chang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The regulator also called on the social network to delete all information already forwarded from WhatsApp on roughly 35 million German users.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.Facebook said on Tuesday, after the order had been issued, that it had complied with Europe\u2019s privacy rules and that it was willing to work with the regulator to address its concerns. The Hamburg regulator has authority over Facebook\u2019s activities in Germany because the company\u2019s German subsidiary is based in the city.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.More than any other region, Europe has pushed back against American technology giants\u2019 use of people\u2019s digital information, routinely forcing companies like Google and Facebook to change their policies after they breached the European Union\u2019s tough data protection rules.In its decision on Tuesday, which would affect only WhatsApp users in Germany, the Hamburg regulator said that neither the internet messenger nor Facebook had received individuals\u2019 permission to share the information and had potentially misled people over how their data would be used in the future.The watchdog added that millions of people whose contact details had been uploaded to WhatsApp could now have that information shared with Facebook against their will, which would infringe German law.\u201cFacebook\u2019s answer, that this has merely not been done for the time being, is cause for concern that the gravity of the data protection breach\u201d will have a more severe impact, Mr. Caspar said.Advertisement"}

For some, the extreme nature of the campaign rhetoric \u2014 which is already thick with insults and grumbles about possible vote rigging \u2014 raises questions about American law, during the election and beyond.Will foreign election observers be deployed to monitor the vote, much as they do in elections in other countries?Given the president\u2019s power to launch a nuclear strike, is there a legal entity that monitors his or her mental capacity?\u201cCan anyone restrain a president who is obviously not fit?\u201d asked Ken Martin, a retired government official from New Zealand.And what would happen if Mrs. Clinton won the election but was assassinated before she was sworn in?(Mr. Trump later said his comment had been made in jest.)For answers I turned to James A. Thurber, a professor of political science at American University in Washington, who has just returned from a trip to Russia, Turkey and several other European countries where he said he had fielded similar questions from concerned foreign observers.International observers will be present in November, just as they have been in past American elections, Dr. Thurber said. Their goal is to learn, not to lecture. \u201cThey don\u2019t come to look for fraud, but to take lessons from how we administer the election,\u201d he said.The job of monitoring the vote falls largely to Democrat and Republican election monitors who will be present at polling places across the country.American law has no specific provisions for the death of a president-elect, Dr. Thurber said. The most likely outcome would be for the winning party to choose its vice-presidential running mate to step up. \u201cThe people would have spoken for the ticket,\u201d he said.Similarly, there is no legal authority for oversight of the president\u2019s mental capacity \u2014 determining fitness to hold office is a major purpose of the campaign. But it is a timely query.Once in office, a president can be replaced only if he or she is convicted by the Senate, after articles of impeachment are issued by the House of Representatives, or is incapacitated. Short of that, Dr. Thurber added, the phalanx of military and civilian advisers around the president might informally restrain him from making certain rash decisions. At the end of Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration, Dr. Thurber said, \u201clots of people around him guided him and persuaded him.\u201d\u201cIt would be a similar situation,\u201d he added, should Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton demonstrate they lack the fitness to make decisions.The biggest mystery for many abroad, though, relates to Mrs. Clinton, and the intense emotions she elicits among so many Americans. \u201cThe bit I don\u2019t get is the antipathy towards Hillary,\u201d wrote Stephen Woodmansee, an Australian living in Malaysia. \u201cWhy is she so widely distrusted (hated even)? Is it pure misogyny or am I missing something?\u201d\u201cFrom our perspective she\u2019s an imperfect politician (aren\u2019t they all?) but has a very good record of getting things done,\u201d wrote Kim Glasgow.I can see where they are coming from: During the Labor Day holiday this month, I visited my relatives in New Jersey, many of whom are staunch Republicans. At the dinner table, just the mention of Mrs. Clinton provoked a barrage of sharp criticism that echoed attack lines often heard on Fox News about her being a criminal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What if \u2018One Click\u2019 Buying Were Internetwide?", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Paying for things online can be cumbersome. Even the man who invented the web, Tim Berners-Lee, says he frequently throws up his hands.\u201cSometimes I will think that I bought something and I press the button, \u2018Buy this,\u2019 and I don\u2019t realize it didn\u2019t go through,\u201d Mr. Berners-Lee said in a recent interview. \u201cWe are long overdue for a payments user interface for the web.\u201dResponding to the frustrations of Mr. Berners-Lee and hundreds of millions of online shoppers, the web\u2019s governing body, the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, has brought together the giants of the internet including Google, Facebook and Apple to fix the clumsiness of paying for things online.Now, a new global standard for online payments \u2014 a sort of Amazon one-click payment system for the entire internet \u2014 is being completed by the consortium and its members.Google, one of the authors of the standard, has recently introduced it in certain new versions of its Chrome browser. Other browser companies have said they intend to follow.The standard will provide a uniform way for users to input their credit cards and payment systems to any web browser so that they can be used for any purchase on the web. After the card details are entered once, they will automatically be called up as choices for all future transactions.This will be somewhat like the existing auto-fill functions that browsers have. But with the new standard, all the data fields will be filled in invisibly, requiring just one click.On the security side, rather than sending along all the credit card details, the browser will generate a one-time payment token that will avoid leaving your credit card number in countless databases around the world.Numerous efforts to modernize the payment system have failed to take off. And this one could fizzle, too, if online merchants, web browsers or consumers fail to adopt the new standard.The new standard will also face competition from the Amazons and PayPals of the world, as well as from the credit card networks, all of which want to be the primary destination for payments, rather than just one option.But payment analysts are hopeful about the new effort because it will not require consumers or merchants to use a new method of payment. Instead it will be equally open to any existing card or payment app, and it will channel them into a single place that most consumers already use \u2014 the web browser \u2014 where everything can be stored and used.\u201cInstead of simplifying the world, we have been fragmenting it into a million apps,\u201d said Eric Shea, a payments consultant at Kurt Salmon Digital. \u201cIf we can get back to that single integrated solution that everyone has on their phone and their desktop, that is the way to move forward and get adoption.\u201dDave Birch, a consultant who has been working on electronic payments for over two decades, said the web browser stood the best chance of providing a unified and more secure portal for payments.\u201cThere\u2019s a convergence going on,\u201d said Mr. Birch, who currently works for Consult Hyperion. \u201cIn the future you will have one experience \u2014 it won\u2019t matter if you are at the store or on the phone. It will pop up on your phone, you will put your thumb on it and you will be done.\u201dThe W3C project represents a challenge to PayPal and Amazon, the current giants of online payments. Both have gained business and fees with their more streamlined checkout processes.Neither company has participated in the current W3C effort and they are likely to continue to provide an alternative to customers who don\u2019t want to enter their details into their browsers.But the W3C has managed to bring in about 40 of the biggest players in online commerce, including Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and American Express as well as Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent.All met last week in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the specifications that they will introduce on different time frames to users around the world.In the version that Google released, when customers shopping at participating merchants hit the buy button, they are given a drop-down menu of their stored shipping addresses and credit cards.The customer can click on the address and card to be used, enter the three-digit security code on the card and hit \u201cpay now.\u201d Other browser companies may choose to use a fingerprint instead of the security code.\u201cWe wanted to remove what we jokingly call the Nascar effect of checkout, where you see five or seven logos for the different cards and payment methods you can use,\u201d said Zach Koch, the top Google executive on the project. \u201cThis is really fast, where a user can say, \u2018Tap, tap, buy.\u2019\u201dThe fees from transactions will still go to existing financial institutions like credit card companies and banks, unless customers choose a new online payment method like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. Apple Pay takes a piece of each transaction; Samsung Pay does not.But the bigger goal behind the W3C project is to create a standard, seamless and secure way to pay for things electronically in a future that will most likely include virtual reality stores, chat-based transactions and machines making payments to other machines (an autonomous car paying for a parking spot, for instance).The standard will also make it easy to include new payment methods like Bitcoin or the Chinese payment provider Tencent.\u201cThis involves quite radical changes to the way people think about payments,\u201d said Ian Jacobs, the W3C staff member leading the effort. \u201cAs a standards body it is our job to be sure it is an open playing field.\u201dThe need to create a better way to pay for things online was evident from the web\u2019s beginnings in the 1990s, Mr. Berners-Lee said. At some of the earliest meetings of the W3C, which he founded, there were discussions about creating a way to pay for things online that didn\u2019t require people to send credit card details over the internet.The failure to come up with a standard and secure way to do this led to the hodgepodge of payment screens consumers encounter today. It also made an opening for PayPal, which created a way for shoppers to pay on different sites using a single password.Mr. Birch said the main hurdle to accomplishing more seamless payments in the past was online merchants, who did not want to give up control over any part of the checkout process.But merchants have expressed increasing frustration with the high rate of abandoned online transactions and the frequency of credit card fraud.More than half of online purchases now happen on mobile phones, but Shopify has said that only 40 percent of the customers who start filling a shopping cart online finish their transactions.Shopify, which manages the online stores and checkout processes for 300,000 merchants, has been closely involved with the W3C effort and is planning to immediately offer the new standard to its merchants, as is Groupon.\u201cWe are betting a lot on it,\u201d said Jason Normore, the director of engineering at Shopify. \u201cEven though it cuts out a piece of our offering, it makes commerce better for everyone.\u201dApple will be one of the most interesting players to watch, given that it has both the Safari browser, which is part of the W3C effort, and Apple Pay, which could be seen as a competing offering.In the new operating system that Apple released last week, it is possible, for the first time, to shop online using the Safari browser and check out with Apple Pay. After hitting \u201cPay With Apple Pay,\u201d the customer is asked to provide a fingerprint on a phone, and the transaction is complete.The W3C standard will provide a similar experience on any browser \u2014 on a computer or phone \u2014 but will also allow customers to choose from any credit card or payment method they have entered into their browsers.Apple has so far been a part of the W3C group writing the standards, which will allow it to integrate non-Apple Pay choices into its browser.Mr. Berners-Lee said he hoped that more standardized payments would open up new types of online commerce that aren\u2019t possible now. He has long been interested in micropayments that would allow newspapers or small producers of content to be paid a few cents at a time, which isn\u2019t possible in a world with only credit cards.\u201cDifferent things call for different payments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are all interoperable you can separate the market for goods being sold from the payment back end.\u201dAn article on Monday about one-click shopping on the internet misstated the fee structure of one online payment method. While Apple Pay charges a fee on each transaction, Samsung Pay does not.Advertisement"}

Battalion Chief Killed in Bronx Explosion After Report of Gas Leak", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe early morning call seemed relatively routine: a report of a gas smell at a small, two-story house on West 234th Street in the Bronx.But the nearly 20 firefighters who arrived at the house about a half-hour before sunrise on Tuesday noticed something else \u2014 materials that indicated that at least part of the home was being used as a drug laboratory, officials said. The firefighters called the police and left the building.On the street, Battalion Chief Michael J. Fahy was directing his firefighters. Then, the building exploded.Chief Fahy, a 17-year veteran of the department and a father of three young children, was hit by debris and killed. He had followed his own father, Thomas, into the department. Chief Fahy, 44, lived in Yonkers with his wife and children. He had a law degree and had steadily climbed the Fire Department\u2019s ranks.Chief Fahy had been struck on the head by a piece of the roof, officials said. He died at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Allen Pavilion in the Inwood section of Manhattan, after being rushed there by police officers, who tried desperately to save his life, the police and fire officials said.The police said they had a man in custody whom they were questioning in relation to the case.At a news conference at the hospital on Tuesday morning, the fire commissioner, Daniel A. Nigro, described Chief Fahy as \u201ca rising star\u201d of the department. \u201cHe was a star, a brave man,\u201d Mr. Nigro said, emotion weighing in his voice. \u201cWe feel it deeply, we feel it deeply today.\u201dChief Fahy had briefly worked as lawyer for the firm Proskauer Rose before joining the Fire Department in 1999, according to his LinkedIn profile. He rose from firefighter to lieutenant to captain and, finally, to battalion chief in 2012. He had also earned a master\u2019s degree in homeland security from the Naval Postgraduate School.About 20 other people were injured in the explosion, including nine firefighters, six police officers and three workers from Consolidated Edison, Mr. Nigro said. None of the injuries were life-threatening.The police had been looking at West 234th Street, in the Kingsbridge neighborhood, after receiving a tip that a house there was being used to grow marijuana, Police Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill said at the news conference. Officers were in the initial stages of an investigation there, he said.The explosion sent wood, bricks and a large part of the building\u2019s roof tumbling down, much of it into the street and onto cars parked there. Neighbors and residents from the surrounding blocks reported their buildings shaking them awake.Images on Tuesday showed the two-story dwelling reduced largely to rubble. A video shot by a neighbor showed firefighters dousing the smoking building in water as sirens blared nearby.\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to make these assumptions these days,\u201d said Campbell Abbott, 24, who lives a block away and shot the video after the explosion. \u201cI thought it was some rogue terrorist.\u201dMatthew Chrisphonte, 21, said he was asleep in his family\u2019s home, across the street and a few doors down on Tibbett Avenue, when he felt the blast. \u201cMy entire house shook, and immediately following the explosion I heard screaming, yelling,\u201d he said.Mr. Chrisphonte said a building close to the explosion site housed a day care center, which was evacuated.The person listed in public records as the owner of the property could not be reached for comment. The police said the house was occupied by renters, but they had yet to identify them.Many neighbors said the house was frequently occupied by college-age tenants, but none seemed to know its latest tenants.Marina Uza lived in the neighborhood for 11 years but said she moved away last year because of issues with the home where the explosion took place: parties and people screaming on the street.\u201cThere were too many people going in and out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was too much going on. I have a child, so I left.\u201dAround Chief Fahy\u2019s firehouse in the Bronx, the street was closed to traffic and pedestrians.

{"Headline": "Torn Over Donald Trump and Cut Off by Culture Wars, Evangelicals Despair", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRIMES, Iowa \u2014 Betty and Dick Odgaard used to own the tiny church next door to their home. They had built it over 13 years into an art gallery, bistro, flower shop and framing service. They even rented out the chapel, with its bright stained glass windows, for social events.But three years ago, the Odgaards refused to rent the quaint site to two gay men for a wedding, saying it would violate their religious beliefs about marriage. The men filed a civil rights complaint, and the Odgaards settled, paying a penalty because it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. After the controversy, regular customers stopped coming. Friends and family members stopped speaking to them. The Odgaards were vilified as bigots and haters.So, in a year when many voters see nothing but bad choices, many evangelicals feel deeply torn. Long part of a reliable Republican voting bloc, many are appalled to find Donald J. Trump their only alternative to Hillary Clinton. They say he has taken positions all over the map on same-sex couples and abortion and does not have the character to be president. Others are still bewildered that Mr. Trump defeated not only Mr. Cruz \u2014 a pastor\u2019s son who made \u201creligious liberty\u201d a signature issue \u2014 but also half a dozen other conservative Christian contenders they would have gladly supported.Nevertheless, polls show that the vast majority of evangelicals are now coalescing around Mr. Trump, largely out of fear that a President Clinton will appoint liberal Supreme Court justices.The change in America seemed to happen so quickly that it felt like whiplash, the Odgaards said. One day, they felt comfortably situated in the American majority, as Christians with shared beliefs in God, family and the Bible. They had never even imagined that two people of the same sex could marry.Overnight, it seemed, they discovered that even in small-town Iowa they were outnumbered, isolated and unpopular. Everyone they knew seemed to have a gay relative or friend. Mr. Odgaard\u2019s daughter from his first marriage disavowed her father\u2019s actions on Facebook, and his gay second cousin will not speak to him. Even their own Mennonite congregation put out a statement saying that while the denomination opposes gay marriage, \u201cnot every congregation\u201d or Mennonite does. Mrs. Odgaard, 64, the daughter of a Mennonite minister, was devastated.\u201cIt all flipped, so fast,\u201d said Mr. Odgaard, a patrician 70-year-old who favors khakis and boat shoes. \u201cSuddenly, we were in the minority. That was kind of a scary feeling. It makes you wonder where the Christians went.\u201dThe beginning of the end of the Odgaards\u2019 familiar life came Aug. 3, 2013, when Lee Stafford and Jared Ellars arrived at the Odgaards\u2019 gallery, G\u00f6rtz Haus. The couple were in a panic because the hotel they had booked for their wedding had gone bankrupt two months before the date, and they had already sent the invitations out. Mr. Odgaard spent about 45 minutes showing them the property and figuring out seating, flowers and how many guests needed gluten-free meals. It was only when Mr. Odgaard asked if it was a same-sex wedding that his tone changed, they said.\u201cI\u2019ll remember these words for the rest of my life,\u201d said Mr. Ellars, 35, a database administrator. \u201cHe looked at us and he said, \u2018I can\u2019t take your money, and we don\u2019t do anything for free.\u2019\u201dThe couple, together for 13 years, say they never wanted the Odgaards to go out of business. They say they wanted them to stop discriminating against gay people and never put another gay couple through the rejection they experienced. The case was settled in arbitration, and the Odgaards had to pay $5,000 to Mr. Stafford and Mr. Ellars, which they donated to an anti-bullying program for gay students.Their wedding was held in a barn, officiated by a minister with the Disciples of Christ church that Mr. Stafford attends. To this day, Mr. Stafford, who is 43 and a business systems analyst, is troubled that the debate over religious liberty appears to be \u201cso one-sided,\u201d he said.\u201cTheir religious beliefs say they don\u2019t approve of gay marriage, but my religious beliefs say that we can,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does their religion trump mine?\u201dMr. Jorgenson jumped at buying the Odgaards\u2019 picturesque property on the busiest street in Grimes, a suburb of Des Moines. He converted the lower floor, where the flower shop once stood, into a children\u2019s ministry, and installed soundproofing to insulate the children\u2019s ruckus downstairs from the electric guitars and drums of the church\u2019s worship band upstairs.He liked the symbolism of converting a landmark site that had represented a defeat for conservative Christians into an outpost for preaching \u201cGod\u2019s word, without apology,\u201d he said. The church now draws up to 300 on a weekend, and is already outgrowing the space. On a recent weekday, the secretary sat working on a stool in a hall closet. The staff was planning a conference to teach Christians how to evangelize to atheists, agnostics and Mormons.It is necessary to train believers to hold their own, the pastor said, because \u201cmainstream biblical Christianity is less and less mainstream.\u201d On Sundays, he notices that half of his neighbors do not even go to church.He expects that more and more Christians will, like the Odgaards, suffer \u201cpersecution\u201d for their beliefs. He regularly visits the Capitol in Des Moines to pray with and lobby legislators with the Family Leader, a conservative Iowa group.Mr. Jorgenson was among many Iowa pastors who publicly supported Mr. Cruz, though not from the pulpit, and he is not sure if he will vote for Mr. Trump in November, even though Mr. Cruz has now said he will vote for Mr. Trump. Mr. Jorgenson would not even consider voting for Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and said he did not know anyone in his church who would. But asked how much hope he had that Mr. Trump would protect the religious liberty of conservative Christians, Mr. Jorgenson held his two fingers a quarter-inch apart.\u201cMy hope is not ultimately in the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not of this world. Jesus is going to come back. He\u2019s going to bring the perfect government. Until then, we live in a world of sin.\u201dShe is an accountant, he a chemist, and they met in a Christian chat room. They had something in common, aside from their faith: Mr. Berkheimer is half-Japanese, and Mrs. Berkheimer had lived in Japan, and her children from her first marriage are half-Japanese.Over dinner at a steakhouse recently, the Berkheimers said they had nothing against gay people \u2014 a refrain the Odgaards also repeatedly sounded.\u201cMy brother was a homosexual,\u201d Mrs. Berkheimer said. Her brother became a born-again Christian before he died of complications from AIDS many years ago, and she named her son after him, she said.She said she became seriously alarmed about the nation in the past year as Congress failed to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood after an anti-abortion group released videos taken surreptitiously of the organization. The Berkheimers are in the \u201cNever Trump\u201d camp.\u201cI\u2019m worried for America if we don\u2019t turn away from abortion,\u201d said Mrs. Berkheimer, who is 48. \u201cI think our country is going to be punished, with a nuclear weapon. I don\u2019t think you can mock God forever.\u201dShe quickly added that she was worried she would sound crazy saying such things.Mr. McKoy steered the conversation to the Odgaards. He had quietly played a part in their story: When Mrs. Odgaard was in the depths of despair over a boycott of G\u00f6rtz Haus, she often called Mr. McKoy, and he prayed with her. He introduced the Odgaards to Mr. Jorgenson, the young pastor looking for a permanent place for his church.On air, the radio hosts suggested that the Odgaards\u2019 story showed that Americans were developing a double standard on the notion of tolerance. \u201cI just wish that this tolerance went across the board for Christian businesses,\u201d said one host, Frank Thomas Holzhauser, who on air calls himself Frank (the Verse) Thomas \u2014 a nod to his facility with Scripture.When the show ended, the hosts debated the election. Only Mr. Holzhauser said he was certain he would vote for Mr. Trump, but he admitted it had caused him to lose some friends who \u201ccan\u2019t stomach Trump.\u201dThe others said they had not decided how they would vote. None had supported Mr. Trump in the Iowa caucuses. Mr. McKoy and Chris Rohloff had supported Senator Marco Rubio, Mr. Holzhauser had favored Ben Carson, and Bob Monserrate had backed Mr. Cruz. Mr. Rohloff said he had thought that Mr. Trump was finished last year, the moment he said at a candidates\u2019 forum in Iowa that he had never asked God for forgiveness.\u201cEveryone in the room just went, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 Even if you\u2019ve never done it, you should at least know the right answer,\u201d Mr. Rohloff said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fundamental thing for Christians.\u201dBut by late September, Mr. McKoy said in a telephone interview that he and his co-hosts had decided to vote Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s the lesser of two evils. And I don\u2019t know by how much.\u201dSome evangelicals in Iowa said Christians who praised Mr. Trump were giving Christianity a bad name. They blamed evangelicals in the South or \u201cNascar Christians\u201d who go to church only when car races are not on.Some Republicans are working to lift evangelicals\u2019 enthusiasm.He sounded exasperated with Christians who disparaged Mr. Trump.\u201cI hope the good Lord shows more grace to me as a sinner than these people show to Donald Trump,\u201d he said.On a recent Sunday, the Odgaards walked into the church and sat in the rear, where Mrs. Odgaard, an artist whose paintings once filled the space, used to design frames for customers. The seats \u2014 stackable banquet chairs that the Odgaards had bought for their wedding business \u2014 were nearly full of mostly young worshipers. They rested their coffee cups on the hardwood floor that the Odgaards had stripped of carpet and sanded when they bought the place, spending a week on their knees. One Sunday in church, the memories were so raw that Mrs. Odgaard said she began to cry and left for home.\u201cIt\u2019s like losing a child,\u201d Mr. Odgaard said.Church members were invited to stay afterward for a quarterly meeting. Dylan Knudsen, a co-pastor, made a major announcement.Harvest Bible Chapel had just been approved for a loan to buy the Odgaards\u2019 tidy red brick house next door. The Odgaards were about to move to another town. But they planned to keep attending Harvest Bible Chapel, Mr. Knudsen said. There was brief applause.\u201cPlease thank them,\u201d Mr. Knudsen said, \u201cfor their sacrificial role.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The View From Syria as a Cease-Fire Takes Effect", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The timing of the cease-fire in Syria, which took effect on Monday at sundown and was largely holding on Tuesday, is fraught with symbolism.It coincides with Eid al-Adha, the Muslim Feast of the Sacrifice, which commemorates Abraham\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his son for God. The tale is central to the Muslim, Christian and Jewish faiths \u2014 and a recurring literary metaphor for society\u2019s sacrifice of the young in the wars of their elders.United Nations agencies and other aid groups have scrambled to prepare long-awaited aid deliveries to the divided city of Aleppo. But on Tuesday they were still awaiting official word that the route was secure.There was a big shelling the previous Eid, which hit an open area and it killed lots of children.We hear shelling, bombing and this kind of stuff, and we got used to it, but when we hear there is a cease-fire, we say, \u201cGod protect us.\u201dPeople didn\u2019t forget. They manage their life without thinking what will happen next. They take each day individually. They get used to not thinking about the future: We see this day, we are going to work, we are going to the cafe, to meet some friends or some relatives. Just for today. I think it\u2019s a powerful message.The streets are crowded by people and children. But still it\u2019s early to judge if the cease-fire will last or not.He often operates around the clock and does not expect the cease-fire deal to change that, he said in a text message.For Eid, he went to a friend\u2019s house for dinner. His friend had managed to find a sheep to slaughter, though it was more difficult and expensive to come by than usual, and they ate sheep\u2019s liver and honey-soaked baklava, traditional Eid sweets. On the way back, the city was almost pitch black.\u201cThe streets were empty. Dark,\u201d he said. \u201cNo fuel for cars. Few generators.\u201dThe first evening of the truce passed without a call to the emergency room. But when he got home, he could hear explosions in the distance. Surface-to-surface missiles, he speculated.The doctor wondered if he would make it through another day without heading back to the operating room. \u201cThe cease-fire is a big lie,\u201d he said.We in Aleppo support the cease-fire and stopping the killing in Syria. Children didn\u2019t go and play on the swings; they didn\u2019t go to the playgrounds. They didn\u2019t celebrate or experience joy this Eid because of the violent bombardment that neighborhoods were subjected to before the cease-fire.We hope that the killing stops so that everybody can live in security. We hope that the war in Syria will end, that the killing will end, so that a new Syria can be built.They threaten us every now and then that they would attack the city if we don\u2019t agree on anything they want from us. All the people of Moadhamiyeh are busy-minded and talking about the evacuation these days, not to mention the regime\u2019s agents, the troubles they make. In short, it\u2019s not safe anymore for me and people who reject the reconciliation. We may get killed.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit better today,\u201d he said on Tuesday in a text message. \u201cI can hear music being played in the Eid square.\u201dHe chatted online about his plans for Eid with the Beirut bureau of The New York Times a short while later:No Eid here. And my family is so far. My family is in Aleppo, it is so sad. They are on both sides. But they don\u2019t want to leave.Here, people can\u2019t believe anything. But they are always waiting for peace.I am happy to have spent last night without loud sounds of bombing on Qasioun Mountain. It was a nightmare for us to hear the artillery and rocket launchers from the mountain. Our building was shaking and sometimes my little children were waking up from their sleep crying.Today, we have a plan to go the park to spend our day outdoors. We will take falafel sandwiches for lunch. There is a nice park next to the Ibn al-Ameed bakeries, we will go there.Do you believe there\u2019s something called a truce? Do you think they are serious? ... They are all a bunch of criminals.We organized a celebration especially for the children of martyrs. We did the whole celebration in the basement. We were worried about the random shelling. \u2026 Imagine, you could hear sounds of prayers in Binnish and Fouaa for the Eid, followed by the sounds of shelling. The sounds were very clear.Before the Syrian revolution, my family would visit relatives on Eid, but now most of my relatives have left Raqqa to other Syrian cities, Turkey and Europe. I have nothing to do but visit a few friends who still live here.I don\u2019t feel any change will happen in the city of Raqqa because the cease-fire will not implemented here since we are occupied by Daesh. We are tired of the war and hope to have a real cease-fire that covers the whole of Syria.Maher Samaan contributed reporting from Paris, Megan Specia and Yara Bishara from New York, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Aren\u2019t They in Jail? Here\u2019s One Company Head Who Is", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HagglerConsumers who write to the Haggler to describe particularly egregious behavior often end their letters with variations of this question: Why aren\u2019t the people in charge behind bars?The Haggler never has a good answer. But he has long wondered what sort of chicanery would land the head of a company in the pokey.Now we know.Q. I serve on a local fire department, and in May I ordered three caps from a company called Hero Tees, based in Anniston, Ala. It was supposed to embroider the caps with the name of the fire department, and if they looked good, I intended to order more. But I never received a thing.When I called and emailed to complain, I was told to wait. Since then, I\u2019ve heard nothing.For a moment it seemed possible that Mr. Slaton\u2019s misadventures with Hero Tees had led to an actual consumer-fraud-related arrest.It wasn\u2019t that simple.Certainly, Hero Tees has annoyed a lot of customers. Since February 2015, the Better Business Bureau has received more than 240 complaints. Most are similar to Mr. Ray\u2019s letter. One customer transcribed an obscenity-heavy exchange he had with a Hero Tees representative. The only printable part is \u201cStill no hat,\u201d rendered in all caps.Mr. Slaton appeared in a photo on the \u201cAbout Us\u201d section of the site, a guy in his mid-40s, with a grin, a lightly whiskered chin and slicked-back hair. He looks like a Hollywood stuntman who would never say \u201cThat seems too dangerous.\u201d The site described him as a Navy corpsman veteran.The company advertised through a number of Facebook pages, but there is one Hero Tees-related page that it did not set up. It\u2019s called \u201cHero Tees Ripped Me Off Too!\u201dDid these people, and their anger, lead to Mr. Slaton\u2019s stay in the Calhoun County jail?The county sheriff, Larry Amerson, doubted it but said he wasn\u2019t the guy to ask. \u201cI just know he\u2019s a federal prisoner,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to call the Marshals Service in Birmingham. We\u2019re a holding facility for the marshals.\u201dThe Marshals Service referred the Haggler to the United States attorney\u2019s office in Birmingham. A spokeswoman in that office explained that Mr. Slaton\u2019s troubles long preceded his creation of Hero Tees. A few court documents tell the story.It begins in 2001, when Mr. Slaton was a letter carrier for the United States Postal Service and a vehicle hit his truck. After the accident, he reported pain levels that severely limited his physical activity. He would eventually turn down even limited-duty jobs offered by the Postal Service. For more than a decade he was unemployed and received workers\u2019 compensation, according to court filings.In 2011, the inspector general\u2019s office at the Postal Service took notice of Mr. Slaton\u2019s case and surveilled him for four months. The guy\u2019s life did not seem curtailed by pain. On the contrary, he regularly went to a gym and was caught on video lifting \u201cwell over 100 pounds,\u201d according to a court document. He took long drives. He remodeled his house.In 2013, he was tried and convicted of 33 crimes, including eight counts of making false statements to obtain federal workers\u2019 compensation. The government thought the judge\u2019s sentence \u2014 three years of probation and restitution of $100,000 \u2014 was a tad lenient, and appealed. In September of last year, citing procedural issues, an appeals court sent the case back for resentencing.A few weeks ago, before the resentencing hearing, the government got some added ammunition when it was contacted by the Better Business Bureau, which told prosecutors all about Hero Tees. The story of the company and its many livid customers became part of a recent motion by prosecutors that argued, essentially, that Mr. Slaton should have his bond revoked. At a hearing in late August, he was taken to Calhoun County jail.More recently, Judge Karon Bowdre rethought her sentence. Mr. Slaton will serve nine months in custody and nine months on probation. The fine was reduced to $25,000.Allison Case, a lawyer for Mr. Slaton, declined to comment.So it isn\u2019t true that Mr. Slaton was thrown in jail because of Hero Tees. That said, his management of Hero Tees did mean his stay behind bars started a week or two sooner than it otherwise would have.Hero Tees customers are unlikely to get their money back. Many, including Mr. Ray, have been given refunds through their credit card issuers. But if nothing else, the tale of Mr. Slaton gives us all an idea of what it takes to shut down the kind of company that makes people wonder, \u201cHow is this company still in business?\u201dStep one: The guy in charge needs to commit a federal crime.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Public Companies See Gold in California", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeal ProfessorCalifornia is the capital of American business. One out of five companies on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market hail from that state, according to my recent assessment of relevant data.The figures show that when it comes to formation of public companies, the rich states are getting richer while the rest are in slow decline.Compiling data from public filings and adding in missing data from SDC Platinum and CRSP/Compustat, databases that track headquarters information, I examined where public companies had their headquarters from 1965 through 2013. From 1965 through 1979, 10.07 percent of public companies were based in California. The number has continued to grow, so that from 2000-13, 19.46 percent of public companies had their headquarters in California.That\u2019s an astounding number. A state with 12 percent of our population now accounts for a fifth of all public companies. (In the 1970s, California was about 10 percent of the United States population.)Other states, meanwhile, are in decline. Ohio had 5.58 percent and Pennsylvania had 5.9 percent of public listings in the 1965-79 period. But from 2000 through 2013, Ohio had 2.58 percent and Pennsylvania 3.78 percent of public company headquarters.Illinois\u2019s decline was even starker, as it slid to 3.62 percent from 6.42 percent of public company headquarters. The reason for the decline may be obvious as the old manufacturing base went into decline. The appellation Rust Belt rings true to a large degree for these states as old companies disappear and are not replaced with new ones.Yet the decline is not just in the industrial Midwest. New York and New Jersey also fell. New York fell to 8.31 percent of public company listings from 11.32 percent, while New Jersey slipped to 4.53 percent from 5.62 percent.Other states have had growth. Texas rose to 10.26 percent of public companies from 8.38 percent. Massachusetts climbed to 5.12 percent from 3.95 percent. The state is home to technology and pharmaceuticals, two of the biggest growth industries in the United States.Still, the concentration of American corporate might is stark. Nearly 40 percent of all public companies are in just four states: California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas. Three of them \u2014 California, New York and Texas \u2014 account for a third of the Fortune 500.And the trend is accelerating. In the last 12 months, California, Massachusetts, New York and Texas accounted for 50 percent of all initial public offerings by operating companies, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence.The geographical shift reflects a changing world. The five biggest companies in the United States by market value are all technology companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 three of them with headquarters in California. Not one existed in 1965. The tech phenomenon has benefited California more than all other states, a rise that seems to be unabated.The continued emergence of biotechnology as the other main growth engine of new public company formation appears to be helping California, Massachusetts and Texas, the three states that have long held the lead in this industry.These three stand out as the winners. Why would three very different states perform so well?One might have expected that high-regulation, high-cost, high-tax states like California would decline over time as companies migrated. Texas, of course, offers a different situation. Yet it is not alone among states offering lower taxes and lower regulatory costs.And then what is one to make of Massachusetts, a relatively small state that is punching above its weight? It has regulation and taxes, and yet also business competitiveness.There is no special formula for states to be homes to companies. Instead, what appears to be going on is a winner-take-all system.California is a good example. It is a state burdened with a high tax rate, significant regulation and extreme housing costs. It is the type of place that you would think would lose business. But instead, California is winning at creating public companies. This may be because it already has a significant base of growth companies attracting yet more people to feed off the infrastructure and then create yet more new, big companies. Similar arguments can be made about Massachusetts and the natural network that its biotechnology companies and universities create.Compare this with Texas, which is known for having good hospitals and generates companies in more divergent fields. This may indeed be helped by a more business-friendly environment, but it is more likely a result of the centers that have developed in these fields.New York is increasingly the home of finance companies with a sprinkling of health care companies. But its people\u2019s skills are more associated with media, fashion, finance and consumer companies. Gone are the days when any big corporation would make New York its home because that was the place to be.This is not to say that other states are not successful in business. South Carolina and Alabama, for example, have successfully created manufacturing hubs by creating nonunion, business-friendly environments.There needs to be more study of why certain states nurture and attract public companies.For these states, the economic benefits are not just from those companies alone. There are also secondary effects. The advisers to these companies \u2014 the lawyers, the bankers \u2014 will increasingly be pulled from their New York homes, particularly to the West Coast. As the new crop of unicorns \u2014 start-ups valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 goes public, even at reduced valuations, this pull will continue and the big services that are the specialization of New York are likely to spread out even more to these other states.The country is still going West, it seems.Advertisement"}

So notable has been its practice that the company was called out as one of the most aggressive users of equity grants by Mark Mahaney, a veteran stock analyst with RBC Capital Markets.By comparison, LinkedIn paid out 17 percent of its revenue in stock-based grants last year, or about $510 million. Salesforce.com, which along with Google has expressed interest in buying Twitter, paid out 8 percent of sales in such packages, or $593.6 million, over the same time period.Tech companies that do not factor stock-based compensation into their preferred earnings metrics, such as Twitter, argue that such payouts are not cash and do not reflect the underlying health of core businesses.(Not all tech companies urge investors and analysts to ignore stock-based compensation. Facebook and Amazon are among those that factor in those grants as a real expense.)But a new owner would need to compensate its newest employees by either paying cash or doling out yet more equity. Ignoring those grants, particularly ones made to the most desirable employees like top engineers, is simply impossible for a buyer.Those costs have apparently not diminished the interest of some potential buyers. Shares of Twitter were up about 1 percent after Bloomberg reported that Walt Disney was working with a financial adviser to weigh a possible bid.Still, questions remain about whether Twitter is already valued too richly \u2014 its market capitalization as of Monday afternoon was more than $16 billion. The equity compensation costs just make the company even more expensive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Accuses Tech Firm Palantir of Bias Against Asian Engineers", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The United States Department of Labor sued Palantir Technologies, a prominent data analytics start-up, claiming systemic discrimination against Asian job applicants. The move again raises questions about diversity in Silicon Valley.In its suit, filed on Monday, the Labor Department claimed that Palantir\u2019s hiring processes for software engineering positions placed Asians at a disadvantage. Qualified Asian candidates were routinely eliminated during the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screening and telephone interview process, the government said. The company also relied on an employee referral system that favored non-Asian candidates.Should the suit succeed, the Labor Department has asked for an order canceling all of Palantir\u2019s current and future government contracts, which would include those with the F.B.I. and the United States Army.In a statement, Palantir denied the allegations and said that it was disappointed with the suit. \u201cThe Department of Labor relies on a narrow and flawed statistical analysis relating to three job descriptions from 2010 to 2011,\u201d the company said.The government\u2019s suit against Palantir is unusual in that the claim focuses on discrimination exhibited against Asians, who have typically been better represented at many tech companies than African-Americans or Latinos.The suit \u2014 and the proposed penalty \u2014 is a blow for Palantir, a company formed in 2004 and funded by well-known investors including Peter Thiel.Palantir\u2019s software has been credited with helping intelligence agencies find and kill Osama bin Laden. While Palantir now also counts state and local governments, financial firms and health care companies as clients, as a United States government contractor, it is subject to executive orders that prohibit hiring discrimination.\u201cIt is rare to see such blatant and obvious discrimination in a federal complaint,\u201d said Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer at Outten & Golden, a law firm that specializes in workplace fairness cases. \u201cNot because discrimination isn\u2019t common, but because companies usually make the business decision to go through the conciliation process and settle with the government.\u201dThe government said it had tried to work with Palantir to resolve the claims before the process broke down. Two government divisions unsuccessfully tried to \u201csecure Palantir\u2019s voluntary compliance\u201d with anti-discrimination laws, the suit said.The government said Palantir\u2019s behavior with Asian candidates included one example where software engineering jobs drew a pool of more than 1,160 qualified applicants. Of that number, 85 percent were Asian. Yet Palantir ultimately hired 11 Asian applicants and 14 non-Asian applicants.\u201cThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in 3.4 million,\u201d the Labor Department said in its complaint.After attempts at a settlement failed, the Labor Department filed a formal notice last October asking Palantir to show why the government should not begin enforcement proceedings related to its findings that the company had used discriminatory hiring processes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "People Are Watching Less TV. So Will They Watch the Emmys?", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHERE was a time several years ago when awards shows were on the upswing.As television ratings began to erode in an era of Netflix, the DVR and Facebook, awards shows, along with sports and other big live events, were among the few rock-solid programming institutions that were immune to the changes, delivering grindingly sturdy results.Well, they used to, at least.Here's a look at some of the most memorable moments from the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards.Trying to buck this recent trend on Sunday will be the Emmys, which will be broadcast on ABC and hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.Executives in the television industry are aware of the declines and are wondering if they are part of the cyclical rise and fall of awards shows, or if people\u2019s ever-changing viewing habits are finally affecting the ratings for these three- to four-hour, commercial-loaded TV events.\u201cWhat prompts these trends?\u201d said Don Mischer, the longtime TV-event producer who is overseeing this year\u2019s Emmys. \u201cAs we\u2019ve gone through time, there is so much more content available that the pieces of the pie are getting smaller and smaller.\u201d57 PhotosThat\u2019s one theory: that viewers are instead turning to an ever-expanding list of options instead of habitually tuning in to the Oscars or Emmys. Another is that with a growing number of awards programs, viewer fatigue is setting in. Yet another is that at a time when services like Netflix provide programming without commercials, the prospect of watching a prolonged awards show riddled with ads seems like too much to endure. It doesn\u2019t hurt that highlights from an awards show that happened the night before are always just a click away.\u201cThere are so many things fighting for your time, and live TV, even for live events, is fairly inefficient,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, a financial-services firm. \u201cOur tolerance for commercials and high-ad loads is disappearing. Once you started to binge watch, it\u2019s just hard to go back to any form of live-linear TV unless you\u2019re an absolute die-hard fan.\u201dFinding an answer is critical for an industry that is desperately trying to maintain an ad-supported business model. Big live events that drive viewership and provoke engagement \u2014 on social media in real time, and in offices the day after \u2014 are a crucial component of that strategy.Executives point out that awards shows have long been prone to seesaw ratings, with any number of factors affecting their appeal. For the Oscars, viewership is often dictated by whether a series of blockbusters, or movies with big-name stars, were nominated for best picture. For other awards, the competition that night \u2014 whether it\u2019s an N.F.L. playoff game that goes into overtime or a hit like \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d \u2014 can dictate an up year or a down year.The television critics James Poniewozik, Mike Hale and Neil Genzlinger evaluate the 2016 Primetime Emmy nominations.But in the last two years, the gains have stopped. The Oscars went from an audience of 43.7 million in 2014 to 34.3 million this year. The Golden Globes went from a total of 20.9 million viewers in 2014 to 18.5 million this year. The Grammys went from 28.5 million viewers two years ago to 25 million this year. And the Emmys went from an audience of 17.6 million in 2013 to 11.9 million last year. There are similar trend lines for many other awards programs, with big highs from a couple of years ago eroding by the millions.\u201cPerhaps the outlier was the growth in viewership,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cMaybe this is just the reality now.\u201dDan Donnelly, a managing director at Publicis Media, said that even if ratings continue to fall, big live events still deliver an audience that few programs can match, and so might remain attractive to advertisers.\u201cEven with that decline, if someone tells you, \u2018Oh, you can advertise in an environment with 18, 25 or 30 million viewers, even if they used to have 45 or 50 million,\u2019 well, then wow, that\u2019s still a great place to play,\u201d he said.There is also hope within ABC that it is better positioned than Fox (last year\u2019s Emmy network) to provide a promotional push \u2014 through Mr. Kimmel\u2019s late-night show and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d \u2014 that could position the show for higher ratings this year.The Emmys present an unusually intriguing case study: They are dedicated to honoring an industry that\u2019s never been bigger or filled with more celebrated shows, but those shows also don\u2019t attract big audiences, Mr. Mischler said, at least compared with Emmy winners of years past.Producers for the show said they have had to take special care to introduce a growing supply of shows and actors to viewers who might never have watched or heard of them.\u201cEach year, there are more nominations of shows and actors that an increasing number of viewers at home are unfamiliar with,\u201d Mr. Mischer said. \u201cWe will go on the air Sunday night, and how many of viewers across the country are familiar with \u2018Portlandia\u2019\u201d?Or, as Mr. Nathanson, the analyst put it: \u201cAmazon won an Emmy for \u2018Transparent\u2019 last year. Most people haven\u2019t seen it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fast Response to \u2018Brexit\u2019 News: A Pop-Up Paper Finds Success in Britain", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe morning after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Matt Kelly ducked into a coffee shop on a graffiti-lined street in the trendy East London neighborhood of Shoreditch.The clientele lining up for their lattes, normally silent and aloof, had been drawn into an animated discussion about the vote and its consequences. The mostly 20- and 30-somethings, some from a variety of technology start-ups clustered nearby, seemed united in their dismay over the results.The New European, published by Archant, is part of a broad experimentation taking place in print.As publishers large and small struggle at a time of rapid digital transition, print is a costly challenge for the industry. In recent years, many large publishers have opted to scale back or exit print altogether. Others have tried to bolster its allure by packaging print with digital offerings, or using print to showcase exclusive content.Some midsize publishers have focused on portfolios of smaller-scale titles that can be produced using the same infrastructure of presses, distribution and marketing networks. Those economies of scale can significantly reduce the marginal costs \u2014 and the risks \u2014 of developing new print products.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Archant had the size and distribution network \u2014 it is Britain\u2019s fifth-largest regional newspaper publisher by revenue and by circulation \u2014 and staff.So it decided to experiment with what it calls pop-up publishing.By keeping its start-up costs low and its ambitions modest, The New European has thus far managed to avoid the fate of some prominent failures in the British newspaper market.Both experiments, aimed at general-interest audiences, failed to capture enough demand from readers and advertisers to justify their publishers\u2019 relatively modest initial investments.By contrast, The New European was conceived as a niche publication. The publisher targeted the 48 percent of Britons who voted on June 23 to stay in the European Union \u2014 a potential audience that included about 16 million like-minded readers. Since it was meant to be short-lived, Archant avoided spending huge sums on market research or publicity campaigns.\u201cWe never set out to actually create a long-term brand,\u201d said Jeff Henry, Archant\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe way we structured it was to make money on a four-week run.\u201dThe first edition, priced at 2 pounds, or about $2.65, sold more than 40,000 copies in Britain and generated significant social media attention as readers rushed to share images of their papers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Its front pages promote meaty essays by well-known British intellectuals, politicians and business leaders. The articles themselves are mixed with cartoons, infographics and lighter features on European sports, travel and culture.Archant\u2019s business plan for the newspaper is driven principally by cover sales. In the last few weeks, it has extended its newsstand presence to Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and Switzerland.While the company hopes that broader reach will increase The New European\u2019s appeal to advertisers, the publication\u2019s open-ended future \u2014 Archant commits to only four issues at a time \u2014 has made it a difficult sell with some companies interested in longer campaigns.In late August, Archant also experimented with an online auction for some of its premium ad space. But while more than 60 British and European companies participated, the bidding failed to generate significant additional revenue, the company said.Industry watchers have nevertheless been encouraged by The New European\u2019s staying power.\u201cThe New European has absolutely shown a way forward for print publishers to sample whether a new product works,\u201d said Steve Dyson, a media consultant in Birmingham. Mr. Dyson said he could envision successful pop-up titles linked to popular political or social movements, or major sporting events like last month\u2019s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.Its fervently pro-independence stance found an audience of as many as 60,000 daily readers, although that number has since dwindled to around 15,000. Still, subscription and newsstand sales are enough to sustain a small dedicated staff as well as a website that, in addition to Scottish politics, offers sports, culture and international news.The success of The New European suggests that, for all the industry\u2019s evangelizing about the need to embrace a digital future, publishers have yet to exhaust the possibilities of print.\u201cIt\u2019s very counterintuitive, but print can sometimes be more agile than digital,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cIf you are a newspaper business and already have a distribution mechanism and a team of designers, it is actually a very simple process, whereas if you want to do a bespoke digital product, that is much more involved.\u201dMoreover, \u201cprint is a very visible format,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go around London with your laptop open and say, \u2018Look at me, I\u2019m reading The New European.\u2019\u201dSo far, The New European, like the rest of Britain\u2019s newspaper industry, has managed to ride a wave of demand for news about the so-called Brexit, which could fade in the coming months as the initial shock of the vote wears off.Negotiations over Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union could drag on for years, Mr. Tjaardstra noted, and to remain relevant to its niche audience, The New European would eventually need to broaden its coverage to include other topics of interest.That\u2019s if it continues at all.Mr. Kelly insists that Archant holds \u201cno sort of sentimental attachment\u201d to The New European as a brand.\u201cIt needs to earn its keep,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole point of pop-up is that you are prepared to kill the product.\u201dFollow Nicola Clark on Twitter @_nicolaclark.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fail Better, America, on this 9/11 Anniversary", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJoe Quinn is speaking. His brother Jimmy died on 9/11. The sun is shining from a clear sky, as it was that day. I am on the treadmill listening to music, watching images of the memorial service on the 15th anniversary of the attack on America. I pull the headphone plug out of my iPod and insert it in the treadmill jack.The voice is strong. After his brother\u2019s death Quinn was inspired to serve, doing tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He recalls the national unity that followed the loss of 2,977 lives in the 9/11 attacks, 2,753 of them at New York\u2019s twin towers, and notes the disunity that seems to have become the American condition since then.\u201cDon\u2019t believe it,\u201d Quinn says.No, don\u2019t believe it. Suspend all doubt and rancor. Of the 2,753 victims in New York, no identifying trace of 1,113 was ever found, according to the medical examiner\u2019s office. If it has been required of so many to make their peace with such absence, it behooves us all to lift our gazes beyond Yeats\u2019 \u201cweasels fighting in a hole.\u201dDon\u2019t believe in American disunity. Believe in the daily fashioning and refashioning of America, its constant reinvention and its high idealism, believe that, as Lincoln said, \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\u201d \u2014 and recall the onerous sacrifice over generations for that cause.There are always politicians who, as the German Social Democrat Kurt Schumacher noted in a speech to the Reichstag in Berlin in 1932, make \u201ca continuous appeal to the inner swine\u201d of people by \u201cceaselessly mobilizing human stupidity.\u201d Fear is the fertile soil in which such appeals propagate. The past year in the United States has demonstrated that. Resist fear. It is a distorting lens.Some people jumped from the burning towers. I see them still. The choices we face may seem difficult. They are not.Fifteen years. Time does not fly. Time eddies, accelerates, slows down and turns back on itself. A sob wells up in me as I watch Quinn.I am staring again, a couple of days after the attack, at a photograph of a pregnant woman\u2019s ultrasound tacked to a subway wall: \u201cLooking for the father of this child.\u201dThere are a lot of children aged 14-and-a-half who love but never saw their dads.The commemoration service proceeds through name after name that evoke every corner of the earth, every creed. People who tried to get out of the towers and people who went into the towers to help them. A New Yorker is born every day from the acceptance this city offers.Now I am back on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, near the East River, just before 9:00 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, having dropped my son at school. I am driving, stopped at a traffic light, and a guy on a motorbike leans over and says, \u201cHey, look, the World Trade Center is on fire.\u201dSmoke billows from the north tower. As I turn right toward Brooklyn Heights, where my family is in a temporary apartment having just moved from Berlin, I feel a boom and shudder as United Airlines Flight 175 from Boston crashes into the south tower at 9:03 a.m.It is my daughter Adele\u2019s fourth birthday (\u201cDad,\u201d she will say years later, \u201cmy birthday\u2019s famous but I\u2019m not.\u201d). It is my third week back in the United States. It is my first day in a new job as foreign editor.I board a No. 2 subway headed for Times Square. All bridges and tunnels into Manhattan are closed at 9:21 AM; this must have been the last train to run. A woman beside me is crying. I try to console her. She believes her brother is in one of the towers. I reach my desk in time to see the south tower collapse at 9:59 a.m.\u201cHijackers rammed jetliners into each of New York\u2019s World Trade Center towers yesterday, toppling both in a hellish storm of ash, glass, smoke and leaping victims, while a third jetliner crashed into the Pentagon in Virginia.\u201dI emerged late that evening onto Times Square. There was nobody. Not a soul. I started to walk beneath the neon signs.\u201cPut one foot in front of the other,\u201d says Quinn. Turn off your TV. Power down your phone, say hi to your neighbor, and introduce yourself to a stranger. Connect. Be the unity you seek.The fires burned for weeks. The acrid sweet smell below Houston Street persisted.

{"Headline": "In Red Sox\u2019 Magical Season, Rick Porcello Has Been the Hidden Ace", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExtra BasesRick Porcello would rather play down the magnitude of his comeback this season. If he is proud of his quick ascent from a losing pitcher to the majors\u2019 top winner, it is not for his resilience.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that \u2014 we\u2019re playing a game,\u201d said Porcello, suddenly an ace for the Boston Red Sox. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously pressure, especially when you don\u2019t perform well, and everything is magnified in a big city like this and a baseball town. But I think you could pretty much say that for our entire team. We all didn\u2019t have a very good year last year.\u201dLike his team \u2014 which finished last in the American League East in 2015 and now leads the division \u2014 Porcello has flipped his story. Last April, he signed a four-year, $82.5 million contract extension before he had thrown his first pitch for the Red Sox. Then he went 9-15 with a 4.92 earned run average.It was a discouraging start in Boston for Porcello, who had come from Detroit in a trade for Yoenis Cespedes. Really, though, Porcello was replacing Jon Lester, the rotation mainstay who had been dealt for Cespedes in July 2014. It seemed to be a major downgrade, at a high cost.Yet Porcello is 22-4 with a 3.11 earned run average and is leading the A.L. in strikeout-to-walk ratio (6.1 strikeouts for every walk) and walks and hits divided by innings pitched (0.991). Now he seems like a bargain.\u201cThings have come together for him in many ways this year,\u201d Manager John Farrell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve scored a high number of runs for him, he pitches with a tremendous amount of confidence, and our guys know that we\u2019re going to be in the ballgame every time he walks to the mound, so maybe we play a little bit more free when he\u2019s on the mound.\u201cHis walk rate is the lowest of his career, so he\u2019s not beating himself,\u201d Farrell said, \u201cand he\u2019s an extremely prepared and competitive guy.\u201d So his victory total, Farrell said, is no fluke. \u201cIt\u2019s not totally in his control, but everything that\u2019s in his control, he has certainly taken care of.\u201dFarrell said the biggest cause of Porcello\u2019s transformation came late last season, when he rediscovered his best pitch, the sinking two-seam fastball that tails away to his arm side. Through Friday, left-handers had hit just .214 this season off Porcello, who tried too hard last year to overpower hitters.\u201cHe kind of got four-seam heavy,\u201d said Carl Willis, Boston\u2019s pitching coach. \u201cTo that point in his career, he\u2019d been predominantly a sinkerball pitcher. He bought back into sinker first \u2014 not eliminating the four-seamer, but sinker first, to kind of train their eyesight with the fastball down. Then, keeping that four-seamer up in the zone and above the hands, it has a better effect.\u201dPorcello said a mechanical flaw had caused him to pitch differently. He was off-balance over the rubber, he said, which made him rush toward the hitter with his lower half. That led to a loss of command, which led to jams.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal, but when you get into a big situation with runners on base \u2014 you\u2019re in some trouble and you need to make some pitches \u2014 your natural inclination, your competitiveness, is to want to go harder and go faster,\u201d Porcello said.\u201cYou want to do all of that stuff, and it\u2019s not always the best way to go, especially a pitcher of my style \u2014 I rely on movement and location and inducing weak contact.\u201dPorcello is finishing his eighth season but is only 27 years old. It stood to reason that he could improve with the right mechanics and approach, and he had a feeling he could do this in spring training. He also had the patience to wait for it.\u201cI pretty much went out there in spring training, every outing, and got my brains beat in because I was working on my delivery, focusing on my fastball and locating,\u201d Porcello said. \u201cAnd it ended up paying off, because I got to the season and I felt really comfortable with my delivery and the things that I worked on in camp. It all carried over.\u201dNow, the Red Sox hope, it will carry deep into October.As the Cincinnati Reds staggered to 14 losses in their last 18 games before the All-Star break, Walt Jocketty predicted better days ahead.\u201cYou can see the progress we\u2019re making, and it\u2019s fun to see where that\u2019s going,\u201d said Jocketty, the Reds\u2019 president for baseball operations. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see us get better in the second half as we continue to grow and these guys get more experience and start getting healthy again.\u201dJocketty, who built a championship team in St. Louis and three playoff teams with the Reds, was right. After going 32-57 before the break, the Reds had gone 31-33 since then through Friday. But the improvement was not enough to prevent a dubious record.Cincinnati has received fairly reliable performance from starters Dan Straily, Brandon Finnegan and Anthony DeSclafani. But the Reds\u2019 staff set a major league record on Monday by giving up its 242nd home run of the season, the most any team has ever allowed.The previous record, by the Detroit Tigers of Felipe Lira, Greg Gohr and Omar Olivares, stood for 20 years. After the Reds broke it, their manager, Bryan Price, acknowledged the obvious.\u201cWe certainly have to improve the quality of the talent, and we have to get guys who can get the ball on the ground more often than we have this year,\u201d Price said, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of fly-ball pitchers. It hasn\u2019t worked.\u201dOne of the more impressive aspects of the San Francisco Giants\u2019 recent success has been Manager Bruce Bochy\u2019s bullpen usage. The Giants had a different saves leader each postseason \u2014 Brian Wilson in 2010, Sergio Romo in 2012 and Santiago Casilla in 2014 \u2014 upending the notion that only a designated closer could handle the rigors of the ninth.This season, though, Bochy has struggled to find the right pitcher for the job. As the Giants wobble through the final lap of the pennant race, their bullpen has repeatedly failed. When they lost on Monday at Dodger Stadium \u2014 with Derek Law, Javier Lopez and Hunter Strickland failing to protect a 1-0 lead \u2014 it was the fifth time in September that the Giants had lost a game despite leading after eight innings.That tied the major league record for losses in a calendar month while leading after eight innings. The others to do it were the 1936 Phillies, the 1974 Indians, the 1991 Mariners and the 1992 Mets. None came close to the playoffs.No pitcher this postseason may feel the precise kind of pressure Ralph Terry faced in the early 1960s. Twice in three years, he was on the mound in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7 of the World Series, with the winning run at the plate.Terry learned to handle nerves early. When he first took the mound in the majors \u2014 for the Yankees at Fenway Park in 1956 \u2014 he was so skittish he bounced his warm-up pitches and could not bear to look into the stands. The first hitter he faced, Billy Goodman, was batting over .300. It took the wisdom of Yogi Berra to calm Terry down.\u201cYogi\u2019s catching and he puts the pitch right in the middle of the plate \u2014 one finger means fastball,\u201d Terry said. \u201cI thought, \u2018O.K., Yogi knows what he\u2019s doing, let\u2019s split the heart of the plate, right down the middle.\u2019 So the pressure\u2019s off. I was never scared. I was never nervous in another game.\u201dTerry, 80, has written his life story, with John Wooley, due out next month and available through his Facebook page. They called it \u201cRight Down the Middle\u201d for the sense of peace that took over that very first game. Terry would need it in his most famous moments.The first was in Pittsburgh in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series. Terry had warmed up five times on the steep bullpen mound before collecting the last out of the eighth inning. But in the middle of the Forbes Field diamond, the mound felt different.\u201cThey had a big, flat mound,\u201d Terry said. \u201cMy front foot would come down early, and everything was high. If I\u2019d only warmed up once or twice, I\u2019d have been able to adjust. But I couldn\u2019t get the ball down.\u201dWith the score tied, 9-9, Terry threw a high fastball \u2014 \u201chigh cutter, really,\u201d he said \u2014 on his second pitch to Bill Mazeroski, the leadoff man in the bottom of the ninth. Mazeroski slammed it over the left-field wall to win the title.Two years later, in San Francisco, Terry found himself in a similar spot in Game 7. He allowed a leadoff single to Matty Alou with a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the ninth, meaning that every subsequent hitter had a chance to do what Mazeroski had done: win the World Series with a homer.Terry struck out Felipe Alou and Chuck Hiller. Then Willie Mays doubled to right, with a strong throw by Roger Maris keeping Matty Alou at third. That brought up Willie McCovey. Terry details the strategy of that encounter in the book, but the outcome is part of baseball lore: McCovey pulled a high, inside fastball into the glove of second baseman Bobby Richardson, and the Yankees won the title. Terry was named most valuable player.Remarkably, he said, he never flashed back to the Mazeroski moment while staring down the Giants two years later.\u201cAfter winning it, then all of a sudden it dawned on me: I\u2019d been carrying it around in the back of my mind,\u201d Terry said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, think if I had \u2014 I\u2019d have had to leave the country and change my name!\u2019 But I didn\u2019t think about it. You get in the game, you\u2019re confronted with problems right there. That commands your full attention.\u201dTerry would pitch five more seasons in the majors and make a subtle but important contribution to the Mets. At spring training in 1967, when Terry was trying to hang on as a knuckleballer, he played golf with Tug McGraw, a 22-year-old lefty who asked Terry if he knew a pitch he could use against right-handers. Terry suggested a screwball.\u201cI figured it would just be something to get a little off-speed or a little movement,\u201d Terry said. \u201cBut, man, he had it \u2014 just like Warren Spahn, right over the top. Looked just like Spahnie.\u201dTwo years later, in 1969, McGraw would use Terry\u2019s pitch to help lead the Mets to their first World Series title.Advertisement"}

I was hired to start a journalism program at the University of Hong Kong, my alma mater, and train a new generation of reporters to tell the stories of Hong Kong, China and Asia. It was a big and timely beat.Hong Kong was handed over to China after 156 years of British rule 10 months before I returned. In an ingenious stroke designed to reassure the international community and Hong Kong people, China\u2019s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, devised the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement: Beijing would assume sovereignty, but Hong Kong would keep its rule of law and capitalist ways for 50 years.The political rules were written to ensure that pro-Beijing forces would control the local legislature, known as LegCo, and Hong Kongers were willing to accept an imperfect system in the hope that a more accountable government would evolve. Many were heartened in 1998 when, in the first post-handover LegCo election, the Democratic Party won 13 of the 50 seats and became the dominant opposition.As I caught up with friends from my college days, I shared their excitement about the city\u2019s future. Many veteran activists cherished the idea that cosmopolitan Hong Kong, where people enjoyed freedom of expression, could inspire democratic change in mainland China.The election results portend greater political stasis and polarization in Hong Kong. The calls for independence, as unlikely and impractical as that is, reflect growing resentment for how Beijing and its local representatives have governed the city and intervened in its affairs. Discontent is especially high among the youth.But the LegCo insurgents and their supporters in the general public are increasingly fighting a lonely battle as powerful forces around the world are scrambling to appease Beijing. In recent decades, the fortunes of the mainland and Hong Kong have turned.China has become an indispensable player in world politics, and sometimes throws its weight around, as in the South China Sea. It is also building an alternative world order: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the One Belt, One Road plan to network more than 60 countries spanning vast stretches of Asia, the Middle East and Europe are China-led efforts to offer balance to the United States.Meanwhile, Hong Kong has lost some of its luster. Once the gateway to China, it now contends with Shanghai as the mainland\u2019s top financial center. Its container port is losing ground to Shenzhen. Its economy is more dependent on the mainland.Although it\u2019s the young rebels who caught international attention in recent years, many Hong Kongers believe the city needs to seek accommodation with Beijing. These include people who appreciate how China has lifted hundreds of millions from poverty, while modernizing the country. There are also many Hong Kongers who enjoy growing personal, professional and business ties with China. In a recent poll, more than half of Hong Kong residents felt somewhat or strongly against the calls for independence.The fact is that the fate of Hong Kong has always been linked to China, an integral part of its destiny because of history, culture and geography.Independence is not an option for Hong Kong.Like the rest of the world, Hong Kong people will have to cope with the reality of a rising and more powerful China.My students will have to be prepared to tell stories of Hong Kong that have become darker and more complicated. They will have to navigate the tangled relations among Hong Kong, mainland China and the rest of the world. As citizens, they will have to struggle with the fact that Hong Kong might just be a pawn in the big global game among corporate interests and the great powers.Yuen Ying Chan is an honorary professor at the University of Hong Kong and a distinguished fellow at Civic Exchange, an independent public policy think tank in Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Driscoll\u2019s Aims to Hook the Berry-Buying Shopper", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by7 PhotosWATSONVILLE, Calif. \u2014 On 40 acres at a farm near the central coast of California, new varieties of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries are being tested, each of them proprietary. No other company in the world grows berries exactly like these.Now the business behind it all \u2014 Driscoll\u2019s, the family-owned berry juggernaut \u2014 is hoping a new marketing campaign will make berry lovers care about that distinction.With new labels on its packages, a retooled website and an aggressive social media outreach that starts this week, the company is aiming to get Americans to understand what makes Driscoll\u2019s berries unique. Its strawberries have been bred for a uniform shape, for example, while Driscoll\u2019s raspberries are pinker and shinier, made to meet desires expressed by consumers.\u201cYou have to find a way to say this strawberry is different from that strawberry, which isn\u2019t necessarily an easy thing to do,\u201d said Soren Bjorn, executive vice president of Driscoll\u2019s. \u201cBut our strawberries actually are different \u2014 no one else grows the strawberries we grow.\u201dConsumers tend to think of fruit and vegetables as commodities, one cucumber interchangeable with another. They generally look for the best quality at the lowest price, not for particular brands.But as competition heats up for space on the perimeter of supermarkets, where fruits and vegetables are sold, grocery chains have asserted greater leverage over produce suppliers. That has left those suppliers looking for ways to stand out. Driscoll\u2019s is betting that once consumers know why its berries are distinctive they will demand them by name.\u201cIf Driscoll\u2019s can establish that, it will have real value in its brand,\u201d said Timothy Calkins, a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take some real investment and time.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first produce company to go this route. Consider Chiquita and bananas, or the Hass avocado, a \u201cbrand\u201d created by the trade association that represents growers of that variety of the fruit. And The Wonderful Company is behind Wonderful pistachios and Halos mandarin oranges.\u201cThey do it mainly to try to position themselves as premium in comparison to other brands,\u201d said Dick Spezzano, who led produce buying at Von\u2019s, a large supermarket chain, before starting Spezzano Consulting Service.The public will get an introduction to the people Driscoll\u2019s calls its Joy Makers \u2014 agronomists, breeders, sensory analysts, plant pathologists and entomologists who will explain how the company creates its berries. The company\u2019s YouTube channel will feature stories told by consumers about why berries make them happy. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram will be used to send traffic to the website and YouTube.Labels on the company\u2019s berries have been changed, too, to \u201cspeak\u201d more to consumers, using a scriptlike font for the Driscoll\u2019s name with the dot over the \u201ci\u201d colored to match the berries inside the box.The company would not disclose how much it is spending on the effort.Professor Calkins said a traditional national advertising campaign, including TV advertising, would cost $10 million to $20 million. Since margins on produce are razor-thin, most companies elect to spend the few dollars they have for marketing to woo buyers for supermarket chains rather than consumers.\u201cProduce growing is very fragmented, and nobody really has the critical mass to do that kind of campaign,\u201d Mr. Calkins said.Grocery executives with control over the increasingly valuable store perimeter have also begun to develop branding programs of their own, slapping their store\u2019s name on packaged fruits and vegetables. That means that a grocery brand of bagged lettuce is competing with Dole and Foxy, a brand owned by the Nunes Company, one of the country\u2019s largest vegetable growers.\u201cRetailers want to put their own name on the produce going into their stores, so that consumers think they can only get that celery they like at that store,\u201d said Matt Seeley, vice president of marketing at Nunes.Nunes put the Foxy label on its leafy greens and vegetables back in the 1980s and hired Brooke Shields as its spokeswoman.But the company has stepped back from promoting the Foxy brand to consumers, though it still does some billboard advertising and some digital and online marketing.\u201cOur industry has the greatest products in the world to sell, and yet it doesn\u2019t do the best job of leveraging that equity and talking straight to consumers,\u201d Mr. Seeley said. \u201cWe\u2019re like the water people \u2014 bottled water has become a commodity and so has a lot of fresh produce.\u201dThe one exception, he and Mr. Spezzano said, might be Driscoll\u2019s because the company grows strawberry varieties that are patented.Driscoll\u2019s strawberries trace their heritage to the late 1800s, when \u201cAunt Lou\u201d came home from a trip to Sweetbriar, Calif., carrying some plants that she swore produced the best strawberries she had ever eaten \u2014 or at least that\u2019s how J. Miles Reiter, chairman of Driscoll\u2019s and the great-nephew of Louise Reiter, recalls it.By 1944, family members and other parties formed a group to conduct private breeding of berry plants, which was an unusual move at the time, as most plant breeding was done in universities.In 1957, Driscoll\u2019s developed a strawberry plant it prosaically called Z5A, which produced attractive berries over a long season. It took the company more than a decade to develop a strawberry that had those qualities as well as great taste; the company called it Heidi.\u201cThe success of that berry influenced all of the breeding that came afterward,\u201d Mr. Reiter said.Driscoll\u2019s sold strawberries and a few raspberries until the late 1980s, when all three of the large tropical fruit companies \u2014 Dole, Del Monte and Chiquita, the original branded fruit companies \u2014 showed up to court the company. They were unsuccessful, but the Driscoll and Reiter families decided Driscoll\u2019s would become a year-round supplier of berries, meaning it would need to develop growers in Southern California, Florida and Mexico. And it would fully commit to raspberries, which had always been a smaller part of its business, and add blueberries and blackberries.\u201cBlueberries had always been something grown somewhere else, in Maine or Michigan, blackberries just tasted horrible and raspberries, well, they\u2019re fussy, hard-to-grow things,\u201d Mr. Reiter said.Those other berries meant the company would have to change its packaging as well, and so it became one of the first produce companies to embrace the clamshell, which has now become ubiquitous in the produce section.Driscoll\u2019s latest innovation is the addition of a microbiologist and horticultural scientist to its team. They work in a lab the company built this year in a former barn at Cassin Ranch, the site of its research and development operation as well as its field testing and breeding, and stocked with equipment that interprets the reams of information embedded in berry genomes.\u201cThe genetics are the reason that growers want to grow for us and not someone else,\u201d said Dave Sterry, senior vice president for global research and development at Driscoll\u2019s.The new team is doing things like mapping microclimates and figuring out how to use the aromatics of a berry to increase its sweetness, rather than increasing the sugar content of the berry itself.\u201cIt\u2019s very expensive for a strawberry plant to make more sugar, and that means you\u2019ll likely get fewer berries, which means less money for growers,\u201d said Jessica Gilbert, a molecular blueberry breeder at Driscoll\u2019s, examining traits like flavor, color and shape. \u201cSo we look for other ways to increase sweetness.\u201dThe team also works to develop disease resistance, reduce the need for water and ensure that berries are easy to harvest, seeking to eliminate thorns that can tear the hands of harvesters.The ability to study plant genomes is helping reduce the time it takes to breed new berry varieties, shortening what can be a seven-year cycle.Driscoll\u2019s breeding team is also developing more golden varieties of fruits like raspberries and strawberries, which are particularly popular in Asia.\u201cWill there be room for three or four brands of berries? No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Bjorn said. \u201cBut we only need room for one.\u201dAn earlier version of a timeline with this article misidentified the valley in which the Driscoll family started growing strawberries. It was the Pajaro Valley, not what is now known as Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Too Young for an App? Musical.ly Tests the Limits", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the folklore of the start-up world, few figures loom larger than the teenager. Teenagers see the future, set trends and spend money, or compel parents to spend it for them. Their behavior has become an obsession for entrepreneurs.What is striking about the app, though, is how many of its users appear to be even younger than that. Musical.ly hasn\u2019t just found the coveted teenage audience \u2014 it may have gone lower. And it points to a growing tension between younger users, technology companies, and the norms and laws that regulate them both.The app encourages a youthful audience in subtle and obvious ways. It lets users create short videos in which they can lip-sync, dance or goof around to popular songs, movie scenes and other audio sources, and then post the videos to an Instagram-style feed. Its featured feed includes stars popular with young listeners, including Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez, as well as lesser-known talent and social media personalities who have crossed over from services like Vine. And its tool for posting videos includes an entire category for songs from Disney films and TV shows.The app does not collect or show the age of its users, but some of its top-ranked users, whose posts routinely collect millions of likes, called hearts, appear from their videos and profile photos to be in grade school. Until recently, the app had a feature that suggested users to follow based on their location. In New York, that feature revealed a list composed largely not just of teenagers, but of children.\u201cI would say that Snapchat and Instagram, they skew a little bit young,\u201d he said. But with Musical.ly, \u201cyou\u2019re talking about first, second, third grade.\u201dThis puts Musical.ly in a strange position. Websites and online service operators that target users under 13 must meet federal requirements regarding the collection and sharing of personal information, which is defined broadly to include names, photos or videos, or persistent identifiers, such as user names. The restrictions are part of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule, often called Coppa, enacted by the Federal Trade Commission.Like most social networks that operate in America, Musical.ly says in its terms of service that it prohibits users under the age of 13. But the app doesn\u2019t collect age information about its users, a convention often used by networks that, at least anecdotally, are widely used by children. (Those networks that do ask for an age, like Facebook, tend to take the user\u2019s word for it.)According to a spokesman, the F.T.C., as a law enforcement agency, cannot comment publicly about individual companies. In an email, the agency said, \u201cWe support the development of robust, easy-to-use mechanisms companies that collect kids\u2019 personal information can use to seek the parents\u2019 consent.\u201dServices that are more openly marketed toward children often stringently adhere to Coppa\u2019s privacy rules. Vine Kids, for example, is a limited and largely passive service with no user names or video posting capabilities; similarly, YouTube Kids is essentially an app full of streaming children\u2019s programming, walled off from the rest of YouTube\u2019s ecosystem. In contrast, Musical.ly, like Snapchat or Instagram, is a full-functioning social network, popular with young people but not openly marketed to them.In short, children are using their smartphones much like the rest of us, whether or not they are comprehensively addressed by regulations or by broader cultural conventions.Alex Hofmann, president of Musical.ly, said the company tries to be mindful of its popularity with younger users. \u201cOne of the differences to other apps,\u201d he said, \u201cis that we don\u2019t only talk to the musers\u201d \u2014 the company\u2019s term for users \u2014 \u201cwe talk to the parents.\u201dUltimately, Mr. Hofmann said, he expects the app to diversify its audience. \u201cWe really see ourselves as a real social network, and as a network for different age groups,\u201d he said.For now, the company will have to navigate a peculiar if widely envied situation \u2014 capitalizing on its apparent popularity with an audience that it cannot fully acknowledge, watched over by wary but increasingly complicit parents.\u201cA year ago, there was basically nobody who was 40 years old on Snapchat,\u201d Mr. Vaynerchuk said. \u201cIf Musical.ly can hold on, they will age up.\u201dAsked whether an app attracting such a young audience might be a liability, he cast the matter of children using social apps less as an argument than as an inevitability. Children are using these apps, he said. And besides, in the beginning, it was the children who chose Musical.ly, not the other way around.What remains to be seen, he said, is whether any particular service is too much, too soon \u2014 something that is largely out of the company\u2019s hands.\u201cThere\u2019s no campaign, there\u2019s no money to be thrown at it, it will just become something you get used to,\u201d Mr. Vaynerchuk said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to address. This is about social norms.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Let\u2019s talk movies.To help us understand what to make of cinema\u2019s dirge, I turned to two of The Times\u2019s most thoughtful Hollywood watchers: Brooks Barnes, the neighborhood beat reporter based in Los Angeles, and A.O. Scott, one of our chief film critics.He cited evidence that suggests people may be shunning spontaneous treks to the theater in favor of plopping on the couch for a Netflix binge. This trend also coincides with a summer flush with big studio flops: \u201cSequelitis and an overload of event movies have been blamed for much of the carnage.\u201dBut, he argues, these trends don\u2019t spell doom for the medium.\u201cIt pops up almost every summer \u2014 \u2018nothing but blockbuster drivel!\u2019 he said in an email. \u201cFor more than 40 years, summer has been when studios roll out their lumbering parade floats aimed at the out-of-school set.\u201dIn the fall, the studios shift to more sophisticated fare, Mr. Barnes said. \u201cComing up are movies that will blow people away.\u201d\u201cThe death of cinema has been going on for most of a century,\u201d he said, \u201cand I expect it will last for at least another hundred years.\u201dHe wrote: \u201cWhatever the state of the industry or the prevailing winds in the culture and the digital economy, the integrity and specificity of cinema is a fact.\u201d\u201cThis is big, and I hope it sends a message across the country.\u201d Mr. Brown said at a signing ceremony in a Los Angeles park.The two measures require the most populous state to cut emissions from vehicles, factories and utilities to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.Supporters overcame strong opposition from the oil industry and many Republican lawmakers to pass the legislation.The New York Times Magazine sent Nico Young, a particularly talented student photographer, on an assignment to show what life is like at his high school.There is still gold to be found in the Sierra Nevada foothills.Mr. Espinoza, 40, said he was in Woods Creek, a waterway in Jamestown known for bearing gold, when he pushed aside a big rock and spotted it, pinched in the bedrock.\u201cIt was just amazing,\u201d he said of the 17.9-ounce nugget. \u201cI was waiting to wake up anytime.\u201dFrank Powell, a guide at the company, said California\u2019s 120-mile Mother Lode continues to provide a livelihood for many lone prospectors.It\u2019s grueling work, he said, requiring strenuous digging to get down to bedrock where the gold is hiding.For Mr. Espinoza, who has two daughters, prospecting has provided a precarious livelihood since he took it up almost four years ago.In a typical week, he makes between $200 and $300, he said. Some days he goes home empty-handed.\u201cThere are times when it drains you, not only economically, but physically and mentally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to get back up and try again after you failed so many times.\u201dAs word started to spread about his discovery, he said he has fielded three serious offers.Mr. Espinoza is not saying how much he wants for it, but the owner of Gold Prospecting Adventures suggested that with its historical significance it ought to fetch up to $70,000.Mr. Espinoza said he plans to wait for the right offer.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Snapchat, Known for Ephemera, Proves Its Staying Power With Videos", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Summer Olympics was something of a coming-out party for Snapchat, the mobile storytelling and messaging app.Nearly 35 million users in the United States watched highlights and stories from the Games on a dedicated channel in Discover, the area of Snapchat where media companies publish content, and on so-called Live Stories: videos and images from athletes and fans that Snapchat editors strung together to tell more intimate stories of life at the Games. Millions more watched athletes use Snapchat to talk about their events and joke with their teammates.\u201cNBC did an amazing job, but Snapchat filled the void when it came to creating mobile content for this major world event,\u201d said Aryeh Bourkoff, founder and chief executive of LionTree, a merchant bank that specializes in media and technology. \u201cThere was more Olympics footage and content on Snapchat than there was on NBC.\u201dSnapchat\u2019s effort helped expand viewership for the Olympics, which hit a 16-year prime-time ratings low on NBC. And it provided a glimpse of why the company could one day compete with television for audiences and advertising dollars.\u201cSnapchat is the company that will figure out how to move TV viewers to mobile,\u201d said Hemant Taneja, a Snapchat investor and managing director at the venture firm General Catalyst Partners. \u201cYouTube and others have worked hard to bring video to mobile devices, but Snapchat is the first to crack how users behave on mobile.\u201dSince introducing Discover in January 2015, Snapchat has become a web of highly edited video content \u2014 whether made by users, celebrities or media companies like Buzzfeed and CNN. That, in turn, has caught the attention of advertisers who want to reach Snapchat\u2019s growing audience, which, the company says, includes 41 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34. By comparison, the company says that the average television network in the United States reaches about 6 percent of the same demographic.Still, Snap is far from the only internet company trying to create the next-generation television experience.Facebook, with more than a billion daily active users, and its photo-sharing app Instagram, which has over 300 million, dwarf Snapchat. Both Facebook and Instagram have aggressively moved into video, and Facebook has even paid content makers, including The New York Times, to produce videos for its streaming product Facebook Live.Almost a third of internet users around the world visit YouTube, where billions of videos are viewed each day. YouTube has become one of the largest music distribution platforms in the world, thanks to the many music videos that users watch.All of these companies hope they can lure advertisers with their video platforms. Analysts at Jefferies estimate that Snap\u2019s revenue will grow to $1 billion next year from $350 million this year, based almost entirely on advertising.Traditional television still commands 72 percent of all video viewing time, and television advertising budgets have not shrunk significantly with the proliferation of online video, according to data from Activate, a consulting firm for tech and media companies.And this fall, broadcast networks including CBS, NBC, ABC and Fox negotiated their biggest rate increases in three years for prime-time ad space, according to a recent JPMorgan Chase advertising report.To reap financial rewards, internet companies must do more than persuade viewers to spend more time watching videos. They must show that their online ads can deliver the same value as television ads.Television ad dollars would \u201cflood into online\u201d if online ads could prove they were as effective as television ads, said Joe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group. For Mr. Marchese, that means the ad takes up the full screen, probably plays with the sound on and is viewed in its entirety.While advertisers do not go so far as to say that Snapchat video ads are equivalent to television ads, they note that watching content on Snapchat mimics, in some crucial ways, the experience of watching traditional television. Videos play with the sound on. They take up the full screen. They tell a narrative story. Users flip between them like they do TV channels.Snapchat says its ads and videos are more engaging because they are not \u201ccompeting with family photos and other things in a stream for the viewer\u2019s attention,\u201d said Imran Khan, Snap\u2019s chief strategy officer. Content makers and advertisers \u201chave complete, exclusive command of the user\u2019s smartphone,\u201d he said.Doug Neil, executive vice president for digital marketing at Universal Pictures, agrees. \u201cA full-screen experience that has the sound enabled grabs the user\u2019s attention much better,\u201d he said.In 2014, Universal ran the first video ad campaign on Snapchat, a trailer for the low-budget horror movie \u201cOuija,\u201d which ended up being the top performer at the box office on its opening weekend. The ad, like all content on Snapchat, disappeared. But exit polls indicated that a large percentage of people who went to see the movie that weekend had seen the ad. Mr. Neil said he found the results impressive for a single ad placement.Advertisers like Mr. Neil also like that Snapchat is beefing up its television-like lineup.Universal likes to run ads for the studio\u2019s films next to stories that have similar target audiences, Mr. Neil said. He added: \u201cWe understand the audience for known content like \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019 We\u2019re very interested in sponsoring those kinds of stories.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Without Shimon Peres? In Many Ways, His Dream Faded Long Ago", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The world awoke on Wednesday to an actuality it had never known before: a modern state of Israel without Shimon Peres. But in many respects Mr. Peres\u2019s Israel began to disappear long ago.During more than seven decades in public service, Mr. Peres, who died at 93 two weeks after suffering a stroke, accompanied Israel through startling transformations and constantly reinvented himself.So for many Israelis, trying to untangle and define Mr. Peres\u2019s legacy is like peering through a historical kaleidoscope where the lines between Israel\u2019s longtime ideological rivalries are at once sharp and distinct, then dissolve into a dazzling blur.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened a special cabinet meeting in memoriam on Wednesday with a minute of silence and the words, \u201cThis is the first day of the state of Israel without Shimon Peres.\u201dMr. Netanyahu, from the right-wing Likud Party, only reluctantly endorsed the principle of a Palestinian state in 2009, and continued to clash privately with Mr. Peres, a former political opponent from the Labor Party, in recent years. Still, Mr. Netanyahu issued a statement praising Mr. Peres, who served two stints as prime minister, as \u201ca man of peace,\u201d and said at the cabinet meeting: \u201cI admired him. I loved him.\u201dMr. Peres looked back with a mix of satisfaction and concern. In a 2013 interview on the occasion of his 90th birthday, he said the reality of Israel was \u201cboth different and greater than the dream.\u201d He marveled that Israel\u2019s population had grown to eight million people \u2014 but said he worried that they were becoming less grounded in moral values as they increasingly pursued material goals.After years of violent shocks and political erosion on both sides, some Israeli Jews trace the collapse of Mr. Peres\u2019s dream to the moment when a Palestinian suicide bomber ripped through a Passover Seder at the Park Hotel in the coastal city of Netanya.It was March 22, 2002, and 250 guests had just sat down for the holiday meal. Thirty were killed. Days later, Israeli tanks invaded the Palestinian cities of the West Bank in the fiercest military operation there since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 war.\u201cThey were offered a Palestinian state,\u201d Mr. Peres told CNN at the time, referring to subsequent rounds of failed peace talks between the sides. \u201cThey were offered practically all of the land. They were offered a position in Jerusalem. Why fight? Why kill? Why incite?\u201dThis was clear vindication if ever there was any for those on the other side of Israel\u2019s political spectrum who had opposed the accords.\u201cAt the time they were signed, they enjoyed the support of the majority of Israel \u2014 now, most people see them as a failure,\u201d said Moshe Arens, a contemporary of Mr. Peres and a former defense and foreign minister from the Likud Party. \u201cIf they had been a success I would have had to say I was wrong.\u201dSpeaking as Mr. Peres lay mostly unconscious in the hospital after his stroke, Mr. Arens described him as \u201can inveterate optimist,\u201d while articulating the apparent policy void that he was leaving behind.\u201cIt is very difficult for us to make projections about the future in the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Arens said. \u201cI say proceed slowly. Everyone wants to know what\u2019s the end game. I don\u2019t know what it will be.\u201dHaim Cohen, a longtime friend of Mr. Peres\u2019s, said on Israel Radio that recently, \u201cEvery meeting was like listening to his last will and testament.\u201d\u201cOne of the main messages he tried to leave for us,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, \u201cwas his deep concern for the unity of the nation.\u201dDespite Mr. Peres\u2019s own late-in-life attempts at unity among Israelis, perhaps it is only natural in a fractious country that his legacy is viewed through a prism of old divides.Many Arabs still denounce him as a \u201ccriminal\u201d for his early support of settlement-building, and as a warmonger because of his role in building Israel\u2019s weapons arsenals and campaigns that led to civilian deaths.Many Israelis and Jews from around the world remembered him in fatherly and grandfatherly terms \u2014 a veiled or not-so-veiled contrast with the current Israeli leadership.Isaac Herzog, the current Labor leader and parliamentary opposition chief, said of Mr. Peres, \u201cI don\u2019t think his vision is gone,\u201d noting that the aspiration for a two-state solution with the Palestinians has been accepted by most mainstream Israeli political figures, though its prospects have ebbed lately.A new generation of Labor Party legislators is grasping at what is left. \u201cPeace has become a word that people sneer at the mention of,\u201d said one of them, Merav Michaeli. \u201cIt is our responsibility to gain back the people\u2019s trust.\u201d Another, Stav Shaffir, said that Mr. Peres and his cohort \u201calways thought way ahead\u201d and worked in a stately fashion \u201cto make every Israeli feel Israeli.\u201d\u201cThe mission of my generation is to be that leadership,\u201d she said.Yet Micah Goodman, an American-Israeli philosopher, said the problem of the Israeli left was a dearth not of leadership, but of ideas. The founding ideology of Israel\u2019s Labor movement, socialism, crumbled and morphed into the pursuit of peace. The vision of a new Middle East was a \u201cmessianic\u201d one, Mr. Goodman said in an interview, and Mr. Peres was its prophet.As that option receded, he said, Mr. Peres increasingly turned his attention to the boundless possibilities of technology and science and the pull of a secular, humanistic type of Judaism.A few months ago, Mr. Peres reached out to Mr. Goodman to discuss Mr. Goodman\u2019s Hebrew best-seller, \u201cThe Secrets of the Guide for the Perplexed,\u201d about Moses Maimonides, the medieval Jewish sage also known as Rambam.\u201cI find myself in his apartment in Tel Aviv,\u201d Mr. Goodman recalled. \u201cHe is wearing his jeans. He wants to understand Maimonides.\u201cHe told me that before he goes to sleep he thinks to himself, \u2018Did I bring more good to the world today, or bad?\u2019 He kept a balance sheet. He was like a 16-year-old idealist. At 93.\u201dPeter Baker and Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Three Galaxy players sustained injuries in that match, and days later a fourth, midfielder Nigel de Jong, was dealt to a club in Turkey. Donovan said that while he was speaking with friends on the Galaxy staff that week, they had \u201cjokingly asked if I was ready to make a return to the field.\u201dSeveral days of discussions with friends and family, as well as a frank discussion with Galaxy Coach Bruce Arena, who has known and coached Donovan for nearly two decades, persuaded him to try to return.Of his talks with Arena, Donovan said, \u201cWe both agreed that if this was going to happen, the expectations would be minimal, and he would use me in situations that made sense for the team.\u201dEven as a late-game substitute, he could help the Galaxy. Los Angeles is in third place in the Western Conference, but it is almost assured of a playoff berth in a year without a truly dominant team. (The Eastern Conference leader, New York City F.C., has the same point total as the Galaxy.)He also returns as the father of a 8-month-old son, another factor in his decision.While the chance to help the Galaxy was a big part of Donovan\u2019s motivation, he said, \u201cthe opportunity to have my son Talon on the field with me after a game was a feeling that I would never be able to replicate.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some See Anti-Women Backlash in Ouster of Brazil\u2019s President", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 At one heated moment in the impeachment trial of Dilma Rousseff, a powerful senator pushing for her ouster decided that some of his outspoken female colleagues in the chamber needed scolding.\u201cCalm down, girls,\u201d the senator, C\u00e1ssio Cunha Lima, part of a political dynasty from northeastern Brazil, told Senators Vanessa Grazziotin and Gleisi Hoffmann, both supporters of Ms. Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president. His remark drew sharp rebukes from the two women.\u201cMen believe they are the owners of this space, as if we\u2019re just here by chance,\u201d said Ms. Grazziotin, 55, a prominent leftist senator from Amazonas State.Throughout the impeachment proceedings, female allies of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s in Congress argued that the way her impeachment was carried out reflected a political establishment in which women were still supposed to serve as accessories to powerful men. A new wave of vitriolic positioning against female politicians like Ms. Rousseff is fueling these concerns.During the impeachment trial, for instance, Jaufran Siqueira, a socially conservative politician in the northeastern city of Natal, seized on a new idea for gaining votes.\u201cI can\u2019t deny that I oppose the feminist movement,\u201d said Mr. Siqueira, a real estate broker who emerged into the national spotlight with his campaign. \u201cBut it\u2019s absurd to claim I\u2019m going to set fire to women.\u201d He said the photo had been merely \u201ca joke.\u201dDespite the increasing tensions, female political leaders in Brazil remain far from unanimous on whether Ms. Rousseff was driven from office because of her gender.\u201cMy understanding is that Dilma\u2019s budget maneuvers were illegal,\u201d said Ms. Silva, 58, an environmentalist, who repeatedly clashed with Ms. Rousseff when both were ministers in the cabinet of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that women won\u2019t play a crucial role in Brazilian politics after Dilma\u2019s impeachment,\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cOf course we will. We have too much momentum now to stop us.\u201dAs campaigning intensifies for municipal elections, other leaders at different points on Brazil\u2019s ideological spectrum echoed such views.\u201cI don\u2019t see this moment as something that disappoints the aspirations of Brazilian women,\u201d said Teresa Surita, a supporter of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster, who is running for re-election as the mayor of Boa Vista, a city in the Brazilian Amazon.\u201cI have to be aware of the need for support from the federal government, regardless of who is in power,\u201d she said.Still, others contend that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster revealed the ugly workings of Brazil\u2019s male-dominated political scene. As large protests flare against Mr. Temer\u2019s administration, especially on the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city, thousands of women are voicing opposition to the new government.\u201cTemer took out Dilma because a man doesn\u2019t like to answer to a woman, and as president, she was the one telling them what to do,\u201d said Rayra Lima de Ara\u00fajo, 14, a high school student who attended the antigovernment protests on Sunday with her mother, Maria da Cruz Lima, 43, an unemployed nurse.\u201cI\u2019ve always been described as a hard-charging woman in the midst of delicate men,\u201d she said. \u201cI never saw a man accused of being hard-charging, and we know that they are.\u201dBut even Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, once one of Latin America\u2019s most powerful political parties, is grappling with an internal debate over sexism as it tries to reinvent itself.M\u00edriam Leit\u00e3o, an economic historian and one of Brazil\u2019s most influential columnists, said the Workers\u2019 Party was using the debate over women in politics to try to discredit the impeachment process because it cost the party the presidency it had held for more than 13 years.\u201cDilma didn\u2019t fall because she is a woman,\u201d Ms. Leit\u00e3o wrote in her column in the newspaper O Globo. \u201cShe produced a surge in inflation, a recession of historical significance, and lost her job.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a high school student who attended antigovernment protests in S\u00e3o Paulo on Sunday. She is Rayra Lima de Ara\u00fajo, not Rayna. The article also misidentified the Brazilian legislative body that has 513 members, 10 percent of whom are women.

But this year has been especially nightmarish for C.R.s, as they call themselves.\u201cThey tend to be center-right traditional Republican conservatives, and so you know there is a little bit of a mismatch there,\u201d said Karl Rove, the architect of George W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaigns.Mr. Trump was never interested.\u201cI didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said with a shrug when asked in an interview if he had ever considered joining the club. \u201cI was very much into the world of real estate.\u201dAt Mr. Trump\u2019s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, Grayson Sessa, the vice president of the school\u2019s College Republicans, said he was dismayed by the nominee\u2019s name-calling and hoped the party\u2019s values could withstand him. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great feeling,\u201d he said.But Karis Lockhart, the chairwoman of the University of Central Florida chapter, whose parents met as College Republicans, said that those who could not bring themselves to vote for Mr. Trump were being overly sensitive.She argued that Mr. Trump would bring in new voters who would help in other races on the ballot. \u201cHe\u2019s dumbing it down for people who don\u2019t want the numbers and statistics,\u201d she said approvingly.\u201cMy job is to bring everybody back on board to the Republican Party, whether or not they love Trump,\u201d said Cade Marsh, the College Republicans\u2019 state chairman in Florida, who wears \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d shirts and wants to run for president in 2032.

That\u2019s a pretty hard and fast rule. How many puzzles qualify as \u201cenough\u201d is variable, but this is a skill set that only improves with practice.My point is, if I can do it, you can. Sure, I had professional panic and the fear of failing on a national readership level to motivate me, but really, all it takes is getting started. By solving every puzzle he ran, every day, week after week, my skills started to improve. It didn\u2019t happen overnight (except for the acrostics, because I had a deadline coming up), but I am now at the point in my solving skills development where I can almost readily recognize my mortal solving enemies: rebuses and what I call anti-rebuses (a theme where a rebus element is hidden under a black square). For the longest time, I tanked when solving puzzles like these, because I just couldn\u2019t predict where those elements would be in a puzzle. It was like a form of theme blindness.I bring this up because I happen to be exceptionally proud of myself today. Joanne Sullivan offers us a tricky anti-rebus, and I solved it. All by myself.And, with enough practice, you can do that, too.The black squares are typically the stagehands in a crossword puzzle, quietly serving to separate their flashier sisters, the entries. Today, however, there are places in Ms. Sullivan\u2019s crossword where we will need to announce their presence as part of the entries. It\u2019s possible that they\u2019ve unionized.Anyway, this theme was a labor of love between Ms. Sullivan and the editors Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano, as you will read in her notes below. The theme as presented is that the word BLACK is represented by a black square and is necessary to either begin or finish the entry. For example, at 17A, the clue \u201cJet\u201d is answered by the entry COAL [BLACK]. Similarly, at 18A, the clue \u201cMontana Indians\u201d is answered by the entry [BLACK] FEET and at 21D, the clue \u201cItalian Fascist\u201d is answered by the entry [BLACK] SHIRT.That gives us 18 theme entries altogether, which is an astounding amount of theme material, even if the grid word count was bumped up to 82 words to do it.\u2022 30A: Many thanks to The Boy for the help on remembering the name of YOSHI, the \u201cNintendo dinosaur.\u201d\u2022 35A: No, this clue is not talking about getting water in your EARs. \u201cWhere waves come in?\u201d refers to sound waves.\u2022 54A: This one made me giggle, because all I could imagine was a single [BLACK] BEAN in a bowl of chili or a burrito. I wanted it to be [BLACK] BEANS.\u2022 58A: Do people really list their TYPE on dating sites? As in, \u201cI like tall blondes\u201d? Please report back if you have information on this phenomenon.\u2022 68A and 61D: I loved the placement here. 61D is ATE (food going down) and 68A is EGEST (food coming ... well, you know).\u2022 32D: This was probably my favorite song in 1990. \u201c[BLACK] VELVET\u201d was a tribute to Elvis Presley.Here\u2019s a brainteaser: How did Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano increase this puzzle\u2019s total word count (i.e., the number of across and down answers) from 74 to 82 without changing any letters or the pattern of black and white squares?There are several ways to format this puzzle. Will and Joel debated how to present it and chose a different approach than the one I submitted.This grid\u2019s edited version is numbered as though all the black squares are regular blocks. The version I submitted treated the five black squares used in the theme answers as white rebus squares that were colored black to complete the theme words. (Rebus squares have pictures or multiple letters in them.)Instead of treating COAL and FEET as two words (17 and 18-Across), I combined them into one long 17-Across answer reading COAL BLACK FEET (as in a \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d Before & After style answer). I used wacky clues for the combined answers. (Result of firewalking? = COALBLACKFEET). I\u2019d also considered using two straightforward clues separated by a slash for the combined theme answers.I treated the five black theme squares as rebuses hiding in plain sight. Another option would have been keeping them white and letting solvers color them black (or squeeze in the word \u201cBLACK\u201d in tiny letters).Since my version treated COALBLACKFEET as one answer, the number 18 wasn\u2019t in the square with the F in FEET but was essentially hidden in the black rebus square between COAL and FEET. My clue for BLACKSHIRT was numbered 18-Down instead of 21-Down.Since I regarded the black theme squares as letter squares and not black blocks, I avoided putting them in locations where white squares would have been invalid (e.g. between 1 and 5-Across). That constraint made constructing the puzzle more challenging.Have you joined us yet to solve the Thursday Crosswords on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page? Why not?

{"Headline": "Cocktails in Berlin", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayJeffrey Wechsler returns with a theme that also combines these two things in a very funny way and with considerably fewer Nazis.The name of the game today is knowing how to count in different languages. Mr. Wechsler has taken five common, two-word phrases and turned the first word of each phrase into a sound-alike French, Spanish or German number.There is the repetition of the number three in the theme, but they\u2019re different languages and they\u2019re funny so, on balance, I was willing to give it a pass. Finally, I noticed a few \u201cescaped\u201d foreign numbers in Mr. Wechsler\u2019s grid, but he explains those below.Here is the theme set (or SEPT), with the original phrases:17A: SEPT (7 in French) PIECES = SET PIECES23A: DREI (3 in German) MARTINIS = DRY MARTINIS37A: SECHS (6 in German) THERAPISTS = SEX THERAPISTS46A: TRES (3 in Spanish) ELEMENTS = TRACE ELEMENTS57A: HUIT (8 in French) FIELDS = WHEAT FIELDS\u2022 62A: Trick question! \u201cWho has won more Olympic medals than Michael Phelps?\u201d is a great way to clue NO ONE.\u2022 1D: In this clue, the \u201c\u2018No way\u2019 man\u201d is JOS\u00c9, as in \u201cNo way, Jos\u00e9!\u201d\u2022 8D: In the clue \u201cSole end?\u201d we\u2019re looking for what\u2019s at the end of the sole of the foot, and, at least on mine, the answer is TOE.\u2022 13D: D.A.D.T. stands for \u201cDon\u2019t ASK, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d the policy on military service by LGBTQ people instituted in 1994 and lasting until 2011.\u2022 45D: Beer STEINS are \u201cPorter supporters?\u201d, Porters being a type of dark beer.The seed entry for this puzzle theme was DREI MARTINIS. I simply noticed the homophonic relationship of the word DRY to the German DREI, and took it from there. I\u2019m glad that I could find enough foreign language numbers that really are extremely close (and occasionally, just about perfect) homophones to English words. For example, the French HUIT provides the initial H sound that most dictionaries indicate should be voiced for words starting with WH. (In my Webster\u2019s, the primary pronunciation of \u201cwheat\u201d starts with a HW sound, and the secondary pronunciation starts with just the W sound.)I\u2019m anticipating some commentary on the inclusion of the foreign language numbers DIECI (at 6-Down) and EIN (at 36-Across) in the grid. There seems to exist a certain notion of grid purity, suggesting that words relating to the theme (or even letter combinations) should be purged entirely from the fill. Otherwise, a degree of \u201cinelegance\u201d intrudes. I can understand that to some extent, but I don\u2019t see it as compelling in all cases. In fact, I mentioned to Will that I could probably get rid of DIECI if necessary. But this was apparently not a problem, and I\u2019m happy to be on the same side with Will on this. As for \u201cEIN Heldenleben,\u201d the translation is \u201cA Hero\u2019s Life\u201d, so one can argue that this EIN is not a number, but an indefinite article.And finally, I was delighted that my clue for 1-Across was accepted!

In years past, most voters did not actually start paying close attention to the presidential campaign until after Labor Day. This is when campaigns had to get serious in their appeals to voters and solidify their ground game ahead of Election Day.In his book \u201cThe Vanishing Voter,\u201d Thomas Patterson, a Harvard political scientist, writes that Labor Day speeches \u201conce served as coming-out parties\u201d for party nominees. In 1936, in the doldrums of the Great Depression, roughly half a million people in Detroit turned out to see President Franklin Delano Roosevelt kick off his re-election campaign. But in the modern presidential campaign, Mr. Patterson writes, Labor Day \u201cmight as well be Groundhog Day.\u201dWhile it may seem that many voters are checked out of the grueling campaign process, this year\u2019s electorate has actually been more engaged than in many recent campaigns. It\u2019s not hard to figure out why more people started paying attention to this election earlier than they did in 2012 \u2014 just look to the glowing orange beacon on your TV screen.\u201cThe public got more involved earlier this year than in the past, and I think you can point to one person as the reason: Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Patterson said in an interview.He added that Mr. Trump has a \u201cwater-cooler effect\u201d \u2014 people like to talk about him \u2014 which could also account for the early voter engagement.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing quite like people talking as an indicator of their engagement in the campaign,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. He added, \u201cNow, whether he gets them thinking is a different thing. But he does get them talking.\u201dThe water-cooler effect is apparent online as well, according to CrowdTangle, a tool that tracks social media usage. The company compared Facebook users\u2019 engagement in the 2012 election between March and September with engagement numbers for the same period of time in 2016. Its findings: the number of public posts that mentioned \u201cHillary\u201d or \u201cTrump\u201d was roughly the same as the number of posts that mentioned \u201cObama\u201d or \u201cRomney\u201d in 2012. But the number of interactions \u2014 that is, the number of likes, shares and comments generated by users \u2014 quadrupled between 2012 and 2016, from 90 million to 361 million. Facebook\u2019s daily active users roughly doubled in that time, but still, that makes it double the users, quadruple the interaction.\u201cIn my opinion, those are pretty amazing numbers,\u201d Brandon Silverman, the co-founder and chief executive of CrowdTangle, said in an email. He added that this election cycle \u201cis generating a massive amount of interest and passion in the election, even this early on, and an extraordinary amount of it is being expressed on Facebook every day.\u201dThat is the irony of this year\u2019s election: Voters are simultaneously more interested in, and more exhausted with, the campaign than in past election years.So if Labor Day doesn\u2019t really matter anymore, when\u2019s the new starting point for when the election kicks into high gear? Mr. Patterson said the first presidential debate between the two party nominees could act as the new starting gun.\u201cThe conditions are such that the debates could make more of a difference than they normally do,\u201d he said.While the debates in a \u201cnormal\u201d election year mainly serve to solidify both sides\u2019 support for their candidate, this year\u2019s debates could be a potentially huge reckoning for Mr. Trump, who may have gotten off a few zingers during the primary debates, but who has nowhere near the policy fluency that Mrs. Clinton does. That could stand out to voters who haven\u2019t yet made up their minds.So, undecided voters \u2014 yes, all four of you \u2014 vacation is over. It\u2019s time for you to start paying attention to every tweet, sound bite and policy proposal that populate your TV, smartphone and computer screen. Come on in, the sludge is fine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s a Wrap: Covering the Toronto Film Festival", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCovering the Toronto International Film Festival means being on your toes and flexible. I get a short amount of time with actors and directors for whom others are also clamoring, so I aim to make the brief moments count.During a typical TIFF day, I might be scarfing down a granola bar on the way to a hotel-room interview and find myself sharing an elevator with Michael Fassbender (as happened last weekend). In many other elevators over the years at the festival, I\u2019ve been the shabby, backpack-toting guest sharing rides with celebs dressed for the red carpet (Keira Knightley, Reese Witherspoon and Zac Efron among them).Some of my interviews may be across town from one another. My preferred form of TIFF travel is Bike Share Toronto, which enables me to circumnavigate sticky traffic situations, and also sometimes gets me called out by my peers when they see me zipping past wearing a sports jacket on the way to a fancy film-industry dinner.Regardless of the number of interviews and screenings I\u2019ve logged, parties are always on the agenda. One of the more low-key (and enjoyable) ones is thrown by the South by Southwest film festival organizers. This year it drew the director Jim Jarmusch, whose signature white hair stood out from the crowd while the man himself managed to fit right in.Of course, TIFF party talk always leads to TIFF film buzz. What are you watching? What are you liking? Some starrier fare \u2014 like \u201cLa La Land,\u201d \u201cArrival\u201d and \u201cLion\u201d \u2014 has been plenty chattered about this time, but one of the films garnering the most praise is not celebrity-driven: the Barry Jenkins film \u201cMoonlight.\u201d Every party I\u2019ve attended, people have had positive things to say about it.TIFF is also an interesting place to contrast how the press reacts to a movie with how the public does. At press screenings, even for comedies, the reaction tends to be a stony silence. At the Toronto screening of the animated movie \u201cSing,\u201d the audience clapped along with songs and cheered at the end of performances.Covering a festival like TIFF, where hundreds of films and famous people sweep through an already bustling Canadian city and splash a bit of Hollywood on the streets, is a wild and sometimes strange ride.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bangladeshi Traffic Jam That Never Ends", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf all the dysfunctions that plague the world\u2019s megacities, none may be more pernicious than bad (really, really bad) traffic. Sitting still in Dhaka, where bad design takes on epic proportions.I WAS IN DHAKA, which is to say I was stuck in traffic. The proposition might more accurately be phrased the other way around: I was stuck in traffic, therefore I was in Dhaka. If you spend some time in Bangladesh\u2019s capital, you begin to look anew at the word \u201ctraffic,\u201d and to revise your definition. In other cities, there are vehicles and pedestrians on the roads; occasionally, the roads get clogged, and progress is impeded. The situation in Dhaka is different. Dhaka\u2019s traffic is traffic in extremis, a state of chaos so pervasive and permanent that it has become the city\u2019s organizing principle. It\u2019s the weather of the city, a storm that never lets up.Dhakaites will tell you that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t understand traffic, that the worst traffic jam in Mumbai or Cairo or Los Angeles is equivalent to a good day for Dhaka\u2019s drivers. Experts agree. In the 2016 Global Liveability Survey, the quality of life report issued annually by the Economist Intelligence Unit, Dhaka ranked 137th out of 140 cities, edging out only Lagos, Tripoli and war-torn Damascus; its infrastructure rating was the worst of any city in the survey. Like other megacities of the developing world, Dhaka is both a boomtown and a necropolis, with a thriving real-estate market, a growing middle class and a lively cultural and intellectual life that is offset by rampant misery: poverty, pollution, disease, political corruption, extremist violence and terror attacks. But it is traffic that has sealed Dhaka\u2019s reputation among academics and development specialists as the great symbol of 21st-century urban dysfunction, the world\u2019s most broken city. It has made Dhaka a surreal place, a town that is both frenetic and paralyzed, and has altered the rhythms of daily life for its 17.5 million-plus residents. Not long ago, the Dhaka-based Daily Star newspaper published an article titled \u201c5 Things to Do While Stuck in Traffic.\u201d Suggested activities included \u201ccatching up with friends,\u201d reading and journaling.The first chapter of my own Dhaka journal begins in March of last year, on a highway that runs south from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport into the center of town. If you do a web search for this stretch of road, you may come across a Facebook page titled \u201cHighway to Hell, Airport Road.\u201d Photographs posted online reveal the nature of the hell, aerial shots capturing a scrum of automobiles strewn at odd angles across eight lanes of road. It looks like a Matchbox set that has been scattered by an angry toddler: the morning commute as a cosmic temper tantrum.These images had me prepared for the worst. Yet on my flight to Dhaka I was told that the traffic in the city would be unusually light. For weeks, Bangladesh had been gripped by a hartal, a nationwide general strike and \u201ctransportation blockade.\u201d The hartal, called by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, was an effort to pressure Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina into holding new elections. The strike had disrupted everyday life in the capital, with street demonstrations and sporadic violence causing Dhaka\u2019s denizens to curb their normal routines. It had accomplished the seemingly impossible, breaking the logjam on Dhaka\u2019s streets. A Bangladeshi on my flight explained the situation. \u201cIn Dhaka, you have either horrible traffic or really horrible traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the hartal, there will be almost no traffic. Traffic will be O.K.\u201dHorrible traffic, really horrible traffic, almost no traffic, O.K. traffic \u2014 it takes just a few minutes in Dhaka to realize that these are not scientific terms. When my plane touched down I caught a taxi, which exited the airport into a roundabout before making its way onto the infamous highway. There, unmistakably, was a traffic jam: cars and trucks, as far the eye could see, stacked up in a configuration that bore no clear relationship to the lanes painted on the blacktop. My cab nosed into the convoy. Whereupon a crawl commenced.The traffic rolled south for 20 seconds. The traffic stopped. My cab idled for a couple of minutes at a dead standstill. Then, for mysterious reasons, it crept forward again. Occasionally, the traffic would flow unimpeded for a minute or so, reaching a clip of perhaps 15 miles per hour. But soon we\u2019d lurch to a halt again. It was the kind of stop-and-go routine I\u2019d experienced on American interstates, the \u201cbumper-to-bumper\u201d conditions that traffic reporters describe on news radio, shouting something about a jackknifed tractor-trailer over thumping helicopter rotors. In this case, though, the problem was not an accident. The problem was Dhaka.It was hot and I was jet-lagged. I dozed off. When I snapped awake, about an hour later, the congestion had thickened and the scenery had turned frantic. We were in the heart of the city now, penned in by surging pedestrians and hundreds of vehicles competing for space on a wide road called Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue. There were passenger cars and puttering three-wheeled auto-\u00adrickshaws. There were buses so vacuum-packed with passengers that many riders were forced onto the exterior, clinging to open doorways and crouched on rooftop luggage racks. There were cargo tricycles, known locally as \u201cvans,\u201d heading to markets bearing heaping payloads of bamboo, watermelons, metal pipes, eggs, live animals. And, of course, there were the iconic Dhaka passenger vehicles, bicycle rickshaws. Officially, rickshaws are banned on major thoroughfares like Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, but there they were, in vast phalanxes, their bicycle bells pealing above the roar of the traffic jam.Eventually, my taxi reached a roundabout, and we turned left onto another thoroughfare, the Panthapath Tejgaon Link Road. There, the cabdriver executed a U-turn and a tricky sequence of maneuvers to win a place in a feeder lane that permitted entrance to the driveway of my hotel. The lane was empty: our final hundred yards of terrain to travel, and our first stretch of open road. The distance from airport to hotel was eight and a half miles. The trip had taken two and a half hours. We wheeled into the hotel\u2019s driveway and the cabby spun around to offer his verdict. \u201cSome traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cNot so bad.\u201d\u201cBANGLADESH IS NOT so much a nation as a condition of distress,\u201d wrote the journalist William Langewiesche in 2000. It sounds like an overstatement, but to behold the gridlocked streets of Dhaka is to see distress in action, or rather, in inaction. The stalled traffic in the capital city is symptomatic of the nation\u2019s broader woes, in particular population growth, which is moderate by the standards of the developing world, but disastrous given the size of Bangladesh.Fundamentally, traffic is an issue of density: It\u2019s what happens when too many people try to squeeze through too small a space. Bangladesh is the 12th most densely settled nation on earth, but with an estimated 160 million citizens it is by far the most populous, and the poorest, of the countries at the top of the list. To put the matter in different terms: The landmass of Bangladesh is one-118th the size of Russia, but its population exceeds Russia\u2019s by more than 25 million.Bangladesh\u2019s density problem is magnified in Dhaka, in part because, practically speaking, Dhaka is Bangladesh. Nearly all of the country\u2019s government, business, health care and educational institutions, and a large percentage of its jobs, are concentrated in Dhaka. Each year, 400,000 new residents pour into the capital, a mass migration that has made Dhaka the world\u2019s most densely settled megacity, and one of the fastest growing.The town that those millions inhabit almost completely lacks the basic infrastructure and rule of law that make big cities navigable. There are just 60 traffic lights in Dhaka, and they are more or less ornamental; few drivers heed them. The main problem with Dhaka\u2019s anarchic streets, though, is that there aren\u2019t enough. The Daily Star has reported that just 7 percent of Dhaka is covered by roads. (In places like Paris and Barcelona, models of 19th-century urban planning, the number is around 30 percent.) Footpaths are also an issue. There are too few sidewalks in Dhaka, and those that exist are often impassable, occupied by vendors and masses of poor citizens who make their homes in curbside shanties.The usual solution to congestion in cities like Dhaka is to move commuters under the streets rather than over them. But Dhaka has no subway, and no concrete plans to build one. The problem is compounded by the growing status-symbol appeal of private transport: a vogue for automobiles among Dhaka\u2019s middle classes that is adding tens of thousands of new vehicles to the city\u2019s streets every year.By the government\u2019s own estimate, Dhaka\u2019s traffic jams eat up 3.2 million working hours each day and drain billions of dollars from the city\u2019s economy annually. Traffic takes another kind of toll on the lives and minds of Dhakaites. \u201cThe city is atomized,\u201d says Sarwar Jahan, a professor of urban and regional planning at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. \u201cPeople cannot socialize because of the traffic problems. You can only occasionally go to a friend\u2019s house or relatives. It simply takes too long.\u201dIt is wrong, in other words, to speak of Dhaka\u2019s traffic as an inconvenience; even \u201ccrisis\u201d is too mild a term. Adnan Morshed, an associate professor of architecture and planning at the Catholic University of America, has called Dhaka\u2019s congestion \u201ca vast urban pathology\u201d that \u201ccontinues to kill.\u201d Bangladesh\u2019s thriving textile industry has given the nation\u2019s economy a jolt, but analysts warn that if the capital cannot solve its traffic and infrastructure problem, such gains will prove fleeting \u2014 that progress itself may grind to a standstill. Jammed-up roads are the indelible image of Dhaka\u2019s agony. They may also be its single greatest cause.DHAKA\u2019S TRAFFIC OVERLOAD is a sensory overload. You can smell and taste it: The exhaust fumes tickle your nostrils and coat your mouth, leaving an acrid taste on your tongue. You can \u2014 often, you must \u2014 reach out and touch the traffic, executing defensive hand-check maneuvers to ward off vehicles and fellow pedestrians as you scramble across packed streets.But the traffic hits you most forcefully in your ears. Some historians claim that the city\u2019s name derives from the dhak, a big drum with a clattering sound. True or not, there\u2019s no mistaking the pounding that the city gives to your auditory nerves. Traffic is Dhaka\u2019s deafening music, a dissonant theme song of shouting drivers, rumbling engines and, leading the attack, honking horns: vocals, bass, ill-tuned brass.That din is the sound of aggression. Dhaka\u2019s drivers may be the most brutish and pitiless on earth. They may also be some of the best, if your idea of skillful driving is expansive enough to include the lawlessness and daredevilry that Dhaka demands.One afternoon I hailed an auto-rickshaw near the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium and took a long, meandering journey through some of the city\u2019s most heavily trafficked streets. Dhakaites call auto-rickshaws \u201cCNGs,\u201d because they run on compressed natural gas. They\u2019re the kind of vehicles you find all over urban Asia, essentially small metal boxes, propped atop three wheels and divided into two tiny compartments, one for the driver, and another, slightly larger but still a tight squeeze, for passengers. In Dhaka, they\u2019re painted forest green, nearly all of them are dirty and dinged up, and they make a lot of loud, unpleasant noise snarling through the streets. They\u2019re scruffy, ornery little machines, the piratical cousins of golf carts.My CNG was piloted by an unsmiling man who looked to be in his late 20s. On the road, he was relentless. He vied for every centimeter of roadway in thick traffic and sped as fast as possible when congestion eased. We were in one of the busiest parts of town now, on Bir Uttam Rafiqul Islam Avenue, a wide street lined with malls and crammed with shoppers. Another mall, of a sort, had sprung up on the road itself. In Dhaka, a traffic jam is an economic opportunity: Vehicles are descended on by vendors hawking bottles of water, peeled cucumbers, books. Crime is an issue, too. Once, CNGs had no doors, but wire doors were added as protection from muggers who prey on riders in stalled traffic. Enterprising thieves have been known to drop in on passengers, clambering on top of CNGs and slicing through their canvas roofing to gain entry. The weapon of choice for some muggers is Tiger Balm, the heat rub, which they smear on victims\u2019 eyes to disable them.My driver\u2019s modus operandi was to keep his CNG in motion no matter what, even in chock-a-block conditions. When he couldn\u2019t push the thing forward vertically, he moved horizontally, crossing lanes of traffic by beating out a nattering pattern on his horn, nosing his way in between vehicles and forcing other drivers to budge in turn, even if the only movement possible was an inch or two. He kept repeating two syllables, barking at fellow commuters in between horn blasts: \u201cAs-tay!\u201d he cried. \u201cAs-tay! As-tay! As-tay!\u201d Later, I asked a friend who speaks Bengali to translate the word for me. Aste, it turns out, means \u201cslowly, gently.\u201dThere is one form of transportation in Dhaka that might be deemed gentle, at least by the city\u2019s hard-as-nails standards. Bicycle rickshaws are the quaintest and most ubiquitous of all the vehicles on Dhaka\u2019s streets. No one is certain about the size of the city\u2019s rickshaw fleet. (Only a fraction of the vehicles are officially licensed.) Most estimates put the number upward of 200,000; some reckon there are several times that many.Arguing about rickshaws is as big a pastime in Dhaka as riding them. There have been many proposals to ban the machines, but the efforts have always been beaten back. Some contend that rickshaws are the vehicles best-suited to traffic-choked roads, and the most environmentally friendly. Others say that they are inefficient, that four rickshaws rolling abreast on a Dhaka street take up the square footage of a bus while transporting just eight passengers.One thing that everyone agrees on is that Dhaka\u2019s rickshaws look great. They have been called \u201cmoving museums.\u201d They\u2019re elaborately appliqu\u00e9d with tinsel and tassels; their frames bear colorful paintings of flowers, movie-star portraits, heroic images of Bangladesh\u2019s 1971 war of independence, pastoral and urban scenes. Scrutinize the cityscapes painted on rickshaws and you will note an irony. Invariably they show a dreamily placid city, with swooping birds and sunsets blazing behind turreted towers. As for the roads depicted in the paintings: They are tidy, tranquil, serenely traffic-free.FOR THE FORESEEABLE future, those rickshaw paintings are the closest thing to orderly street scenes that you\u2019ll find in Dhaka. When experts are asked about solutions to the city\u2019s woes, they recite a familiar litany. They talk about traffic lights, dedicated rickshaw lanes, arterial roads, light rail. They speak of decentralization, of easing the burden on Dhaka by developing secondary cities like Chittagong and Khulna. The government, for its part, is touting the 12-mile-long, $1.14 billion Dhaka Elevated Expressway, whose construction began in August of 2015. But skepticism about such projects runs deep in Dhaka, where progress has so often been stymied by government ineptitude and corruption.In the meantime, the capital\u2019s roadways seethe. It takes just a few days in Dhaka to acclimate, and to develop an affection for the city\u2019s impregnable streets. For a greenhorn, the traffic offers a novel perspective on an alien city. I learned to appreciate the way that 360 degrees of stacked-up traffic transformed sight lines, collapsing space and perspective, shattering Dhaka\u2019s scenery into Cubist shards: splashes of color; a flash of a painted sign on a wall; a glimpse of a driver\u2019s beard in his truck\u2019s rearview mirror; a pile of corrugated metal siding, surreally floating a dozen feet in the air, the payload of an unseen cargo tricycle.I knew, of course, that it was unseemly for a visitor from one of the world\u2019s richest cities to aestheticize the chaos and dysfunction of one of its poorest. Traffic in Dhaka is not just a nuisance. It is poverty, it\u2019s injustice, it\u2019s suffering.Yet nearly everyone I met in Dhaka spoke of the traffic as a trial by fire, a test of mettle, a horror that is also a perverse source of pride. One woman, a lifelong Dhaka resident, told me she \u201cmissed the jams\u201d when she lived abroad: In the big cities of Europe and America, the relative lack of congestion unnerved her. When you make it through a day in Dhaka, when you make it across a snarled intersection, you have triumphed against the odds, and over the gods. The town puts you in a philosophical frame of mind. Dhaka teaches that travel is hell, but it also reminds you of the primitive wonder of travel, the truth that, to complete any journey, no matter how quotidian, is to conquer space, and \u2014 depending just how awful the congestion is on the Mirpur Road \u2014 to subdue time.When the day came for my return to New York, I\u2019d been in Dhaka long enough to have learned its golden rule of commuting: Leave early. So I arranged for a wake-up call and at 4:45 a.m., more than five hours before my flight\u2019s boarding time, I staggered into a waiting taxi. The cabdriver assured me that the traffic at that hour would not be so bad.Lo and behold, he was right. The sun hadn\u2019t yet risen, and the taxi went hurtling through the black streets of central Dhaka. There was no traffic \u2014 zilch. We gained the Airport Road, and whizzed faster still. I watched the kilometers tick off on the dashboard speedometer and I rolled down my window. As the taxi revved past 50 miles per hour, we seemed to be flying.Then, a mile or so south of our destination, a formation of cars and trucks and CNGs pressed up against us, the taxi slowed and suddenly we were earthbound again: on a jammed-up road in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We stopped, we started, we stopped again. The cause of the congestion was unclear, but it was obvious that I\u2019d have no trouble making my flight. So I relaxed: I was going to relish the madness one last time. Eventually, the speedometer nudged a hair above five miles per hour, and as we started to crawl forward again, a thought stole into my mind, proof that Dhaka had done its work on me. You call this traffic? C\u2019mon. This isn\u2019t traffic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cost of Keeping Companies in the United States", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWe need to put aside the politicized allegations that inversions are a way for corporations to cheat the rest of America. This sort of language confuses the issue and obscures a central fact: All of these corporations are owned by shareholders who should, in theory, reap the benefits of a lower corporate tax bill.Unfortunately, in our zeal to keep companies in the United States, we have created policies where inversions benefit some shareholders at the expense of others. Perversely, the inversion rules are more likely to punish American investors and long-term investors to the benefit of senior executives, recent investors and tax-exempt investors, including those overseas.Overall, taxable shareholders lost 1 percent to 3 percent on the value of their shares. This may sound small, but it amounts to around $6 billion in extra taxes for the shareholders. So while inversions reduce the corporate taxes collected by the Treasury, the extra taxes paid by shareholders offset that loss by about 40 percent.Fifteen percent to 20 percent of shareholders in the deals we studied were made worse off from inversion. The anti-inversions tax rules are especially bad for long-term investors who have higher capital gains because they have seen their shares appreciate significantly over the years. For example, investors who bought Pfizer five years ago have had their shares appreciate by 80 percent; investors who bought 25 years ago have seen their shares grow by six times (adjusted for splits).For older Americans who plan to bequeath shares to spouses or heirs, an inversion is especially costly. These individuals end up paying capital gains taxes upon inversion that they would otherwise avoid through a bequest.(The tax cost of an inversion also explains why companies with founders who hold large ownership stakes, like Facebook, would never consider inverting: such a maneuver would require Mark Zuckerberg to cut a $14 billion check to the government to cover the capital gains tax on his shares.)But tax-exempt investors enjoy a nice return from inversion of 4 percent to 7 percent. These include investors in millions of retirement accounts, pensions and endowments across the country, who do not pay taxes when an inversion occurs. Even tax-deferred investors, such as most 401(k) and traditional I.R.A. accounts, are exempt from capital gains taxes.Foreign shareholders also benefit, as the I.R.S.\u2019s special tax rules don\u2019t apply in other countries.There\u2019s a third group that benefits: corporate executives. We found that the chief executive\u2019s wealth increases 3 percent to 4 percent, despite the personal tax consequences of inversion. This is in part because stock options, unlike shares, are not subject to capital gains tax at inversion. In 2004 the government added a tax on pay for executives of inverting companies but the companies began reimbursing their executives for this expense, passing the cost along to shareholders.There are several steps the United States can take to discourage inversions. A lower corporate tax rate and the removal of taxes on foreign earnings would certainly reduce the incentives for companies to leave. If we coupled a lower corporate rate with a reduction in the deductions companies now have, we could maintain the current level of tax revenue while at the same time simplifying the tax code and remaining competitive.First, though, we should abandon the policies that have punished long-term and older taxable American shareholders, while other investors \u2014 foreign, tax-exempt and corporate insiders \u2014 benefit. And the rules have failed in their primary mission of discouraging corporate inversions: Companies worth over half a trillion dollars announced their intention to invert since 2014. In short, we have the worst of policy effects: unintended consequences and no intended ones.Brent Glover is an assistant professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University.

He has found a way to make a New York rap sound that\u2019s modern, not preoccupied with the formalist bullies of the 1990s (the L.O.X., DMX) that still define the city to so many.\u201cThere\u2019s so few New York movements \u2014 we\u2019ve got to be a part of this one,\u201d said Craig Kallman, the chairman and chief executive of Atlantic Records, who signed Highbridge the Label, A Boogie\u2019s label, to a joint venture.Several of the songs on \u201cArtist\u201d were inspired by a rocky situation with a girlfriend, including a pregnancy scare. While writing about that experience, A Boogie began experimenting with how to best manipulate his voice, landing on a creaky, sweet, melodic style delivered with a bruiser\u2019s cadence.\u201cI was always scared to use that around people,\u201d he said. \u201cEven to this day, I\u2019m still developing my voice. I used it again in a different type of mood song, like a hood song, and it sounded crazy again and I was like, \u2018Damn, this is the voice right here.\u2019 It made me want to do mad music in different moods.\u201d That\u2019s meant flexibility in approach: sometimes his most rugged subject matter \u2014 on \u201cArtist,\u201d and also \u201cHighbridge the Label: The Takeover Vol. 1,\u201d the mixtape he released in May with his labelmate Don Q \u2014 comes in the softest voice, and vice versa.Soon after he released \u201cArtist,\u201d he first heard one of his songs on Hot 97, the venerated New York radio station, while he happened to be streaming on Facebook Live. By April, he performed a sold-out show at B. B. King Blues Club & Grill.Around that time, he began a string of club performances alongside the Hot 97 prime-time D.J. and longtime New York rap agitator Funkmaster Flex, who first learned about A Boogie from the bloggers on his website, and from requests in Bronx nightclubs.\u201cFor the first time in a while, that New York sound, people are looking to put in their clubs up and down the East Coast,\u201d Funkmaster Flex said, before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush anything and say we\u2019re back. I don\u2019t want to jinx it.\u201dWhen A Boogie was young, he said, he sold marijuana \u201cto get the money to get to the studio.\u201d After getting in trouble as a teenager, he and his family relocated to Florida, where he was arrested at least five times, on charges including burglary and drug possession. (\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt nobody,\u201d he said.) His last year there, he was on house arrest, though he would sneak out to work with a local producer.He returned to Highbridge last summer, but a few months ago moved to a house in Westchester, and more recently, to one in New Jersey, which he shares with Don Q and the label\u2019s owners, QP and Bubba.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hate,\u201d he said. \u201cNot in the neighborhood, but outside the neighborhood, and people bring that over here. I don\u2019t never know who\u2019s out here no more.\u201d A few weeks ago, one of his friends was shot and killed in the neighborhood. \u201cI felt like it could have been me,\u201d he said. Around the same time, he performed onstage with Drake during three consecutive shows at Madison Square Garden.After the visit to Highbridge, A Boogie\u2019s S.U.V. made its way to Blast Off Productions near Times Square, a tiny hotbox of a studio with Drake platinum plaques on the lobby wall and speakers strong enough to shake the doors. Even though he was feeling under the weather, he bought a box of Raw rolling papers in the smoke shop downstairs, then headed upstairs for a recording session.After a quick meal from Steak \u2019n Shake, A Boogie began rolling up some weed in the lobby while in the background, a surly beat throbbed. Soon he began singing in that appealingly cracked voice: He mumbled a few musical phrases to himself, then tried a couplet: \u201cRight when you thought that I was so average/That\u2019s when you turned me into a savage,\u201d lingering over the vowel sounds and pushing his voice even further into scratched territory.\u201cI ain\u2019t wanna make that type of song just now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy today.\u201dBut the beat was putting him in a different head space, and squeezing out a different voice. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get back in that bag, talk about my feelings,\u201d he said, then closed his eyes and found the melody.Advertisement"}

That gulf tells you a lot about why Snap\u2019s founder Evan Spiegel has kept his company in Venice Beach, near the ocean and studio lots that have shaped popular culture for decades.The brand\u2019s laid-back Southern California approach was first apparent in its messaging and media app Snapchat, where the messages quickly disappear.The videos are short and sweet and have become a hit with young people who are wary of Facebook and Instagram with their permanent records of social media.Just as Snap outwardly eschews the more earnest Silicon Valley ethos \u2014 technology should change the world \u2014 it has also sidestepped the biggest mistakes made by Google Glass.Glass, which was shut down as a consumer product last year, didn\u2019t show people when it was recording. Some techies didn\u2019t care, but many found it a violation of privacy.Single-use plastic bags are the shameful hallmark of a society that has become overdependent on things we don\u2019t need. Nothing we use for five minutes should end up polluting our environment for hundreds of years.\u2014 Dan JacobsonWhen plastic bags made their debut to replace the brown paper bag that sometimes would tear or become damp from produce, dairy or frozen food items, I thought this was a heaven sent idea for both merchants and customers. ...

{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Pui-Wing\u2019s Week in Tech: Yahoo\u2019s Hacking, Self-Driving Cars and the Future of Twitter", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsA few things stand out to me about this attack. It\u2019s obviously terrible for everyone whose information has been breached, and it also comes at a terrible time for Yahoo, which is in the process of selling most of its assets to Verizon. What happens to that sale, now, seems in question; this sort of disclosure could affect aspects of the deal, including the price. After all, although Yahoo has long been in decline, the company still has a loyal user base that has stuck with it for email and other web services. To the extent that those people are scared away by this breach, Verizon may well want to reconsider.What do you think? Are the endless Yahoo acquisition talks going to get even more endless now?But it\u2019s unclear how that might affect the price of the deal, or if Verizon will walk away from Yahoo. Hackings now happen all the time and to almost every corporate entity. So Verizon couldn\u2019t very well build in an escape clause on a deal for an industrywide problem, though it may have some leverage to chip away at price or some other deal conditions.All I know is that a horde of lawyers and investment bankers must be getting well paid right now to figure it all out.I suspect that like me, you\u2019ve noticed a huge change in Silicon Valley recently. From Uber to Tesla to Google to Apple, much of the industry has become obsessed with cars. Where we used to talk about smartphones and apps, we now talk about electric engines, location mapping and ride sharing.I\u2019m personally gratified to see this happening; cars are expensive, inefficient and environmentally problematic, exactly the sort of big challenge that techies want to fix. But I\u2019ve also heard grumbling both inside and outside the Valley that companies here are biting off more than they can chew in attacking the auto industry. Do you agree?Did I really just say that? Eyeroll.Finally, let\u2019s talk about my favorite pastime, Twitter. Several big things happened with the slow-growing 140-character social network. First, the 140 characters got a bit looser. As of this week, when you add images, links or other multimedia elements to your tweet, they won\u2019t count against the character limit. In other words, tweets got just a bit longer.These deals are something of a strategy shift for the company. It\u2019s looking to become a kind of TV network, the place you\u2019ll turn to first when you want to watch something. I think this is a great idea. Livestreaming sports, awards shows and other news events can be a hassle today \u2014 you\u2019ve got to find a link, usually log in with your cable-company account, and then you\u2019re often presented with some slow, blurry stream that makes you tear your hair out. Twitter, thankfully, is trying to solve this. It could be pretty handy.But it also seems a little bit of an odd game plan to save the company, right?But for now at least, I don\u2019t see it. The 13-year-olds are into Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest, even Musical.ly. Twitter? Not on their radar screen.Maybe Twitter needs to try something else, like making money off how brands use it for customer service. That sounds incredibly enterprise-y, but those boring businesses are often more predictable and profitable.Google isn\u2019t surprising. We\u2019ve heard rumors for years that the search company, which has perennially failed at building social apps, is interested in the microblogging network. But an acquisition by Salesforce is a stranger idea. I don\u2019t immediately get how it would work, and there\u2019s a very high chance that a business-focused cloud company could ruin the freewheeling network. But if Salesforce thinks of some out-of-the-box way to use Twitter as a customer service and lead-generation network, that could be lucrative.Anyway, thanks for joining me! I hope you spend the weekend bracing for Mike\u2019s return. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.Advertisement"}

The unintended microbiome alteration incited by enthusiastic personal and environmental hygiene practices in infancy and childhood is another assault on our bug-brothers, and one that carries health risks.The overzealous and inappropriate use of antibiotics in patients depletes the individual\u2019s health-maintaining microbiome, leads to serious multiresistant infections and incurs adverse drug reactions in the susceptible. Furthermore, the richness, health and biodiversity of the human gut microbiome contributes to the balanced immunomodulation required to suppress harmful inflammatory and allergic processes. This reinforces the importance of our microscopic companions for human \u00adwell-being.We also do well to protest the widespread use of antibiotics in animal feed to accelerate cattle and poultry growth to meet our ever-growing demand for dietary protein.

{"Headline": "Whom to Vote For? Employees Tend to Follow Their Leader", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhile Mr. Cook\u2019s role was as a private citizen \u2014 it was not an Apple event \u2014 the message to employees about whom he is supporting for president is clear.The influence of chief executives like Mr. Cook over employees\u2019 political leanings and donations, intentional or not, is substantial: It may not be an overstatement to suggest that a chief executive\u2019s politics may be one of the most significant factors in swaying how employees think about elections.Three business professors set out to examine \u201chow the political preferences of C.E.O.s affect their employees\u2019 campaign contributions and electoral choices.\u201d The results of the study, which looked at eight federal election cycles from 1999 to 2014 and over 2,000 companies, showed a statistically significant correlation among campaign contributions made by the chief and his or her employees as well as voter turnout. The study found that \u201cemployees direct approximately three times more of their campaign contributions to political candidates supported by their firm\u2019s C.E.O. than to otherwise similar candidates.\u201dIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, C.E.O.s and employees donate along similar party lines because they share common values and interest,\u201d think again.The study uncovered patterns that show a chief executive\u2019s influence is profound: \u201cWhen a new C.E.O. contributes to different political candidates from the ones supported by the prior C.E.O., employees tend to follow his/her lead and redirect their donations as well,\u201d wrote the professors, Ilona Babenko of Arizona State University, Viktar Fedaseyeu of Bocconi University in Italy and Song Zhang of the University of Lugano in Switzerland.There is nothing inherently wrong, in most cases, with a chief executive or employee raising money for a particular candidate or party. Mr. Cook, it is worth noting, gives to both sides of the aisle, having just hosted a separate fund-raiser for House Speaker Paul Ryan in June.But the influence of a boss\u2019s political leanings should not be underestimated. \u201cOur evidence indicates that C.E.O.s are a political force, with potentially important implications for firms they manage and for the nature of democracy,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe welfare implications depend both on whether C.E.O.s promote their own political agenda or act in the interests of their firms, and on whether the interests of the firm coincide with the interests of its employees.\u201dStill, the risks \u2013 and complex set of election laws \u2013 make political fund-raising a complicated endeavor for those in the corner office. \u201cThe potentially coercive effect of an employer\u2019s solicitation counsels in favor of avoiding the situation altogether,\u201d said Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the chief of Kalorama Partners, a Washington consulting firm. \u201cThe logical alternative \u2014 having a very strong and clear disclaimer \u2014 doesn\u2019t really work, since many employees might not believe the disclaimer, no matter how strongly it is worded.\u201dTony Fratto, a former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush who now operates a consulting firm, Hamilton Place, took issue with the idea that C.E.O.s should remain outside the political campaign arena.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that some employees feel pressure to align with the C.E.O. politically, but my experience is that in most cases both C.E.O.s and employees are overwhelmingly influenced by a candidate\u2019s views or voting record on industry issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI encourage firms to do more to inform their employees at all levels about what political leaders\u2019 records are on their key policies. I actually think that doesn\u2019t happen enough.\u201dThis election cycle, it seems that many C.E.O.s, especially on Wall Street, have chosen to be less public about whom they are supporting in the presidential race. Perhaps because of the lingering negative memories of the financial crisis or perhaps because this presidential election has turned so decidedly nasty, many executives have stayed on the sideline. In June, Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel, canceled an event at his home for Donald Trump after it was reported to be causing a firestorm among Intel employees and peers in Silicon Valley that felt Mr. Trump\u2019s policies were damaging to the industry. Mr. Krzanich later said he canceled the event because it had turned into a fund-raiser without his approval. \u201cI do not intend to endorse any presidential candidate. We are interested in engaging both campaigns in open dialogue on issues in technology,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.When it comes to presidential politics, some executives privately say they worry they could see reprisals against their business or industry if they were to actively campaign for one candidate or another.\u201cThe risk of being on the record publicly against a politician is high, particularly if that politician may take retaliatory action,\u201d said Brian Richter, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin.Clearly the influence of C.E.O.s and other senior executives\u2019 political preferences on the people working for them deserves more scrutiny. In the meantime, while it is hard to know how individuals will ultimately vote when they pull the lever in November, perhaps a new election polling data point should be the preferences of their bosses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long Island Abuse Case Reveals Risks of Out-of-State Foster Care", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe website features photographs and short biographies of children, some with special needs. Choices can be narrowed by gender, age, race and ethnicity.The State of Washington turns to sites, like the Washington Adoption Resource Exchange, to help find adoptive parents for children. The state\u2019s goal is to keep the children near family and familiar surroundings, but if officials cannot find a suitable match, they consider homes out of state \u2014 even across the country in New York.That is how Washington first found Cesar Gonzales-Mugaburu, who lives in Ridge, N.Y., on Long Island. He reached out after seeing children online in 2009.Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu eventually took in three boys from Washington, two of whom he adopted. They were among more than 100 children he cared for over some 20 years, a vast majority of whom came from New York City.Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\u2019s arrest prompted questions about why it took so long for the alleged abuse to be revealed. But it also drew attention to the practice of sending foster children far from the communities they knew \u2014 in this case, nearly 3,000 miles \u2014 to find a home.Some states use such long-distance placement because their own systems are struggling to find a place for children with special needs. Advocates say such long-distance arrangements can be positive because they can help children find homes more quickly. But effective oversight of even local foster care providers has proved a difficult task for many child welfare agencies nationwide; distance adds another obstacle.Records obtained by The New York Times show that social workers in Washington were confused about the status of a 2014 investigation into abuse in Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\u2019s home across the country. At that time, they continued to actively guide Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu in his efforts to adopt a third boy because they did not know details of the investigation.\u201c#1 Do you know anything about the investigation,\u201d Amy Herring, a social worker in Washington, wrote in an email to Erin Coyle, who at the time was a director at SCO Family of Services, a nonprofit foster care agency in New York that monitored Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu on behalf of Washington. \u201c#2 Do you know when the adoption paperwork may be done by?\u201dMs. Coyle \u201cis no longer employed by the agency,\u201d SCO said. Ms. Coyle did not respond to requests for comment through messages left by phone and sent via Facebook.For his part, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, who was licensed to run a therapeutic home for special needs children, continued to be paid. From September 2010 through January 2016, when he was arrested, he received nearly $145,000 from Washington for caring for children placed with him, in addition to money he received from New York City for caring for local foster children.Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, 60, has pleaded not guilty to charges of sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child. His lawyer, Donald Mates Jr., said the allegations were false.The first mention of Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\u2019s name in Washington State\u2019s records was in late 2009, and was positive. He was interested in adopting a boy listed on an adoption website.Lori Whittaker, a social worker, wrote in a case file in December 2009 that the staff thought he would be a \u201cgood placement.\u201d Also, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu had told them that none of the child\u2019s special needs \u201cscare me.\u201d(The children\u2019s names, as well as confidential information, were redacted from files given to The Times.)Soon after, on Feb. 3, 2010, another social worker, Veronica L. Mo, wrote something similar and said he had also asked about another child. Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu traveled to Washington to meet one of the boys, according to the records. He soon took another child.Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu was a one-man operation used by several different agencies that considered his home a safe haven for boys who were developmentally or physically disabled, or had severe behavioral problems.That dependency proved blinding for those agencies, law enforcement officials have said.Mr. Mates said that nothing was overlooked and that his client is innocent. Over the past 20 years, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu had been the subject of 30 to 40 complaints about abuse or other mistreatment of children, and the police or social services had investigated them all, Mr. Mates said. \u201cEach and every time that an investigation was done, no charges were brought,\u201d he said.And records suggested that the authorities at Washington\u2019s child welfare agency were more directly involved in monitoring Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu than was New York City\u2019s child welfare agency. Although New York\u2019s agency sent more than 90 boys to him, it had outsourced oversight of Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu to the nonprofit SCO Family of Services.Through the years, there were several different agencies involved, like the boys\u2019 schools, hospitals where they went for care, and a residential treatment center called Little Flower in Suffolk County.A developmentally disabled boy from Washington whom Gonzales-Mugaburu adopted left his direct supervision to live at Little Flower. There, in 2014, he told a psychotherapist about horrific abuses inside Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\u2019s home on a quiet cul-de-sac. The therapist, Amy D\u2019Antonio, alerted the authorities about the allegations, prompting an investigation by Suffolk County Child Protective Services.Ms. D\u2019Antonio had helped the young man, who was 18 years old at the time, reconnect with his biological family in Washington. She said Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu objected, once approaching her in the parking lot of the treatment center and telling her that the teenager did not have the mental capacity to make such a decision.Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu told her the boy was a \u201ccompulsive and pathological liar,\u201d said Ms. D\u2019Antonio, who in March sued Little Flower, her former employer, saying the agency should have acted more quickly to prevent further abuse of children in his care. Little Flower has disputed the claims in her lawsuit and says it \u201cfully supported\u201d her efforts to contact the authorities.Yet while that investigation was underway, social workers in Washington were trying to place a third child with Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu.At the same time, Washington officials began to question why the state was paying Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu for a child who was no longer in his direct care. Questioned, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu became indignant, according to entries that social workers placed in his case file. He told Ms. Herring, the Washington social worker, that he resented being treated \u201clike a crook and it hurts him.\u201d\u201cHe reported that it also angers him deeply. They make him feel \u2018dirty and undervalued,\u2019\u201d the entries read.Washington later found that Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu had, in fact, been overpaid. But Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu continued to complain. On Jan. 12 this year, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu told Ms. Herring that he felt \u201conce again insulted\u201d over the disputed payments, according to records.But two days later, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu shifted the conversation.He told Ms. Herring that he was under investigation. \u201cHe reported that two \u2018troubled boys\u2019 are causing problems for him, and he wanted to make sure that the SW was aware of what is going on,\u201d she wrote, using shorthand for social worker.At that point, one young man after another, including the 18-year-old adopted son from Washington, were coming forward with allegations of abuse.Two boys, 11 and 13, told the authorities about sexual misconduct in the home. Unlike allegations by boys in the past, theirs were believed, mostly because the boys did not have severe disabilities or emotional problems, said Detective Lt. Robert Donohue, commander of Suffolk County\u2019s special victims unit.Much of the blame for the failure to alert other agencies has been placed on SCO Family of Services in New York, which coordinated the placement of boys in Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\u2019s home, with most coming from Long Island and the surrounding area. It has acknowledged that it could have taken more aggressive action after previous complaints.\u201cInternal and external reviews have concluded that SCO had no knowledge of sexual abuse or misconduct in this home,\u201d the agency said. \u201cOur review of this former foster parent, however, suggests that there were other issues with the home, and in retrospect and knowing what we know now, a decision to close the home should have been made earlier.\u201dIt was child welfare officials in Washington who were most dependent on getting straight answers and accurate updates from SCO about conditions at Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\u2019s home and the status of investigations. Norah West, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, said, \u201cWe rely on information from the agency that is contracted to ensure the well-being of the child in that receiving state.\u201dThe mother of the 18-year-old boy, whom The Times is not naming to protect her son\u2019s identity, grew up in the foster care system herself. She said she had struggled with mental illness and substance abuse, and could not believe her son had suffered in a system that she thought would help him.\u201cI can\u2019t believe they put him with someone like that,\u201d she said. \u201cLook what I did to my son.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colin Kaepernick\u2019s Anthem Protest Leaves the N.F.L. Necessarily Uneasy", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesAfter nearly two weeks of conspicuous silence, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell on Wednesday finally weighed in on Colin Kaepernick\u2019s continuing refusal to stand for the national anthem.No surprise: Goodell, the son of a United States senator and the point man for a group of teams owned mostly by white billionaires, doesn\u2019t agree with Kaepernick.Or, as Goodell said in his carefully chosen and long-overdue words, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with what he\u2019s doing.\u201dThe key word is \u201cnecessarily.\u201dSo Goodell didn\u2019t necessarily come down strongly one way or the other. He was \u2014 how shall I put it? \u2014 necessarily noncommittal.\u201cI support our players when they want to see change in society, and we don\u2019t live in a perfect society,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, we believe very strongly in patriotism in the N.F.L. I personally believe very strongly in that.\u201dOn both of his hands, Goodell has a very sticky situation. But it\u2019s a situation he had to face sooner or later.\u201cHis actions and similar actions by figures of the past and present are a vital part of our journey and a key component of the equation for social change and should be respected as such,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cFrom the country\u2019s inception, such displays against the status quo are distinctly American.\u201dYou know what else is distinctly American? Football. That\u2019s part of Goodell\u2019s problem.Despite the N.F.L.\u2019s insistence that football is growing into an international game, it\u2019s still an American idea willfully cloaked in Americana. Fighter jets routinely fly over stadiums before games. Flags, some fantastically oversize, are unfurled before every kickoff. Color guards march in. The national anthem is sung.But it\u2019s that national anthem that has been problematic lately for Goodell and a league that loves to wrap itself in the flag. Over the past two weeks, Kaepernick\u2019s protest has started a discussion that the commissioner and his league probably didn\u2019t want to have.Eric Reid, Kaepernick\u2019s 49ers teammate, has joined Kaepernick in his protest. So has Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane. Jets wide receiver Brandon Marshall, on WFAN radio on Tuesday, called Kaepernick \u201cone of the biggest patriots out there because he\u2019s standing up for human rights.\u201dAs more and more athletes find their voices, Kaepernick and some of his colleagues have moved so far out of the football box that players are now casually talking about constitutional law with the ease they normally display in using the N.F.L.\u2019s military-tinged language of formations and end-arounds and long bombs.The problem, though, is that the N.F.L. has not always been aboveboard in its links to the military, and that is another reason Kaepernick\u2019s stance is touching on a sensitive issue.To the N.F.L.\u2019s credit, it quickly conducted an audit. On Wednesday, the league said it had repaid taxpayers $723,734 last spring, doling out the amount auditors deemed to be inappropriate payments. But as the season opens on Thursday, the N.F.L.\u2019s idea of patriotism \u2014 fake or real, paid or free \u2014 and Kaepernick\u2019s idea of it remain at opposite ends of the field.\u201cI think they are probably upset and probably worrying about what this does to the firmament of their pregame ceremonies,\u201d Robert Boland, a former N.F.L. agent who teaches sports law at Ohio University, said of league officials. \u201cThis is probably not a situation that they want to get into too deeply, given the implications and the bent of society right now. But this issue is going to come to a greater head. I don\u2019t know when, but it will happen.\u201dBoland recalled what Bill Shannon, a former public relations director for Madison Square Garden, decided to do in the 1960s and \u201970s when sports officials grew worried about Vietnam protests during the national anthem. The Garden\u2019s lights were dimmed so only the anthem singer could be seen, under a spotlight.It was a neat little trick, but it can\u2019t be done during a daytime football game. For now, the spotlight will remain on Kaepernick and whoever decides to join him \u2014 and on the N.F.L.\u2019s claim that it represents much that is good about America.In this debate, we don\u2019t necessarily have to agree on who is right, or who is wrong. But to Goodell\u2019s dismay, it\u2019s a debate that won\u2019t necessarily disappear soon.Email: juliet@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

When it came time for gifts, each friend unveiled a Disney Barbie, except for one, who, a couple of years older, presented Ms. O\u2019Brien with a fake ID and suggested they go bar-hopping.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ms. O\u2019Brien replied quizzically. \u201cA princess wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201dThen, with dreams of ascending to Broadway and finding romance, too, she moved to New York, where some dreams flourish and others are crushed.She found theater work in New York and on the road, performing a signature role as Belle in \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d in regional productions. \u201cI used to tear up onstage,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I thought I was never going to have my fairy-tale ending.\u201dPrince Charming, it seemed, had crawled under a rock.\u201cI had a guy take me on a carriage ride in Central Park and then tell me to pay for it,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Brien said.Dismayed, she and a friend made up a song called \u201cWhatever Happened to Chivalry?\u201dHis fellow actors competed for Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s attention by bombarding her with questions: Was she married? (No.) Was she dating anyone? (Yes, as a matter of fact.)Mr. Roche, who was also in a relationship, sat back and took it all in. \u201cEveryone was aware that this gorgeous woman had entered the room,\u201d he said. But soon he and Ms. O\u2019Brien were cutting up backstage over missed queues and fumbled lines and whatever else captured their fancy.\u201cI thought he was the nicest guy I\u2019d ever met,\u201d she said. \u201cI was totally captivated by how infectious his kindness is and his smile and his passion for the business. He makes you feel really excited about what you\u2019re doing.\u201dBut she wasn\u2019t thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to date him,\u201d she said, though they did promise to stay in touch and connected from time to time on Facebook and attended each other\u2019s shows.It was after a reading of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d two years later, when their previous relationships had fizzled, that Mr. Roche suggested dinner at Vynl on Ninth Avenue.She was coming from a modeling convention where she had helped her agent spot new talent; he was coming from the Public Theater production of \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d starring Al Pacino, for whom Mr. Roche also works as a driver and an assistant.\u201cEverything about Mike was so interesting,\u201d she said of Mr. Roche, who also works in Queens as the after-school coordinator for the Leadership Program\u2019s 21st Century Community Learning Centers at Long Island City High School.He was also a baseball player at Ramapo College in New Jersey before working as a production assistant and an actor for Estelle Parsons and then winning a 2010 Drama Desk Award as a member of the Godlight Theater Company.Adding intrigue to their encounter over dinner was the cast of characters dropping things off for Mr. Pacino throughout their meal.\u201cHe was just so positive and full of light and energy,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Brien, now 36, said of Mr. Roche, 41. \u201cThe fact that he listened and was interested in things outside of himself was incredibly rare among the people I had been seeing.\u201dBut Ms. O\u2019Brien, who studied opera at the Interlochen Arts Academy and musical theater at the Hartt School in Hartford, had been plotting to abandon New York and return to her home in Oregon, her confidence at an all-time low.\u201cI was explaining to him, \u2018I\u2019m going to leave, I\u2019m burned out, I can\u2019t handle auditioning anymore and the rejection and the roller-coaster lifestyle it entails,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd within about 20 minutes, he turned my whole perception of life around. All of the sudden out of nowhere, I had this guy with a big heart sitting right in front of me, cheering me on.\u201dThey closed down the restaurant, then laughed some more as she regaled him with stories on the street corner. And as they hugged goodbye, Ms. O\u2019Brien wondered what on earth she had been thinking when she decided to move.Temporarily putting her packing on hold, she joined her mother in the Berkshires for a few days and quickly discovered that she longed to return to the city, and to Mr. Roche.\u201cHolly has been through hell and back with men,\u201d said Susan Hilerio, a friend of Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s who has known her since college. \u201cShe loves to heal people, she loves to help people, she wants to be the person who saves everyone. She would get her heart shattered and just pick right back up and let it happen again.\u201dDuring their second date, at Joe Allen in the theater district, Ms. O\u2019Brien declared that she was staying.\u201cI had never had a boyfriend who supported what I did in this business, who understood about traveling out of town for work and didn\u2019t consider it a pipe dream,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hit me that I needed somebody in my corner, and I wanted to see where it went with Mike. I was reinspired.\u201dAnd when they kissed good night, they each described it as something out of a movie.\u201cI remember telling him, \u2018You know, this is some serious Prince Charming type of behavior here,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the most chivalrous thing any guy had ever done for me.\u201dAfter that, they were inseparable. \u201cWe had essentially fallen in love,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got along so well, in fact, that we didn\u2019t argue and could almost finish each other\u2019s sentences. There was no drama, which was very new for me.\u201dNot only did Mr. Roche understand Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s dreams, but he was also determined to make her life easier as she pursued them. While she was out of town with a show, he moved from Manhattan to her street in Astoria so that they could see each other more often.And when, not long after their August 2014 engagement \u2014 he proposed in front of the castle at Disney World in Orlando, Fla. (where else?) \u2014 she was offered a performing gig on a European cruise that would keep them apart for nearly seven months, he encouraged her to go.\u201cIf someone offers you that contract as a singer, you have to take it,\u201d Mr. Roche said.He missed her dearly, with their relationship suddenly virtual. \u201cBut I\u2019m very aware that if you\u2019re dating an actress, they\u2019re going to go away and do shows, and Holly is aware that I may go away, too\u201d he said. \u201cTo be quite frank, you just find a way to make it work. What I really appreciate about her is she gets that. And I feel it\u2019s my job to support her doing her work.\u201dNot only is Mr. Roche a talented actor, but he is also \u201ca nice, normal guy in a business that\u2019s not normal and not nice,\u201d said Mr. Navarra, their unintentional matchmaker. \u201cHolly is the same kind of person, not only talented and beautiful, but sweet. Together they\u2019re a breath of fresh air.\u201dThe change in Ms. O\u2019Brien has been remarkable, Ms. Hilerio said. \u201cI feel like someone is finally taking care of her and has her best interests at heart,\u201d she said. \u201cHe grounds her, and she seems at peace.\u201dAfter the ceremony, guests uttered the passwords \u201cone true\u201d to Mr. Navarra, playing the role of a Brando-esque doorman at 202 East, a reception space on East 77th Street that had been transformed into a Gatsby-era speakeasy with a swing band.The bride\u2019s crystal-adorned strapless gown cascaded into a skirt worthy of a princess, a pink ribbon encircling her waist and a tiara on her head. As the couple took the floor for their first dance, two friends sang performed the theme from \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d which begins with the lines \u201cTale as old as time / True as it can be / Barely even friends / Then somebody bends / Unexpectedly.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so happy that we\u2019re getting married in this city that I\u2019ve come to love again because of him,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Brien said before the wedding. \u201cNew York can be a lonely and overwhelming place if you don\u2019t have someone to share it with.

Schneiderman, since he was given the power to investigate killings involving the police.Officer Isaacs was driving home after finishing a 4 p.m.-to-midnight shift when he got into a traffic dispute with another driver, Delrawn Small, at a red light on Atlantic Avenue in the Cypress Hills section of Brooklyn, the authorities said.Amid questions about those preliminary accounts of the shooting, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office chose to investigate the killing of Mr. Small.Officer Isaacs has worked with the New York Police Department since January 2013 and was assigned to the 79th Precinct in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. In addition to second-degree murder, he also was charged with manslaughter. His lawyer, Stephen Worth, declined to comment on the charges on Monday, as did a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat.Last year, responding to a series of civilian killings involving the police, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York signed an executive order granting Mr. Schneiderman the power to investigate and prosecute police-related deaths.Reached by telephone, Ms. Albert declined to speak about the charges against Officer Isaacs.

I think it\u2019s that message to police officers that results in the killings that we see across the country.\u201dRick Rojas and Ashley Southall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They spoke of job losses, mental health issues, substance abuse and problems with the city shelter system that drove them to the streets.\u201d You\u2019ll see four of those profiles and photographs republished below._________Key QuestionHow do personal accounts shape our views of homelessness?__________________Mom and Dad called regularly from pay phones to check up on us, and once or twice a month, we\u2019d all get together at Lori\u2019s.\u201cIt\u2019s not such a bad life,\u201d Mom told us after they\u2019d been homeless for a couple of months.\u201cDon\u2019t you worry a lick about us,\u201d Dad added. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been able to fend for ourselves.\u201d\u201cI think that maybe sometimes people get the lives they want.\u201d\u201cAre you saying homeless people want to live on the streets?\u201d Professor Fuchs asked. \u201cAre you saying they don\u2019t want warm beds and roofs over their heads?\u201d\u201cNot exactly,\u201d I said. I was fumbling for words. \u201cThey do. But if some of them were willing to work hard and make compromises, they might not have ideal lives, but they could make ends meet.\u201dProfessor Fuchs walked around from behind her lectern. \u201cWhat do you know about the lives of the underprivileged?\u201d she asked. She was practically trembling with agitation. \u201cWhat do you know about the hardships and obstacles that the underclass face?\u201dThe other students were staring at me.\u201cYou have a point,\u201d I said._______C. J. and Tiffany DillingerC. J. and Tiffany Dillinger cut a tender image in the midst of hard circumstance early on Thursday as they spooned together on Broadway on a bed made from pedestrian plaza chairs that they had dressed with a foam mat, sheets and pillows, cocooned in corrugated cardboard.They were shaken awake just before 7 a.m. by a security guard for the Gramercy District Alliance. As they stuffed their pillows and blankets into a ratty rolling suitcase, they said they had been homeless since their house in Old Bridge, N.J., was foreclosed on a year ago.They had fallen behind on their mortgage. Then they were both laid off. She had a shipping and receiving position. He was a construction worker.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get some housing,\u201d Ms. Dillinger said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be separated from him.\u201dThey married 16 years ago, and homelessness is the hardest challenge they have faced, Ms. Dillinger said. They started taking public transportation into New York City in July because they heard it was a more manageable place to be homeless.\u201cBelieve it or not, there\u2019s more resources here,\u201d Ms. Dillinger said. \u201cSoup kitchens, places to eat. We came because we heard about a couples\u2019 shelter.\u201dWhen they tried to get into the couples\u2019 shelter, however, they were denied. But Ms. Dillinger said, \u201cI\u2019d rather be out here than in shelters.\u201dAs Mr. Dillinger turned the walls from their previous night\u2019s room back into flattened cardboard and dropped it beside a curbside trash can, Ms. Dillinger\u2019s eyes misted.\u201cThere\u2019s more resources for survival here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t call it living.\u201dJason Jones\u201cBeing sober \u2014 it just didn\u2019t work for me,\u201d said Jason Jones, who is married and has a daughter on Long Island.Mr. Jones said he served in the Army and once did a stint as a fund-raiser for a congressional candidate. It was around 2006 that alcohol began to take control of his life, he said, along with what he described as a desire to be more aware of \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on in the world, like in Rwanda,\u201d rather than the mundane daily duties of working a job and tending to his family.He bounced around the homes of family members and girlfriends before finally winding up in the city shelter system, but he hated it. He spent time in the Wards Island shelter, and went on to share a house with other men from the shelter.One of the roommates took him on a walk through McCarren Park, where he met a group of people who hang out around the northwest corner. He fell in with them quickly and has spent his summer with them. But he is already thinking about the winter, and said he intended to enroll in a back-to-work program and either make amends with family or re-enter the shelter system.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to work with the people inside it\u2019s not that bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just perseverance, with the winos.\u201dJerelyn FisherJerelyn Fisher sat in a wheelchair early on Thursday under a building scaffolding, bathed in bright light, with newspapers spread across her lap. She rested her bare, badly swollen feet on a black suitcase. Trash bags were piled high around her, nearly bursting with her belongings.Ms. Fisher lived for years in an apartment on Avenue D and Third Street. She taught sewing classes in New York City public housing and also in a fabric store until 2003.\u201cI just couldn\u2019t find another job,\u201d she said. \u201cI became homeless and discovered a whole new way of living.\u201dShe has avoided the shelter system because she says she finds the other residents challenging.\u201cThere are a lot of people who are upset and angry because they are homeless,\u201d she said.She turned to religion to deal with the stresses of being homeless and now preaches to others.\u201cThe biggest thing I\u2019ve learned is how Satan has mistreated humans,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that God Jehovah lives above us and you have to know how to pray if you\u2019re going to survive in this world.\u201dHer plan for the winter is to wrap herself in double plastic bags, as she has done for years.\u201cIt insulates you from the cold,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you get so hot inside you have to take off one of the bags.\u201dJose MoralesJose Morales and his 17-year-old girlfriend, Kimberly Williams, who is five months pregnant, had built a shelter out of a blanket tethered to a fence, underneath the No. 4 train.Mr. Morales said he grew up in a troubled home in the Bronx and eventually attended high school at a residential treatment center for drug and alcohol addiction. When he got out, he went into foster care with a family in Brooklyn, because his mother had been sent to prison on drug charges. He rebelled.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to listen, I didn\u2019t want to do no chores, I didn\u2019t want to obey no curfew,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was able to go back right now, I\u2019d apologize and fix it.\u201dHe was sent to another foster home in the Bronx. That was when he met Ms. Williams over Facebook. When she was kicked out of her home on Long Island after a fight with her grandmother, Mr. Morales allowed her to stay with him \u2014 a violation of house rules. They were both evicted.They squatted on a rooftop in Brooklyn before taking up residence in their current location. They went to the city intake center in the Bronx for homeless families, but learned they were ineligible because they were not married or in a domestic partnership.On Wednesday night, they huddled together on the sidewalk and watched a praying mantis crawl on the fence above their bed.\u201cI go around, I ask for a job here and there, but nobody\u2019s hiring,\u201d Mr. Morales said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t good for her, it isn\u2019t good for me.\u201d_______Questions for Writing and Discussion_________Going Further1.

She was the only player in the top 20 who had yet to reach the quarterfinals of a major.Pliskova, who leads the WTA tour in aces, dominated second-seeded Angelique Kerber to win the Western & Southern Open before the United States Open.In the quarterfinals of the United States Open, Pliskova will face another player having a Grand Slam breakthrough: Ana Konjuh, an 18-year-old Croatian.Konjuh was the top-ranked junior in 2013, when she won the girls\u2019 championships at the Australian and United States Opens.Now ranked 92nd, Konjuh overpowered Radwanska, who has never reached the quarterfinals at the Open. Konjuh hit 38 winners and lost only five points on her first serve.Konjuh avenged a second-round loss to Radwanska at Wimbledon, where Konjuh served for the match twice, had three match points and sustained a freak ankle injury when she stepped on the ball at the end of a rally late in the third set.Konjuh is the first Croatian woman to reach the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open. Iva Majoli, who was the last Croatian woman to win a major, was in Konjuh\u2019s box Monday night.\u25a0 Top-ranked Serena Williams cruised into the quarterfinals with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Yaroslava Shvedova. Williams won her 308th Grand Slam singles match, breaking Roger Federer\u2019s Open era record. She has not lost more than three games in a set during the tournament. Williams will next play fifth-seeded Simona Halep, who defeated No. 11 Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro, 6-2, 7-5.In an age of splintered attention and multi-everything-all-at-once, why should anyone, even a tennis fan, have to limit himself to one distraction at a time?As part of its $600 million overhaul, scheduled for completion in 2018, the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center has moved courts around, moved seats up, installed a cunning network of raised walkways and opened up sightlines everywhere.Daniel Zausner, the tennis center\u2019s chief operating officer, said the changes reflected the current, restless state of sports consumerism, in which fans want multiple choices and a constant selection of new things. Live events have to compete with, among other things, the allures of the couch and the screens at home.\u201cPeople\u2019s obsession is to multitask,\u201d Zausner said. \u201cPeople have an insatiable appetite to keep moving. They don\u2019t want to see too much of one thing for too long.\u201dThat means that during the giddy early days at the Open, when all the courts are filled and the complex is bustling with crowds, the best seat in the house is not necessarily a V.I.P. spot in one of the three big stadiums.Read the complete article here.An earlier version of this article misstated Karolina Pliskova\u2019s height. She is 6-foot-1, not 6-11.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Iva Majoli.

{"Headline": "The Insomnia Machine", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 1914, The Lancet reported on a clergyman who was found dead in a pool; he had left behind this suicide note: \u201cAnother sleepless night, no real sleep for weeks. Oh, my poor brain, I cannot bear the lengthy, dark hours of the night.\u201dI came across that passage with a shock of recognition. Many people think that the worst part of insomnia is the daytime grogginess. But like that pastor, I suffered most in the dark hours after midnight, when my desire for sleep, my raging thirst for it, would drive me into temporary insanity. On the worst nights, my mind would turn into a mad dog that snapped and gnawed itself.Though one in 10 American adults suffer from chronic insomnia, we have yet to answer the most fundamental questions about the affliction. Scientists are still arguing about the mechanisms of sleep and the reasons it fails in seemingly healthy people. There are few \u2014 if any \u2014 reliable treatments for insomnia. At the same time, medical journals warn that bad sleep can fester into diseases like cancer and diabetes. Deep in the night, those warnings scuttle around my mind like rats.About 18 months ago, during a particularly grueling period, I felt so desperate that I consulted yet another doctor \u2014 but all he did was suggest the same drugs that had failed me in the past. I was thrown back once again on my own ways of coping. As a child, I had invented mental games to distract myself. For instance, I would compile a list of things and people that made me happy, starting with words that began with A and moving through the alphabet.One night, I was in the Qs, trying to figure out what to add to quesadillas, queer theory and Questlove. Then, suddenly, the game infuriated me \u2014 why, why, why did I have to spend hours doing this? In the red glare of the digital clock, my brain rattled its cage. I prepared for a wave of lunacy.But instead of a meltdown, I had a wild idea: What if there was another, easier, way to drive the miserable thoughts from my mind?I began to fantasize about a machine that would do the thinking for me. I pictured it like another brain that would fit on top of my head. The next day, I cobbled together my first insomnia machine.Though millions of us struggle with chronic insomnia, we\u2019re not a unified army fighting the same foe. Every one of us is grappling with a different mix of mental and physical dysfunctions. Dozens of medical conditions deprive people of sleep; these include apnea, Parkinson\u2019s disease, chronic pain, depression, brain injury, autism and restless legs syndrome.For a while I followed the rules of \u201csleep hygiene\u201d \u2014 a tough-love approach that includes dragging yourself out of bed during wakeful periods, and allowing yourself to crawl back under the covers only when you feel sleepy. But I never felt sleepy. And in our frigid New England house in winter, it was excruciating to be exiled from the wool blankets; I felt humiliated, like a bad dog, as I put one foot and then another down on the cold floor and slunk off to another room. Even the name of the therapy shamed me: The word \u201chygiene\u201d had an old-fashioned sting to it, an implication that the way I slept was filthy and needed to be scoured.So that\u2019s why I \u2014 the dirty, disreputable insomniac \u2014 took matters into my own hands. I found a stretchy sock that was long enough to wrap around my head like a blindfold. Then I sewed the sock into a circle, from toe to topstitch, making sure it fit securely, so that it would stay in place no matter how I tossed and turned on the pillow. I cut two slits in the inner layer of fabric, sewing stitches to create button-hole-like openings. And then I found an old pair of earbuds, sewed foam around each bud, and threaded the foam-bumps into holes in the headgear. This way, the gizmo would hold the speakers near my ears, but not in them \u2014 more comfortable for sleeping. Once I had finished, I attached a cheap MP3 player (made by SanDisk) to the rig. Now I could roll my head around, doze, slumber or pad to the bathroom, all while listening to the new voice in my head.My boyfriend said that he felt as if he were sleeping next to a hostage. But weird as it looked, the device offered relief. I\u2019d cue up an audiobook and a monologue would commence, blotting out my own thoughts. Instead of laboring to calm myself, I could just drift on the voice pumped into my head. I began to wear the machine all night long, floating in and out of sleep, comforted that whatever happened, the narrator would stay with me.After I\u2019d built my headgear, I discovered companies were selling similar devices online \u2014 usually in the form of fleece headbands outfitted with flat earphones. I tried some out, but I found they weren\u2019t snug enough to stay in place, so I still use my D.I.Y. gear.Of course, the insomnia machine is a humble hack. The real challenge lay in curating the audio: It took trial and error to find material that could tame my midnight mind.At first, I loaded the machine with the kind of dry disquisitions that, according to conventional wisdom, bring on sleep; I turned to books like \u201cDirt: The Erosion of Civilizations,\u201d an important jeremiad about soil quality that is not super-entertaining. But the drone in my ears didn\u2019t keep my mind busy enough, so instead I began to pick out funny, engaging and friendly books. When I enjoyed those hours of wakefulness, I no longer tried to sleep, and when I stopped trying to sleep, I slept.The slow pace of 19th-century novels and memoirs is perfect for an insomnia machine: You fall asleep when the characters are having dinner, and when you wake up they\u2019ve only reached the drawing room. It feels as if you\u2019re surrounded by friends, dozing comfortably in a corner as life carries on.\u201cHow is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!\u201d Rostov thought. His horse had collapsed underneath him, and blood streamed from the poor creature\u2019s head. Rostov staggered to his feet and looked around the empty meadow, feeling as if he must be in a dream. Was he in enemy territory? Where were the other soldiers?And now I was sleeping. Wakefulness, that galloping horse, had fallen to the ground underneath me. I waded through fields of grass while Tolstoy monologued at me. I wanted to warn him to shut up and take cover, for Napoleon\u2019s spies watched us from the hillside, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. Still, I was glad to have Tolstoy by my side, leading me through that desolate meadow.Literature did not cure my insomnia, but transformed it into a manageable condition, and so I feel enormously grateful to the internet and its crowd of volunteers for providing thousands of hours of literary medicine. I think of Jorge Luis Borges, who lamented that he had been put in charge of Argentina\u2019s National Library after he\u2019d gone blind and was unable to peruse a single page. Today we live in a splendor that Borges might have dreamed into existence, a library we can stumble through in the dark.In 1886, the author Franklin Harvey Head reported that his contemporaries regarded insomnia as a \u201cmodern and even an almost distinctively American disease\u201d brought about by the hustle-bustle of the railroad and the telegraph. As wires spread across the country and incandescent bulbs burned away the stars, some warned about what would happen when electrification spread into rural towns. Surely, chickens would die of insomnia \u2014 and presumably the farmers, too.Whenever a new technology comes along, we inevitably blame it for ruining our sleep. Today, we believe that phones and laptops will scramble our sleep, even though the evidence of that is thin. Few studies have been done to find out whether digital media can set off insomnia in adults, and the findings of what research has been done tend to be contradictory. Nonetheless, many health professionals recommend that we banish all digital devices from our bedrooms.Most important, the internet is becoming a place for insomniacs to gather together and figure out what works, to share insights and help one another.For instance, in 2013, Drew Ackerman created a podcast to lead listeners into slumberland. Now, three times a week, he climbs into a makeshift studio in the back of a closet and spins whimsical stories about matters of no importance. \u201cFasten your sleep-belts,\u201d he might murmur in a codeine drawl before jumping into a tale about the glug-glug-glug sound of a water cooler.Mr. Ackerman has no training as a sleep doctor or health professional. He, too, found salvation from insomnia in audiobooks, specifically aboard the Pequod, squinting out at the 19th-century sea as he floated along on Melville\u2019s words. That experience led him to wonder whether he could fine-tune audio as a therapy.Nowadays, about 70,000 listeners download each episode of his podcast, and reviewers attest to the power of this treatment. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled to fall asleep for most of my 37 years,\u201d writes DaileyComputer. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything \u2014 changing my diet, exercise, meditation, pills, you name it.\u201d He continues: \u201cNothing helps consistently. Except this podcast.\u201dMr. Ackerman treats insomnia as a disease of existential loneliness. \u201cI hear from so many people who listen to the podcast while their partners are sound asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might be in bed with somebody who loves them. But in that situation, it\u2019s the deep dark night, and you\u2019re all alone.\u201dAnd so Mr. Ackerman has created an alter ego named Dearest Scooter who hosts the show and acts as your \u201cbore-friend.\u201d In the bunk bed of your mind, he\u2019s the compassionate brother lying a few feet above you, a voice in the darkness promising he\u2019ll talk until you drift off.He\u2019s also the antithesis of the sleep-hygiene therapists. He doesn\u2019t shame, he commiserates; he knows how horrible insomnia is, and he\u2019s here for you.\u201cPeople need to be validated,\u201d Mr. Ackerman said. \u201cIf I\u2019m thirsty, I drink; if I\u2019m hungry, I can eat. But when I want to sleep, that\u2019s not under my control. And that\u2019s why this is such a painful mystery.\u201dSo many of us are muddling along, finding relief where we can get it. At least we have one another. At 2 in the morning, with my insomnia machine strapped to my head, I listen to a volunteer reading George Meredith\u2019s \u201cThe Egoist\u201d in a South Indian lilt. As every parent knows, there is magic in the human voice telling a story; this is the oldest and most primitive insomnia treatment. In the dark hours, when we\u2019re wandering in the wilderness of thought, sometimes we just need to feel that someone, even a digital someone with a prerecorded voice, is watching over us.Listening to 19th-century novels and memoirs helps Pagan Kennedy defeat insomnia.

{"Headline": "Madrid for Kids? Try D.I.Y. Spanish Immersion", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal JourneysLike many first-generation Americans my age, I learned Spanish on the fly. My Panamanian mother spoke to my brother and me in Spanish. We answered in English. Back then, in New York City in the late 1970s and \u201980s, being able to speak flawless English was a prize. When people complimented me on how well I spoke, my family members beamed.I eventually learned to read, write and speak Spanish on my own. It was an important way to connect with my heritage since the language unifies Latinos of every national origin and race. But I would never be mistaken for a native speaker, could never let loose a torrent of Spanish words like the heroine of an Almod\u00f3var movie. My accent isn\u2019t perfect but all across Spain, from the Costa del Sol to Granada, from Bilbao to Barcelona, I have had the happy experience of being able to understand every menu, every movie poster and every sign.I was determined that my daughter, Flora \u2014 born the year that President Obama reminded us in his campaign that S\u00ed, se puede (Yes, we can) \u2014 would learn to speak Spanish early, and better than I did. So we moved to Hoboken, N.J., where she could attend a Spanish-language immersion school. And as she prepared to enter the fourth grade, I decided to move to Madrid for a month so that she could live like a Spanish girl, and I could work on my own accent (ay la verguenza! or Oh the shame!).It helped that she had already gotten to know \u2014 and love \u2014 the city during a short business trip two years ago when we had taken her along. My husband could work from there and planned to enjoy the food and the gin and tonics (the cocktail of choice in Madrid) in between business meetings and communicating with his New York office. My husband isn\u2019t Latino, but we\u2019ve made a decision to raise our daughter with an emphasis on her Latina heritage. Decamping to Madrid for a month was a way of keeping that cultural focus front and center, to say that, in our family, we\u2019re passionate about Spanish language, movies, theater, art, books and food. I wanted to make it a vacation with a purpose, and my job, as the adult who speaks Spanish, would be to make it all seamless and fun.The dance slowed a bit the next day when my husband discovered the reason there were free slots: Cervantes\u2019s childhood home is a good 50-minute train ride east of the city center, in a town called Alcal\u00e1 de Henares. Our daughter didn\u2019t care much, though. The ride, she said, gave her an opportunity to learn how tickets work on a different train system. Madrid\u2019s system is more like Paris\u2019s and less like the swipe and smart cards of New York and New Jersey, she said. By the workshop\u2019s last day she was on first-name basis with the museum staff and local girls, and had grown fond of the 17th-century wooden toilet in an upstairs bedroom. We ended the week with her high-fiving the life-size sculptures of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza that stand guard in front of Cervantes\u2019s home.The second week of our trip Flora would attend the weeklong camp at Museo Thyssen. On our previous trip, she had done a one-day workshop there, and we had all been struck by how engaged the staff was with the children. Before the program began, they sat one on one with each participant and asked them questions in Spanish such as: \u201cHave you been to this museum before? Do you like to make art or see art, neither or both?\u201d The theme of the camp was \u201cthe Laboratorio of Dr. Haustein,\u201d a mystery they built around a portrait in the gallery. During the week the children are challenged to use the museum and the children\u2019s lab on the ground floor to answer these questions: Are scientists artists? Can artists be scientists?The day before camp started, my daughter was nervous. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t speak the language.\u201d I reminded her that she does. She said, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t make any friends?\u201d I told her that I hoped that she would. At the end of the first day, she was excited to report that the Spanish was easy to understand and that she had made two friends, a British girl who attends school in Madrid and a German girl whose family has a summer home in Spain. That both girls were three years older than her and leaned on her to translate when they didn\u2019t understand made her immensely proud. She had gone from a 9-year-old to a tween in un momento.But we came to Spain as much for the language as we did for an immersion in its culture. During our last week in town, we were joined by friends whose son does not speak Spanish. This turned out not to be any problem at all because our friend\u2019s son spoke two universal languages: food and soccer.The fact that some hard-working chef spent the time to blow dozens of little lemon-scented spheres to resemble caviar is a miracle to me. It was a big win with the kids, as were the chef\u2019s take on traditional Spanish tapas. They devoured an entire plate of deconstructed patatas bravas, the fried roughly cut chunks of potatoes drizzled with tomato aioli. No matter how refined and experimental the execution of the dish, fried potatoes are always a winner, as are bombas, the traditional Barcelona dish of mashed potato balls stuffed with beef. At the end of the meal, each member of the party was given a freshly printed menu of the tasting, describing what they ate. The kids loved this, too.On our last night in town, I booked a table at Luzi Bomb\u00f3n, a sleek, stylish restaurant on the Paseo de la Castellana, Madrid\u2019s answer to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. I had heard that there was music on Thursday night so I booked for then. We arrived at 10 p.m., our daughter in tow, and the hostess did not blink: She seated us at a great table, next to a wall of open glass doors. We could see out to the Paseo and could feel the breeze as the city finally began to cool down. I thought that music would mean live musicians: a guy with a guitar, perhaps, or a jazz trio. I was so surprised when I realized that \u201cmusic\u201d meant a D.J. who was Spanish and had a fondness for \u201990s rap and R&B.My daughter, exhausted from weeks away from home, promptly fell asleep on my lap, minutes after we arrived. This left my husband and me free to enjoy dinner to the beat of all our hip-hop favorites from Biggie Smalls to LL Cool J to Cypress Hill and everything in between.A year ago when I\u2019d suggested that our family rent an apartment in Madrid for the month of July, my husband had thought it was a crazy idea. But we found a beautiful, affordable apartment with high-speed Wi-Fi that enabled us to work as much as we needed to. Our daughter attended one camp and two museum workshops and walked away with not only improved Spanish but also the email addresses of two new friends with whom she hoped to keep in touch. We hosted two dinner parties on the deck of our Madrid apartment, one for friends who we discovered were in Madrid only after seeing them post photos on Facebook.For me, the Spanish language was always more than a door into a deeper level of my family life and our own particular heritage. It was access to a culture that would take (and has taken) me around the world. By the end of our month in Madrid, I felt a little like Vel\u00e1zquez. Our family had, if only for a few short weeks, painted ourselves into the canvas of Spanish life.A trip to Madrid with your child doesn\u2019t have to be stressful. Here are some major stops to keep it fun and educational.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hajj Prep: Search Soul, Buy Sturdy Shoes, Pay the Dentist", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJIDDA, Saudi Arabia \u2014 My father was on the phone from Australia, giving gravely voiced advice on preparing for the hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.\u201cHave you paid the dentist?\u201d he asked.\u201cHe ruined my teeth!\u201d I shrieked.\u201cNo matter, Baba,\u201d he said, using an Arabic endearment. \u201cThis is the hajj. You have to clear your debts, even if you don\u2019t think they are fair.\u201dThe hajj is a five-day pilgrimage of centuries-old rites that honor a birth story of Islam, a trek every Muslim is supposed to undertake at least once. It is a spiritual as well as physical journey, and requires preparations in both spheres.So I had to buy new shoes suitable for long days of walking and safe to wear in surging crowds. I was supposed to seek the forgiveness of anyone I have wronged \u2014 and forgive everybody who had wronged me. And I had to clear my debts.There is a dentist in the West Bank city of Ramallah who badly damaged my teeth this year, costing me thousands of dollars, days of pain and lasting emotional distress. This dentist has sent me nasty notes, threatening to use his \u201cconnections\u201d to destroy my reputation if I did not pay him his outstanding bill of about $1,000.I protested to my father, crying a little. \u201cGod will compensate you,\u201d he soothed. \u201cAnd then when you see that man again, you can raise your head up high and know he has nothing on you.\u201dAngry and resentful, I paid the dentist. I also made amends with the greedy landlord who refused to return my $2,650 security deposit. Eventually, I landed here in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, only to find that my suitcase containing my clothes, photo-card reader, computer charger, and contact lenses had been lost, and I had to forgive the luggage handlers, too.For hundreds of years, pilgrims have come to Saudi Arabia to sanctify God in Islam\u2019s holiest site, heeding the command of the Quran: \u201cAnd proclaim to mankind the hajj. They will come to you on foot, on very lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant mountain highway.\u201dToday, they also come by bus and aircraft. They traverse between sites in air-conditioned corridors with lanes for those who are older and disabled. They eat in modern malls nearby, and some pay $2,700 a night to stay in towering hotels with views of the Haram, the sprawling mosque built around the black, cube-shaped building known as the Kaaba.I grew up in a observant Egyptian-Lebanese Muslim family in Canberra, Australia, and at 15 started wearing the hijab. I prayed regularly, memorized the Quran and sought to study Shariah, Islamic law.But my faith began to shatter in college. I was 20 when I took off my head scarf, feeling I could no longer visibly represent a religion that did not allow women to preach before men, lead them in prayer or serve as witnesses in some judicial matters.Now, at 38, I have a tangled relationship with Islam. It is the bedrock of my values. It informs how I smile at strangers, give to charity and try to be patient with dentists and landlords. But I date, I own a (modest) bikini, and while I still fast during the holy month of Ramadan, I do not exactly adhere to Islam\u2019s other prescriptions.Still, I had always dreamed of doing the hajj. My oldest sister, Marwa, a farmer in rural New South Wales, and I planned to take a year off and walk to the Kaaba, as the great Sufi woman Rabia al-Adawiya did in the eighth century, from Basra, Iraq. It was one of those bucket-list items that got kicked back as life happened.Then a few months ago, a colleague suggested that I apply for a journalist visa to cover the hajj. I posed for a fresh passport photo wearing a black head scarf, red lipstick, and a scowl.\u201cAre you a Muslim, sister?\u201d the man at the Saudi Embassy in Jordan asked, looking suspiciously at the photo.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I said, pointing to my rather poetic name, Diaa el-Radwa, the Light of Radwa.Radwa is a mountain in Medina, the second-holiest city in Islam. The man stamped my passport with the visa.Suddenly, it was real.In the weeks since, I have sometimes found myself crying as I realized I would soon lay my own eyes on the Kaaba, which is empty \u2014 a reminder that the heart of Islam is the worship of a singular, inimitable God. I am also dreading the crowds, the heat and the logistics, and especially the minder whom the Saudi Ministry of Information assigns to follow journalists everywhere. And I\u2019m anxious about my parents\u2019 expectations.Then there was the matter of footwear.I had been planning to wear hiking boots \u2014 sturdy, comfortable, and nobody would squash my toes. My mum quickly nixed that notion. \u201cIf you wear shoelaces,\u201d she warned in halting English, \u201cmen will try grab you as bend over to untie them.\u201dMum has undertaken the pilgrimage several times, and said nothing worked better than socks and Crocs \u2014 easy to slip on and off. Crocs I got. But socks? Because, she explained, people pee everywhere, and you want to avoid stepping in that.A survivor\u2019s story of how he was almost crushed to death at the 2015 hajj.Instead, I bought braided leather sandals. And socks.I have taken my sister Arwa\u2019s advice of wearing a long robe with a zipper, instead of buttons, so nobody can rip it open. Per my mother\u2019s instruction, I tailored it to sit above my ankles, so I won\u2019t trip. (It\u2019s much harder for men, who may wear only two seamless white sheets. That\u2019s it. No underwear, nothing. I can\u2019t imagine working like that.)Hijab is of course required; I have added an elastic band, so if the scarf slips, I won\u2019t reveal any strands. My brother Saif says people get really angry at women who look immodest.In the bag I will keep clutched to my chest I have a camera, a notepad, an iPhone, disinfectant gel, medicine for diarrhea, and antibiotics. My brother says it\u2019s too dangerous to let my camera or anything else dangle from my neck; it could get snagged.\u201cI cannot begin to describe the crowds,\u201d he wrote on our family WhatsApp group. \u201cYou will often be stuck in human traffic moving only by the will of people around you, almost like a wave carrying you.\u201dSaif undertook the hajj four years ago, when he was 31.\u201cYou may get shoved out of the way by a burly Turkish woman,\u201d my brother continued. \u201cA man might think it is his God-given right to pee in front of you. Just be patient and know why you are there in the first place.\u201dHe called a few days later: \u201cListen, I forgot to tell you something.\u201d\u201cDo your business before you go anywhere,\u201d my brother said, describing how he once had to wait two or three hours to move perhaps 50 yards to a hotel. \u201cToilets, toilets, be very conscious of where they are and how you can get there.\u201d Diarrhea is an ever-present threat. \u201cYou might need to find a quick escape route to a bathroom.\u201dMy father chimed in: \u201cBuy your dates in Taif,\u201d a Saudi city near the holy sites. There, he said, \u201cthey only cost a couple of dollars a kilo. If you buy them in Mecca or Medina, it\u2019s around $35 a kilo. Everything is more expensive there.\u201dAnd then, Arwa, who made the journey in 2004, refocused me.\u201cThe spiritual feeling overtakes\u201d these earthly issues, \u201cthe people that rip you off, the men that are sexually assaulting people in front of you,\u201d she wrote on WhatsApp. \u201cIt takes over all of that. It\u2019s beautiful and unforgettable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Sitcom \u2018Speechless\u2019 Understands Families Like Mine", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSpeechless\u201d is a classic domestic comedy \u2014 yes, a comedy \u2014 centered on a 16-year-old named JJ DiMeo who has cerebral palsy, can\u2019t speak and uses an alternative-communication device to express himself. He\u2019s the eldest of three children, and he\u2019s played by Micah Fowler, who himself has cerebral palsy, a casting decision that alone makes this series stand out.Minnie Driver portrays his mother, Maya, who like a lot of parents of children with disabilities sometimes turns into a wild-eyed, not-always-rational warrior for her son. JJ has two siblings (Mason Cook and Kyla Kenedy) whose own needs tend to get overlooked, a common thing in such households. John Ross Bowie plays the father, Jimmy, who struggles to keep Maya from sailing off the edge.There\u2019s a reason for that: The show\u2019s creator, Scott Silveri, grew up in a home much like the one in \u201cSpeechless,\u201d with a nonverbal brother with cerebral palsy and other health issues.\u201cIt\u2019s a story that I\u2019ve been wanting to tell as long as I\u2019ve been writing,\u201d said Mr. Silveri, who has written and been a producer for \u201cFriends\u201d and other shows. \u201cNot so much focused on doing a story about disability; I was really interested in doing a family show and exploring how one family member with a disability affects everybody else and turns them into the specific kind of weirdos that they become.\u201dIt is largely unexplored territory. For decades, enduring TV characters with a disability were rare. Name one from the medium\u2019s first 50 years. \u201cIronside,\u201d says practically everyone. Name five more? Not so easy.That is a difficult character to make appealing, and putting him in network prime time in a central role is as bold, in its way, as television\u2019s first single mother or black lead or transgender story line was. A quarter-century ago, ABC took a similar risk with \u201cLife Goes On,\u201d about a family with a Down syndrome child, a role played by Chris Burke, who has Down syndrome. That show, though, was a drama, which is what \u201coutsiders\u201d might expect: Disability equals struggle equals nothing but pain and misery.The casting of an actor with a disability has caused its own buzz, but Mr. Fowler won\u2019t merely be playing himself. He has a milder form of cerebral palsy than his character (he can speak, for instance) and had to study up on how JJ would move and use his device. Could an actor without a disability have done the same as credibly? For Mr. Fowler, there\u2019s no question.\u201cLiving every day with the challenges of a disability allows me to bring a rawness to the character and bring him to life with my unique perspectives,\u201d he said in an email interview.If actors with special needs will be pulling for the show, so will a lot of parents of children with disabilities. Ms. Driver is keenly aware of carrying those hopes.\u201cIt gives me goose bumps thinking that,\u201d she said. \u201cTo actually represent a body of people whose story hasn\u2019t been told \u2014 that\u2019s very gratifying.\u201dThough I\u2019ve been writing as \u201cus,\u201d one thing you learn quickly when you have a child with a disability is that there is no \u201cdisability community\u201d; the opinions, aspirations and beliefs within that world are as wildly divergent as in the population at large. So I won\u2019t presume to say what \u201cwe\u201d want \u201cSpeechless\u201d to accomplish; only what I\u2019d like.I hope it gives another, especially hard, kick to the door that has made characters and actors with disabilities so scarce on TV. And I hope it helps break down the sense of isolation that envelops families like the DiMeos. Many people still either stare or look away when they see someone like JJ. I don\u2019t expect that those reactions will ever disappear. Maybe \u201cSpeechless\u201d will make them a little less common.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dos Equis Makes Its Case for Its New \u2018Most Interesting Man\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingFOR nearly a decade, Dos Equis has advertised its beer through a pitchman known as the \u201cMost Interesting Man in the World.\u201dTypically clad in a white button-down shirt and black blazer, the bearded, gray-haired gentleman would be shown in commercials bench-pressing chairs holding nurses or doing handstands on a horse while a narrator dryly delivered hyperbolic testaments to his greatness. \u201cHis charm is so contagious, vaccines have been created for it,\u201d one said. \u201cIf he were to pat you on the back, you would list it on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d went another.The campaign and its witty lines have been a big success, helping to send sales of Dos Equis soaring since 2007 and making a star out of the most interesting man himself, a 77-year-old actor named Jonathan Goldsmith.Dos Equis, hoping for a seamless transition, likened the move to picking a new actor to play James Bond, but it has put the brand in the awkward position of explaining why the previous Most Interesting Man in the World was no longer interesting enough. Mr. Goldsmith, after all, has been the face of the campaign since it started.Andrew Katz, the vice president for marketing for Dos Equis, denied that the change was made because Mr. Goldsmith had \u201caged out.\u201d\u201cIt had more to do with really trying to evolve the campaign story line,\u201d Mr. Katz said in an interview. \u201cThis new interesting man is more resourceful, he\u2019s more willing to roll up his sleeves and he is more present tense than past tense.\u201dMr. Katz added that the meaning of the word \u201cinteresting\u201d has \u201cobviously evolved over time\u201d and that millennials in particular \u201cvalue different things\u201d than other generations. To underscore that, Dos Equis said it had conducted a survey in February of about 1,000 men ages 21 to 35, in which 84 percent of respondents said that \u201cwhat is interesting today is different from what was interesting a decade ago.\u201dThe transition shows how tricky it is for a company to form such a strong attachment with a single representative, said Allen Adamson, a brand strategy consultant whose clients have included Samuel Adams and the spirits company Diageo.Brands have an easier time with animated characters like Mr. Clean or figures like Colonel Sanders of KFC \u201cwhere you can control the image and keep it and freeze it in time,\u201d he said. (To that point, KFC has hired at least four actors to play the colonel in the last year and a half, including the comedians Darrell Hammond and Jim Gaffigan.)\u201cThere\u2019s always a risk anytime you make a change that people will ask what\u2019s going on, especially when you\u2019ve branded that person \u2018the most interesting guy\u2019 and given them a superlative,\u201d Mr. Adamson said. \u201cThen the eyes will be more critical to: \u2018Do I believe it? Do I like it? How does he compare to that other guy?\u2019\u201dMr. Goldsmith, who turns 78 this month, said that it was not his decision to leave the brand but that he wishes Dos Equis \u201cthe very best in every way.\u201d When asked about his appeal among different age groups, he said he was \u201cvery privileged to have the demographics from 7 to 80.\u201d\u201cThese corporate decisions are just that, and I have very little comment on that,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s their campaign and they did what they did. Time will tell about the success of it, but you know, that\u2019s business.\u201dMr. Katz said Mr. Legrand would be more active and adventurous than his predecessor, though the campaign will maintain its \u201clegend lines,\u201d which is how the brand refers to remarks like: \u201cHis fortune cookies simply read \u2018Congratulations.\u2019\u201dA clip on YouTube introducing Mr. Legrand last week showed a montage of scenes in which he exits a rocket ship, flees down an alleyway and emerges drenched from a well to return a soccer ball to a group of men. It was narrated in Spanish with subtitles, one of the languages Mr. Legrand speaks, which Mr. Katz said was an effort to \u201clean into our authenticity\u201d as a Mexican beer. (When asked whether it considered casting a Latino actor to play the role, Dos Equis said it chose to \u201cnot limit ourselves to a specific ethnicity or region,\u201d noting the beer was made by a German brewmaster in Mexico.)But it will most likely take time for consumers to associate a new face with the brand.\u201cThe actor is obviously important, but at the end of the day we think the campaign itself is the thing that people love,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cIt\u2019s the framework that\u2019s just so strong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Television news broadcasts ran with the story, as thousands of people registered their anger in comment threads on social sites like Facebook and Reddit \u2014 one more reminder not to believe everything you read on social media.After all the commotion, the university has made clear the reports are untrue.The campus, which serves about 28,000 students, roughly 4 percent of them African-American, has indeed created a dorm space for 24 students oriented around the black community, a spokesman, Robert Lopez, said on Wednesday.But, it\u2019s \u201copen to all students.\u201d\u201cThis living-learning community focuses on academic excellence and learning experiences that are inclusive and nondiscriminatory,\u201d Mr. Lopez said.Residential communities organized around themes like race and gender are neither rare nor new on American college campuses.Opponents argue that such programs promote racial silos and degrade the quality of learning, while supporters say they provide a sense of belonging to minority students who face discrimination.\u201cYou can go and be yourself and not have to worry about explaining how you\u2019re doing because of your skin color,\u201d he said.Cal State officials and black student leaders both rejected the depictions of the housing program as segregationist.\u201cThis is not new,\u201d he said.Readers weigh in on the issues important to them:I live in L.A. and just about everyone here agrees our biggest problem is traffic.

{"Headline": "Behind the Scenes With Shimon Peres", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI was on my way to Afghanistan in 2013 when I received a call from my editor asking me to stop in Jerusalem and photograph Shimon Peres, who was about to celebrate his 90th birthday.The difficulty of photographing a world leader is to see past his carefully curated persona in order to reveal a more intimate portrait.Mr. Peres, then the president of Israel, evoked both the weight and levity of accumulated wisdom. Whether in the sanctuary of his official residence or among the throng of admirers vying for his ear at an endless stream of public appearances, he possessed the grandeur of a man who had spent his life making history.His schedule was relentless. I began photographing him one day just after dawn. In the quiet of the morning, he adjusted his tie, pushed on his cuff links as he fielded phone calls, and sat down to work methodically on a speech.Despite his long list of accomplishments over seven decades in politics, he was humble and industrious, sharp and focused.His age meant that he had outlived many of his friends, colleagues and family members. Experience had taught him that regrets were futile. As he was whisked from an elementary school to a tech conference to a wedding, he appeared to hover above the frenzy.Before his death at 93, Mr. Peres served as Israel\u2019s defense minister, finance minister and transportation minister, and twice as prime minister. When I met him, he was six years into a seven-year term as president.I have spent most of my career covering strife and suffering in the Middle East and Africa. And at the end of the day with Shimon Peres, I wondered whether anyone could ever have enough power or wisdom to bring peace to the region.A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s first prime minister, Mr. Peres was the last of the nation\u2019s founders still in office in 2013. He stretched the largely ceremonial contours of the presidency by speaking out on the urgency of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and against a unilateral Israeli attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.His public career paralleled the development of the modern state of Israel. \u201cI never dreamed we should be eight million people,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2013. \u201cI never knew that there will be more Hebrew-speaking people than, say, Danish-speaking people.\u201d\u201cFor me, work is not tiring but enjoying,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like vacations. I think this is another invention which is foolish. I see a person sitting on the shore of the sea with a dog, I say, \u2018My God, what is he doing there?\u2019 He can better read. He can better think.\u201dWhen his term ended in 2014, Mr. Peres moved from the presidential residence to a modest apartment he owns in Tel Aviv and continued to promote his ideas on medical research, teaching English in Israeli kindergartens and providing free food for children until age 3.\u201cWhen did civilizations start?\u201d he asked while adjusting his tie before a meeting during my 2013 visit. \u201cWhen a very primitive instrument was introduced: the mirror. Before the mirror, people didn\u2019t comb their hair, didn\u2019t cut their nails. With a mirror, everybody washes himself any morning, without any order from the government.\u201dAt the wedding of the daughter of the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Mr. Peres posed with the family for pictures and left immediately after the ceremony.Mr. Peres then spoke at a technology conference. In his interview with The Times, he lauded Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, for making \u201ca revolution without revolutionaries, a revolution without bloodshed.\u201dAsked whether he regretted his early support for Israeli settlements or ordering the assassination of a Palestinian master bomb-maker, Mr. Peres said: \u201cThe past for sure is unchangeable, so what can I do with my regrets? I\u2019m trying to mobilize all my energies to understand what is next.\u201dOf the myriad public positions he held over the years, Mr. Peres told The Times that his favorite was among his first: director general of the Defense Ministry in the 1950s.\u201cTo end poverty,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to do a very simple thing: to teach the children English, which is a global language. Otherwise, you will remain provincial.

The protest was viewed widely as the sequel to a 2014 stand against federal power in Nevada. That confrontation was led by the men\u2019s father, Cliven Bundy, a rancher.The Oregon occupation was billed by its leaders as a political protest and a rallying point for frustrated ranchers who wanted to reclaim land under federal control.

The occupiers ultimately failed to achieve their goal of forcing Washington to hand the sanctuary over to the county.The occupation was led by Ammon Bundy, now 41, and his brother Ryan Bundy, now 43. During the occupation, at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, it often felt as if Ammon Bundy was in charge.

{"Headline": "The Age of Distrust", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 I have a profound respect for the intelligence of the voter. Winston Churchill is often quoted as saying that the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter, but more important is what he actually said in the House of Commons on Oct. 31, 1944: \u201cAt the bottom of all the tributes paid to democracy is the little man, walking into the little booth, with a little pencil, making a little cross on a little bit of paper \u2014 no amount of rhetoric or voluminous discussion can possibly palliate the overwhelming importance of that point.\u201dNobody, looking back at the first 16 years of this century, can suggest that the political, economic and financial elites who brought you the euro crisis, the war in Iraq, the Great Recession of 2008, growing inequality and (at least until last year in the United States) middle-class income stagnation have not made some very serious mistakes, of very enduring consequences, with very startling impunity. This has not been lost on the little woman with the little pencil in the little booth.No wonder experts are increasingly viewed as being in the business of bamboozling for their own ends. Ordinary folk reckon the system is rigged, that elites are not in it for the people but, rather, the money. This is the Age of Distrust. No two presidential candidates have ever been as distrusted as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.The grave mistakes that I have mentioned occurred in the midst of a technological whirlwind that moved factories offshore and migrants onshore, and offered huge opportunity for the initiated at the hubs of globalization\u2019s churn while stripping many outlying places and outcast people of their raison d\u2019\u00eatre.Technology is a wonderful thing if you are putting it to use, less so if it is putting an end to your usefulness.Many people in our liberal democracies feel they are being tossed hither and thither by forces beyond their control \u2014 nowhere more so than in Greece where national elections in recent years \u2014 and there have been a lot of them \u2014 have revealed an almost complete disconnect between the vote itself and any tangible effect. What then is democracy, a mere game?There has been another whirlwind, a cultural one. As Sylvie Kauffmann has suggested, when Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, says the world must not move in a single direction \u2014 \u201ctoward a new mix of cultures and races, a world of cyclists and vegetarians\u201d \u2014 he is expressing a nativist anti-liberal resurgence.All this unease has been compounded by the sense of insecurity instilled by jihadi terrorism and other violence. A bombing in New York and a stabbing attack at a Minnesota mall are still under investigation, but whatever their origin they will impact an already tense American election.All this is the backdrop to Trump, to Marine Le Pen in France, to Brexit, to the nationalist governments dominating central Europe, to the rise in Germany of the rightist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, to the vogue for authoritarian models \u2014 in short to the challenges facing liberal democracies. Marx noted that history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. The British exit from the European Union was the exception \u2014 simultaneous tragedy and farce, a disaster abetted by lies, energized by a buffoon and consummated in mayhem.This was the moment when it became irrefutable that some of the very foundations of the postwar world and the spread of liberal democracy \u2014 free trade, free markets, more open borders, fact-based debate, ever greater integration \u2014 had collapsed.I am pessimistic in the short-term, optimistic in the long-term.I am pessimistic because the problems cannot be righted in short order. Politicians are going to have to work very hard to earn back the trust of the people. A serious issue exists with what Stephen Walt of Harvard University has called the \u201cruling elites in many liberal societies and especially the United States, where money and special interests have created a corrupt political class that is out-of-touch with ordinary people, interested mostly in enriching themselves, and immune to accountability.\u201d This has to end.Democracy has to deliver \u2014 not just to the rich but the most vulnerable. This is a fundamental lesson of recent times.When democracy creates wealth on a broad scale there is no tension between it and capitalism. But when that is not the case, the value of democracy becomes less clear to some. There are tremendous tensions between democratic national sovereignty, open global markets and mass migration.The answer is not to build walls. Western societies need to build education and innovation and opportunity. A time of great uncertainty is upon the world.Still, I believe in the resilience of liberal democracy, in the little man in the little booth. Greece knows that the democratic idea is stubborn.Technology has prized the world open. Nobody \u2014 not Vladimir Putin, not Xi Jinping, not Trump \u2014 can shatter that interconnectedness. Nor can anybody quash forever the human desire to be free and to live under the only form of government consistent with that desire \u2014 representative government installed with the consent of the people.Liberalism demands acceptance of our human differences and the ability to mediate them through democratic institutions. It demands acceptance of multiple, perhaps incompatible truths. In an age of polarization and vilification this may seem a lofty aspiration. But democracies have a habit of rising to the challenges they face.Democracies need to be challenged, unlike dictatorships that fear broad challenge because it may cause them to buckle. Challenge in democracies is also rebirth.Respect the intelligence of voters. Sooner or later they come to their senses. Churchill was kicked out of office in an election in 1945, just months after defeating Hitler. Talk about gratitude. He was re-elected in 1951.Advertisement"}

Mr. Tillery offered documents from two veterinarians to confirm the dog\u2019s breed, hoping that would prevent the authorities from taking his dog.On Tuesday, Diggy, Mr. Tillery and their supporters got news that would let them smile again: Charges were dismissed in the 51st District Court, assuring that dog and owner could stay together.\u201cImmediately upon receipt of the signed and notarized affidavits from the veterinarians, we agreed that the charges should be dismissed,\u201d Margaret Scott, a prosecutor in Waterford Township, said in an email.It was an ending that satisfied dog lovers who feared that the dog and Mr. Tillery would have to be separated soon after a match that had appeared to start so well.\u201cPeople had really invested their emotions into this story, and it\u2019s beautiful to see so many people care about rescue dogs,\u201d said Kristina Rinaldi, the director of the Detroit Dog Rescue, a no-kill shelter.Rescue workers occasionally collect dogs from Detroit Animal Control; on one visit, workers loaded 12 dogs into a van before Diggy caught Ms. Rinaldi\u2019s eye, she said. He was in one of the kennels, looking sad, and all of the volunteers said they wanted to give him a chance. With no more room in the van, she loaded the dog into her own car.He was originally named Sir Wiggleton because of a \u201cfunky butt wiggle\u201d he would do when he was excited, she said.Rescue workers put him through the usual process: He was given medical treatments and socialized, playing with other dogs at day care.

{"Headline": "27 Million Potential Hispanic Votes. But What Will They Really Add Up To?", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFeature\u201cI want you to say it and to believe it,\u201d Praeli instructed. \u201cI want you to say it and to commit yourself.\u201d She smiled, but these were marching orders. \u201cIf we don\u2019t believe it, other people won\u2019t believe,\u201d Praeli said in Spanish. \u201cIf we don\u2019t believe it in this room, we won\u2019t be the difference in November.\u201dLooking for answers, I spent six months interviewing scores of Latinos in Virginia, a battleground state where the Latino share of the population has more than tripled since 1990. I met with Latino Catholics, Pentecostals and Mormons, with legal residents, citizens and undocumented immigrants. I frequented a church and a community center, soccer fields and a dance club. I lurked around Republican and Democratic events and a skateboard park. I interviewed custodians and construction workers, lawyers and real estate agents, restaurant owners and community organizers, college students and political staffers. In all, I spoke with more than 100 Virginians of various ethnic backgrounds.For all the energy that activists, especially on the Democratic side, have put into turning out the Latino vote, I met strikingly few Latinos outside the upper-middle class who talked about voting as if it were something they did regularly. The exceptions tended to be people like Luc\u00eda Rodriguez, 61, who cleans houses and has voted regularly for more than a decade \u2014 even in 2008 after she and her husband, a custodian, saw all their savings vanish in the mortgage crisis. For years afterward, they scrambled to keep their family afloat, working every available hour. Yet she kept on voting. Why? \u201cIt\u2019s a civic duty,\u201d she said. Rodriguez explained that in Bolivia, where she had been an accountant, she learned the habit of voting because nonvoters could be penalized with fines. In her Mormon church in the United States, she was surrounded by friends who voted. To pass her citizenship test, she had to study American government and learn English. Her voting behavior entailed years of effort and experience. Through all my conversations, I began to fear that the real roots of political engagement, which lie not in quadrennial outreach programs but around dinner tables and in churches and classrooms, are far more absent from Latino life in America than most people understand.Statistically, the Latinos most likely to cast ballots are almost identical to other reliable American voters. They are over 40. They\u2019ve lived in the United States for at least 20 years. They are Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans with long cultural histories of citizenship. They are college graduates.The Latinos least likely to vote represent a different demographic slice altogether. They are under 30, single and Mexican-American. Their families earn less than $50,000 a year. They may not have completed high school.Data capsules like these suggest that the Latino vote is simply hamstrung by the same factors that impede the Election Day turnout of all Americans: poverty, youth, lack of schooling. Political scientists showed long ago that voting goes hand in glove with affluence and education. Generally speaking, the wealthier you are, the more degrees you earn, the more likely you are to turn out. But if these were the only relevant factors, Latino voting would most likely rise naturally over time as more Latinos enrolled in college and as the age of the average American-born Latino increased. (In 2012 their average age was 18.)Causality unravels, however, when you start picking at the numbers. Take income, for example. While nearly a quarter of Latinos live in poverty, as a group they are slightly better off than African-Americans. Yet in 2012, African-Americans had the highest turnout rates in the nation. They, not Latinos, have arguably been the decisive bloc in our last two presidential contests and in this year\u2019s Democratic primary. So poverty alone can\u2019t explain the weak Hispanic vote.Youth and education also prove to be red herrings. Hispanics are America\u2019s youngest and least-educated major racial or ethnic group. Nearly a third of foreign-born Latinos never reached ninth grade. Some have never had a day of schooling in their lives. But if age and learning were the decisive catalysts, we would expect to find the highest voter turnout among Asian-Americans, who are our second-oldest and best-educated group. More than half of Asian-Americans hold bachelors degrees. Yet Asian-Americans tend to vote at even lower rates than Latinos. In 2012, 53 percent of their eligible voters did not go to the polls.The immigrants from Latin America immediately found themselves lumped together under the label \u201cHispanic,\u201d even if they spoke Portuguese or an indigenous language, even if they had no ancestral link to Spain. It\u2019s tough to galvanize such a heterogeneous group. The panethnic, multilingual category of \u201cHispanic\u201d is a uniquely American invention, created by congressional legislation in the 1970s. In her book \u201cMaking Hispanics,\u201d G. Cristina Mora shows how bureaucrats, media executives and political activists built the notion to combine Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans and others in census counts and federal programs. The term was always deliberately ambiguous, Mora notes, so that it could accommodate varied origin stories. There are Hispanics who swam the Rio Grande hoping for a living wage, Hispanics who flew business class to enroll in Ivy League schools, Hispanics who disembarked as Cold Warriors in Florida. There are even Hispanics whose families owned land in the Southwest before it was ever part of the United States. (These \u201cHispanics\u201d like to joke that they didn\u2019t cross the border; the border crossed them.) Unlike African-Americans, most of whom can trace a connection to slavery, Latinos have no single common history. Trump, Figueroa once told me, \u201cmakes us more Latino\u201d: His threats and insults provoke a unifying sense of indignation.Sifting thorough the numbers and this complicated history makes the 52 percent of nonvoting Latinos look rather different. The problem isn\u2019t their youth, poverty or lack of education. The problem is that when you\u2019re poor, young or undereducated, it takes more effort to overcome your immigrant family\u2019s low levels of political socialization. For first-generation Americans, politics is often just one more cultural expression that they must decipher on their own. It\u2019s rarely a priority. The immigrant parents that I spoke with swam rivers and boarded airplanes to escape violence, to earn money, to educate their children. Learning to play American politics was never on the agenda.In Virginia, I found that serious political talk was so rare among the American-born children of Spanish-speaking immigrants that they would often ask me questions like \u201cWhat is the Tea Party?\u201d and \u201cWho is my mayor?\u201d Alicio Casta\u00f1eda, a student at George Mason University whose parents are from Mexico, told me that after we had lunch in April, he began reading more news articles and researching deeper into the presidential candidates. He voted on Super Tuesday. His love for the soccer team Manchester United had led him to The Guardian newspaper, which reminded him that it was a big day in America. \u201cI\u2019ve always been personally interested in politics,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t had anyone to talk to about it.\u201dUntil the 1960s, high schools often taught courses on democracy, civics and government. At the turn of the 21st century, most teenagers received one such class, or none. This drought in civics hurts all Americans, but for Latinos it\u2019s devastating. Several studies have found that merely hearing parents chat about politics or watching them cast a ballot improves the odds that a child will later vote as an adult. Yet a national survey directed by Mark Hugo Lopez in 2002 found that young Latinos were the least likely to have discussed politics with their parents. They were also the most likely to believe that voting is \u201cdifficult.\u201dOn Super Tuesday, I glimpsed what was missing among so many of the Latino families I spoke with when I met Kat Heller, a non-Hispanic mother, exiting a polling station with two children. Growing up in Minnesota, Heller had always tagged along with her parents when they voted. Once, when she was about 12, her father took her to watch the ballots being counted. \u201cI just remember feeling it was really exciting,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt was seeing history happening. Everyone was waiting breathlessly.\u201d Inside the voting booth on Super Tuesday, Heller put her 3-year-old son on her hip and asked him: \u201cWhich do you think we should vote for?\u201d His 13 touches had already begun.A good rate for voter registration is two new registrations an hour. Chavez and her colleague hit the mark with four new registrations between them (the colleague waited for Chavez every time someone\u2019s dominant language was Spanish). Still, most passers-by ignored them. One 20-something with jet black hair who did stop told Chavez, in Spanish, that he was a citizen but not registered. She tried to reel him in.\u201cO.K.,\u201d she responded with a smile, \u201cwhat is the problem?\u201dHe said that he would come back to register next week, that she should give him her phone number.\u201cWhat happens if you don\u2019t come next week?\u201d she asked him.\u201cI promise you.\u201d\u201cYou know what happens,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it now, four more years will go by, and you won\u2019t vote.\u201dThe Clinton campaign is splitting its strategy between the tactics. After analyzing which programs worked best during the primaries, Praeli began pushing an expansion of Nevada\u2019s bilingual Mujeres in Politics program in battleground and \u201cexpansion\u201d states across the country. Mujeres in Politics marshals Latinas for the ant work of canvassing and phone banking, but it also relies on social ties to deepen the campaign\u2019s reach into Latino communities. Each Latina who participates is tasked with the responsibility of drawing in five more Latina volunteers.Chavez herself was lured into politics by a Latina friend. For years after she settled in Virginia from Peru, she earned money washing dishes, waitressing, cleaning bathrooms, cleaning offices, \u201ccleaning anything,\u201d she says. At one point she held three jobs: a full-time job, a part-time job and a weekend job cleaning the airport at night. In 1996, she earned her real estate license. Then in 2009, after a friend asked her to walk with Terry McAuliffe in a parade, she was so smitten by his concern for Latinos that she decided to volunteer for his campaign for governor. For Chavez, the experience was intoxicating: \u201cI was like, \u2018Whoa, I did not know any of this existed.\u2019\u2009\u201d She has volunteered for Virginia Democrats every year since then. Election season feels like a party to her. \u201cI have the best time,\u201d she told me. When Praeli spoke at the \u201cLatinos con Hillary\u201d event at Todos, Chavez was there, dressed head to toenails in blue.From the beginning, Latino voters have been up for grabs. The national electoral bloc that we now call the Hispanic vote was created by middle- and upper-class Mexican-American Democrats who wanted more clout in government and politics. According to the historian Ignacio M. Garc\u00eda\u2019s book on the subject, they organized \u201cViva Kennedy\u201d clubs in Texas, California, New Mexico, Indiana, Illinois and elsewhere. Working together under an absurd logo of John Kennedy riding a grinning burro, these grass-roots clubs turned out thousands of Spanish speakers in delegate-rich states, helping Kennedy squeak into the White House by a margin of less than 1 percent of the popular vote. But Republicans pushed the strategy further: In \u201cMaking Hispanics,\u201d Mora shows how members of Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 re-election campaign, who nicknamed themselves the \u201cBrown Mafia,\u201d ran Spanish-language ads on radio and television. They crafted three distinct campaigns to bring in not just Mexican-Americans but also Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. With their help, Nixon was re-elected by a landslide, taking about 35 percent of what was then known as the \u201cSpanish speaking\u201d vote. The real loss for Republicans since President George W. Bush left office is that their candidates have frittered away the affections that he and Reagan earned among Latinos.Several of the Catholic Latinos I met said that abortion laws were their top priority. \u201cIf we can close that one clinic,\u201d Iris Chavez told me with a sparkle in her eye, referring to a Planned Parenthood-like women\u2019s clinic that was once located in Manassas, \u201cwe can set fire to the nation.\u201d Chavez, 26, was brought into the United States illegally from El Salvador when she was 11 and was protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Obama created in 2012 for undocumented millennials who came to the United States as children. She works part-time as a secretary at All Saints Catholic Church, where so many Latinos attend the Sunday afternoon, Spanish-language Mass that they spill from the pews to stand three to four deep against the walls. She doesn\u2019t much like Donald Trump, she told me, but if she could vote, she would vote for him based on her belief that abortion is murder.Chavez is the kind of Latino that Nixon\u2019s \u201cBrown Mafia\u201d was after \u2014 the same kind that Reagan tried to embrace with his 1986 amnesty, which legalized 2.7 million Hispanics who had no criminal history, and the kind that Reince Priebus had hoped the Republican National Committee\u2019s 2012 election autopsy would provoke Republicans to seek again. If the party had followed George W. Bush\u2019s lead, Todos Supermarket might have become a site for G.O.P. events. Carlos Castro, its owner, considered himself \u201calmost 100 percent Republican\u201d until 2007, when the Republicans of Prince William County championed an anti-Hispanic \u201cImmigration Resolution,\u201d and he began to reconsider. He\u2019s now an independent. Other conservatives in the county told me that they would keep their votes out of everybody\u2019s reach until a candidate arrives whom they can fully support.Even if a \u201cTrump effect\u201d among Latinos this year does help put Clinton in the White House, will those new voters stay engaged? History suggests they might not. According to the political scientists Matt Barreto and Gary M. Segura, more than a million Latinos in California registered to vote for the first time in the years after the state passed Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative. Prop. 187 prohibited undocumented immigrants from state-funded institutions, like schools, and required police officers to report their arrests to federal immigration authorities. In a statewide election, the initiative passed with 59 percent of the vote. Pete Wilson, the Republican governor who had championed the measure, won re-election that same fall. Prop. 187 was soon tied up in federal court, which ruled many of its elements unconstitutional, but California\u2019s electorate soon went on to pass a ban on affirmative action (Prop. 209) and a reduction in bilingual education (Prop. 227). Both measures were widely regarded as anti-Hispanic.Among those defeated in 2014 was Amanda Renteria, now the national political director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Renteria ran for Congress in a Central Valley district that was 74 percent Hispanic. She grew up in the Central Valley and taught math at her old high school in Woodlake before attending Harvard Business School and becoming the first Latina chief of staff in the history of the Senate. She lost her 2014 bid for Congress by 17 points. If Latinos had turned out for her at the levels that African-Americans turned out for Obama, it\u2019s possible that today she would sit in Congress.California may be a majority-minority state in terms of its population, the report observed, but its electorate is not: 60 percent of its likely voters are white, while only 18 percent are Latino. It would be na\u00efve, however, to expect Democrats to throw themselves wholeheartedly into the project of turning out the state\u2019s Hispanics given that they already control solid majorities in California\u2019s State Assembly and State Senate.\u201cWe have to be honest,\u201d Mar\u00eda Teresa Kumar, the president and co-founder of Voto Latino, a nonpartisan organization, told me last fall. \u201cWhen it comes to voter registration, each party is looking to the Latino community and the African-American community for enough votes. They don\u2019t need us all.\u201d From her office in Washington, she directs efforts to engage young Latinos who are often navigating the political system for their families. \u201cOur job,\u201d Kumar said, \u201cis to do true political empowerment: It\u2019s mass mobilization and mass participation. And for parties, it\u2019s about how little do they need to spend to get over the top.\u201dYet the majority of Virginia\u2019s General Assembly is still Republican, and only two of its state-level representatives, the delegates Alfonso Lopez and Jason Miyares, are Latino. Harry Wiggins, the chairman of Prince William County\u2019s Democratic Committee, described the problem like this: \u201cWe win the presidential. We won for Mark Warner. We won for Tim Kaine. We won for Terry McAuliffe. Yet the county board we lose, because they have off-year elections, and we have very light turnout.\u201dAfter Kaine finished his speech, as \u201cShake It Off\u201d blasted through the gym, several of these students joined the throng vying for an opportunity to snap a selfie with him. I asked two of them what they knew about Kaine. \u201cHe was mayor of Virginia,\u201d one said. The other added that he had lived in Honduras and was a friend of Latinos. That was all that they seemed to know. Two parents I spoke with told me, in Spanish, that they understood only pieces of Kaine\u2019s speech, which was in English.

{"Headline": "Megan Rapinoe\u2019s Protest Leads to Division on and Off the Pitch", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHours after the United States Soccer Federation announced that the popular midfielder Megan Rapinoe would not be punished for kneeling during the national anthem at a women\u2019s national team game, she did it again.Rapinoe has joined San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and a number of other professional, college and high school athletes who have knelt during the anthem in recent weeks to draw attention to what they say is racial inequality and police brutality in the United States.On Thursday, Rapinoe spoke of her First Amendment right to protest peacefully, and expressed concern that many Americans were not as protected as others.But her decision to kneel for the anthem has been polarizing for fans of the national team. Many have argued that her protest, which she first did during a National Women\u2019s Soccer League match, is disrespectful while she wears a national team uniform. Others vigorously defended her right to protest, as they have with Kaepernick and other professional athletes. Within seconds of Rapinoe\u2019s taking a knee Sunday night, Twitter users were ready with their opinions.There also was plenty of disappointment with television coverage of the controversy on Fox Sports 1. Fox\u2019s studio team of Rob Stone and Aly Wagner criticized Rapinoe\u2019s approach during and after the game, and the broadcasters calling the match itself \u2014 which included the former national team coach Tony DiCicco \u2014 focused mostly on her protest as a distraction to the team.In a way, the controversy comes at a convenient time for the team. After the Women\u2019s World Cup in 2015 and the Olympics in August, the women\u2019s national team is entering a low-profile cycle. (The next Women\u2019s World Cup is in 2019, in France.) In the meantime, the team\u2019s games will be friendlies for the most part, not all of them as competitive as Sunday\u2019s win over the Netherlands, a rising European national team. Thursday\u2019s United States game against Thailand, for example, wound up being a 9-0 rout.The team\u2019s next games are two friendlies against Switzerland and Sweden in October.Advertisement"}

Chris Christie of New Jersey, who on Saturday declared emergencies for three counties. \u201cAll those things will decide what impact it has, especially in our coastal areas.\u201dA \u201cslow north-northwestward motion\u201d was predicted through Monday, and the hurricane center said Hermine\u2019s center would \u201cmeander slowly offshore of the Mid-Atlantic coast for the next couple of days.\u201dTropical storm warnings were in effect between the Fenwick Island, Del., area and Cape Cod, Mass., and the hurricane center described a storm system with tropical storm-force winds \u2014 between 39 and 73 miles per hour \u2014 extending more than 200 miles from its center. Hermine had maximum sustained winds on Sunday of 70 m.p.h., and the hurricane center said the storm was \u201cexpected to be at or near hurricane strength\u201d before beginning to weaken on Monday night.Live map of Hermine's forecasted path.But to the federal and state authorities, wind speed was only part of the riddle of Hermine, which seemed ready a little over a week ago to disintegrate without becoming a named storm.Flooding always loomed as a threat, and some forecasters predicted record-breaking events. On Sunday, after extensive preparations, those fears mostly eased with every passing hour.\u201cThis is certainly not Sandy, nowhere near that,\u201d Mr. Christie said, referring to the catastrophic 2012 storm. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not even Jonas.\u201dOn Long Beach Island, to the north of Atlantic City, Christian Gagliardi, who has a six-month rental on the island, said he was not worried about the storm.\u201cEven if it stalls at this point, unless you live on the ocean, it\u2019s not going to be a problem,\u201d Mr. Gagliardi, 43, said while standing on a dune that was built to protect the island after Sandy.Drivers approaching the island on Route 72 from the west were greeted with electronic signs warning \u201cSevere Coastal Storm \u2014 Be Prepared,\u201d and a convenience store near the causeway connecting the island to the mainland had placed a small pile of sandbags near its door.New York City banned swimming, bathing and surfing on its beaches through Labor Day, and the city said the restrictions could extend into Tuesday. The city also warned that it could limit access to bridges, and that Staten Island Ferry runs could be delayed or canceled.Mr. Scott\u2019s office said more than 40,000 customers were still without power there, and in a pointed statement on Sunday, Mr. Scott mentioned issues that he called \u201cstill unresolved by city and county government.\u201d\u201cThere are still too many people without power in the City of Tallahassee and Leon County and, as you would expect, I will not be satisfied until it is fully restored,\u201d Mr. Scott said.Local officials have defended their response amid what Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee described over the weekend as an \u201cunfortunate and irritating situation.\u201d\u201cOur No. 1 priority is to get power back to our residents and businesses as quickly as possible,\u201d he wrote in a lengthy post on Facebook. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve successfully done that, we\u2019ll worry about cleanup and getting Tallahassee back to the beautiful community that we have all grown to love.\u201dAlso on Sunday, officials in Pasco County, north of Tampa, oversaw a blend of mandatory and voluntary evacuations in response to the rise of the Anclote River.

It\u2019s not so much the gap in pay relative to Bay Area employers, though that is a factor, as it is the location of many of San Diego\u2019s tech companies, Mr. Bakst wrote.Most of San Diego\u2019s tech jobs are in parts of the city \u2014 such as North County or Sorrento Valley \u2014 that they consider too far from downtown, San Diego\u2019s cultural epicenter and millennial stamping ground.Some fresh graduates say they have little interest in living or working in the industrial park atmosphere of Sorrento Valley, where less costly rents have exerted a strong pull on tech companies ever since Qualcomm set up shop there in 1985.Starbucks, a Chili\u2019s and a couple of Indian food spots are there. But not much else.In his column, Mr. Bakst wrote that if San Diego wanted to stem the exodus of its young tech class, it needed to nurture jobs in a part of the city where they want to live and work: downtown.But industry professionals and city officials said that is an effort already underway.\u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of cool stuff going on. There just aren\u2019t as many household names.\u201dMr. Winkler suggested that another factor was at work in the job deliberations of San Diego\u2019s 20-somethings. Fresh out of college, he said, many of them are simply hungry to check out a more happening town.\u201cTruthfully, people are always going to want to go to San Francisco,\u201d he said.This month, two groups announced advances on hand-held devices that could be used by law enforcement to detect THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, in a driver\u2019s system.Hounds Labs, which has been collaborating with scientists at U.C. Berkeley, said its device had an important advantage over fluid-based tests.Tests of blood, urine or saliva can turn up THC days after a person has smoked marijuana. But the chemical only lingers for a few hours in the breath, the company said. That means its Breathalyzer can signal recent consumption.As a wave of pot decriminalization has swept the country, law enforcement agencies have become increasingly eager to get ahold of a portable device that could help catch stoned drivers.Scientists say it is clear that THC causes deficits in cognitive function, but the amount required to affect driving performance is not well understood.That has not stopped some states, including Washington, Montana and Pennsylvania, from setting legal cutoffs.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Writer Charged With Insulting Islam Is Killed as Extremism Boils Over in Jordan", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo when Mr. Hattar, 56, a prominent writer from a Christian family, showed up at a court on Sunday to face criminal charges of insulting Islam, at least one man with a gun decided a trial was not enough. As three bullets ripped through the writer in front of the courthouse, Jordan\u2019s simmering tensions boiled over.The brazen daylight killing of Mr. Hattar in front of his horrified family was not only the latest example of violence tied to cartoon renderings of Muslim figures, it was also the sort of manifestation of extremism that Jordan\u2019s government has struggled to contain in a nation that finds itself under pressure from multiple directions.Never mind that after an across-the-board social media backlash, Mr. Hattar quickly removed the cartoon, deactivated his Facebook account and apologized, saying he \u201cdid not mean to offend anyone.\u201d If the government hoped that arresting him would tamp down the anger among the more violent sections of Jordanian society, it misjudged.\u201cI saw his lifeless, blood-drained body just now,\u201d his wife, Randa Kakish-Hattar, said in an interview several hours later at her home where she was mourning with friends and family. \u201cHis two children saw him shot and killed before their eyes. And for what? For sharing a cartoon on Facebook?\u201dFamily members accused authorities of not doing enough to guard him against death threats. \u201cNahed apologized about the cartoon,\u201d Saif Hattar, a cousin, said. \u201cIt was misunderstood. We believe the ISIS poisonous mentality was the cause of this but the government failed to protect him.\u201dA suspect in the shooting was captured near the scene, according to the government, which vowed harsh action. \u201cWe will hold the perpetrator who committed this despicable act to justice, and the government will respond with an iron fist to anyone who uses this incident as an opportunity to spread hate speech in society,\u201d Mohammad Momani, a government spokesman, said in a statement.Mr. Hattar wrote columns for Al Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper, often about nationalism and Islamic political thought that reflected a secular, leftist point of view. At various points described as a communist and supporter of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, he was imprisoned several times for his political activism.Before his death, Mr. Hattar said that he shared the cartoon not to insult Islam but to point out the hypocrisy of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In his apology statement, he said the cartoon \u201cmocks ISIS terrorists and their concept of heaven.\u201dRelatives said Mr. Hattar received more than 100 death threats, many through Facebook and some by telephone. In one message they played for a reporter, a caller said if justice did not take place, he would kill Mr. Hattar by \u201ctearing out his heart from his chest.\u201d The family said it went to the governor to submit the death threats but no action was taken.\u201cThis happened despite the government knowing that Nahed is a prominent person, that he received hundreds of death threats,\u201d said Saif Hattar, his cousin.\u201cThe murder of Hattar targets democracy and diversity in our society and aims to spread darkness and terrorism,\u201d Nidal Mansour, the president of the Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists, said in a statement. \u201cEven though we disagree with what Nahed says or writes, this is the time to stand united against terrorism and those who killed him. They want to instill fear and silence us.\u201dAt the family meeting hall in Amman, relatives consoled one another.His wife, Mrs. Kakish-Hattar, said she tried to convince Mr. Hattar to leave the country just two days earlier, but he refused.Mr. Hattar\u2019s younger brother, Majed, 51, was with him when he was attacked and still had blood on his clothes and shoes. He said he had chased the gunman and caught him by holding his beard.More than 1,000 residents joined relatives on Sunday evening in Fuheis, a largely Christian suburb northwest of Amman where the writer came from. \u201cWe meet today in pain and sorrow,\u201d said Huwaished Akroosh, the president of the municipality. \u201cWe have confidence in his majesty the king and for safekeeping this country and its people. \u201dA headline on Sept. 26 with an article about the killing of a Jordanian Christian writer, Nahed Hattar, after he posted a cartoon online deemed offensive to Islam overstated the case against him. He had been charged with insulting Islam, but not convicted of it. The article imprecisely translated a comment on Twitter by Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, one of Al Qaeda\u2019s most influential ideologues, in response to Mr. Hattar\u2019s apology. He said, \u201cThe apology and clarification from Hattar make him no less of an infidel\u201d \u2014 not \u201cis no less of an apostasy\u201d \u2014 \u201cthan his caricature.\u201dDeborah Acosta contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A National Park\u2019s Plea: Enjoy the Animals; Don\u2019t Act Like One", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateDoes a bear poop in the woods? Of course it does, and so, apparently, do a whole lot of humans.\u201cWith that increase, we started to see a different behavior in our visitors,\u201d said Kyle Patterson, a Rocky Mountain National Park spokeswoman.While most people behave properly, the number engaging in illegal activity increased so much that the park this summer issued a plea for assistance in trying to educate visitors about park etiquette. The \u201cPlease Help Your Friends to Behave Better to Protect Rocky Mountain National Park\u201d statement covered a variety of topics, including avoiding the park between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. during the summer and fall, restrictions on campfires, keeping a distance from wildlife, not taking items from the wild, the prohibition on pets in most places, parking and, yes, bathroom habits.\u201cIf your friend is a frequent pooper, suggest taking care of that before hiking. If nature calls, plan ahead \u2014 bring a waste bag, or research tips on how to poop in the woods,\u201d it said. \u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends go to the bathroom near water sources. Just think, you might be drinking from that water source the next day!\u201dEtiquette issues in the parks aren\u2019t new, nor are they unique to Colorado. Last year, Glacier National Park posted a blog on its website about \u201cthe not-so-rare wildflower called the \u2018toilet paper bloom\u2019 \u201d that gave instructions on how to properly pee and poop in the woods. In fact, nearly every park website offers some sort of guidance about etiquette, whether it\u2019s a reminder to turn off cellphones for night sky viewing at Joshua Tree National Park or advice on how to behave with the villagers at the National Park of American Samoa.Even though Rocky Mountain has half the staff of Yellowstone and a third of the staff of Yosemite, the call for help that was shared on Twitter and with the park\u2019s 500,000 Facebook followers, posted on its website and sent to various news outlets, wasn\u2019t intended to encourage vigilantism, Ms. Patterson said.\u201cWe certainly have a lot of visitors reaching out to other visitors,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes that goes well, sometime it doesn\u2019t. We have had altercations about parking spaces, arguing about who got the parking space first. People trying to save parking spaces and other people yelling that they can\u2019t.\u201dA few years ago, a man was punched in the face after politely telling another visitor that he needed to stay off the tundra to protect the fragile ecosystem, Ms. Patterson said.Rather than encouraging people to engage with strangers, the lighthearted primer \u201cwas truly meant to connect with park visitors to be able to share with their friends what the rules and regulations are and why,\u201d she said.It\u2019s easy to understand the challenges that many of the park\u2019s 400 summer employees (including 175 year-round staff), are experiencing.A trip to one of the most popular parts of the 415-square-mile park on a Saturday in late summer put a spotlight on a variety of visitors who either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care about park rules.Choice parking lots like Bear Lake were filled before 8 a.m. Drivers arriving after that were sent back down the hill to a Park and Ride lot. Once the Park and Ride lot fills, usually around 9:30 a.m., access to Bear Lake Road is restricted. Drivers are stopped lower down and directed to the parking lots at the visitor centers, where free shuttles take passengers to trailheads.\u201cThis guy might be a problem,\u201d Billy Webb, a park volunteer, radioed ahead after he sent a white S.U.V. to the Park and Ride lot.Mr. Webb was worried the driver would pull forward and stop, insisting on waiting for a spot to open. When drivers do that, it snarls traffic, incites road rage and blocks the way for the shuttles and emergency vehicles.As the lots filled, some drivers parked on the wild grass by the side of the road, risking damage to the native species, and the chance that they would be towed. Friends are advised to discourage this behavior by reminding the driver that they wouldn\u2019t allow someone to park on their prized rose bushes.On the Saturday of my visit, about 10,000 vehicles entered the park. While there are more than 350 miles of hiking trails in the park, there was a steady flow of people on the 5.6-mile trail to Mills Lake, including some who broadcast music from their phones as they walked along.Nonetheless, all seemed polite, nodding hello and stepping to the side to let others pass, or in the case of one fellow, to take a hit of his Boost Oxygen supplement as he approached 9,500 feet and the spectacular vista as the lake comes into view amid a stunning mountain backdrop.But I was only an hour into my hike when I noticed a woman squatting behind some limber pines near the trail. Soon after, the confetti of toilet paper became increasingly noticeable along the side of the trail.Already, the park provides free bags to pack out waste at the Backcountry Office and also from a dispenser near the 13-mile Lumpy Ridge Trailhead, a popular site for climbers.\u201cWhat we will be doing within the next couple of years is looking at long-term solutions, engaging the public on what that looks like,\u201d Ms. Patterson said.Until then, the staff will continue to walk a fine line between host and enforcer, all while trying to educate the public.As I rode back to my car in the shuttle, I noticed there were advertisements on the inside of the bus, not unlike a New York subway. The subject matter, however, was decidedly different.\u201cGo Before You Go,\u201d read one. \u201cUse restrooms at trailheads.

{"Headline": "In a Novel Set at Harvard, Class Divisions and a Creepy Crush", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The opening chapter of Teddy Wayne\u2019s third novel, \u201cLoner,\u201d encompasses 11 \u00adpages of deadpan hilarity. Wayne\u2019s teenage protagonist, David Federman, an awkward grind who is prone to conceptualizing words backward, has arrived for his first day of Harvard only to find himself locked in the back seat of the family car while his equally uncool NPR-listening parents begin unloading the trunk. \u201c\u200a\u2018Where\u2019d he go?\u2019 I could hear my mother ask. \u2018In here,\u2019 I shouted, knocking louder. \u2018Sorry, thought you got out,\u2019 my father said following my liberation.\u201dThe exchange, as brief as it is, is the perfect metaphor for Federman\u2019s predicament. Although he has managed to come out on top in the college admissions game, so far in life he has been socially not just a flop but an invisible one. When he got into Harvard, his high school classmates weren\u2019t surprised so much as puzzled about who that kid who got into Harvard was. The experience has left him bitter and insecure. And Federman\u2019s discovery that he will be spending his freshman year living with a braces-wearing physics major who is quickly nicknamed Subatomic Steven only seems to promise further ostracization. \u201cAll hopes I had of a roommate who would help upgrade me to a higher social stratum snagged on the gleaming barnacles of Steven\u2019s orthodontia,\u201d Federman laments. \u201cHe would have fit right in at my cafeteria table at Garret Hobart High (named for New Jersey\u2019s only vice president), where I sat with a miscellaneous coalition of pariahs who had banded together less out of camaraderie than survival instinct. .\u2008.\u2008. We might have formed, in aggregate, one thin mustache and a downy archipelago of facial hair. We joked about sex with the vulgar fixation of virgins.\u201d Wayne\u2019s writing is spiky and electric, and combined with his use of the collective \u201cwe\u201d (at least in the initial chapter), it reminded me of the early work of Jeffrey Eugenides.But if \u201cLoner\u201d at first appears to be a comedy of manners, it quickly veers into something far creepier. At his dorm orientation meeting, Federman spots the beautiful New York City private-school girl Veronica Morgan Wells and is instantly infatuated. Like some kind of twisted love letter, the rest of the novel is addressed to \u201cyou,\u201d meaning Veronica. What\u2019s more, the too-cool-for-school Veronica becomes the organizing principle around which Federman constructs his entire life, down to the classes he takes (cue the women\u2019s studies jokes) and the girl he hooks up with (Veronica\u2019s roommate). Perhaps needless to say, Veronica herself appears completely indifferent to Federman\u2019s presence if not his existence, which only spurs him on. Think \u201cDon Quixote\u201d set in Dunster House.But if the setup is promising, the discomfort this reader experienced while reading \u201cLoner\u201d was manifold. For one thing, the dichotomy Wayne establishes between the digestion-addled, \u00adpotato-shaped, hopelessly provincial and embarrassingly ambitious Jew (represented by both the Lactaid-popping Federman and his dowdy, allergic girlfriend, Sara Cohen) versus the effortlessly soign\u00e9e and sophisticated WASP (represented by the lithe and lazy Veronica Morgan Wells) seems, at this point in American history, not only a clich\u00e9 but an anachronism. If its high point was \u201cPortnoy\u2019s Complaint\u201d in 1969, the paradigm no longer rings particularly true in 2016, especially considering that a large proportion of the coastal elites Veronica supposedly represents are by now Jewish themselves.For another thing \u2014 and at the risk of giving too much away \u2014 as the book progresses, Federman turns into a full-blown stalker. As a result, the reader may go from enjoying \u201cLoner\u201d to finding the experience not just uncomfortable but excruciating. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll simultaneously hope that Federman escapes detection and hope he gets caught, if only to end the agony of watching him watching her. Female authors tend to be told more often than male ones that their protagonists are \u201cunsympathetic\u201d or \u201cunlikable\u201d and that their books are therefore unlikable as well. So I\u2019m sensitive to the charge. But as \u201cLoner\u201d barrels toward its shocking and not entirely plausible conclusion, the reader may begin to wonder what value there is in being inside the mind of the novel\u2019s deceitful and deranged antihero.As Bret Easton Ellis did with Patrick Bateman in \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d (1991), Wayne seems to imply that David Federman is somehow emblematic of this particular moment, with its apparently insurmountable class divisions paired with a voyeuristic internet culture. In this light, the character\u2019s delusional longings can be seen as speaking less to mental illness than to the anxieties of a middle class fighting to stay relevant.Wayne adroitly homes in on the way in which, thanks to various private schools or exclusive resorts or familial connections (or all of the above), the moneyed seem to arrive at elite colleges already knowing one another and immediately form their own closed tribes. If entrance to the Ivy League would seem at first glance to promise an equally elevated playing field to those lucky enough to gain admittance, for those from humble origins, even solidly bourgeois ones, it can also serve as a harsh reminder of how much the game is already rigged \u2014 and, by association, how ironically provincial and incurious the rich often are. And the rise of social media has surely added grist to the mill of class anxiety. Poring over Veronica\u2019s Facebook page, Federman finds himself \u201cskimming over close-ups of food and panoramic sunsets to linger on images of you. The majority depicted your life before Harvard: European cities, what appeared to be your family\u2019s wraparound-porched oceanfront vacation home, a couple from childhood (wobbly on skis; crying on Santa\u2019s lap), you and high school friends posing with tipsy hilarity at bars and nightclubs \u2014 entered with the benefit of fake IDs, I assumed, or city-girl know-how, or just because you were young and eye-catching and this was your Manhattan birthright.\u201dIn contrast, Federman\u2019s actual girlfriend, Sara, possesses a Facebook profile picture that shows her \u201cat her high school graduation, flanked by her deliriously proud parents, off-kilter mortarboard dwarfing her head.\u201dSara Cohen also possesses an even emotional keel, a desire for intimacy and a strong political consciousness, all of which make her attraction to Federman \u2014 who at his best appears to be an emotionally blank hanger-on \u2014 somewhat mystifying.This leads me to my last issue with \u201cLoner,\u201d which is the title. All authors know how difficult it is to step back from what they\u2019ve written and find one or two or three words that might encapsulate the other tens of thousands. But if there is any instance in the novel where David Federman is shown to prefer his own company in the manner of an actual loner (or \u201cintrovert,\u201d as they\u2019re known in polite company), I missed it. Instead, Wayne presents us with a character so desperate for inclusion in the popular crowd \u2014 and, by association, the love and acceptance of a girl he won\u2019t ever know \u2014 that he will go to any lengths to achieve it. Perhaps a better title would have been \u201cSociopath.\u201dLucinda Rosenfeld\u2019s new novel, \u201cClass,\u201d will be published in January.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Silicon Valley Dream Collapses in Allegations of Fraud", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Like so many bright, young entrepreneurs these days, Isaac Choi arrived here last year, set up shop and promised employees that he would lead them to the Silicon Valley dream.That dream is turning out mostly to be a mirage.While WrkRiot is not widely known, the start-up\u2019s collapse has gripped Silicon Valley. Mr. Choi\u2019s situation may be extreme, but the company\u2019s implosion has a familiar ring to many who came west to be the next Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 but ended up instead at the next WrkRiot. Silicon Valley is always eager to celebrate its success stories, but the reality is that numerous tiny start-ups that few ever hear about form the tech industry\u2019s dysfunctional underbelly.\u201cWith the exception of the alleged fraud, almost anyone who has worked at a start-up has experienced most everything that went wrong at WrkRiot,\u201d said Semil Shah, a start-up investor based in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize the word start-up is a broad concept that includes everything from a proven entrepreneur raising $15 million to a guy with money from friends and family.\u201d To an outsider, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re both the same.\u201dPenny Kim, the former head of marketing at WrkRiot who wrote about her experience at the company, including the forgery allegations, said, \u201cI\u2019d heard stories about late paychecks or start-ups failing, but who expects fraud in Silicon Valley?\u201dWrkRiot terminated Ms. Kim\u2019s employment in mid-August after she filed a wage claim. She has since filed a retaliation complaint against the company and moved to Dallas, where she previously lived.In an interview this week, Mr. Choi, 35, said WrkRiot, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., near where Intel has its headquarters, was \u201clike any company. If you want to talk start-ups, all start-ups have problems.\u201d When asked about the forgery claims, Mr. Choi said Ms. Kim was a disgruntled employee who was fired for cause and that the accusations were \u201cunfair to my guys.\u201dAlong with the start-up, Mr. Choi\u2019s personal credibility is on the line. As he built WrkRiot, the entrepreneur said that he graduated from the Stern School of Business at New York University and that he worked at J. P. Morgan for nearly four years as an analyst. N.Y.U. and J. P. Morgan both said they had no record of Mr. Choi. At least one company listed on his LinkedIn profile also could not be found.Mr. Choi, whose LinkedIn profile has since been wiped clean, did not respond to questions about his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. His lawyer, Bernard Fishman, said he was not aware of the allegations against WrkRiot until contacted by The New York Times.Mr. Choi set up his start-up in June 2015 under the name 1For.One, with a mission of helping people find the perfect job online. He brought in advisers with expertise in recruiting and data science and eventually hired nearly 20 employees, including Chinese nationals under work visas.The company later changed its name to JobSonic with a tagline, \u201cFinally, a lightning fast job platform that cares.\u201d Eventually, the start-up settled on the vowel-challenged name of WrkRiot.Mr. Choi said the company had not raised any money from venture capital firms but that he had \u201ca bunch of private investors who are high-net-worth individuals who believe in the company.\u201d He said one investor was related to him and one was not, but would not say how much money the company had.WrkRiot\u2019s former chief technology officer and co-founder, Al Brown, said Mr. Choi had intended to put $2 million of his own money into the company, but that only $400,000 materialized.In Ms. Kim\u2019s post about her experience at the company, which she did not initially identify but later confirmed was WrkRiot, she wrote that the start-up, without consulting her, hired someone who would report to her, did not plan ahead on its business \u2014 and had no idea what its business really was \u2014 and was repeatedly turned down by investors. The chief executive, later identified as Mr. Choi, also borrowed money from employees, she said.\u201cNothing about that start-up surprises me anymore and it all seems like a horrible nightmare I was lucky enough to wake up from,\u201d she wrote.Since Ms. Kim\u2019s disclosures, others have told her they were also shortchanged by start-ups. Michelle Young, the founder of the online travel guide Untapped Cities, reached out to Ms. Kim to tell her about an undisclosed start-up that bought ad space from her company \u2014 but then stopped paying.Ms. Young was eventually offered $40,000 in guaranteed business by the start-up if she agreed to a nondisparagement clause. She did not sign and is still waiting for some of the money she is owed.\u201cAt some point the checks stopped coming,\u201d said Ms. Young. \u201cThere were warning signs. Offers that seemed too good to be true.\u201dAt WrkRiot, a handful of the start-up\u2019s remaining 10 or so employees gathered on Tuesday night to discuss their situation, according to a person who attended the gathering and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned about retaliation.A few were hopeful that Mr. Choi could save the company. Some of the Chinese nationals whose work visas are tied to their employment said their visa extensions were in limbo, partly because WrkRiot had missed a payment to the paycheck-processing company ADP, making it impossible for the government to verify their employment through ADP.By then, WrkRiot had shut down its website, its Facebook page and its Twitter account. Many of the employees are now hunting for other Silicon Valley start-up jobs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Look Up: In the Digital Age, Billboards Are Far From Dead", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingWhen Axl Rose ended a 23-year feud with his former Guns N\u2019 Roses bandmates, Duff McKagan and Slash, and agreed to reunite with them onstage in 2016, the band unveiled its North American tour in an unusual way. There were no news conferences, talk-show chats or photo ops. Instead, flashy electronic billboards featuring the band\u2019s logo and famous song titles began popping up in major cities across the country.The ads created buzz on social media, with fans posting photos of the billboards on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere, and ticket sales for the band\u2019s shows took off.\u201cIt\u2019s what we call a reveal, where you give hints that start to build excitement and questions, and with social media, these things have a tendency to catch fire,\u201d said Scott Wells, chief executive of Clear Channel Outdoor Americas, which handled some of the band\u2019s billboard campaign.The billboard strategy seems almost retro at a time when much of the marketing world is focused on mobile devices and social media. But Guns N\u2019 Roses isn\u2019t alone. The Rolling Stones used a similar billboard approach to tease fans before the band\u2019s 2015 summer tour.Big brands, including McDonald\u2019s and Comcast, have long used billboards to promote their products, but now even tech companies such as Foursquare, Lyft and Snapchat use them.Some use humor. Chick-fil-A\u2019s campaign, for instance, showed cows on billboards with captions under them reading \u201ceat mor chikin.\u201dIndeed, billboard companies are not only surviving \u2014 they\u2019re flourishing.Spending on so-called out-of-home advertising, which includes stand-alone billboards, ads on various modes of transit and airport ads, has risen for 24 consecutive quarters, according to Kantar Media and the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. Spending surged to $7.3 billion in 2015 from $5.9 billion in 2009.In 2015, spending on out-of-home ads in the United States rose 4.6 percent from 2014, while spending on TV ads fell 3.6 percent, radio ads declined 2.5 percent, newspaper ads slipped 12.8 percent and magazine ads dropped 12.7 percent, according to Magna Global. Spending on digital ads, however, rose 20 percent.\u201cDigital has been sucking media dollars out of press and radio, but our audience has been growing,\u201d said Jeremy Male, chief executive of Outfront Media, one of the biggest players in the billboard industry.Why? Studies indicate that people are spending more time outside their homes, partly because of an increase in travel and commuting and also because smartphones keep them connected when they are away from home or work. And \u201cyou can\u2019t TiVo a sign,\u201d said James Goss, a managing director at Barrington Research, meaning that billboards can\u2019t be skipped over. \u201cSo they have a captive audience.\u201dOf course, many of the billboard ads they are producing have moved beyond the old model, where static photos with simple captions stare back from a roadside perch.Now electronic billboards are everywhere: along highways, on the side of buildings, outside bus shelters, on public benches, and in airports, elevators, subways and malls. Many are digitized, able to show videos, stream live events, display content from social media or change a screen\u2019s image every 30 seconds.\u201cWe allow our customers to change their message instantaneously right from their desktop,\u201d said Sean Reilly, chief executive of Lamar Advertising, another prominent billboard company.Some billboard displays are interactive, containing sensors and codes that people can scan with their smartphones to take them to a specific destination online.\u201cWhile the digital age has to some extent been a threat to some traditional media, we\u2019ve really embraced it,\u201d Mr. Male said.For national brands, billboards are an easy and inexpensive way to grab eyeballs of all ages and demographics with a single ad.Even tech companies are taking their ads outdoors. When Foursquare\u2019s Swarm app found that young New Yorkers tended to congregate and take pictures in Madison Square Park, the company chose to advertise on a billboard on the side of the nearby Flatiron Building, knowing it would show up in photos that were later shared on social media, said Kinjil Mathur, chief marketing officer at Foursquare.But improved data analysis is crucial to the field\u2019s growth. \u201cAdvertisers want to be able to measure who is seeing their ads,\u201d said Brett Harriss, an analyst at Gabelli & Company.Some companies have started adding small cameras to billboards to collect data on passers-by.Clear Channel\u2019s Radar program teams up with several companies, including AT&T, to track the travel patterns of people passing by its billboards. The program uses mobile device data and other information to determine if people later visit a store or search their smartphones for the product. Some companies use geo-fencing, in which a billboard ad will pop up in an app on a mobile device.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, has called them \u201cspying billboards\u201d and demanded that the Federal Trade Commission investigate. \u201cA person\u2019s cellphone should not become a James Bond-like personal tracking device for a corporation to gather information about consumers,\u201d he said in May, arguing that people needed to be able to opt out of being tracked.Mr. Wells of Clear Channel defends the program. \u201cThe data is anonymous and aggregated \u2014 we\u2019re not looking at individuals,\u201d he said. Still, any government intervention could stymie the field\u2019s growth.However, Mr. Reilly remains bullish on the industry\u2019s future.\u201cAt the end of the day, if people are out and about, moving around,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we\u2019re going to be relevant, both to where they are and what our customers want to say to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unplugged and Unmoored", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving With CancerInside our new condo, the internet connection had failed. Two young men, sent by the cable company, had spent hours burying a cable to replace an antiquated line running into the building. As soon as they drove off, nothing worked anymore: not the landline, not the television, not the internet.When I wasn\u2019t on the iPhone with the cable company during the next days \u2014 punching in numbers, interminably on hold, explaining that yes, I had plugged and unplugged \u2014 I realized that I could do without the television and the landline, but the loss of the web was harrowing. I worried: How could I, as a cancer patient, manage to exist without internet access?All of my scheduling with the research nurse in charge of the clinical trial in which I participate occurs electronically. She sends me the dates and times of appointments as well as reminders about where to go for tests; then she emails me results. Once when I was terribly ill, I texted her in alarm and she phoned my local pharmacy with a prescription that did the trick. Now my email wasn\u2019t even working on my cellphone. We were disconnected.Throughout seven years of cancer treatment, I had emailed my oncologist with questions. Of course I limited myself to crucial problems, but knowing that I could rely on her expertise gave me a wonderful sense of security.To email or not to email: I suspect this must be a question in medical circles these days. If electronic messaging with patients were to become more common, how could already busy physicians find the time to read and respond? Might they have to hire staff members to deal with inquiries and wouldn\u2019t that effectively invalidate the personal reply patients seek? And how would they pay for it?The electronic blackout triggered withdrawal tremors not only because of the breakdown of my conduit to nurses and doctors. Like many cancer patients, I use the web as a source of health care information. Although some people eschew medical searches that can trigger uncertainty or anxiety, I consult trustworthy government- and newspaper- and hospital-sponsored sites that have helped me cope with a variety of side effects ranging from lymphedema to neuropathies. I watch YouTube videos to deal with ostomy-related crises. Whenever a new drug is prescribed, I go online to learn about its efficacy as well as its physical and economic costs, as do all the members of my support group.Quite a few of us have also joined an electronic community of people dealing with our specific form of cancer. Linking far-flung patients and insuring anonymity, online support groups facilitate conversations about clinical trials, home remedies for common body dysfunctions and insurance quandaries. Additionally, they provide a safe space to vent.When I am not reading research findings or the entries on message boards, I can turn to my feed on Facebook, to Words With Friends, or to photographs of my grandchildren. Depleted by treatment, I spend a great deal of time alone at home\u2026 alone, that is, with the internet. And even when I discover a venue where I might make an embodied difference \u2014 like a program that trains cancer patients to help educate medical students \u2014 I reach out via the computer to volunteer my services.For cancer patients, the net effect of the internet has been empowering, it seems to me, decreasing confusion and loneliness after diagnosis.So I was profuse with my thanks when an acquaintance disconnected the router from the TV, moved it into the dining area, and ran a line to the outside source under the kitchen door. It worked. The electronic blackout was over. I checked my email.The next day, though, I braced for disaster: Another cable company van had pulled into the driveway.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tech Companies Disrupted Silicon Valley\u2019s Restaurant Scene", "Date": "2016-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 It wasn\u2019t so long ago that the aroma of Moroccan spiced prawns and wood-oven pizzas wafted out to a downtown street here from the open-air patio of a once popular eatery called Zibibbo.Today that patio is behind locked doors, obscured by frosted glass. The pizza oven is gone. The formerly crowded bar has been converted into a sparsely populated start-up space of a dozen engineers, their bikes and whiteboards. After 17 years in operation, the restaurant closed in 2014. The space is now an American Express venture capital office and a start-up incubator.All told, more than 70,000 square feet of Palo Alto retail and restaurant space were lost to office space from 2008 to 2015, as the tech bubble drove demand for commercial space downtown.It is a story playing out across Silicon Valley, where restaurateurs say that staying afloat is a daily battle with rising rents, high local fees and acute labor shortages. And tech behemoths like Apple, Facebook and Google are hiring away their best line cooks, dishwashers and servers with wages, benefits and perks that restaurant owners simply cannot match.Silicon Valley technologists love to explain how they have disrupted the minutiae of daily life, from our commutes to the ways we share family photos. But along the way, they have also managed to disrupt their local restaurant industry.That may not be an issue for tech workers with access to free, farm-fresh cuisine in corporate cafeterias, but for everyone else here it is leaving a void between the takeout cuisine popping up around Palo Alto \u2014 picture bento boxes ordered on iPads at a counter \u2014 and $500 meals at high-end restaurants.\u201cRestaurants as we know them will no longer exist here in the near future,\u201d said Howard Bulka, a chef and owner of Howie\u2019s Artisan Pizza in Palo Alto and another restaurant in nearby Redwood City. \u201cPalo Alto is just too tough a row to hoe. A lot of people are looking into getting out in one piece or are thinking of leaving the business entirely.\u201dWith razor-thin profit margins, restaurateurs find they can increase wages only so much. Paying a livable wage is a struggle in Palo Alto, where the average one-bedroom apartment rents for $2,800, the same as in New York City, according to Rent Jungle. Workers have also been driven out of surrounding towns that were previously affordable, like Cupertino and San Jose, where demand from a new influx of tech workers has driven up the average cost of a one-bedroom apartment to more than $2,500.The cost to lease space in downtown Palo Alto, according to the city\u2019s planning department, is now $7.33 a square foot, up more than 60 percent from four years ago. Landlords have also put the onus of building improvements on the tenants.Palo Alto requires restaurants to pay fees for things like sidewalk improvements, tree maintenance and parking. Restaurants that lease 1,000 square feet or more must provide four private parking spaces or pay an in-lieu parking fee of $63,848 per space, for a total of $255,392 \u2014 the highest such fee in the country.Successful restaurants often pay 4 to 6 percent of gross sales in occupancy costs, which include rent and other fees like insurance and property taxes. But in Palo Alto, restaurateurs say the combination of high rents and staffing challenges has pushed their occupancy costs to 12 percent of gross sales.\u201cFrom an operating standpoint, it\u2019s crushing,\u201d Mr. Bulka said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough profitability in this. Period.\u201d\u201cHelp wanted\u201d signs are now ubiquitous, and not only among restaurants. On a recent Wednesday, a sign outside a florist read: \u201cCall our associate. We don\u2019t have enough people to run the shop here right now.\u201dUnderstaffed \u201cfast casual\u201d restaurants \u2014 frozen yogurt, cupcake and tea shops; pok\u00e9 bars; and salad stations where customers order from the counter \u2014 have replaced older mom-and-pop restaurants. Other newcomers are well-heeled chains like Nobu, the global sushi empire that announced plans to open a restaurant in Palo Alto, and Sweetgreen, the salad chain start-up that has raised $95 million in venture capital funding and can offset the costs of doing business in Palo Alto with sales from its more than 50 other locations.Not everyone is so fortunate. \u201cWe\u2019re competing more for staff than we are for guests at this point,\u201d said Craig Stoll, a James Beard Award-winning chef and co-owner with his wife, Annie Stoll, of Delfina.The Stolls own four restaurants in San Francisco and two in Silicon Valley \u2014 one in Burlingame and the other in Palo Alto. They have not been able to fully staff their Silicon Valley locations since they opened about two years ago. They used to require their line cooks to have particular experience. \u201cNow we\u2019re just selling ourselves on Craigslist, posting pictures of cooks butchering pigs, saut\u00e9ing, and good-looking waitresses to recruit staff,\u201d Mr. Stoll said.In the last year, the Stolls have lost several of their best servers and their director of operations to Twitter and Airbnb in San Francisco. To compete, the couple have been increasing pay and perks as much as possible, but they say they still often have to close off entire sections of their Silicon Valley restaurants simply because there is not enough staff to service them.Recently, they have resorted to hiring their 14-year-old daughter and her friends to step in. \u201cWe\u2019re breeding our own work force at this point,\u201d Mr. Stoll joked.Just a few blocks from Pizzeria Delfina in Palo Alto, JC Andrade, an owner of Vino Locale, a family-run wine bar, said his bar lost its previous chef to Facebook. His family increased workers\u2019 pay and now offers a 401(k) program, but Facebook and Google continue to offer his staff higher wages than Mr. Andrade said he makes as owner. Increasingly, he said, he has to beg his 15-year-old brother to pick up shifts.Last year, Brigette Lau and Chamath Palihapitiya, founders of the venture fund Social Capital, opened Bird Dog, a stylish restaurant downtown. They had backing from other Silicon Valley investors eager to bring a slice of younger, innovative and relatively affordable San Francisco-style cuisine to downtown Palo Alto.But even with Silicon Valley\u2019s backing and their own substantial means \u2014 Mr. Palihapitiya is part owner of the Golden State Warriors basketball team \u2014 Ms. Lau said operating a restaurant in Palo Alto was not for the faint of heart.\u201cI\u2019m supportive of the start-up community, but not at the expense of the community,\u201d she said.Walk around downtown Palo Alto and you will probably stumble on an enticing dining space where seasonal menus with dishes like Cuban braised pork tease passers-by. But do not try to enter without a badge. The space is Palantir Technologies\u2019 private, fully staffed, employee-only cafeteria. The privately held software company now occupies over 12 percent of the rentable commercial office space downtown, according to the research firm PrivCo.The newest options for locals include Zume Pizza in nearby Mountain View, where robots cook the pizza. Zume delivers to Palo Alto \u2014 perhaps in driverless cars in a few years.On Palo Alto\u2019s main street, adult-size robots, with screens featuring real people speaking from their homes in Bermuda or Kansas City, greet pedestrians and escort them into a Beam robot shop, which is unstaffed and empty save for the other robots selling themselves.\u201cWe joke that we\u2019re all going to end up like Beam robots,\u201d said Mr. Andrade, of Vino Locale. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before someone hands them a tray.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Pat McCrory, a former mayor of Charlotte, said on Friday that \u201cthere are some groups that are coming into our state that are here to cause anarchy and to not respect our law, respect our property or to respect our citizens.\u201dPolice officials have said that most of the arrests since the protests began were of North Carolina residents.\u201cThere are, like, 10 organizers in Charlotte who do everything and so on the drop of a dime, maybe we could get like 250 people to show up to something,\u201d Ashley S. Williams said.But Tamika Lewis, 27, another local organizer, said activists sought outside help in frustration. \u201cThey are clearly not listening to the citizens of Charlotte, so we are calling in reinforcements,\u201d she said. She has opened her four-bedroom home to at least 10 protesters, who are spending nights strategizing and sharing tips about how to stay safe during potential clashes with the police.\u201cPeople were talking about they need somewhere to shower, and I was like, \u2018Well it\u2019s only me and my room tonight. Come on,\u2019\u201d she said.On Friday outside the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police station and under the glow of streetlights, some demonstrators bobbed their heads as a hip-hop song played through speakers from a man\u2019s book bag.\u201cWe ain\u2019t meant to survive because it\u2019s a setup and even though you\u2019re fed up, you\u2019ve got to keep your head up,\u201d Tupac Shakur bellowed as a helicopter circled above. \u201cKeep your head up.\u201d Nearby, a first-time protester, Kendra Taylor, 38, a nurse from Charlotte, was feeling inspired.\u201cIt makes me want to go out and support other cities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the numbers that show people that we are serious about something having to change.\u201dAlan Blinder contributed reporting.slide showAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video of Fatal Police Shooting of Louisiana Boy, 6, Is Released", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe police video footage of the last moments of 6-year-old Jeremy Mardis\u2019s life shows deputy marshals firing a barrage of bullets at his father\u2019s S.U.V. after a car chase on the dark streets of central Louisiana. It shows his father slumped over the open car window, injured and bleeding.Minutes later, the words of an officer can be heard: \u201cThere\u2019s a juvenile.\u201dThe video was released on Wednesday at a preliminary hearing in a Louisiana court before the deputy marshals, Officer Norris Greenhouse Jr. and Lt. Derrick Stafford, were tried on charges of second-degree murder. It was the first public glimpse of what happened on Nov. 3 in Marksville, a small city near the Mississippi border.It raised questions about basic police tactics and the wisdom of high-speed chases. But the fatal shooting of the child, who was white, received little of the national attention that has trailed other police killings. It spurred no organized street protests; no viral hashtags; no movement like Black Lives Matter, which was sparked by anger and despair over a wave of killings of African-Americans by law enforcement officials.Some differences in the case are clear:\u25a0 Charges were filed against the officers in the case.\u25a0 The shooting flips the racial narrative that has prompted protests across the nation: white officers shooting unarmed black men or black men legally allowed to carry weapons.\u25a0 Video of the Louisiana killing had been missing from public view until Wednesday. At the time of the shooting, Facebook Live had not become a widespread tool used by people at traffic stops, such as during the fatal shooting in July of Philando Castile in Minnesota, spurring outrage.\u201cThey are disproportionately likely to attract police attention, and when they do, they are more likely to have force used on them. And so it is just way more likely that something horrible is going to go wrong,\u201d David A. Harris, a professor and expert in police accountability at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, said in a telephone interview on Thursday.Some families of white victims, however, have been vocal about the fact that their cases are not drawing the same level of outrage and official scrutiny.\u201cOne of the major things we said is that if Zachary had been a person of color, there would not have been a hotel room available up and down from Atlanta through South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Bland said.As for Jeremy\u2019s case, it did not resonate in the same category of other police shootings, Mr. Harris said, because it was \u201creally counter to the general narrative of police overreaching and killing someone.\u201dMr. Harris, voicing what could be one possible public perception of the Louisiana case, said of Mr. Few, who had his son beside him while the police chased, \u201cHe had had a role in creating this risk that a lot of people would say, \u2018This is kind of on him.\u2019 \u201dOfficer Greenhouse and Lieutenant Stafford were moonlighting as deputy city marshals when they began chasing Jeremy\u2019s father. Initial reports said they wanted to serve a warrant, but officials have not definitively said why they were trying to arrest him.There are glimpses of Mr. Few with his hands up out the driver\u2019s side window. The deputies appear to begin shooting before the audio begins. Then, after the sound of gunfire, they are heard shouting at Mr. Few to show his hands. His form is blurred out in some footage as he slumps against the car door. More officers arrive and walk over to the vehicle. The body of the child is discovered.\u201cI never saw a kid in the car, man,\u201d Lieutenant Stafford, accused of firing 14 of the shots, is heard saying. \u201cI never saw a kid, bro.\u201dSomeone in the background can be heard throwing up.The two Marksville police officers were charged last November with second-degree murder.The Associated Press reported that the defense lawyers said Mr. Few had driven recklessly in a two-mile chase and then rammed into Officer Greenhouse\u2019s vehicle as he was exiting it, before the deputies opened fire.Christopher LaCour, a defense lawyer, was quoted in other reports as saying the deputies had acted in self-defense. \u201cChristopher Few was a suspect before they knew that child was in the car,\u201d Mr. LaCour said. He did not immediately reply to a phone message on Thursday.Lieutenant Stafford\u2019s trial is set for November, and Officer Greenhouse\u2019s trial is scheduled for March.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Sailors Needed: Robot Sailboats Scour the Oceans for Data", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALAMEDA, Calif. \u2014 Two robotic sailboats trace lawn-mower-style paths across the violent surface of the Bering Sea, off the coast of Alaska. The boats are counting fish \u2014 pollock, to be specific \u2014 with a fancy version of the fish finder sonar you\u2019d find on a bass fishing boat.About 2,500 miles away, Richard Jenkins, a mechanical engineer and part-time daredevil, is tracking the robot sailboats on a large projection screen in an old hangar that used to be part of the Alameda Naval Air Station. Now the hangar is the command center of a little company called Saildrone.At least 20 companies are chasing the possibly quixotic dream of a self-driving car in Silicon Valley. But self-sailing boats are already a real business.While they are counting fish, Saildrone\u2019s boats are also monitoring the seals that feed on the fish by tracking transponders that scientists have attached to the heads of the seals.\u201cWe can tell them what size fish they are eating and why they are going there,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, who is the chief executive and a co-founder of the company.Last summer, working with scientists and engineers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the boats skimmed along the edge of the retreating Arctic ice cap, giving scientists a detailed account of temperature, salinity and ecosystem information that would have been difficult and expensive to obtain in person.The Saildrone autonomous sailboats look a little like shrunken America\u2019s Cup racing yachts \u2014 small trimarans with hard, carbon-fiber sails.The Saildrone\u2019s carbon fiber sail acts like an aircraft wing. When air passes over it, thrust is created. The sail is stabilized by a counterweight that is placed in front of it and a tab trailing behind it that can automatically make small corrections to make sure it maintains an efficient angle to the wind. Underneath the boat are both a rudder to aid in steering and a keel, which will right the boat if it is knocked over.The big difference, of course, is that there are no sailors on board. The boats are controlled through communications satellites from the operations center here as they collect oceanographic data and monitor fish stocks and the environment.One day, they may be used for weather prediction, oil and gas industry ocean operations, or even to police illegal fishing.Mr. Jenkins has a much grander vision. He believes the missing piece of the puzzle to definitively comprehend the consequences of global warming is scientific data. He envisions a fleet of thousands or even tens of thousands of his 23-foot sailboats creating a web of sensors across the world\u2019s oceans.Vast amounts of data collected by his robots could reveal with greater detail the extent and rate at which global warming might become an existential threat to humanity and whether it is happening in decades rather than centuries.That is, if someone is willing to pay for all that. The boats are not sold \u2014 the scientists, commercial fisherman and weather predictors pay a $2,500-a-day fee per boat for the data they produce.Saildrone got its start with $2.5 million in grants from Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s executive chairman, and his wife, Wendy Schmidt. And Mr. Jenkins\u2019s company recently received $14 million in financing from three socially minded venture capital firms: Social Capital, Lux and Capricorn.\u201cMy interest in Saildrone is very practical,\u201d said Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive who is the founder of Social Capital. \u201cLet\u2019s stop arguing about what is happening, and let\u2019s measure. Once you have data and it\u2019s statistically significant and valid, then we can get to the next step, which is to find what the structural reforms are that need to happen.\u201dEach boat is packed with an armory of scientific sensors that beam data back to the control center.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much taking the earth\u2019s temperature as it is its pulse,\u201d said Mr. Jenkins, a 39-year-old, tousle-haired mechanical engineer who was trained at Imperial College London.He has found willing clients in ocean scientists and engineers who previously had limited ways to collect highly specific and accurate data about the ocean surface.\u201cRichard had a great boat but no scientific sensors on it, and we had sensors but no boat,\u201d said Christian Meinig, the director of engineering at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. The scientists at the laboratory have already begun to use the boats to enhance their study of the El Ni\u00f1o warm-water pattern in the Pacific Ocean.The breakthrough for the robots was a sailboat design that Mr. Jenkins originally began pursuing when he set out to capture the world land-sailing speed record in 1999. He succeeded in 2009 in a \u201cland yacht\u201d called Greenbird that reached a speed of 126.2 m.p.h. on a dry lake bed in Southern California.To reach such a high speed and remain stable, Mr. Jenkins replaced the traditional sailboat sail with a rigid vertical carbon-fiber wing coupled with a unique stabilizer trailing behind the wing that would automatically adjust the wing faster than a human sailor could respond by pulling ropes.He has repurposed the wing to sail at slower speeds and to autonomously travel anywhere in the world. Last year, in an experiment, one of the Saildrone boats made its way from Alameda to the Equator in 42 days, collecting a wealth of ocean surface data along the way. A scientific research vessel with a large human crew would be faster, but it would cost about $80,000 a day.That researchers can move the autonomous boats \u2014 unlike the static ocean buoys that are now typically used \u2014 is significant, because it allows scientists to alter collection patterns in response to ocean conditions and interesting discoveries.\u201cA self-correcting model is really a superpowerful way of doing things,\u201d said Christopher Sabine, an oceanographer who is director of Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. \u201cFor climate modeling we need to know what\u2019s going on year-round, and to be perfectly frank, we don\u2019t like to go out into the middle of winter.\u201dSaildrone is not the only autonomous vehicle on the sea. Liquid Robotics, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., makes a boat called Wave Glider, which uses wave rather than wind action to move at more than two knots and carry up to 100 pounds of instruments.The Saildrone payload is more than twice as large, and the boat is potentially twice as fast. The sensor suite is made up of more than a dozen instruments that capture wind speeds, radiation, still and video imagery, temperature, ocean chemistry, and other data.Mr. Jenkins\u2019s contention is that a fleet of robot sensors spread across an ocean like the Pacific will make a huge difference in both weather and climate prediction. For example, a better understanding of a weather phenomenon like El Ni\u00f1o could make a difference worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201cThey completely failed to see the last one coming,\u201d he said, noting that climate scientists acknowledge they don\u2019t have the spatial resolution to make accurate predictions. \u201cThey have a pressing need for more data.\u201dAn article on Monday about drone sailboats that gather research data misidentified the variety of fish being counted off the coast of Alaska by boats deployed by a company called Saildrone. The drones are counting pollock, not haddock.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Deflategate Scientists Unlock Their Lab", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "The researchers whose work led to Tom Brady\u2019s suspension have never spoken publicly. Now they\u2019re eager to say they were right, no matter what Patriots fans believe.Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 It was over 100 degrees in the scrubby sprawl on the city\u2019s northern frontier earlier this month, but inside the 40-foot-long thermal chamber, it was 48 degrees \u2014 same as it was for the playoff game on that January night in Foxborough, Mass. The floor was covered in green artificial turf, like a football field.Through a side door was a similarly stark and windowless space, this one at room temperature, the same setting as the officials\u2019 locker room in Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots, about 2,300 miles away.\u201cWe\u2019re heading into where we spent about three months of our lives a year and a half ago,\u201d Pye said.And suddenly he was transported to another time, another place, when (and where) N.F.L. footballs and air pressure were all the rage.The 2016 season has started without the Patriots\u2019 star quarterback, Tom Brady, who is serving a four-game suspension for his role, murky as it may be, in Deflategate. Brady and the Patriots were ensnared in a contentious investigation to determine if, for the A.F.C. championship game in January 2015, against the Indianapolis Colts, they conspired to purposely deflate their game-day footballs below league standards for Brady\u2019s benefit.Part of the reason Brady is not playing now is what Pye and his co-workers found then \u2014 or, more precisely, could not find: a plausible scientific explanation for why the Patriots\u2019 balls were not fully inflated.\u201cI would feel bad if I thought I made a mistake or I thought I overlooked something,\u201d Pye said. \u201cBut we made measurements and put the facts out, and it went from there.\u201dDeflategate swept a nation into debates over science (the Ideal Gas Law) and culture (cheating in sports), from the predictable (Can the N.F.L. be trusted? Can the Patriots?) to the less so (What is the effect of vigorous rubbing on a football?). Arguments were clouded by allegiances and conspiracy theories, reports and rumors.But it was here, in the temperature-controlled silence of a desert bunker, that Pye oversaw months of experiments to try to determine if air was intentionally removed from the footballs, or if the recorded levels could be explained by science.When the results of the N.F.L.\u2019s investigation were released in May 2015, the sports world devoured it. It was called the Wells report, and the first half of it was filled with circumstantial evidence of foul play and delicious components of a great mystery.There was the setting, in a modern American castle, the home stadium of the league\u2019s top franchise. There was no dead body, but a pile of game-used footballs. There was no smoking gun, but there were conflicting pressure gauges. There was a famous athlete linked to shadowy ball boys by text messages that hinted at a cover-up. There were bungling investigators (game officials) and an unexplained bathroom stop. There was even a rainy night.Like an ink blot, it became whatever anyone wanted to see.The second part of the Wells report did not receive the full brunt of attention initially. It was a wonky scientific document filled with equations, tables and graphs, linked by explanations of experimental methods and laws of physics. It was 68 pages, plus a six-page executive summary at the beginning and a nine-page appendix at the end. The title pages said that it was \u201cprepared by\u201d a company called Exponent, of Menlo Park, Calif.Pye was one of four primary scientists and engineers leading Exponent\u2019s investigation. Exponent \u201cidentified no set of credible environmental or physical factors that completely accounts for the additional loss in air pressure.\u201d It did not say that someone deliberately removed air from the footballs, but it might as well have.Soon enough, the Exponent report, too, was submerged by scrutiny. With the name of the firm and the men responsible for producing it now public, the attacks came from swarms of Patriots fans, which was to be expected. More surprising, at least to Exponent, the work was pulled apart by other scientists. Several went public with their critiques.Exponent heard and read it all and said nothing, maintaining what it calls \u201cprofessional silence\u201d until the entire matter was resolved. That took more than a year of hearings and appeals and talk of Brady taking the case to the United States Supreme Court.Now that Brady has accepted his punishment and is sitting out, Exponent is finally talking. And it wants everyone to know: It was right all along.Caligiuri stood alongside Ganot, 32, a materials engineer, in the lobby of the Midtown Hilton. They had just finished a meeting a block away at the New York offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the law firm hired by the N.F.L. to investigate the fast-spreading wildfire already known as Deflategate.The law firm needed someone to investigate the science portion of the scandal. One of Ganot\u2019s former professors at Columbia recommended Exponent.At the time, Pye was working on a project for Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense, designing robot-driven Land Rovers fitted with ground-penetrating radar systems to detect improvised explosive devices in the Middle East.\u201cJohn, we need you to do these tests for us,\u201d Pye recalled Caligiuri saying. \u201cIt\u2019s footballs. I\u2019m going to give you some pressures and I\u2019m going to give you some scenarios, temperatures and environment, and I need you to do some tests.\u201dPye smiled at the memory.\u201cIt always starts with \u2018some tests,\u2019\u201d he said.Caligiuri passed along the basics: The Patriots\u2019 footballs were thought to be pumped up to about 12.5 p.s.i. before the game, the Colts\u2019 balls at 13 p.s.i. The halftime readings were much lower and varied. The temperature outside was 48 degrees. It was known that the balls were tested at halftime inside, at room temperature: 11 Patriots balls but only four Colts balls, because officials ran out of time. The referee had two gauges, and one was way off.\u201cThese halftime measurements, is there really anything there?\u201d Caligiuri said, boiling down Exponent\u2019s mission. \u201cThat\u2019s the basis for it.\u201dPye was still on the phone when he started plugging numbers into the Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT. Pressure drops with temperature. The balls would, of course, be deflated by halftime, to some degree.\u201cMy impression from the very first phone call was that this was going to be an explainable thing,\u201d Pye said.\u201cIs there a real difference here?\u201d Steffey said. \u201cBecause we were about to embark on a significant investigation, and if all of this is within the noise level, and within a margin of error, then there\u2019s really nothing here. So that\u2019s the first thing we did.\u201dWithin a day or two, it was clear: The numbers were statistically significant. They could not be fully explained within accepted error margins.\u201cWe knew this was going to get a lot of scrutiny, from your eighth-grade science classes to your physics professors,\u201d Pye said. \u201cSo we wanted to try to answer all those questions.\u201dThe conference room at Exponent\u2019s Phoenix laboratory has vast windows overlooking the mostly shadeless landscape. About 10 scientists and engineers gathered around the room\u2019s oval table and tossed around ideas, which were written on a whiteboard.\u201cEverything we can think of,\u201d Pye said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s human related, environment related, physics related, materials related, including the football and the gauge itself. We tackle the measurements, we tackle the environment, we tackle the inflation side. And we write this all down, kind of group them, think of ways we can refine this model. And then I get back on the phone to Bob. He\u2019s back to Menlo Park at this point, and I said, \u2018Bob, we\u2019ve got a plan.\u2019\u201dCaligiuri, a grandfather with a trim white mustache, oversaw everything. Steffey handled the statistics. Pye handled the experiments. Ganot was the go-between, making six trips to Phoenix in the course of a couple of months.Not all of Exponent\u2019s work receives public scrutiny, but Caligiuri knew this would, maybe as much as anything.\u201cWe knew there would be controversy here,\u201d Caligiuri said. \u201cAnd we needed absolutely the best people we could possibly put on it. That\u2019s why I organized it the way I did. I knew the way to approach this \u2014 and frankly we had seen the news, we saw the people blaming it on the way he rubbed the footballs and people talking about it and stuff \u2014 and we knew that there were some questionable things out there already. So we knew we needed to be totally bulletproof here.\u201dThe U-shaped, three-story Exponent headquarters in Menlo Park is about 10 miles from where Tom Brady went to high school. It is fronted by a shallow rectangular pool whose primary feature is a twisted, blue steel beam bent into a loop, like an unfamiliar cursive letter. It was part of a 2,000-foot television transmission tower in Missouri that collapsed during repairs in 1988. Some of the falling beams, 35 feet long and five inches in diameter, buried themselves 40 feet into the ground. Exponent investigated the accident.The company now employs more than 1,000 people working out of 20 offices, including two in Asia and two in Europe. It went public in 1990 (its ticker symbol was FAIL), changed its named to Exponent in 1998 (ticker symbol: EXPO), and reported revenue of nearly $313 million last year.Exponent\u2019s work force includes nearly 500 employees with doctorates. They include physicists, metallurgists, epidemiologists, automotive engineers and data scientists.\u201cEverything from A to Z,\u201d Caligiuri said. \u201cArchitects to zoologists. I think we still have a zoologist.\u201dThe work is now fairly divided between \u201creactive\u201d investigations (what went wrong) and \u201cproactive\u201d projects (product development). For the latter, having its headquarters in Silicon Valley \u2014 Facebook headquarters is a mile away \u2014 was a stroke of good fortune for Exponent. To get an idea of the breadth of companies that have hired Exponent, Caligiuri said, \u201clook at the Fortune 500.\u201dExponent certainly has its critics. It is often hired by insurance companies and companies in duress, perhaps facing lawsuits and the prospect of monstrous recalls and payouts. And when those companies receive research from Exponent that supports their claims \u2014 that says they or the company they insure were not at fault, for example \u2014 they often use the research to bolster their case, in courtrooms and in the court of public opinion.Automobile companies routinely hire Exponent to provide backup investigations during scandals, one reason Exponent\u2019s 150-acre complex in Phoenix includes a two-mile oval track, for testing \u2014 and crashing \u2014 cars and other vehicles. Exponent\u2019s research and experts have sided with the likes of Suzuki (with rollover worries about its Samurai) and Toyota (unintended acceleration). A 2013 Exponent investigation into a long fight over ignition switches in General Motors cars helped lead to a widespread recall.The investigative report into accusations that the New England Patriots improperly deflated game balls in last January\u2019s A.F.C. championship game.Exponent staunchly denies that its scientific favor can be bought. It says that it is just as likely that its research runs counter to its clients\u2019 hopes, but that research then gets tucked away, never to see the light of day.\u201cClients hire Exponent because of our reputation for our independent, high quality, thorough and objective technical and scientific evaluations,\u201d Exponent\u2019s chief executive, Paul Johnston, said in an email. \u201cWe frequently give results to clients that are not what they would have wished, which can often be seen through the resulting product recalls.\u201dThe first-floor hallways of Exponent\u2019s California headquarters are lined with laboratories, all accessible only with an electronic card. There is a biomedical lab with a bone-cutting saw. There is a fluids lab with a combustion chamber. There is a chemistry lab, a photonics lab, a chromatography lab. There are X-ray machines, CT scanners and two scanning electron microscopes.Client confidentiality is a major issue. To prepare for a visit from a journalist and a photographer, Exponent employees covered a couple of in-progress, large-scale experiments in blue tarps. A 3-D printer in the prototype room was hidden behind paper while it hummed and buzzed.Out a side door, where the traffic from nearby Highway 101 could be seen and heard, a warehouse is filled with objects from prior experiments. Ganot described it as the warehouse from the final scene of \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark,\u201d but would not permit a look inside. Outside, in the sun, the ground was covered in metal parts and enormous gas pipes, some of them burst, all of them there to be studied because something had gone wrong. A car nearby was covered in a tarp, unidentifiable.It might be strange, then, that a company that covets discretion and is known, if at all, for investigating disasters that often kill people and can cost billions of dollars in damages, would want to tackle something as mundane and inconsequential as the air inside N.F.L. footballs.\u201cThe visibility of this project fits into some of the largest that we do at this firm,\u201d Pye said. \u201cBut when you think about the impact? Meh. Not so much. No one is losing their lives here. The building is not burning down. The vehicle is not crashing. The product is still working. Nothing\u2019s caught on fire.\u201dSo why even get involved?\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting scientific problem,\u201d Caligiuri said. \u201cIt clearly was not as simple as what it was portrayed in the early days. Frankly, it could be controversial, but we are not afraid of controversial matters.\u201dThe temperature inside the thermal chamber at Exponent\u2019s highly secured laboratories in Phoenix can be set anywhere from minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) to 60 (140 degrees Fahrenheit).Depending on the day, it might hold a car or a truck or batteries or personal electronics or something else that someone wants to test for performance in extreme conditions. In early 2015, during the N.F.L. playoffs, it was filled with hot tubs.Then the Patriots beat the Colts and the Deflategate scandal began. Thousands of fans and media members converged on Arizona for the Super Bowl in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale, unaware that the cold conditions at New England\u2019s Gillette Stadium soon would be reconstructed in a thermal lab in the desert a few miles away.Pye was in charge. He is a gregarious man with the air of a suburban dad. He did not play football but looks as if he could have. Pye and his wife have a son and a daughter, and their son plays football for the freshman team at his high school.Now Pye can perform a good party trick. Toss him a football and ask about its pressure.\u201cI\u2019ll say 12.3,\u201d he said, squeezing one. He stuck a gauge in it and showed the digital result: 12.25.Pye was born in Kamloops, British Columbia, but his family moved frequently because his father managed hotels. Pye ended up in Florida for high school, then back to the University of Toronto for a degree in engineering science. He earned a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate in aerospace engineering at Stanford. That led him to nearby Exponent, where much of Pye\u2019s work involves robotics and the military. Since 2005, Pye, now an American citizen, has overseen Exponent\u2019s Test and Engineering Center on the far northern edge of Phoenix.\u201cWhat we do here is the big stuff,\u201d Pye said.Exponent could have investigated footballs just about anywhere. But Phoenix had a big thermal chamber. It had Pye. And was just about as far from New England as could be.\u201cA rule we enforced on ourselves is that we had to control for football-fan bias,\u201d Pye said. \u201cSo we specifically did not involve our Boston office.\u201dGanot went to Gillette Stadium to examine the scene of the alleged football crime. He wanted to understand the space between the field and the officials\u2019 locker room, since temperature transitions were an important part of the experiments. He wanted to examine the room\u2019s heating and cooling system, the reliability of its thermostat, the consistency of the room conditions.The locker room in Arizona was roughly the same size as the one in Gillette Stadium and was set to match the known conditions from the game. Next door, the floor of the \u201cfield\u201d was covered in artificial turf. It was not merely decoration. Pye wanted something that could get wet so that when the balls hit the ground, they would pick up moisture, just as they did on that cold, wet night in Massachusetts.The experiments began with the two gauges used by the referee Walt Anderson \u2014 one called the \u201clogo\u201d gauge, with a Wilson logo on it, the other the \u201cnon-logo\u201d gauge. One gave relatively accurate pressure readings, while the other read significantly higher, adding to the cloud of confusion over Deflategate.Pye\u2019s nine-member team analyzed the gauges and compared them to 50 others of the same model. They tested the potential effects of temperature, various ball pressures and battery life. Did it matter that one had a longer needle? (No.) Did it matter who used them? (No.)Analysis of the gauges consumed 18 pages of the report. Among its conclusions was that the gauges used were different, but consistently different.About half of the report was devoted to \u201cphysical, usage, and environmental effects.\u201d Did the balls lose air when used in the game? (According to automated squeezing tests with 650 pounds of force administered 1,000 times, no.) Does vigorous rubbing matter? (Yes, but the effect wears off in 30 minutes, long before the officials would have tested the air pressure before the game.)As part of those experiments, Pye set up a television replaying the game in real time. Exponent employees imitated what they watched \u2014 throwing the balls, falling on them, shuffling them out of play, wiping them with towels, spraying them with water to simulate rain.\u201cHe was the head ball boy,\u201d Pye said, nodding to an employee named Daniel Kingsley.The trickiest part of the investigation, and where there remains the most debate, was over the timing of the measurements taken at halftime. The Ideal Gas Law and Gay-Lussac\u2019s law are among those that explain how much the air pressure inside something like a football decreases with colder temperatures and increases with warmer ones.The tougher question facing Deflategate investigators was determining how quickly the internal temperature and pressure of the balls would have changed as the environment changed. And while officials recorded the order of balls as they were measured during about 13 minutes of halftime \u2014 Patriots\u2019 balls first \u2014 the exact timing was unclear.\u201cIf you waited forever in the locker room before you took the halftime measurements, they should be the same,\u201d Pye said. \u201cThe issue was that it was something less than that.\u201dFor weeks, Pye and his team ran tests, ball by ball, gauge by gauge, game simulation after game simulation, trying to account for all the possibilities.In the end, Exponent said that it could not \u201cdetermine with absolute certainty\u201d whether there had been tampering with New England\u2019s balls. The insinuation was more damning.\u201cWe conclude that within the range of game characteristics most likely to have occurred on Game Day, we have identified no set of credible environmental or physical factors that completely accounts for the additional loss in air pressure exhibited by the Patriots game balls as compared to the loss in air pressure exhibited by the Colts game balls,\u201d the report said.\u201cIf we had the exact same report and would have said the pressures are explainable, you never would have heard anything about it,\u201d Pye said. \u201cThe N.F.L. would have said, \u2018Oh, O.K., and moved on.\u2019 You wouldn\u2019t have heard about Exponent, you wouldn\u2019t have heard about John Pye, you wouldn\u2019t have heard about all the things that happened from then.\u201dExponent submitted the report to Paul, Weiss, the law firm in New York. There had been little interaction between the coinciding investigations \u2014 one featuring dozens of interviews and analysis of text messages and fascinating behind-the-scenes accounts and entanglements, and Exponent\u2019s dive into the science of air pressure.(One exception came when Paul, Weiss asked Exponent if it was possible for someone to take a bag of 12 footballs into a bathroom and deflate them, at least a little, in 1 minute 40 seconds. A Patriots ball boy was seen taking balls into the bathroom on the way to the field before the game, and it became the primary theory for how the balls lost their air pressure. Pye found a small office and had several Exponent employees try. Yes, definitely, he told the lawyers in New York.)Exponent officials heard it and read it all. They remained silent as their reputation took shot after shot.\u201cThat was difficult,\u201d Caligiuri said. \u201cThere\u2019s always an urge to respond to critics.\u201dPye put the critics into three categories. One was the unabashed fan who was \u201cgoing to make the call on feeling over questions of fact.\u201d\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d Pye said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the world we live in.\u201dSecond were the armchair scientists, those who understood enough to raise reasonable questions, usually quickly dismissed. Exponent anticipated them in this case, which is one reason it conducted every experiment it could think of, even if it knew the answers. \u201cWe tried to head those people off,\u201d Pye said.Third were Exponent\u2019s peers, the usual audience for Exponent\u2019s work. They are the ones who frustrate Exponent most.\u201cThe real world is the real world \u2014 it\u2019s not a binary thing,\u201d Pye said. \u201cBinary is a human invention; the real world has a continuum. So you need to understand where your work fits on that continuum. To those people, we wanted to provide enough data so that they could understand what we did, but also understand the significance of what we did. What I found, in a lot of criticisms, is that subtlety, that significance piece, was missed.\u201dCaligiuri was more direct.\u201cWhat disappoints me the most from the scientific community is they said we didn\u2019t do things that we did,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s in the report. I believe in the scientific method. I believe in challenging what people say. That\u2019s all part of the verification and validation process. I have no problem with that. But if you\u2019re going to look at what someone else has put forward as a hypothesis, a theory or experimental verification, you have to understand what they did, and then work from there. And I\u2019m not sure that everybody did that.\u201d\u201cThe hearing was somewhat therapeutic,\u201d Steffey said.Exponent still receives emails from adamant critics, and its role in Deflategate has cost it several prospective clients, the company said. At least one in the Northeast told Exponent that it could not risk its own credibility by being associated with the company behind the controversial Deflategate science.But there are no regrets. Brady is sitting out his suspension, and Exponent has moved on. The thermal chamber still has its artificial turf, but it now is testing lithium-ion batteries, not footballs.\u201cThe thing that I wanted to make sure came out when we were no longer quiet was that there\u2019s real science here,\u201d Pye said. \u201cThere\u2019s real engineering. We didn\u2019t start from feelings. We started from facts \u2014 the facts that we had, which were complete to the degree that they were complete. And we took those as far as we thought science and engineering could take them. And then presented that.\u201dPye opened the metal door of the chamber. He stepped out of the New England winter night and into the afternoon blast of an Arizona summer.An earlier version of this article misstated the distance from Phoenix to Foxborough, Mass. It is about 2,300 miles, not 3,500.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hundreds of Pounds Lighter, and Now Shedding Another Burden of the Past", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLosing 650 pounds is a remarkable achievement, but it does not mean the end of your troubles.It may not sound like much. But imagine how it would feel, for instance, to have a loose sac weighing three pounds attached to the bottom of each of your upper arms. The skin not only swung down in a huge arc but also rubbed against itself, a constant reminder of the person Mr. Mason so wants to put behind him.\u201cI still feel trapped in this excess skin,\u201d Mr. Mason said from his bed on Wednesday morning, as the surgeons marked his body for the operation. \u201cThis will be life-changing for me again.\u201dThe surgery was again performed without charge at Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan by a team of seven led by three doctors from three different hospitals. It was painstaking, precise and extraordinarily complex. Cutting off a mass of extra skin, as anyone who has been obese and has lost a great deal of weight knows, is not a matter of simply taking a scalpel, snipping it away and stitching it up.\u201cThe three of us spent a long time figuring out how to deal with the reality of his arms \u2014 the amount of excess skin is far beyond what we can normally handle,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Capla, who performed the surgery along with two longtime colleagues: Dr. Joseph Michaels, a plastic surgeon in Bethesda, Md., and Dr. J. Peter Rubin, chairman of the plastic surgery department at the University of Pittsburgh.The team had to work out where to make the incisions, far trickier in this case than in most. There was also the question of the dozens of enlarged blood vessels that had to be cut along with the skin.Because Mr. Mason needed anticoagulants to prevent blood clots, the worry was that if the blood vessels were not thoroughly sealed, they could bleed out of control. \u201cIn normal life, we either clip or cauterize or tie a vessel,\u201d Dr. Capla said. \u201cIn Paul\u2019s case, we have to do all three for each one.\u201dMr. Mason moved to the United States when Dr. Capla, having read about him in The New York Times, volunteered to take charge of the skin-removal surgery no doctor in Britain had been willing to attempt.About the same time, Mr. Mason embarked on a Facebook relationship with a woman named Rebecca Mountain who had read about him and eventually invited him to move in with her in Massachusetts. They were engaged to be married; she was by his side during his operation last year.There have since been a number of changes in Mr. Mason\u2019s life, both positive and not, some chronicled on an intermittent TLC series about him. He and Ms. Mountain split up last year under the burden of financial worries and the stresses of living together with so much else going on. Mr. Mason now lives in an apartment in a rooming house. He has had a couple of other brief relationships, but none have worked out. \u201cI don\u2019t have much of a social life,\u201d he said.After the surgery last year, he got his weight down to about 310 pounds, started walking and began working out at a gym. But he\u2019s back around 350 pounds and has had several setbacks. He has arthritis in both knees. He is prone to frequent infections in one leg and requires intermittent hospitalization. Though no longer in a wheelchair, he walks rather painstakingly, with a cane.After the latest surgery, Mr. Mason said, he plans to address his arthritis, start exercising again and eventually buy a car. Money is tight, but he supports himself on a private pension from his earnings as a postal worker years ago, the last steady job he had. While he recovers, he is staying at a Manhattan hotel, his room paid for by an anonymous donor whose mother died of complications from obesity some years ago.The three doctors said that Mr. Mason\u2019s case was the most extreme they had ever worked on. Beyond that, they said, it has resonance at a time when obesity is an epidemic and many obese patients are unaware of the repercussions of extensive weight loss.\u201cThey\u2019re left with so many psychological scars,\u201d Dr. Michaels said, in addition to the excess skin and other physical problems left behind.Dr. Capla said she feels protective of Mr. Mason, who can seem so vulnerable, but who has persevered nonetheless.\u201cYou have to figure out what you want to live for,\u201d she said. \u201cFor someone who\u2019s so emotionally complicated, who could have given up many times \u2014 he hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s one of the most interesting parts of it, that you have someone who seems to have every reason to throw in the towel, and yet who has fought all the way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "N.F.L. Week 1: Here\u2019s Who We Think Will Win", "Date": "2016-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first week of the N.F.L. season features some important matchups between N.F.C. and A.F.C. teams, including one between the Patriots and the Cardinals on Sunday night. Here is a look at Sunday\u2019s matchups and who we think will win them (all times are Eastern):Follow our live coverage of NFL Week 1 here.1 p.m. on Fox Line: Packers by 5 \u00bd But the problem with winning the off-season is that it was probably preceded by a lot of losing, and that is definitely true for the Jaguars, who have not finished with a winning record since 2007 and are 19-61 over the last five seasons.There is no telling how the various pieces will mesh, but after the Jaguars were ranked 31st in the N.F.L. in points allowed last season, defense may no longer hold them back. That is because of additions like Malik Jackson, Prince Amukamara and Tashaun Gipson through free agency and Jalen Ramsey and Myles Jack through the draft. Jackson, a lineman who is coming off a Super Bowl win with the suffocating Denver Broncos defense, will be able to impart some of what he learned under the defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, but he will be adjusting to a 4-3 alignment after thriving in Phillips\u2019s 3-4.While losing teams rebuild, winning teams reload. The Packers have done that with the return of Jordy Nelson, the team\u2019s top wide receiver, who missed last season because of injury. Nelson is likely to be on a snap count to ease his return, but his presence turns Randall Cobb into an excellent No. 2 receiver, from a disappointing No. 1, and lets Davante Adams focus on just being a deep threat. Jared Cook, a tight end added as a free agent after his release by the Rams, may also step into an unexpectedly large role in the offense led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Despite all of those receiving threats, much of the talk around Green Bay has been about the off-season weight loss by Eddie Lacy, the team\u2019s big, bruising running back. Lacy became the latest athlete to show up in \u201cthe best shape of his life,\u201d which is a trope that no one seems to tire of.The future appears bright for Jacksonville, but beating Green Bay is probably still too optimistic.PICK: PACKERS8:30 p.m. on NBC Line: Cardinals by 6It will take time to determine if it was wise for New England to trade the veteran linebacker Chandler Jones to the Cardinals, but in Week 1, it will almost assuredly haunt the Patriots. Jones will be wreaking havoc as part of a stout Arizona defense that will do its best to make life miserable for Jimmy Garoppolo, New England\u2019s backup quarterback, who has been forced into a starting role because of Tom Brady\u2019s suspension.Adding Jones to a defense that ranked fifth in the N.F.L. last season in yards allowed seems almost unfair, and his new teammates are predicting big things for a player who had 30 sacks over the last three seasons.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it: He has that potential to be a 20-plus-sack guy,\u201d Arizona cornerback Patrick Peterson told reporters.Even worse news for Garoppolo, who threw four passes last season (and completed one), is the return to health of Tyrann Mathieu, a ball-hawking defensive back who recovered quickly from a torn anterior cruciate ligament. When asked what type of snap count Mathieu will be on, Coach Bruce Arians predicted he would appear on \u201cevery single play.\u201dThe Patriots have to hope Garoppolo can win at least two games in Brady\u2019s four-game absence, and New England\u2019s coaches and players have been saying all the right things. But playing on the road against one of the N.F.L.\u2019s best teams, without the help of an injured Rob Gronkowski, will probably begin Garoppolo\u2019s starting career with an 0-1 record.PICK: CARDINALS1 p.m. on CBS Line: Bengals by 2 \u00bdHad Andy Dalton not injured his thumb and missed the end of the season, things might have turned out better for the Bengals in a year in which they started 8-0. But without Dalton, Coach Marvin Lewis\u2019s playoff record in Cincinnati fell to 0-7, with things getting truly ugly in a wild-card loss to Pittsburgh.At full strength, the Bengals are a better team than the Jets, but they will play without the standout linebacker Vontaze Burfict, who is suspended for repeated violations of the league\u2019s safety rules, and the star tight end Tyler Eifert, who is recovering from off-season ankle surgery.The Jets, meanwhile, begrudgingly retained quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick after his franchise-record 31 touchdown passes last season. The pass-heavy attack, and a punishing defense, led to a 10-6 record in Coach Todd Bowles\u2019s first season, and the addition of Matt Forte, a two-time Pro Bowler, to the running game should help balance the offense.PICK: JETSMocking the Raiders has recently been like shooting fish in a barrel. As any number of detractors will point out, nobody has ever posted on Facebook, Twitter or any other social media platform that Oakland has qualified for the playoffs. The Raiders\u2019 drought began far before the popularity of those apps, as their last playoff game was a Super Bowl loss in January 2003, months before Apple launched the iTunes Music Store.Amid talks of a possible move to Los Angeles or Las Vegas, the Raiders have built a team that seems on the verge of big things, thanks to linebacker Khalil Mack, who is the rare type of player who single-handedly changes games. His 15 sacks last season felt like the beginning of something special.Oakland is also strong on offense, with quarterback Derek Carr having built a strong rapport with Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree, and Latavius Murray has shown flashes of brilliance at running back.The Saints will be a threat for as long as Drew Brees plays, especially when they are at home, but there is little reason to believe they suddenly know how to play defense.PICK: RAIDERSThe career trajectory of Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston is headed north, while Matt Ryan\u2019s has been crashing for a few years in Atlanta. But when the quarterbacks face off, there has to be some belief that Ryan\u2019s experience, plus home-field advantage, will be enough to dispatch an upstart team.Those expectations are tempered by the unclear status of Julio Jones\u2019s health. Jones, the Falcons\u2019 star wide receiver, nearly broke Calvin Johnson\u2019s single-season record for receiving yards last season, but he has been limited in practice by an ankle injury. If he is not at 100 percent, the door opens for Tampa Bay.Winston will be attacking the soft Atlanta defense with a strong supporting cast of Doug Martin, Mike Evans and Vincent Jackson. If the Bucs can get their scoring (20th in the N.F.L. last season) to catch up to their yardage (fifth in the N.F.L. last season), Winston will be at the helm of a playoff team.PICK: FALCONSCalvin Johnson\u2019s surprising retirement not only left the Lions without their No. 1 receiver, but it also will force a trial by fire for Golden Tate, who thrived as Detroit\u2019s No. 2 receiver last season but may have benefited greatly from Johnson\u2019s presence. As Detroit contemplates a post-Johnson world, the Colts are mostly hoping Andrew Luck can put his health concerns behind him.PICK: COLTSThe good news for Dak Prescott, a rookie who will begin the season as the Cowboys\u2019 starting quarterback because of a back injury to Tony Romo, is that he can hardly do worse than the 1-11 record Romo\u2019s backups produced last season. The even better news is that he may not be asked to do much, as Dallas\u2019s impenetrable offensive line should have a fairly easy time opening wide holes for Ezekiel Elliott, a rookie running back who could put up monster numbers.PICK: COWBOYSAnyone clamoring for Sam Bradford to start, or come on in relief, for Minnesota this week may be overestimating the difference between him and Shaun Hill, but either quarterback can probably manage enough offense to fend off a Titans team that has some promising pieces but is a long way from being dangerous.PICK: VIKINGSOlivier Vernon left for the Giants, Cameron Wake is fighting back from a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon and Ndamukong Suh seemed far less dominant in his first season in Miami. But even with that all being true, a strong game from the Dolphins\u2019 defensive line against a vulnerable Seattle offensive line is the best hope of this game not being embarrassing.PICK: SEAHAWKSThe Bills showed some promise for a bright future last season, but the team failed at the thing Coach Rex Ryan is known for: defense. Ryan brought in his brother Rob to help right the ship, and while the preseason was not very encouraging, Week 1 could see some improvement as two rookies are expected to start on the left side of Baltimore\u2019s offensive line.PICK: BILLS1 p.m. on CBS Line: Chiefs by 6 \u00bd Whether Jamaal Charles is ready to return from the knee injury he endured last season hardly seems to matter in the short term, as Charcandrick West and Spencer Ware are more than capable of piling up rushing yards against San Diego.PICK: CHIEFSBrock Osweiler may or may not succeed as a starting quarterback in the N.F.L. \u2014 the Denver Broncos certainly seemed skeptical when they let him walk away despite not having another experienced quarterback on the roster \u2014 but everyone is sure that at 6 feet 8, he is very tall. Just ask Coach John Fox of the Bears, who really drove that point home. \u201cHe\u2019s big, he\u2019s tall,\u201d Fox told reporters. \u201cHe is athletic for a tall man. A lot was made of his height, and he hangs in the pocket pretty well.\u201dFox\u2019s Bears also have a lot of questions in terms of ability, and are not nearly as tall.PICK: TEXANS1 p.m. on CBS Line: Eagles by 4The Browns were so sure that Carson Wentz was not a solution at quarterback that the team traded away the No. 2 pick in the draft rather than select him. It will be very awkward if his first N.F.L. game results in a win over the Browns.PICK: EAGLESTimes are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "World Leaders Gather to Mourn Shimon Peres, and Possibly His Dream", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by9 PhotosThe funeral brought together Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, something no mediator has been able to do in recent years, and the men shook hands and exchanged pleasantries. But the encounter went no further, and the momentary pause in their war of words seemed unlikely to last beyond the interment.In his eulogy, Mr. Netanyahu welcomed by name many of the foreign figures in attendance without mentioning Mr. Abbas. It was left to Mr. Obama to acknowledge the Palestinian leader, saying that his \u201cpresence here is a gesture and a reminder of the unfinished business of peace.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Abbas, in a move perceived by some analysts as a jab at Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government, brought along an adviser, Mohammed al-Madani, who was barred by Israel last summer for \u201csubversive\u201d activities. No ruler, president or prime minister of an Arab country came, although Egypt sent its foreign minister and others sent lower-ranking officials.Amos Oz, the famed Israeli author and a friend of Mr. Peres\u2019s, gave voice in his eulogy to what others were thinking, wondering about the fate of peace in a new era. With Israelis and Palestinians sharing a small piece of the world, he said, the only solution is the creation of a Palestinian state that Mr. Peres supported.\u201cIn their heart of hearts, all sides know this simple truth,\u201d Mr. Oz said as Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas listened. \u201cBut where are the leaders with the courage to come forward to make it come to pass? Where are the heirs to Shimon Peres?\u201dMr. Obama, who has been pressing the two sides to rejuvenate a peace process, made a similar point less directly. \u201cShimon never saw his dream of peace fulfilled,\u201d he said. And so, he added, \u201cNow this work is in the hands of Israel\u2019s next generation, in the hands of Israel\u2019s next generation and its friends.\u201dThe funeral drew delegations from 75 countries and such figures as former President Bill Clinton, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and King Felipe VI of Spain.About 4,000 mourners gathered underneath a tent on a warm, cloudless day at the national cemetery overlooking Jerusalem. Security was tight.A longtime security hawk, he helped build the nation\u2019s military and was instrumental in developing its nuclear program. Critics, especially Palestinians, castigate him for promoting the construction of settlements in territories seized in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 and for launching military operations that led to civilian deaths.But the peace process ultimately stalled, and today the region looks little like the peace once envisioned, amid continuing occupation, settlement construction, terrorism and incitement.Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas both say they are willing to negotiate, and each blames the other for resisting. Mr. Obama tried twice to restart talks, in vain, and is contemplating laying out his own proposed parameters for peace before leaving office in January.Echoing Mr. Clinton, who in 1995 memorably bid farewell to the assassinated Mr. Rabin by saying, \u201cShalom, chaver\u201d (\u201cFarewell, friend\u201d), Mr. Obama ended his eulogy for Mr. Peres by saying, \u201cTodah rabah, chaver yakar\u201d (\u201cthank you, dear friend\u201d).He ousted Mr. Peres as prime minister in 1996, but Mr. Netanyahu said they later became close friends and he spoke lovingly of their arguments over the best way to pursue peace for Israel.\u201cWe went back and forth for hours, flinging arguments at one another,\u201d he said. \u201cHe came from the left, I came from the right. I came from the right, and he came back from the left. And in the end, like two worn-out prizefighters, we put down our gloves. I saw in his eyes, and I think he saw in mine, that our principles stemmed from deep-seated beliefs and a commitment to the cause \u2014 ensuring Israel\u2019s future.\u201dThe idea of a negotiated resolution seems so out of reach that one eulogist after another used the word \u201cna\u00efve\u201d to describe the impression Mr. Peres left, even as they argued that it was a misunderstanding of his idealism.The obstacles to progress were evident on Friday. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas, who have not formally met in six years, shook hands before the service, as they did last year on the sidelines of a climate conference in Paris.\u201cLong time,\u201d Mr. Abbas said as he greeted Mr. Netanyahu and his wife, Sara. \u201cLong time.\u201d\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201dBut both came under fire just for that. Mr. Abbas\u2019s decision to come to a cemetery named for the founder of modern Zionism, Theodor Herzl, angered many Palestinians, who criticized him for honoring an enemy. In Gaza, one militant faction said in a statement that \u201cevery drop of blood from Arab and Muslim martyrs will curse Abbas.\u201dIt was a delicate issue on the other side, too, as Israeli officials debated overnight whether to seat Mr. Abbas in the front row. Ultimately they did, but he had no speaking role. Afterward, Naftali Bennett, a hard-line member of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, criticized the prime minister for shaking hands with Mr. Abbas, who \u201cis encouraging the murder of Israelis,\u201d as he wrote on Facebook, adding, \u201cLet him stop funerals before attending funerals.\u201dThe enduring impasse even tripped up the Americans. A White House transcript of Mr. Obama\u2019s eulogy had to be quickly corrected after it initially was sent out with \u201cJerusalem, Israel\u201d as the location of the remarks, in violation of a longstanding United States policy that refuses to recognize any country\u2019s sovereignty over the city until a final peace agreement resolves the issue. A second copy of the president\u2019s remarks listed the location only as \u201cJerusalem.\u201dAs for Mr. Peres, for a man who made a legacy of bridging divides, there was one final act of reconciliation: He was buried between two onetime rivals, Mr. Rabin and another former prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir.Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting from Jerusalem, Majd Al Waheidi from Gaza and Michael D.

{"Headline": "An Attack on Afghanistan\u2019s Future", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs I frantically emailed and called friends and former colleagues I knew from when I worked at the university and scoured social media and news sites for updates, the gravity of what was happening began to take hold: gunmen opening fire on classrooms, students jumping out of windows to escape. The place I knew as a peaceful community of learning and camaraderie, beloved by the Afghans who work, teach and study there, had become a battlefield.Although Afghan National Security Forces were able to safely evacuate hundreds of students and professors, eight students, one professor, three security guards and four Afghan soldiers lost their lives during the siege.Among the dead is my former colleague, one of Afghanistan\u2019s most promising young academics, Naqib Ahmad Khpulwak, an assistant professor of law and a former Fulbright scholar who had been a fellow at Stanford and was about to start his Ph.D. at Oxford. The authorities told his family that he died while trying to help his students escape out a second-story window.Sami Sarwari, a talented musician who performed at the Kennedy Center in 2013, was full of excitement at being a college freshman. He had just checked in on his Facebook page to tell friends that he was on the campus. His last post said: \u201cLooking forward to a beautiful and bright future.\u201dAbdul Wakil, a friendly security guard who had worked at the university for years, also lost his life. Lt. Mohammad Akbar, a commander of the Afghan Special Forces, helped hundreds of students get to safety before he was killed.The university\u2019s buildings may have been shattered, and the grief over the loss of life may feel insurmountable, but the walls will be rebuilt and the doors reopened. And the resilient young Afghan students who have carried on so many times before will do so again. They will fight for their future with their hopes and dreams, their intellect and innovative ideas. Terrorists may have temporarily invaded their place of learning, but they can never take what these students have learned.Since it opened its doors in 2006 as one of Afghanistan\u2019s first private, nonprofit universities \u2014 supported then and now by the United States Agency for International Development \u2014 A.U.A.F.\u2019s high standards of teaching, and its M.B.A. and undergraduate degree programs, have made it a beacon of hope for thousands of young Afghans. It is a way to build a better life for themselves and their families, and for many, the first step in a career path as a future leader.About 75 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s population is under 35. The students who attend A.U.A.F. are part of that generation. They grew up with war; as displaced, stateless people; as orphans; as children who had to support their families from a young age. As a result, they feel passionately that their own children should have a better life than they did. They are modern, culturally astute and technologically savvy, and they are defining what Afghanistan will look like 10 years from now.The university holds special meaning for me and my husband, Hamdullah Mohib, Afghanistan\u2019s ambassador to the United States. We both had the privilege of working for the university, so we know very well how hard the staff and faculty have labored to create a safe environment for students in the middle of conflict, and how hard it is in those challenging conditions to maintain a curriculum that is the equal of better-known universities across the world.In early August, two A.U.A.F. professors, an American and an Australian, were kidnapped while on their way to work by armed men. They have not been heard from since. Every morning, students, staff and faculty wake up and head to campus, knowing there\u2019s the chance they might not come home that evening. But if the attackers\u2019 goal was to scare students and faculty away, they have failed.A poor shopkeeper whose daughter attends A.U.A.F. on a scholarship and was wounded in the attack told The Washington Post that he would send his daughter back to school once the university reopened. \u201cMy country needs educated people because there is so much illiteracy,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry every day when my children leave home, but my daughter is a talented student and she wants to help her country.\u201dThe university is a microcosm of the Afghanistan the next generation wants to live in \u2014 a place where people debate their differences instead of fight over them, where diversity is respected, and tolerance and understanding are freely expressed. These are the values of a healthy, secure society, which Afghanistan is working so hard to become.Advertisement"}

Ms. Paske did not immediately return emails and phone calls seeking comment.Ms. Paske said in her Facebook post that she was sometimes \u201cgrateful\u201d that her son had the condition.\u201cThat may sound like a terrible thing to say, but in some ways I think, I hope, it shields him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to notice when people stare at him when he flaps his hands.

As she spoke, Bo occasionally looked up at her and reached over to touch her arm whenever he saw that she was distressed.Bo said that it was \u201camazing\u201d that Mr. Rudolph had chosen to sit down with him, adding that the player had even signed his lunchbox.Asked how the encounter had made him feel, Bo said, \u201cIt was kind of like me sitting on a rainbow.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHard to BearTo the Editor:For nearly 40 years the majority of reports and books on in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.) have focused on the minority outcome. I.V.F. cycles more often end not with a baby but with failure. The hope that science can outsmart Mother Nature is what keeps people coming back for increasingly invasive, even experimental treatments. The fertility industry continues to grow without regulation or consumer protections. Side effects to medications (many used off label) are glossed over. Statistics are generalized.Against this backdrop it takes great courage for women to share deeply personal stories of the losses and trauma caused by failed I.V.F. For this reason, Julia Leigh\u2019s account of trying to conceive is an especially important contribution. Rather than an educated and thoughtful appraisal, Cusk\u2019s review was dismissive and tone deaf. It managed to offend and invalidate not only Leigh but many of us who have attempted I.V.F.This was a lost opportunity to open up a larger discussion. Your readers deserve better.PAMELA MAHONEY TSIGDINOSLOS GATOS, CALIF.\u2b25To the Editor:Rachel Cusk, in her informative review of \u201cAvalanche\u201d and \u201cThe Art of Waiting,\u201d correctly points out that a woman may become so focused on the desire to have a biological child that it takes over her life. She rightly notes the potential for terrible difficulty. Cusk states, however, that the all-consuming desire to become a mother resembles the \u201cinward obstinacy of personal will.\u201d As a clinical psychologist specializing in working with both infertile women and new mothers, I find Cusk\u2019s characterization insensitive toward women pursuing infertility treatment. She also faults the infertile woman for being unambivalent about the tension between personal autonomy and motherhood; the infertile woman\u2019s lack of ambivalence, however, is \u00adnot a fault, but a side effect of \u00adthe problem she faces.HANNAH HAHNNEW YORK\u2b25To the Editor:The opening eight or so paragraphs of Rachel Cusk\u2019s review are among the finest I have ever read. No matter what interest one may or may not have in the books she is discussing, there is great pleasure to be had in just reading what she has written. Book reviews as literature are underappreciated.JIM LANGETHORNTON, PA.\u2b25Darkening SkiesTo the Editor:But Ronson invites a reader to be skeptical of his own argument as, time after time, he cites Aiken\u2019s evidence of disturbing human thought and behavior in the digital age only to suggest that she calm down and stop being such a moralistic technophobe. And he reveals just how far he\u2019ll stretch to delegitimize Aiken\u2019s alarm when he mentions her reference to a \u201c10-year-old boy showing his school friends a picture of his topless \u2018very young girlfriend.\u2019\u200a\u201d Ronson acknowledges this is \u201ctroubling,\u201d but differs with Aiken about exactly how terrible or indicative of future pathologies it is when, in his words, a \u201cmiddle schooler\u201d shares pictures of \u201chis middle-school girlfriend\u201d with his peers.Setting aside the casual acceptance of the term \u201cgirlfriend\u201d for kids this age (and the possessive \u201chis\u201d), as well as the unspecified actions that would have to precede a boy sharing said picture in the first place \u2014 a \u201cmiddle schooler\u201d is much more likely to be in the early teens than the decidedly more \u00adelementary-school age of 10. So why is Ronson implying that this boy and girl are anything other than children, and why minimize this example of potentially significant and harmful change?The sky is not falling, true, but it may be darkening, even if just a little.

{"Headline": "Oklahoma Orders Shutdown of Wells After Record-Tying Earthquake", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOklahoma officials on Saturday ordered oil and gas operators to shut down three dozen wastewater disposal wells following a 5.6-magnitude earthquake that tied a record as the strongest in state history.The quake, centered near Pawnee, rattled the state just after 8 a.m. Eastern time Saturday, tying a record set in 2011 for the strongest such tremor in Oklahoma history, according to the National Weather Service.Local officials reported moderate to severe damage and at least one nonlife-threatening injury.\u201cWe are finding a lot of rural houses north, northwest of Pawnee that are seeing extensive damage,\u201d Sheriff Mike Waters of Pawnee County said on Saturday.Pawnee County Emergency Management posted photos on Facebook just before noon of a pile of rubble, noting that three buildings had moderate damage, while several others had minor damage.Rocks and bricks fell from some businesses in town, and items fell off grocery store shelves, Sheriff Waters added.Thousands of earthquakes have hit Oklahoma in recent years. Most have been imperceptible, but the number that can be felt \u2014 generally of magnitude 3.0 and higher \u2014 has risen significantly. Only three earthquakes of that size or stronger were recorded in 2009. Last year, the state had 907 such quakes. So far this year, there have been more than 400.Many seismologists say the quakes are caused by high-pressure injection of wastewater from oil and gas wells, both conventional and hydraulically fractured, or fracked. As wastewater under pressure migrates into rock formations, it alters stresses along old faults, allowing them to slip.The Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which oversees oil and gas activity, announced that it had ordered the shutdown of wastewater wells across about 500 square miles in the area hit by the quake. About three dozen wells are affected, and will have to shut down in as little as a week, Ms. Fallin said on Twitter.\u201cWithout studying the specifics of the wastewater injection and oil and gas production in this area, the U.S.G.S. cannot currently conclude whether or not this particular earthquake was caused by industrial-related, human activities,\u201d it said.Oklahoma has thousands of wastewater disposal wells. Since mid-2015, the state has ordered operators of some to reduce the volume of wastewater injected, in the hope of reducing earthquakes.The earthquake on Saturday was the largest in the state since a 5.6-magnitude quake struck near Prague, about 60 miles south of Pawnee, in November 2011. That quake injured two people and damaged more than a dozen homes and a college building.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Salesforce Is Said to Question Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal in Europe", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe competition questions have focused on whether Microsoft\u2019s proposed deal would hinder access by people and companies to the vast collection of data held by LinkedIn. Salesforce.com has also suggested that the deal would give Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals by combining its own software services with the information held by the social network, two of the people said.The comments came in response to a questionnaire sent by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, a step that allows interested third-party companies, including competitors, to comment on prospective takeovers.Salesforce.com\u2019s concerns do not necessarily mean that Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, the region\u2019s tough antitrust chief, will open an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s purchase of LinkedIn, though on Thursday she raised her own questions about how digital data should be treated in future competition cases.Ricardo Cardoso, a European Commission spokesman, declined to comment on Salesforce.com\u2019s response to the competition questionnaire.A Microsoft spokeswoman, Jennifer Crider, declined to comment on the European Commission questionnaire, though she said the company had already received antitrust clearance in the United States and Canada and was working with other global authorities on similar approval. The company has yet to submit its LinkedIn deal to European competition authorities, but it is likely to do so by early November, at the latest.\u201cWe expect to close before the end of this calendar year,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement on Thursday.A Salesforce.com spokeswoman, Chi Hea Cho, said the company had been contacted by the European Commission as part of its review of the proposed deal. The company also made similar efforts in the United States to highlight the potential competition problems with the deal, but it failed to win over American authorities, said another person with knowledge of the matter.Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, was dismissive of the complaints from Mr. Benioff\u2019s company.\u201cWe\u2019re committed to continue working to bring price competition to a C.R.M. market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices today,\u201d said Mr. Smith, using the initials for customer relationship management, the software category in which Salesforce is the leader.While Salesforce.com\u2019s criticism of the acquisition could appear to be just sour grapes after it lost out on buying LinkedIn, its questions about how Microsoft\u2019s control of data would potentially hinder rivals are gaining traction with some European officials.One possibility would be for Microsoft to combine LinkedIn\u2019s information on people\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and messaging activity on the social network with its own Office software, providing the tech giant with an advantage over rivals offering similar services. In previous statements, Microsoft said its own offerings did not overlap with LinkedIn\u2019s and that competing services like Facebook, which also collect large amounts of data, also existed.Similar data-related concerns were raised in Europe when Facebook bought WhatsApp, the messaging app, in 2014 for $19 billion. The region\u2019s authorities have been regularly criticized, particularly by European telecommunications operators, for approving that deal despite complaints that it would limit consumer choice.\u201cThe questions people have been asking are whether data can be duplicated, and can a competitor establish itself in the same way or buy a copy of another\u2019s data,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly, on second reference, to a Microsoft spokeswoman. Jennifer Crider is a woman.Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton\u2019s Victory Without Breakthrough", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was one of her best moments, an understated swipe at Trump\u2019s evident lack of preparation for the responsibilities of the Oval Office, and it got to the heart of their often disjointed exchanges: Clinton was measured and assured, if a little too much of a policy wonk at times, while Trump was as erratic and peevish as he has been since the beginning of his campaign.This has worked for him up to now; it may work still in what has become a close race. A lot of Americans want change; Trump is the political upstart and Clinton the political establishment. Nothing that transpired in the debate will have altered the fact that millions of Americans want rupture not continuity, and they see in Trump the potential for a radical break from politics as usual.But if Trump\u2019s aim was to come across as presidential, in the sense of possessing judgment and some actual knowledge of issues, he failed. He ranted more than he reasoned. He repeated untruths, and he repeated himself over and over. His core supporters won\u2019t care, of course, but the undecided voters who will decide the election might.She was at her worst when she talked about how \u201cindependent experts\u201d favor her economic plans over Trump\u2019s and when, more than once, she urged viewers to go to her website for real-time fact checking of her opponent\u2019s words. People were not watching Clinton to be directed to the efforts of Clinton\u2019s staff. They know the Clinton campaign is competent.\u201cWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,\u201d Clinton said during this sharp discussion of trade, which constituted Trump\u2019s most effective moment. Clinton\u2019s reversal on the free trade that has, on balance, been good for the American economy for decades has left her vulnerable, defending positions of which she herself is unconvinced. Bernie Sanders pushed her left of her comfort zone on trade, and now she is cornered.His case to be president came down to saying it was time that the United States is run by somebody who understands money. But, even if Trump does know his way around money, an uncertain proposition, that is insufficient preparation for leading the free world.Toward the end, Trump questioned Clinton\u2019s stamina. The response was instant: \u201cWell, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u201dIt was a brilliant dismissal of Trump\u2019s nasty innuendo. In a normal campaign, it might drive home why Clinton is far better prepared to be president. But this is not a normal campaign. Clinton won Monday night, by any conventional reckoning. But whether that makes victory for her on Nov. 8 any more likely is unclear.Advertisement"}

Her husband, Stanford, who was born there, felt the same way. By 2001, with the addition of two children, the couple were outgrowing their rent-stabilized apartment in Brooklyn Heights and began looking in Park Slope.Then the terrorist attacks happened on Sept. 11. Ms. Bandelli\u2019s brother, Alan Kleinberg, who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald, died at the World Trade Center. And everything changed.\u201cIn my darkest days of having a newborn, a 2-year-old, and an aging dog, I was sleeping and breathing it, and knew I had to be away from all that,\u201d said Ms. Bandelli, a psychotherapist who is now 49. So she went house hunting in northern New Jersey, where her brother\u2019s family lived.Ms. Bandelli made a beeline for Westfield, where she and her husband had attended a wedding a couple of years earlier and Mr. Bandelli had declared, \u201c \u2018If we moved to New Jersey, this is the only town I\u2019d ever live in,\u2019 \u201d she recalled.By October, they had put in an offer of $355,000 for a three-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath split-level. Eight years later, with a third child, the Bandellis moved to a 1929 four-bedroom colonial, which cost $765,000.Mr. Bandelli, a criminal defense lawyer, \u201cloves the town for the kids,\u201d his wife said.The appeal of Westfield for New York City transplants like the Bandellis is understandable, as this central Union County town offers characteristics typically associated with urban living \u2014 a bustling downtown, a vibrant cultural scene and good transportation options \u2014 along with many benefits of suburban living, like attractive homes, well-regarded schools and a sense of community.\u201cWestfield is big enough that there are a lot of ways to get connected, but small enough to feel like you can really get to know everyone in this town,\u201d said Laura Brockway, 60, a Realtor with Keller Williams who has lived in Westfield for 32 years with her husband, Richard, raising their three sons there.The couple, both 35, visited towns in Westchester County and northern New Jersey, happening on an open house for a 1950s three-bedroom two-bath colonial in Westfield, which they wound up buying for $630,000.\u201cWe love the downtown, we\u2019re within walking distance of the elementary school, and the people are very friendly,\u201d said Ms. Mays.\u201cIt\u2019s been a great social network for me,\u201d said Ms. Javeri, who is now a board member of the Newcomers group. \u201cIt\u2019s given us the ability to connect and meet many different people.\u201dCondominiums on the market in the newer developments range from $329,000 for a two-bedroom unit at Trinity Place to $899,000 for a two-bedroom 2015 townhouse on Prospect Street.Townwide events, like the Downtown Westfield 5K Run and Pizza Extravaganza in July and the Halloween parade, draw thousands of participants from around the region, Ms. Cronin said.The district has 10 schools, including the Lincoln Early Childhood Learning Center, for centralized prekindergarten and kindergarten, six elementary schools for first to fifth graders, two middle schools for Grades 6 to 8, and Westfield High School.The New Jersey Transit bus 113X goes from Westfield to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in around an hour and costs $9.75 one way or $251 a month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Fights Internet Directory\u2019s Transfer; Techies Say He Just Doesn\u2019t Get It", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republican from Texas does not appear to have the ability to inspire another insurgency so close to an election that will determine control of the Senate. He may not have the interest either. His technical theories about the registration of domain names \u2014 the \u201c.net\u201d and \u201c.world\u201d suffixes of internet addresses \u2014 have been discredited by engineers.But his move to block the Obama administration through a short-term spending bill needed to keep the government open past Sept. 30 demonstrates that the former Republican presidential candidate remains eager to keep his name in lights, even at the expense of his colleagues\u2019 efforts to get back to the campaign trail.\u201cI am hopeful and optimistic that leadership will follow through and protect the internet,\u201d Mr. Cruz said on Thursday, when asked if he would prevent the short-term spending measure from moving forward without his internet provision.Mr. Cruz\u2019s hobbyhorse is the administration\u2019s plan at the end of the month to transfer its oversight of domain name registrations to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a multinational private organization based in Los Angeles. Out of the United States\u2019 control, the openness of the internet would be in jeopardy, Mr. Cruz has warned, with Russia, Iran and China positioned to use their influence on Icann to determine what content appears on the web.\u201cImagine an internet run like many Middle Eastern countries, that punish what they deem to be blasphemy,\u201d Mr. Cruz warned in a Senate hearing he led earlier this week. \u201cOr imagine an internet run like China or Russia, that punish and incarcerate those that engage in political dissent.\u201dTechnologists and administration officials say Mr. Cruz simply does not understand how the web operates. The government\u2019s current job of domain name administrator is largely clerical and cannot influence editorial decisions on the web, they say.\u201cIt sounds like a fairy tale to anyone who understands how the internet works,\u201d said Andrew Sullivan, chair of the Internet Architecture Board, a nonprofit group of network engineers and tech firms such as Google and Cisco.The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said the administration is committed to meeting its Sept. 30 deadline.\u201cThe industry technology experts, business community and the largest internet companies \u2014 like Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2014 have described it as imperative that the transition move forward,\u201d he said.The issue involves the deep plumbing of the internet and the system of addresses and domain names that route traffic around the web. It highlights a broader policy struggle among nations over who should govern the internet, which may have been born in the United States but now counts 3.4 billion global users.The administration and tech firms that support the plan say Icann is a neutral body with advisers from around the world that will simply act as the keeper of the internet\u2019s master directory of domain names.\u201cAny delay would add a degree of instability and make the prospect of government control of the internet more likely, not less,\u201d said Kathryn Brown, president of the Internet Society, a nonprofit organization that advocates open internet policies.But Mr. Cruz\u2019s allies point to Icann\u2019s sketchy track record, including its chaotic 2014 expansion of domain names that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues for the group.But his leverage is diminished. While Mr. Cruz can slow passage of the spending bill, he does not have enough followers to kill it. House conservatives, while supportive of his policy goal, are interested in other issues, like halting the Syrian refugee program.\u201cThis internet issue is not on the front burner, no,\u201d said Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cThe Syrian refugee piece resonates more back home.\u201dDemocrats are far more worried about protecting money for Planned Parenthood to help fight the Zika virus, pesticide use and other matters related to Zika.Mr. Cruz does have the backing of influential Republican leaders such as Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. Last week, four House and Senate Republicans sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker asking for the administration to stop its plan.It is a twist for Mr. Cruz, a Republican who has railed against big government, to argue for more government control and less private enterprise.\u201cSince the internet\u2019s inception, the United States government has stood guard over critical internet functions,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.During the hearing on Wednesday, he interrupted and silenced one government witness who disagreed with his logic. He displayed a large poster-board exhibit with quotations from a Washington Post editorial criticizing Icann for malfeasance. Another exhibit showed a former Icann leader who went on to advise the Chinese government.At one point, Mr. Cruz warned Commerce Department employees that they would be breaking the law if they followed orders to hand over domain name administration to the organization.An article on Friday about efforts by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, to block the administration\u2019s plan to end federal oversight of the internet misstated part of the name of a government agency. It is the National Security Agency, not the National Security Administration.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018I\u2019ve Become a Racist\u2019: Migrant Wave Unleashes Danish Tensions Over Identity", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "The thousands of Muslim asylum seekers pouring into Denmark have spawned a backlash, and questions over whether the country has a latent racial hostility at its core.Supported byTAARNBY, Denmark \u2014 Johnny Christensen, a stout and silver-whiskered retired bank employee, always thought of himself as sympathetic to people fleeing war and welcoming to immigrants. But after more than 36,000 mostly Muslim asylum seekers poured into Denmark over the past two years, Mr. Christensen, 65, said, \u201cI\u2019ve become a racist.\u201dHe believes these new migrants are draining Denmark\u2019s cherished social-welfare system but failing to adapt to its customs. \u201cJust kick them out,\u201d he said, unleashing a mighty kick at an imaginary target on a suburban sidewalk. \u201cThese Muslims want to keep their own culture, but we have our own rules here and everyone must follow them.\u201dDenmark, a small and orderly nation with a progressive self-image, is built on a social covenant: In return for some of the world\u2019s highest wages and benefits, people are expected to work hard and pay into the system. Newcomers must quickly learn Danish \u2014 and adapt to norms like keeping tidy gardens and riding bicycles.The country had little experience with immigrants until 1967, when the first \u201cguest workers\u201d were invited from Turkey, Pakistan and what was then Yugoslavia. Its 5.7 million people remain overwhelmingly native born, though the percentage has dropped to 88 today from 97 in 1980.Bo Lidegaard, a prominent historian, said many Danes feel strongly that \u201cwe are a multiethnic society today, and we have to realize it \u2014 but we are not and should never become a multicultural society.\u201dSome of the same hostilities were reflected this weekend in Germany, where voters in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s home state embraced anti-immigrant candidates \u2014 an emphatic rejection of her refugee policy.There is new tension between Danes still opening their arms and a resurgent right wing that seeks to ban all Muslims and shut Denmark off from Europe. Mr. Christensen, the retired banker, supports emerging proposals for his country to follow Britain in exiting the European Union.There is tension, too, over whether the backlash is really about a strain on Denmark\u2019s generous public benefits or a rising terrorist threat \u2014 or whether a longstanding but latent racial hostility is being unearthed.Analysts say that the public voiced little opposition after 5,000 Poles and 3,300 Americans, among other Westerners, emigrated to Denmark in 2014, but that there has been significant criticism of the nearly 16,000 Syrian asylum seekers who arrived that year and the next. They and other migrants were not invited, and many ended up here by accident, intercepted on their route to Sweden.Critics complain that these newcomers have been slow to learn Danish \u2014 though the Immigration Ministry recently reported that 72 percent passed a required language exam. Some Danes bristle at what they see as ethnic enclaves: About 30 percent of new immigrants lived in the nation\u2019s two largest cities, Aarhus and Copenhagen, where Muslim women in abayas and men in prayer caps stand out among the blond and blue-eyed crowds on narrow streets.Perhaps the leading \u2014 and most substantive \u2014 concern is that the migrants are an economic drain. In 2014, 48 percent of immigrants from non-Western countries ages 16 to 64 were employed, compared with 74 percent of native Danes.The Immigration Ministry has sought to avoid what it calls \u201cparallel societies\u201d of migrants living in \u201cvicious circles of bad image, social problems and a high rate of unemployment.\u201d Tightened immigration requirements, the ministry said in its latest annual report, weed out those \u201cwho have weaker capabilities for being able to integrate into Danish society.\u201dOmar Mahmoud, 34, an Iraqi engineer who entered Denmark a year ago and lives in a refugee center in Randers, a city of 60,000, is trying his best to fit in. He and his wife are taking Danish classes, and their three children are learning the language and making Danish friends in school. They are Muslim, but attend church to learn about Christianity, and he said he was not opposed to his son\u2019s eating pork, a staple of the Danish diet, though it is forbidden in Islam.Mr. Mahmoud said his family had not encountered direct insults or threats, but was frightened by the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim tenor in the public discourse.\u201cIt\u2019s like foreigners are put in a special clan, separate from the Danish people,\u201d he lamented. Still, Mr. Mahmoud said that \u201csome of the Danish people are angels\u201d and that he was relieved to be far from the violence of Iraq. \u201cI\u2019m in my heaven now.\u201dAnders Buhl-Christensen, a center-right city councilman in Randers, said the influx had forced a more honest conversation about national identity. \u201cOur problem in Denmark is that we\u2019ve been too polite,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one dared talk about\u201d immigration, he added, \u201cbecause they were afraid they\u2019d be called racist.\u201dSimilar themes are seen as underpinning a wave of new measures here in Denmark.Last year, Denmark placed ads in Arabic-language newspapers stressing its tough new policies, essentially suggesting: Don\u2019t come here.Muslims do not assimilate as easily as Europeans or some Asians, said Denmark\u2019s culture minister, Bertel Haarder, partly because, as he put it, their patriarchal culture frowns on women working outside the home and often constrains freedom of speech.\u201cIt\u2019s not racism to be aware of the difference \u2014 it\u2019s stupid not to be aware,\u201d Mr. Haarder said. \u201cWe do them a blessing by being very clear and outspoken as to what kind of country they have come to, what are our basic values.\u201dBut much of the difference remains unspoken. This is a country where pedestrians wait for a green light to cross even when no cars are in sight, a contrast to the bustling streets of Middle Eastern capitals.Birgitte Romme Larsen, a Danish anthropologist who has studied refugees and asylum seekers in rural areas, mentioned an African refugee who did not realize that closing his curtains during the day was interpreted as being unduly secretive. Other newcomers were not aware that congregating and talking loudly at a grocery might offend Danish sensibilities.\u201cThese implicit expectations cannot be written into an integration folder\u201d migrants receive, Ms. Larsen said.Sherif Sulaiman, an organic food scientist who moved to Denmark eight years ago from Egypt, said Muslims must not close themselves off in enclaves but open themselves up for interaction.He is the manager of an Islamic center that opened in 2014 and invites Danes in for meals and for an annual \u201charmony week.\u201d Mr. Sulaiman pushed to have the mosque complex use Scandinavian architectural style and furniture, and lends its conference room to a church for meetings.\u201cWe should be like this glass \u2014 transparent,\u201d he said, pointing to a window. \u201cAs long as we follow the rules of the country, we are part of Danish society.\u201dBut some dark-skinned immigrants who have lived in Denmark for decades say assimilation seems an elusive and ever-shifting target.Patricia Bandak and her brother Sylvester Bbaale came to Denmark from Uganda as babies in 1989. Like their native neighbors, they are polite and punctual and ride their bicycles everywhere.The siblings are not Muslim but said they frequently encountered racism: In school, they were called the N word, and told that they should stop eating Ugandan food like matoke, a starchy fruit. Mr. Bbaale, 27, who operates a food truck, said he was beaten on the street last year by three men who cursed at him and told him to go back to Africa.\u201cFor a lot of people, being Danish is in your blood, so I will never be Danish,\u201d said Ms. Bandak, 28, who became a Danish citizen in 2010 and is studying documentary film. \u201cI call myself a Dane of a different color.\u201dThen there is Ozlem Cekic, a Turkish-born Muslim who served as a leftist member of Parliament from 2007 to 2015. Her three children were born in Denmark, she wrote a 2009 memoir in Danish, and, she said, \u201cI even dream in Danish.\u201dYet Mrs. Cekic, 40, said she often received death threats and heard shouts of \u201cGo home!\u201d on the street. Every time terrorists strike Europe, she is bombarded by hundreds of hate messages. Lately, people have inundated her with accusations that Muslims are milking the welfare system and plotting against Danes.While in Parliament, Mrs. Cekic held \u201cdialogue coffees,\u201d at which she would explain \u2014 in fluent Danish \u2014 why she is as Danish as anyone.Karin Andersen is one of thousands of Danes trying to help the immigrants settle through groups formed on Facebook called Venligboerne, or Kind Citizens. She spends several days each month with Housam Mohammed Shamden, 38, his wife and two daughters, who fled Syria in 2014 and now live in Randers, with small Danish flags taped to the front door of their apartment and tucked into flower vases.\u201cDanes are so concerned about losing their culture,\u201d said Ms. Andersen, 62, a retired teacher. \u201cBut how many help the ones who want to be part of it?\u201d\u201cFreedom of speech is now interpreted as freedom to say anything hateful,\u201d said Julie Jeeg, a law student who volunteers with an antiracism group. \u201cDenmark is closing in on itself. People are retreating inward.\u201dIn January, after revelations that a Randers day care center had stopped serving pork meatballs since its Muslim students would not eat them, the Town Council narrowly passed a measure requiring that pork be served \u201con equal terms with other kinds of food.\u201dThe councilman who pushed the measure, Frank Noergaard of the Danish People\u2019s Party, said he was incensed that \u201cpork could be abandoned in Denmark,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you give in on pork, what\u2019s next?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hate Crimes Against American Muslims Most Since Post-9/11 Era", "Date": "2016-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hate crimes against American Muslims have soared to their highest levels since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to data compiled by researchers, an increase apparently fueled by terrorist attacks in the United States and abroad and by divisive language on the campaign trail.The trend has alarmed hate crime scholars and law-enforcement officials, who have documented hundreds of attacks \u2014 including arsons at mosques, assaults, shootings and threats of violence \u2014 since the beginning of 2015.Police and news media reports in recent months have indicated a continued flow of attacks, often against victims wearing traditional Muslim garb or seen as Middle Eastern.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these stereotypes and derogative statements become part of the political discourse,\u201d said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the San Bernardino campus. \u201cThe bottom line is we\u2019re talking about a significant increase in these types of hate crimes.\u201dHe said that the frequency of anti-Muslim violence appeared to have increased immediately after some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most incendiary comments.The latest major episode of anti-Muslim violence came last weekend, when an arsonist on a motorcycle started a fire that engulfed the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, Fla., where Omar Mateen \u2014 the gunman in the June massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando \u2014 had sometimes prayed.The arson, along with an earlier assault on a congregant outside the mosque and other episodes there, has left worshipers scared, said Mohammed Malik, 43, a businessman who has attended the mosque for nearly a decade.\u201cThere is a lot of negative rhetoric,\u201d he said. \u201cThe negative rhetoric is causing the hate, and in turn the hate is causing the violent acts.\u201dThe new study from Mr. Levin\u2019s nonpartisan group, based on official police reports in 20 states, estimated that there were about 260 hate crimes against Muslims nationwide in 2015.That was the most since the record 481 documented hate crimes against Muslims in 2001, when the Sept. 11 attacks set off waves of crimes targeting Muslims and Middle Easterners, Mr. Levin said. The huge increase last year was also the biggest annual rise since 2001, he said.The rise came even as hate crimes against almost all other groups \u2014 including blacks, Hispanics, Jews, gays and whites \u2014 either declined or increased only slightly, his study found. One exception was hate crimes against transgender people, which rose about 40 percent.A 20-state study by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, California State University, San Bernardino.An advance copy of the study was provided to The New York Times.The statistics almost certainly understate the extent of the problem, researchers say, because victims are often reluctant to report attacks for fear of inflaming community tensions, and because it is sometimes difficult for investigators to establish that religious, ethnic or racial hatred was a cause.In the killing last year of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, N.C., for instance, the authorities did not bring hate crime charges against a neighbor who is charged with murdering them, despite calls from Muslims who said there were religious overtones to the violence. The police said that a parking dispute, not bigotry, may have led to the killings.Sometimes, the evidence is more clear-cut.\u201cI hate ISLAM!\u201d a former Marine named Ted Hakey Jr. wrote to a friend on Facebook after last November\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris. Hours later, in a drunken rampage, he fired a high-powered rifle four times into the mosque next door to his Connecticut home.Last month, an apologetic Mr. Hakey began a six-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to a hate crime charge.In Brooklyn, two women out walking their children in strollers were attacked this month, the police said, by a woman who screamed anti-Muslim obscenities and tried to rip off their traditional veils. And in Queens, a man was beaten in April by three strangers who shouted \u201cISIS, ISIS.\u201dIn Minneapolis, a man shouting obscenities about Islam shot two Muslim men in traditional religious garb in June, the authorities said.In St. Louis, a man was arrested in February after the police said he pointed a gun at a Muslim family shopping on his block and told them they \u201call should die.\u201dThe increase in reports of apparent hate crimes has worried Justice Department officials.\u201cWe saw it after 9/11, and we continue to see an uptick in allegations of hate-related incidents today following the tragic events over the past year,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, who leads the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division.\u201cWe see criminal threats against mosques; harassment in schools; and reports of violence targeting Muslim-Americans, Sikhs, people of Arab or South-Asian descent and people perceived to be members of these groups,\u201d Ms. Gupta said.A number of experts in hate crimes said they were concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s vitriol may have legitimized threatening or even violent conduct by a small fringe of his supporters.In a few cases, people accused of hate crimes against Muslims and others have even cited Mr. Trump.The police here in Washington released a videotape in May of a woman who reportedly poured liquid on a Muslim woman after berating Islam and declaring that she was going to vote for Mr. Trump so that he could \u201csend you all back where you came from.\u201dOn Thursday, Hillary Clinton charged that Mr. Trump had \u201cincited violence\u201d in a campaign marked by \u201cbigotry\u201d and \u201chatred.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s supporters say that he has never endorsed violence against any minorities, and some conservatives have challenged data showing an increase in violence against American Muslims as a creation of liberal-leaning researchers.Mr. Trump has said he is not responsible for any violence by his supporters.\u201cThey\u2019re not angry about something I\u2019m saying,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in March. \u201cI\u2019m just a messenger. The people are angry about the fact that, for 12 years, the workers in this country haven\u2019t had a pay increase.\u201dJames Nolan, a former F.B.I. crime analyst who teaches about hate crimes at West Virginia University, said that the data seemed to show \u201ca real spike\u201d in hate crimes against American Muslims, caused in part by candidates\u2019 \u201craising the specter that radical Islam is at our doorstep.\u201dMark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups and extremism, went further.\u201cI don\u2019t have the slightest doubt that Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric has played a big part\u201d in the rising attacks, he said.Adam Goldman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Having Won Re-election, a Black Mayor Is Out to Win Every Voter\u2019s Heart", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPhenix City JournalPHENIX CITY, Ala. \u2014 Eddie Lowe, this city\u2019s first-ever black mayor, could feel the white anxiety here.It was early September in Phenix City, a small east Alabama borough where the percentage of African-Americans has risen over the decades, to the point that they are nearly on a par with whites. Voters had just re-elected Mr. Lowe to a second four-year term \u2014 and, for the first time, elected a 3-to-2 black majority to the City Council.This new reality, Mr. Lowe\u2019s predecessor told a local paper, had created a \u201cgreat division\u201d between blacks and whites in the city of 37,500, and was stoking fears among white residents that minorities would be favored in future board appointments.A few white residents had begun posting racist reactions on social media: On Aug. 28, five days after the election, one man wrote on Facebook that it \u201cmay be time to throw in the towel and admit \u2018the brothas rule.\u2019\u201d A young black activist, meanwhile, had been publicly provoking them by declaring that Phenix City was now \u201cChocolate City.\u201dThe crisis seemed emblematic of this fragile American moment, in which white voters\u2019 fear of diminished political clout has helped fuel the rise of Donald J. Trump. But there was also something distinctly American about the response from Mr. Lowe, a twice-weekly attendee of the Greater Mount Zion Baptist Church and former defensive captain of the University of Alabama football team. On Sept. 8, he held a news conference that turned out to be more of a sermon, mixed with an impassioned locker-room speech.Mr. Lowe is 56 and maintains a linebacker\u2019s form, with dump-truck shoulders and the kind of large, blocky hands one finds on workers in social realist murals. His father was a sharecropper and brick mason. Mr. Lowe, as a child, played football in an empty lot on the poor, black south side of Phenix City, sometimes with an empty bean can in place of a ball. At Alabama, he earned a degree in finance. Today, he is a senior vice president at a bank.Every day, Mr. Lowe teaches himself a new word from the dictionary and reads a chapter of Proverbs. He revels in the occasional dip into cornpone Southern slang. His management theory: Don\u2019t be a caitiff (\u201cYou can look that up,\u201d he said) but rather, a \u201csho nuff leader.\u201d By which he means: Don\u2019t make it about you. Take your knocks if you must. Love people. Lead by example.\u201cYou have to be consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to show and be that person, and be willing to take the bumps and bruises.\u201dMr. Lowe, a part-time mayor, is zealous to an almost Trumpian degree in his promotion of Phenix City. It is a former cotton-mill town somewhat lacking in charm that now serves as a bedroom community to Columbus, Ga., and the Fort Benning military base across the Chattahoochee River. He knows that the city is still half white, and that he will need white support for his visions, like his plan to create a downtown park that will honor Alabama\u2019s fallen military heroes.On race, Mr. Lowe calls himself \u201ckind of a Pollyanna, utopia guy.\u201d He credits football \u2014 even though the football life was not always utopian. His college career began in 1978 at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where during his freshman year most of the black players quit in a protest over the lack of African-Americans on the coaching staff. Mr. Lowe said that he and one other black player refused to quit. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t raise me that way,\u201d he said. The criticism, he recalled, rained down from all sides. \u201cIt got so bad you couldn\u2019t even go to class,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even get a hamburger.\u201dHe transferred to Alabama, and played under the famed coach Paul (Bear) Bryant. Then he was off to the Canadian Football League, where he spent nine years with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. \u201cYou play with guys from all over the world, all over the country,\u201d he said. \u201cDifferent cultures, different beliefs, different backgrounds, just totally different.\u201d If \u201ca bunch of dumb jocks\u201d could unite and seek a common goal, he added, why can\u2019t everyone?He helped establish the White Water Classic, a yearly football game between two historically black colleges, Albany State and Tuskegee Universities. And he worked on improving Phenix City\u2019s reputation, still damaged from midcentury, when it was a thriving hub of gambling, prostitution and crime that catered to \u2014 and preyed upon \u2014 the soldiers from Fort Benning.Changes in the old racial dynamic had been brewing since 2008, when a white barber and longtime liberal on race issues, James Wetzel, was elected to the City Council and soon formed a coalition with the Council\u2019s two black members. They hired the first black city manager, Wallace B. Hunter, and began spreading public investments around town after years in which, Mr. Wetzel said, funding had seemed concentrated on the wealthy and largely white north side.Mr. Wetzel said that some north-side whites used racist language to paint him as a race traitor. But not all of them.\u201cI think Phenix City is typical of small Southern cities that are going through the transition,\u201d said Mr. Wetzel, who was defeated for re-election in 2012. \u201cThe old, hard racial sentiment of the older people, that\u2019s dying out. The white people, age 50 on down, they really don\u2019t have those sentiments, unless they\u2019re really hard-core uneducated rednecks.\u201dRacial tensions continued through Mr. Lowe\u2019s first term, however. In May 2014, his brother, Woodrow Lowe, a former linebacker with the San Diego Chargers, was fired from his head coaching job at the main public high school, after a 33-13 record in four seasons. (In his last season as coach, the team went 6-4.) Around that time, the City Council, in a 3-to-2 vote that split on racial lines, also fired Mr. Hunter. But the Council rehired Mr. Hunter two weeks later after hundreds of black residents rallied, raising questions about the treatment of both men.Today, the mayor declines to speak about the episodes and the role race might have played. He does not see what good it will do.He won the Aug. 23 election with 59 percent of the vote, proving that there are many whites here who are comfortable with black leadership. But the lingering grievances are real. Some residents, on social media, have criticized the White Water Classic and the celebrations around it because they catered to blacks. \u201cDid anyone win the CHOCOLATE CITY CLASSIC?\u201d one man wrote on Facebook on Sept. 10, the night of the game.Others questioned Mr. Lowe\u2019s assertion that the game was an economic boon for Phenix City. Mr. Lowe, in rebuttal, points to an in-house study that shows that the net gain for the city in the White Water Classic\u2019s first two years was nearly $600,000.Two days after the game, Mr. Lowe stopped by a TV station in Columbus for an on-camera interview, where he discussed, somewhat vaguely, the reasons he called the news conference. Afterward, the anchor, Mercer Van Schoor, asked, as if seeking reassurance: \u201cYou don\u2019t like \u2018Chocolate City\u2019?\u201d\u201cWell, listen, no,\u201d Mr. Lowe said. \u201cWe are one Phenix City, as I\u2019ve been saying. Positively one Phenix City.\u201dDriving around town in his tiny sedan, Mr. Lowe showed off the empty lots where he wants to put his military park. He vowed never to replace a white good-old-boy system with a black one. Running the city competently and fairly, he said, would demonstrate his character. He is optimistic enough to believe that this might even change the hearts of Phenix City\u2019s staunchest racists.He smiled.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that gorilla out-love us,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Phone Makers Could Cut Off Drivers. So Why Don\u2019t They?", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe court filings paint a grisly picture: As Ashley Kubiak sped down a Texas highway in her Dodge Ram truck, she checked her iPhone for messages. Distracted, she crashed into a sport utility vehicle, killing its driver and a passenger and leaving a child paralyzed.With driving fatalities rising at levels not seen in 50 years, the growing incidence of distracted driving is getting part of the blame. Now a lawsuit related to that 2013 Texas crash is raising a question: Does Apple \u2014 or any cellphone maker or wireless company \u2014 have a responsibility to prevent devices from being used by drivers in illegal and dangerous ways?The product liability lawsuit, filed against Apple by families of the victims, contends that Apple knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Ms. Kubiak from texting dangerously. The suit is unlikely to succeed, legal experts said, and a Texas magistrate in August preliminarily recommended the case\u2019s dismissal on grounds that it was unlikely that lawyers could prove that the use of the iPhone caused the fatal accident.Ms. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. Her lawyer, Jason Cassel, said she now keeps her phone in the back seat.\u201cThe mere fact she\u2019s putting her phone in her back seat in her purse shows she realizes how tempting it is to look down when we get a beep, chime, vibration,\u201d Mr. Cassel said. \u201cShe never wants to be near the possibility\u201d of being tempted to answer it.The product liability case has brought to light a piece of evidence that legal and safety experts say puts Apple in a quandary \u2014 one it shares with other wireless companies. In Apple\u2019s case, the evidence shows, the company has a patent for technology designed to prevent texting while driving, but it has not deployed it.Apple, Verizon, AT&T and other companies caution about the risks of distracted driving \u2014 and they acknowledge that laws and public education aimed at curbing the behavior are not working. It suggests to legal experts that they can foresee that their product can be used for illegal, dangerous and sometimes deadly activity.AT&T even suggests that the behavior has addictive qualities, meaning drivers cannot help themselves. But the companies \u2014 though they offer manual ways to shut down texting on the road \u2014 do not deploy technology that takes the decision out of drivers\u2019 hands altogether.\u201cThe technology exists \u2014 we just don\u2019t have the stomach to implement it,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. In 2012, the safety board sent a letter to the wireless industry association urging the companies to prevent drivers from using their phones while driving.\u201cTechnology got us into this situation. Technology will get us out,\u201d she said. However, she added, \u201cWe\u2019re so afraid to tell people what they should do that you can kind of get away with murder under these conditions.\u201dGenerally, companies have taken the position that text-blocking technology is embryonic and unreliable. They argue that they cannot shut down a driver\u2019s service without the potential of mistakenly shutting off a passenger\u2019s phone or that of someone riding on a train or bus.Instead, companies have taken the approach of simultaneously warning and enabling, a mixed message that underscores a complex swirl of economic, technological and social factors. Perhaps the most pointed question is this: Even if the technology worked to perfection, would people accept having their service blocked? After all, the idea of mobile phone service is to let people communicate on the go.David Teater, formerly of the National Safety Council and now a private consultant on road safety, who lost his own son to a distracted driver, said companies clearly feared the consequences of cutting off service for their paying customers. It\u2019s an industry, he said, in which one of the most frightening words is \u201cchurn\u201d \u2014 meaning the loss of a customer to a competitor.\u201cIf you\u2019re at Apple or you\u2019re at Samsung, do you want to be the first to block texting and driving?\u201d he said. \u201cA customer might say, \u2018If Apple does it, then my next phone is a Samsung.\u2019\u201dBut to Mr. Teater, that\u2019s just an excuse. \u201cIf Apple had deployed this technology 10 years ago, there would be more people alive today,\u201d he said. \u201cThink about it from a parent\u2019s perspective: How would you feel knowing Apple had the ability to prevent your teen from ever texting and driving, and they chose not to?\u201dIn the Apple case in Texas, lawyers who brought the suit had unearthed a fascinating document: a patent filing that Apple made in 2008, which the lawyers said was granted in 2014, for technology that would \u201clock out\u201d a driver\u2019s phone by using sensors to determine if the phone was moving and in use by a driver. If so, it would prevent certain functions, like texting.In the patent, Apple says such technology is necessary because: \u201cTexting while driving has become so widespread that it is doubtful that law enforcement will have any significant effect on stopping the practice,\u201d and \u201cTeens understand that texting while driving is dangerous, but this is often not enough motivation to end the practice.\u201dIt is unclear whether Apple has developed the lockout technology.While texting is on the rise, people are increasingly driving and using Snapchat and Instagram, or taking selfies, or playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. The phone is at the center of all the activity.Apple says it has taken other steps to address distracted driving. Its CarPlay integrates with some cars so drivers can use voice commands to control some functions of the car and the phone, including letting them orally compose text messages and listen to incoming ones. The technology, Apple says, \u201callows you to stay focused on the road.\u201d\u201cWe discourage anyone from allowing their iPhone to distract them by typing, reading or interacting with the display while driving,\u201d Apple said in response to questions. The company did not directly address whether it could or should shut down phone functions. Rather, it indicated that the responsibility was with the driver.\u201cFor those customers who do not wish to turn off their iPhones or switch into Airplane Mode while driving to avoid distractions, we recommend the easy-to-use Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode features,\u201d the statement said.These approaches put the onus on drivers to make decisions each time they enter a car or receive a message. In addition, voice-activated systems raise other concerns, said David Strayer, an expert on driver attention at the University of Utah, who said he had studied CarPlay and the feature allowed drivers to perform some functions that could take their attention off the road.\u201cIt does not eliminate driver distraction \u2014 not even close,\u201d Dr. Strayer said.Technology is already on the market that can block a driver from having to make a decision. One company, Cellcontrol, sells a device that mounts on the dash and that uses high-frequency sound waves to identify a phone\u2019s location. If the phone\u2019s user is in the driver\u2019s seat, the device can lock out prohibited services.The $129 device, which looks like a small turtle shell, \u201cis very accurate,\u201d said Cellcontrol\u2019s chief technology officer, Joe Breaux. The hiccup is that the technology can sometimes turn off the phone of a passenger sitting behind the driver.Apple, in its patent, said it was developing \u201ca process in which hand-held computing devices can provide a lockout mechanism without requiring any modifications or additions to the vehicle.\u201d It would use motion and scenery sensors to determine if the phone was moving, and its location.By not putting the technology in place, Apple has \u201cfailed in their social responsibility,\u201d said Christopher Kutz, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, who specializes in the moral and legal principles of liability. \u201cThey should\u2019ve done it, and even done it at a market risk.\u201dHe likened the situation to that of gunmakers who could stop selling high-capacity magazines but choose not to.At the same time, Mr. Kutz said, there was little precedent for companies to shut off communications services for safety reasons. In other industries, he said, companies have taken such precautions \u2014 for instance, some manufacturers have technology that will shut down a machine if a worker does not keep two hands on it.In the case of distracted driving, Apple is not the only tech giant recognizing the dangerous behavior and not preventing it. Verizon, like Apple, suggests that current laws are insufficient. \u201cWhile text messaging is banned for drivers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, many people continue to do it, despite knowing the dangers,\u201d Verizon says on a site that promotes free apps and other services available for iPhone and Android that can detect if a phone is being used by a driver and prevent texting.The Verizon messaging app has a driving mode that, when in use, detects if someone is connected to a car\u2019s Bluetooth system and delivers an automatic response to the sender that the recipient is driving, said Kelly Crummey, a Verizon spokeswoman. However, the message still arrives on the recipient\u2019s phone, allowing the opportunity to check it, Ms. Crummey said.That technology suggests it is possible to identify a driver and apply the technology more broadly \u2014 to, say, social media \u2014 but Ms. Crummey said Verizon didn\u2019t have the same kind of control over Facebook, Twitter or other functions. Further, she said, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to turn off all phone functions, like maps or navigation, that drivers rely on.AT&T encourages the use of a free app, Drivemode, that can stop incoming texts. \u201cEveryone knows texting and driving is dangerous, yet when a text message comes in, it\u2019s difficult not to respond,\u201d AT&T says in promoting the app.Of course, services like these must be activated by the user and can be bypassed. And AT&T may have identified the reason such solutions don\u2019t work: People find themselves so drawn to their devices that elements of addiction are at play.In fact, AT&T commissioned research by an addiction expert who, in an AT&T news release in 2014, said that using a phone sets off releases of a neurochemical called dopamine that makes it hard to resist the ping. \u201cIf that desire for a dopamine fix leads us to check our phones while we\u2019re driving, a simple text can turn deadly,\u201d David Greenfield, who founded the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction, said in the AT&T news release.But if the behavior has addictive qualities, can drivers really be expected to police themselves? And should automated blocking be the answer?\u201cDistracted driving is never O.K.,\u201d AT&T said, adding that it had promoted \u201cIt Can Wait,\u201d a public service campaign to discourage texting and driving.CTIA \u2014 the Wireless Association, in its response to questions, said, \u201cLaws, consumer education and technology are pivotal, and we\u2019ve seen this three-prong approach work to stop people from this dangerous practice.\u201dIt hasn\u2019t worked well enough, some say.Apple, as one of the great cultural influencers, might have the power to change the conversation \u2014 to make it fashionable to choose safety over the rush of an incoming text, Mr. Kutz said.\u201cThey\u2019ve made themselves a norm maker,\u201d he said. \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putin, Admired by Donald Trump, Emphasizes Strength as Virtue", "Date": "2016-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Tiger shooter, bare-chested horseman and architect of Russia\u2019s revival as a muscular global power, President Vladimir V. Putin, dressed in a somber suit and tie, sat for over an hour this past week sipping tea from a delicate porcelain cup and offering earnest advice on how to improve housing, medical care and other services in a provincial town south of here.State television broadcast the entire encounter, in between reports of Russian airstrikes in Syria ordered by Mr. Putin and gleeful accounts of how, thanks to a stunt by a pro-Putin athlete, the Russian flag appeared during the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro despite a ban on the Russian squad because of a doping scandal.It was, in the span of just a few hours, a dizzying display of the political mastery that Mr. Putin has over his country and his own image \u2014 a tough, can-do warrior; caring father of his people; and guarantor that no slight to Russia\u2019s pride will go unanswered.Mr. Putin, 63, has shown an extraordinary ability to project an image of towering strength no matter what the circumstances. When he first took power, an old schoolteacher of his in St. Petersburg, Vera Malishkina, remembered her former pupil, who is below average height, as a superb basketball player because he was \u201cvery tall.\u201dAccording to Mr. Trump, the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee, \u201cHe has been a leader far more than our leader.\u201dThe beauty of that is largely in the eye of the beholder, and is certainly lost on Mr. Putin\u2019s Russian opponents.\u201cVladimir Putin is a strong leader in the same way that arsenic is a strong drink,\u201d Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion and a fierce critic of the Russian president, said in a Facebook post. \u201cPraising a brutal K.G.B. dictator, especially as preferable to a democratically elected U.S. president, whether you like Obama or hate him, is despicable and dangerous.\u201dBut what, aside from his undeniable skill at rallying the support of the Russian public, has made Mr. Putin such a potent figure, giving him a growing band of admirers like Mr. Trump and any number of right-wing populist leaders scattered across Europe?Judged by many of the yardsticks of success he set before his first presidential race in March 2000, however, Mr. Putin has often faltered.He has cut down to size or driven into exile some of the so-called oligarchs who made billions in murky deals under President Boris N. Yeltsin in the 1990s. But far from eliminating \u201coligarchs as a class\u201d as he promised, he has created a new class of business moguls who still enjoy sweet insider deals and whose only real difference with those who thrived under Mr. Yeltsin is that they do not dare challenge the Kremlin.Mr. Putin\u2019s economic record has also been mixed to poor. The economy grew rapidly during his first two terms as president, from 2000 to 2008 \u2014 about 8 percent annually, on average, thanks largely to soaring prices for energy, of which Russia is a major exporter. But it developed none of the diversity beyond oil and gas or freedom from corruption that Mr. Putin repeatedly promised.And with oil prices now below $50 a barrel, half what they were in 2014 and far off their peak of $145 in 2008, the economy is in the doldrums. It perked up slightly in June but has declined over all by nearly 1 percent since the start of the year. That is better than the decline of 3.7 percent last year but still a threat to what had been Mr. Putin\u2019s contract with his people: rising prosperity in return for obedience.With the economy on the ropes, the Kremlin has turned increasingly to foreign affairs to keep Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity at levels that would delight any Western leader. His ratings soared after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which unleashed a wave of patriotic fervor across Russia \u2014 and caused more economic pain as the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions.The military interventions in Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad have been accompanied by a drumbeat of reports on state television celebrating Russia\u2019s role as a key power without which no military or political knot can be untied. This has reinforced his status at home, but also a deep wariness of his intentions among mainstream political leaders abroad.He has inserted Russia not only into Syria but also into the even more intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Russian diplomats working frantically to organize a meeting in Moscow between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas.Mr. Putin, he said, was \u201cincensed\u201d in 2014 when President Obama dismissed Russia as a \u201cregional power.\u201d Eager to show that Mr. Obama underestimated Russia\u2019s reach, Mr. Putin has since embarked on a whirlwind of diplomatic activity across the Middle East and in Asia, asserting Moscow\u2019s role far beyond the narrow confines of the former Soviet Union.\u201cYou can criticize Russia for anything, but if you belittle Russia, that is a crime,\u201d Mr. Trenin said.That Russia is now a power to be reckoned with is a message drummed home relentlessly on television. Under President Yeltsin, television had a wide array of state and private channels offering a cacophony of views, but now it is largely state-controlled and entirely on message with the Kremlin.\u201cWe interpret freedom of expression in different ways,\u201d Mr. Putin told three Russian journalists who were writing a book to burnish his image before the 2000 presidential election, when he was a little-known former K.G.B. officer.One of those journalists, Nataliya Gevorkyan, has since been beaten up twice by unidentified assailants in Moscow, and her old and once freewheeling newspaper, Kommersant, was taken over by a pro-Kremlin businessman. Effectively barred from publishing in Russia, she lives mostly in France.While never a fan of Mr. Putin \u2014 \u201cI was sure a guy who served in the K.G.B. should never be president\u201d \u2014 Ms. Gevorkyan granted the Russian president one indisputable asset, one that appalls Moscow intellectuals but enthralls admirers like Mr. Trump: \u201cPeople elected him.\u201d\u201cHe is popular. Maybe not 86 percent, but definitely more than 50 percent,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat is democracy. I really don\u2019t know about democracy anymore.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s ratings are certainly far higher than those of Mr. Obama, and Mr. Putin should easily win the next presidential election in 2018 if he runs. But the authorities are taking no chances. In the latest strike in a sustained campaign to shut down or at least tame alternative sources of information, Russia\u2019s Justice Ministry recently announced that it would place the Levada Center, an independent and highly respected national pollster, on its official register of organizations \u201coperating as foreign agents,\u201d a listing that the center said would cripple its work.The decision to brand the country\u2019s most reliable polling organization as an alien force followed the release of an opinion survey that showed declining support for Mr. Putin\u2019s United Russia Party ahead of elections for Parliament on Sept. 18.Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity, said Peter Kreko of the Political Capital Institute, a research group in Budapest, has made him a seductive figure for Western politicians and electors, who often pine for decisive action and a more secure world, free from the uncertainties created by immigration, insecurity and economic globalization.\u201cAll Western politicians that define themselves as out of the mainstream tend to have positive views of Russia and Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey regard the Putin regime as hyper-efficient, contrary to the hesitant democratic and sometimes incompetent and paralyzed systems in their own countries.\u201dThis efficiency, Mr. Kreko added, is mostly a myth but is widely believed. \u201cWe used to think that because of pluralist media, checks and balances, and globalization that people could not be brainwashed,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what we see in Russia and also Hungary is that people can be brainwashed.\u201dSophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.videovideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In English Lake District, Tradition and Conservation Clash", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThrelkeld JournalTHRELKELD, England \u2014 It was to have been a grand gesture, a deal that would transfer a mountain in the fabled English Lake District from the landed gentry to those who roam its heights, reversing a centuries-old pattern of ownership by the upper-crust few.The campaign to buy the mountain fell apart at a time of broader questions about what the Lake District is for, setting old ways against newer challenges. Much of the debate revolves around land.\u201cThis is the heart of hill-shepherding country,\u201d said Peter Edmondson, 61, gesturing to the craggy, bracken-clad mountains that rise steeply above his whitewashed 17th-century home at Seathwaite Farm. \u201cIf they want to rewild the Lake District, what about me and my family?\u201dThere is no formal link between events on Blencathra and in Borrowdale Valley, but both illuminate the competing visions of how the Lake District\u2019s sylvan valleys and rugged uplands should be run and owned, and for whose benefit.The issue started gaining attention in 2014 with the effort to sell Blencathra, also known as Saddleback.The mountain, along with the ceremonial title of Lord of the Manor of Threlkeld, was priced at \u00a31.75 million, or about $3 million according to exchange rates at the time. Its owner, Hugh Clayton Lowther, the eighth Earl of Lonsdale, whose family has owned it for generations, wanted to raise cash to pay inheritance taxes of \u00a39 million on his father\u2019s estate.In the end, the mystery bidder never materialized. The earl sold off other assets, including a painting by the artist J. M. W. Turner, to pay the estate taxes. In June, he said the mountain was no longer for sale, but the Friends of Blencathra said they still wanted to buy it.After an ultimatum to the Friends by the seller\u2019s agent to come up with a more substantial offer by Sept. 5, the group said its trustees \u201cnow see no prospects of a successful purchase.\u201d That left the question of what to do with the \u00a3250,000.Some donors have taken to social media to say the secretive behavior of the Friends of Blencathra creates suspicions that the donations may not be returned, even though the trustees have promised a \u201cpublic consultation\u201d on the charity\u2019s future.Coincidentally, the Charity Commission has said it is also scrutinizing the National Trust\u2019s purchase in August of 303 acres of sheep-farming land, along with 413 sheep, at Thorneythwaite Farm, next to Seathwaite Farm.The purchase added fuel to a passionate debate between farmers and environmentalists who argue that sheep have overgrazed the hills. Parts of the region, the environmentalists say, should be rewilded to nurture a more complex habitat in the name of biodiversity.That has raised concerns that a landscape immortalized by William Wordsworth and other Romantic poets in the early 19th century will change forever. \u201cThis is a way of life,\u201d Mr. Edmondson said in an interview. Sheep farming itself, he said, is \u201cwhy the hills are so beautiful.\u201dBeyond the ecological debate, Mr. Edmondson\u2019s allies took issue with the tactics used by the National Trust, which is financed by subscriptions from about four million members and owns 630,000 acres across England.With its deep pockets, the trust easily outbid Mr. Edmondson at the auction in August, paying \u00a3950,000 \u2014 \u00a3200,000 above the guide price \u2014 for the land at Thorneythwaite. The sale became contentious because the land was sold separately from the lot that includes the farmhouse and outbuildings, prompting apprehension that its days as an active hill-farm were over.The Trust already owns 90 farms in the Lake District with a total stock of 21,000 of the Lake District\u2019s 50,000 Herdwicks, the dominant breed of hardy sheep that thrive on the remote uplands. Mr. Edmondson himself is a tenant farmer on National Trust land that, he said, offers grazing to his 850 breeding ewes and 1,002 sheep owned by the Trust itself.Part of the rationale for rewilding relates to climate change. The Lake District is widely known as England\u2019s wettest place. But as storms have grown in intensity, some environmentalists argue that the revival of trees and shrubs on land grazed bald by sheep, or colonized by bracken, would prevent the runoff of ever more apocalyptic floodwaters.In December, a storm caused so much damage that part of the Lake District\u2019s main north-south thoroughfare was washed away, in effect cutting the region in two for five months.The floods were only one among recent calamities since a crippling outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. Cumbria, the county that overlaps the Lake District, was hit particularly hard, and hundreds of thousands of sheep were incinerated.\u201cThe look and the feel of the Lake District could be changed utterly for generations to come,\u201d Tim Collins, a local legislator, said at the time. His fears were not borne out, but to a longtime visitor, the region seems caught more than ever between a rose-glow of nostalgia and 21st-century pressures.\u201cI can still remember my grandfather\u2019s day when their life was pretty simple,\u201d Mr. Edmondson said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t drive a vehicle. He didn\u2019t ride a bike. All he had was two dogs, a walking stick and his tobacco.\u201d Sometimes, he said, it would take 14 days to walk his flock to market.These days, tour buses clog narrow lanes, spandex-clad cyclists dodge between them, and kayakers take to the rivers and lakes that inspired Arthur Ransome\u2019s \u201cSwallows and Amazons\u201d children\u2019s stories. Such is the quest for adventure in Britain\u2019s leisured society that developers want to build zip wires down precipices. As they have since the 19th century, rock climbers scale vertiginous crags. Walkers clamber over the high passes and summits, sharing the terrain with the sheep.\u201cSooner or later saturation must be reached,\u201d said Terry Fletcher, a columnist in the monthly magazine Cumbria. \u201cSooner or later enough must be enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, the News Can Survive the Newspaper", "Date": "2016-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorOne day many decades hence, when your grandchildren ask you, \u201cGrandma, what was a newspaper?\u201d you can direct them back to Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2016. Because it may well go down as the day the American newspaper as we\u2019ve known it moved out of intensive care and into the palliative wing on its way to the Great Beyond.The group will be known as the News Media Alliance.There is one obvious reason behind the change: The number of newspapers continues to drop, which has a way of depressing the association\u2019s membership. (It has fallen to about 2,000 from roughly 2,700 in 2008, executives there say.)But the bigger issue, the group\u2019s chief executive, David Chavern, told me last week, was that the word \u201cnewspaper\u201d has become meaningless in reference to many of the group\u2019s members, including The Washington Post, The New York Times and Dow Jones. They may have newspapers, but they get large percentages of their readers online. Actually, you can\u2019t even refer exclusively to \u201creaders\u201d these days when so many millions are \u201cviewers\u201d of online news video.The print requirement was needlessly exclusive for a group that needs all the members it can get to meet numerous existential challenges \u2014 such as ad blocking, ad fraud and aggregators who steal their material and then use it to compete with them.\u201c\u2018Newspaper\u2019 is not a big enough word to describe the industry anymore,\u201d Mr. Chavern said. \u201cThe future of this industry is much broader.\u201dIn this case, as the ad dollars that have long financed journalism vaporize into the electronic ether, you don\u2019t know with any certainty that the best services that newspapers have provided \u2014 holding public officials to account, rooting out corruption \u2014 will live on.If anything, today\u2019s \u201cefficiencies\u201d may even set readers back by pumping out lowest-common-denominator nonsense or, at worst, disinformation.The Facebook program picked up the bogus story and the McChicken item because they were generating copious clicks on the internet \u2014 thus, they were \u201ctrending.\u201dThey represented worst-case examples of what happens when media companies race to give their readers what\u2019s popular \u2014 which is more discernible than ever in an age of ubiquitous data measurement \u2014 at the expense of what\u2019s true or informative.And it is all exacerbated when experienced and discerning journalists fall out of the mix, along with the judgment they bring to the process.In a spoof version of the movie \u201cSpotlight,\u201d about the Boston Globe reporters who uncovered widespread sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, Mr. Oliver envisioned a \u201cmultiplatform content generation distribution network\u201d \u2014 formerly a \u201cnewspaper\u201d \u2014 that puts off a City Hall corruption blockbuster in lieu of a potentially more popular item about a creature that looks like both a raccoon and a cat \u2014 a \u201cRac-Cat.\u201dMr. Oliver devoted his show that week to digital-age threats to local newspapers and the industry\u2019s sometimes ham-handed attempts to overcome them. It took particular aim at Tronc, formerly known as Tribune Publishing \u2014 owner of big regional newspapers like The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and The Baltimore Sun \u2014 whose new, tech-world management team boasts that it will \u201coptimize\u201d Tronc\u2019s journalism with \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d\u201cMy mantra is, \u2018We can\u2019t be the general store that we used to be,\u2019\u201d Stan Wischnowski, the executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News and Philly.com, told me. \u201cWe have to make choices \u2014 we have to use our informed, experienced editors to make really smart decisions.\u201dKnow-nothing press haters may say that news organizations are going out of business because the public is shunning them, but that\u2019s not the case at all. Through online exposure, newspapers are reaching more people than ever. The problem is how they make money. Circulation for physical newspapers is declining, and so is print advertising; digital ads remain far less profitable. The trick is finding a way to make up the lost revenue.That\u2019s one reason that physical newspapers have stuck around as long as they have. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in the industry whose majority revenue is not still print,\u201d said Michael J. Klingensmith, the publisher and chief executive of The Star Tribune of Minneapolis, and the vice chairman of the soon-to-be News Media Alliance. He added, \u201cThe name change to me isn\u2019t about not being paper anymore \u2014 it\u2019s really just about expanding opportunities.\u201dWe fell into the usual conversation about how long newspapers would remain. He said he figured Sunday newspapers would be around at least another 20 years, though he wasn\u2019t sure he could say the same for the rest of the week.That leads back to where this column started. The newspaper, as we\u2019ve always known it, is dying. There will be a lot less to mourn, and even something to celebrate, if we come to find that it has an everlasting soul that lives on.The Mediator column on Monday, about the Newspaper Association of America\u2019s name change, misstated, in some copies, when it will become the News Media Alliance.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz Announces Support for Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Ted Cruz said on Friday that he would vote for Donald J. Trump for president, two months after Mr. Cruz pointedly declined to endorse his former rival in a speech at the Republican National Convention.For Mr. Cruz, who has fashioned himself as the unbending conscience of modern conservatism, the decision to endorse Mr. Trump is the latest remarkable gamble in a career defined by them, placing him in the corner of an ideologically elastic candidate who savaged Mr. Cruz \u2014 and, often, the senator\u2019s family \u2014 at every turn during the nominating contest.But Mr. Trump\u2019s rise in the polls, combined with a handful of political overtures from Mr. Trump and his team in recent days, left Mr. Cruz effectively boxed in, raising the possibility that a narrow Trump defeat could be laid at his feet.In his statement, Mr. Cruz said he had based his decision on two factors: a prior pledge to support the Republican nominee \u2014 which Mr. Cruz said in July had been \u201cabrogated\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attacks on him \u2014 and his desire to defeat Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee.\u201cIf Clinton wins, we know \u2014 with 100 percent certainty \u2014 that she would deliver on her left-wing promises, with devastating results for our country,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cMy conscience tells me I must do whatever I can to stop that.\u201dBut Mr. Cruz\u2019s statement went beyond the perfunctory, praising the policy aims and recent campaign promises of a man he once called a \u201cpathological liar.\u201dMr. Cruz did not address the personal attacks that Mr. Trump had leveled \u2014 always without hesitation, often without evidence \u2014 against the Texas senator and his family during the nominating fight.Among other slights, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility for the presidency, citing his birth in Canada; seemed to disparage the appearance of Mr. Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, in a Twitter post; and insinuated that Mr. Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael, was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.15 PhotosThen there was the Trump-branded nickname: \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted.\u201dIn recent weeks, several former aides and allies to Mr. Cruz had urged him not to publicly back Mr. Trump, on both principled and pragmatic grounds.Such support could be seen as jeopardizing Mr. Cruz\u2019s professed reputation for conservative ideological purity, given Mr. Trump\u2019s shape-shifting political views, which Mr. Cruz delighted in highlighting during his presidential campaign. And by voicing his support so late in the campaign, the senator also risks feeding a perception, rampant among Senate colleagues, that he is a cynical political operator, mindful only of his own interests.At his convention speech in July, Mr. Cruz urged Republicans to \u201cvote your conscience,\u201d leaving the stage in Cleveland to cascading boos.The next morning, as delegates from his home state jeered him at a breakfast, Mr. Cruz said he refused to fall in line like a \u201cservile puppy dog.\u201d Mr. Trump, for his part, said this summer that he would not accept Mr. Cruz\u2019s endorsement anyway.On Friday, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cgreatly honored\u201d to have the backing of a \u201ctough and brilliant opponent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just trying to get this Cruz sticker off my car,\u201d Rick Tyler, the senator\u2019s campaign spokesman, said shortly after the endorsement was announced. \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to get the wrong idea and think I\u2019m a Trump supporter.\u201dSteve Deace, a prominent Iowa conservative radio host who had supported Mr. Cruz, called the senator\u2019s decision \u201cthe worst political miscalculation of my lifetime.\u201dVoters\u2019 responses were often no kinder.\u201cI am ashamed to have supported you,\u201d one man wrote.\u201cConservatism is dead,\u201d said another.While Mr. Cruz is widely expected to pursue the presidency again, he faces a 2018 Senate re-election campaign first.In recent days, signs of a tentative peace between the Cruz and Trump camps had begun to surface.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign issued a news release that was supportive of Mr. Cruz\u2019s latest Senate venture: his opposition to the federal government\u2019s plan to end its oversight of the internet\u2019s master directory of website addresses.Mr. Trump also included a close Cruz ally, Senator Mike Lee of Utah, on a list of prospective Supreme Court nominees, which Mr. Cruz praised in his statement.Mr. Trump also now employs some members of the Cruz orbit: Jason Miller, who was a top adviser to the senator\u2019s campaign, and Kellyanne Conway, who ran a pro-Cruz \u201csuper PAC\u201d before becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager.Longtime Cruz supporters could be forgiven for experiencing whiplash.On Friday, Mr. Cruz cheered Mr. Trump\u2019s vow to nominate justices \u201cin the mold\u201d of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. In the primaries, he regularly disparaged Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment on judicial matters, holding forth on a \u201cradical pro-abortion extremist\u201d federal judge who happens to be Mr. Trump\u2019s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry.On Friday, Mr. Cruz named Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy as a bright spot. In the primaries, he attacked Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals as \u201camnesty.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Cruz cited \u201cnational security\u201d as a reason to to back Mr. Trump. In the primaries, the senator described Mr. Trump as so unsteady that he might even use nuclear weapons against a friendly country like Denmark on a whim.Though Mr. Cruz spoke warmly of Mr. Trump early in the primary season, telling donors he planned to \u201cbearhug\u201d him in the hopes of winning his supporters if Mr. Trump faded, he let fly a blistering critique of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and political integrity just before leaving the race.\u201cI\u2019m going to do something I haven\u2019t done for the entire campaign,\u201d Mr. Cruz told reporters in Evansville, Ind., hours before decisively losing the state\u2019s primary in May. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump.\u201dHe went on to call Mr. Trump \u201ca pathological liar\u201d; \u201cutterly amoral\u201d; \u201ca serial philanderer\u201d; and \u201ca narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country has ever seen.\u201dIf voters did not stop him, Mr. Cruz said, \u201cthis country could well plunge into the abyss.\u201dMaggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Clear Logic in Verizon\u2019s Digital Media Venture", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreet SceneMaybe I am a Luddite. I just don\u2019t get the industrial logic behind Verizon Communications\u2019 recent $9.2 billion foray into the digital media \u201cspace,\u201d especially because the way it has chosen to compete in it is by buying Yahoo and AOL, two companies that have seen much better days.In late July, Verizon, the telephone and wireless behemoth, agreed to buy Yahoo for $4.8 billion in cash. A year or so earlier, it bought AOL for $4.4 billion in cash. The money Verizon spent is hardly material to its $220 billion market capitalization, although it is still a lot of money. And both businesses combined generate about $7 billion revenue annually.Does it still have a good handle on how to invest the nearly $50 billion in cash flow that it has generated in the last 12 months, mostly from its gigantic wireless and old-fashioned telephone businesses? Or is flailing in unknown waters in a misguided quest to get into the business of providing digital advertising, where the two biggest competitors by far are the formidable Google (market cap, $530 billion) and Facebook (market cap, $363 billion)?Both AOL and Yahoo, when that deal closes early next year, will report up the Verizon chain of command to Marni M. Walden, an executive vice president, who is a leading contender to succeed Lowell McAdam, the Verizon chief executive, when he retires. (Mr. McAdam is 62; there is no mandatory retirement age for executives at Verizon.) Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL and the man generally credited with creating Google\u2019s online advertising sales team, appears to be the executive who will run both AOL and Yahoo on a day-to-day basis for Ms. Walden.Ms. Walden\u2019s future at Verizon is likely to depend on how well she and Mr. Armstrong execute on Verizon\u2019s AOL-Yahoo strategy. At 49, she is a highflier, for sure. She was paid nearly $7 million in 2015, and along with Tami Erwin, the head of Verizon\u2019s wireless business, she is one of only two women senior executives at the company. Verizon declined to make any of its executives available to discuss the logic of the AOL and Yahoo deals.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on moving forward running the business,\u201d Bob Varettoni, the head of corporate communications, emailed me.Instead, Mr. Varettoni pointed me to previous public comments Verizon executives have made. For instance, at the time of the AOL acquisition, Ms. Walden said, \u201cWe\u2019ve begun the next chapter in our history where we intend to become the No. 1 global media technology company for creators and advertisers and consumers.\u201d\u201cOur vision is to provide customers with a premium digital experience based on a global multiscreen platform,\u201d she added.She noted that AOL was a leader in \u201cdigital content and advertising platforms\u201d and that with Verizon, the combined company \u201ccreates a scaled mobile first platform directly targeted at the global advertising industry.\u201dVerizon\u2019s public relations team also pointed me to a transcript of Verizon\u2019s second-quarter 2016 earnings call. In the call, Mr. McAdam said that thanks to the AOL deal, which also brought with it The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, Verizon has learned \u201ca tremendous amount\u201d about the video market and opportunities for future growth. As for the Yahoo acquisition, Mr. McAdam said Verizon saw \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d in the digital video marketplace, which he said was expected to reach $180 billion by 2020.Without naming them, he said that two brands \u2013 the aforementioned Google and Facebook \u2014 dominated the market and that Verizon intended to be \u201ca significant player,\u201d too. \u201cContent creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption,\u201d he said.The Yahoo acquisition will allow Verizon to be a \u201cmajor competitor\u201d in mobile media, Mr. McAdam continued. He said Yahoo brought \u201cmarket-leading content\u201d in sports, finance, news and email and expanded Verizon\u2019s \u201canalytics and ad tech capabilities\u201d and enhanced \u201cour competitive position and value proposition to advertisers.\u201d For his part, Mr. Armstrong told Mr. Gelles: \u201cThis industry is so big and it\u2019s so new. People act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future.\u201dHonestly, I don\u2019t know what any of this means. It sounds like Verizon recognizes that the growth in its wireless business, while a cash machine, has peaked and that it needs to find new opportunities. It must think it has found that opportunity by trying to take a piece of the digital advertising market away from Google and Facebook. And even if AOL and Yahoo end up with only 5 percent of the market, by 2020, that will be nearly $4 billion in new revenue for Verizon, which is still just a fraction of its $130 billion in trailing 12 months\u2019 revenue.When I was a Wall Street banker covering the telecommunications industry, I worked on a number of mergers and acquisitions deals for what is now Verizon: the merger of GTE and Bell Atlantic, which created Verizon; the creation of Verizon Wireless; and the sale of groups of Verizon\u2019s wireless assets that posed conflicts for the company. I also worked on two deals that never came to fruition: Verizon\u2019s failed attempt to buy AirTouch, a big wireless provider, and Verizon\u2019s exploration of buying WorldCom for $100 billion, before WorldCom disintegrated. In each of these deals, I always had a clear sense of the company\u2019s strategic direction and priorities.But now I\u2019m more than a little confused. Which leads me to wonder what the market makes of Verizon\u2019s acquisition of Yahoo. Verizon\u2019s stock hovered around $56 a share before it announced the widely expected Yahoo acquisition. These days the stock is hovering around $53, a decline in Verizon\u2019s market capitalization of nearly $12 billion, or three times what it agreed to pay for Yahoo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan\u2019s President, Is Gravely Ill. No, Wait! He\u2019s Fine.", "Date": "2016-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The mystery surrounding the health of Islam Karimov, the longtime president of Uzbekistan, deepened on Wednesday with his daughter suggesting that he was recovering after a stroke, but an announcer reading Mr. Karimov\u2019s traditional independence day address on television.There have been no detailed official statements on his condition, but amid the murkiness in Uzbekistan, a former republic of the Soviet Union, one thing seemed certain. The lack of information followed an old Soviet tradition of keeping bad news about the health of an autocrat under wraps.The practice was not a Soviet monopoly, however, having started centuries before. Perhaps the most infamous case involved a Chinese emperor, Qin Shi Huang, whose eunuchs reportedly kept his demise in 210 B.C. secret for two months and obscured the stench from his rotting corpse with heaps of dead fish.The whole tradition stems from fear of unrest when the public knows that an autocrat\u2019s boot is no longer on their necks, experts noted, particularly if the succession could be messy.\u201cThis is a true Eastern style of dealing with intrigue,\u201d said Valeriy Solovey, a history professor at the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations.\u201cThe death of any tyrant is not disclosed to the society because the power is afraid of unrest, afraid that the society will act in the absence of a ruler,\u201d Mr. Solovey said. \u201cYou can announce the death of a leader only when you have the next one. You can show people that they did not lose their father, that they have a new one now.\u201dMr. Karimov, 78, suffered a stroke on Saturday, but the first word of anything amiss came with an government statement on Sunday about his health, announcing only that he had been hospitalized in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.On Monday, his younger daughter, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, wrote on Facebook that the president was in stable condition in an intensive care unit after suffering a stroke. An authoritative opposition website announced later that day that he had actually died.Various reports suggesting that he was still alive popped up in the Russian news media, including some with anonymous sources quoted on Wednesday saying that he had briefly stood up from what was presumably his death bed.It is, of course, possible that Mr. Karimov remains alive, will recover and reappear in public some day. Yet, given the dearth of information, these precedents suggest a different formula is equally likely:There are no signs of rotting fish trundling through the streets of Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, just yet.Advertisement"}

Casey Kasem that he had been inspired to write the song when he was stranded by the roadside during a blizzard and a mysterious Cherokee chief, Bloody Bear Tooth, led him to safety and asked him to tell the rest of the world, in song, of the sufferings of his people.Mr. Kasem repeated the tale on his radio program \u201cAmerican Top 40,\u201d giving it currency. In a wink to record buyers, Mr. Loudermilk added \u201cP.S. My regards to Bloody Bear Tooth\u201d on the sleeve of his 1971 album \u201cVolume 1: Elloree.\u201dJohn D. Loudermilk, whose middle initial did not stand for anything, was born in Durham on March 31, 1934. His father, also named John D., was an illiterate carpenter. His mother, Pauline, was a homemaker and Salvation Army missionary. He was a cousin of Ira and Charlie Loudermilk, known professionally as the country music duo the Louvin Brothers.When John was 7, his father made him a ukulele from a cigar box and his mother taught him to play it. He soon learned, in addition to guitar, an assortment of instruments, which he played in a Salvation Army band. By his early teens, he had appeared on local radio and television stations.Mr. Loudermilk was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1976. In the 1980s, he turned his attention to the study of ethnomusicology and indulging his passion for sailing and chasing hurricanes.His first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his son Mike, he is survived by two other children from his first marriage, Rick and John, and by his wife, the former Susan Chollette.\u201cI\u2019m looking for the most different thing I can find,\u201d Mr. Loudermilk told The Tennessean of Nashville in 1961 in a discussion of his songwriting style. \u201cEverybody\u2019s writing \u2018I love you truly.\u2019 You\u2019ve got to find something new.

{"Headline": "Creepy Clown Hoaxes Lead to 12 Arrests in Multiple States", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe reports to the police had one thing in common with the circus act involving an improbable number of clowns emerging from a small car.They just kept coming, and coming, and coming, across multiple states. Clowns in vans. Clowns in the woods. Clowns lurking in the shadows. Clowns chasing people or doing crimes.But in recent weeks, steady police work has turned the news around, with 12 people facing charges of making false reports or threats, or chasing people, the authorities said. Other cases seem attributable to children with overactive imaginations, teenagers pulling pranks and others with their own reasons for adding to the hysteria. At least one death has been linked to a clown hoax.\u201cSince the event appears to be difficult to verify, the claim that one has had such an encounter is easier to make and relatively free from the risk of being called out as a fraud,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cSo, low risk of being called out for lying and the benefit of positive attention for reporting such a claim may motivate some people to lie.\u201dBut that low risk has evaporated as the police have worked to get to the bottom of the reports. Among the cases:When the authorities interviewed the person who called in the sightings, Brandon J. Moody, 26, they said that he admitted to making up the story. He also implicated his sister-in-law, Rebecca Moody, 27, in calling 911 about seeing clowns.The pair were charged with obstruction and unlawful conduct during a 911 call, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Neither could be reached to comment.The police noted that \u201csignificant resources\u201d had been committed to respond to the threats by both law enforcement and the schools.\u201cThe suspects indicated that they would be dressed as \u2018creepy clowns\u2019 and would be driving a white van,\u201d the department said. Officers received numerous calls of \u201ccreepy clowns\u201d in different areas of the city but found none, the police said.The identities of the subjects of the warrants were not immediately available. It was not clear on Wednesday if arrests had been made.\u201cThis behavior is not cute or funny,\u201d a police statement said. \u201cUnderstand that if officers see this behavior, you\u2019re going to have a conversation with them.\u201dSchools were locked down while officials searched the buildings, officials said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the police from Alabama and Florida got involved. Makayla Smith, 22, of Flomaton, was charged with making a terrorist threat, the police said. Two juveniles, whose names were not released, were also found to have been involved. Charges are pending against them.\u2022 Henrico County Police in Virginia said two teenagers face charges after they chased children while wearing clown masks in Henrico, about 10 miles east of Richmond, on Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Refugees in Lebanon, Cash Instead of Camps", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesDoes 10,000 seem a lot?Consider Lebanon, a country of 4.5 million people that has taken in probably close to 1.5 million Syrians fleeing their civil war. At equivalent levels, the United States would have 107 million Syrian refugees by now.I am not arguing that the United States should take in millions of Syrians. But Americans should appreciate that Lebanon is doing them and Europe a huge favor.And at great cost. Lebanon is not a prosperous country. The economy is weak and its democracy is battered by destructive religious divisions, complicated by outside intervention \u2014 Syrian troops occupied the country from 1976 to 2005. There has been no president for two years.Lebanon, of course, is also home to half a million Palestinians, some of them residents of refugee camps for 60 years. Largely for that reason, Lebanon has not permitted the building of camps for the Syrians.Instead, they live in limbo.Until January 2015, Lebanon\u2019s border with Syria was open. Now it is closed and the country has set rules that make life much harder for the refugees who are there. Perhaps 70 percent of Syrian refugees do not have legal residency, which can also mean they can\u2019t get work, shelter, education or health care, according to Human Rights Watch.That leaves them open to all kinds of exploitation. Syrians do off-the-books jobs for a pittance. Their children sell candy on the street. They squat in abandoned buildings with no water or electricity, lodge with families who are struggling themselves, sleep in makeshift tent cities.The world has well-worn systems for dealing with refugees in camps. But how do you help urban refugees?Lebanon\u2019s government and international aid groups are doing something new. Cash is keeping the refugees alive \u2014 and it should be noted, off the path to Europe.Cash isn\u2019t the solution everywhere. Goods must be available. Markets must be functional, and large enough so that an infusion of new cash isn\u2019t inflationary. Since it\u2019s easier, safer and carries less risk of corruption to provide cash electronically instead of handing people envelopes of bills, mechanisms should exist for debit cards or cellphone banking.But that covers much of the world, even in emergency situations. It\u2019s no problem in Lebanon, a middle-income country known for commerce. \u201cWe\u2019re using in the humanitarian sector what you and I experience in our normal retail life,\u201d said Dominik Heinrich, the food program\u2019s country director for Lebanon.Here\u2019s how it works: Each needy Syrian refugee family gets a banking card. Family members use it to shop for food at the 450 participating stores and markets; a family of five gets about $135 per month.Especially vulnerable families also get cash. They can withdraw $174 per month in cash, to spend anywhere, on whatever they need most.Next month, all the different agencies that give cash will be combining forces to use the same bank card. The food comes from the World Food Program. The cash comes from either the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or the Lebanon Cash Consortium, which is a collaboration of several private relief groups, led by Save the Children. Unicef also gives cash to families who need it to keep warm in the winter.Many humanitarian groups in Lebanon help with sanitation systems and other in-kind assistance. Many run schools, or provide skills or business training. The cash is intended to address (a little; it\u2019s not really enough to live on) refugees\u2019 most urgent problems: What\u2019s for dinner? Where am I sleeping?\u201cThere is nothing that could replace cash,\u201d said Alan Moseley, the Lebanon country director for the International Rescue Committee, a member of the Lebanon Cash Consortium. \u201cIf we provided shelter materials, clothing, food or direct rent subsidies, it would be more costly to deliver and people would be getting things they don\u2019t necessarily need.\u201dCash has particular advantages for refugees, who are sometimes on the move. A cash card travels better than grain, buckets and blankets.Another major way cash can help refugees: it builds good will with hosts far better than sacks of grain can. Lebanon\u2019s enormous generosity has many critics: politicians demonize refugees, and citizens resent the strain they put on schools, social services and local wages. Locals also see foreigners get help that the citizens themselves could use.When refugees get foodstuffs it can make tensions worse \u2014 they often sell their grain for prices lower than in local stores.In Lebanon, however, Syrians go to nearby stores to buy food that has been grown by local farmers and transported in local trucks. Kevin Murphy, senior manager for cash assistance at the International Rescue Committee, said that every dollar in cash assistance generates more than $2 for the Lebanese economy. When the food program cut its payments last year, \u201cwe saw a lot of backlash from local vendors,\u201d Moseley said.The International Rescue Committee, for example, runs cash-for-work programs in two regions. About 2,500 people, both Syrians and Lebanese, can earn $200 each month for 10 days of collecting trash, cleaning up public areas and making repairs in parks.On a much wider scale, the food program\u2019s cards also go to the poorest Lebanese. Their card is a different color, but Lebanese families can shop in the same stores. Heinrich said that Lebanon first tried to set up such a program for its citizens in 2008, but the logistics had been troublesome (the program used paper vouchers). The country succeeded only after the refugees\u2019 digital cash system was in place \u2014 an example of locals benefiting in some ways from hosting refugees.One problem that cash can\u2019t solve is the big one: There\u2019s not enough aid. Last year a conference of rich-country donors to Syria raised only half its goal. As a result, in July 2015 the food program cut its assistance in half, and Syrian refugees in Lebanon began receiving only $13 per person per month to buy food.It\u2019s strongly in the interest of Europe and the United States to compensate Lebanon richly for its service to the refugees, and to help Syrians there live lives as close as possible to normal. \u201cHere, home is 50 kilometers away,\u201d said Heinrich. \u201cYou are in an environment with the same culture, food, climate, religion. If you have hope, you don\u2019t reach the desperate measures of using your last savings to move thousands of kilometers to a strange country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airbnb, a Silicon Valley Titan, Breaks Ranks in Admitting Its Power", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From AmericaIn recent years, the idea of privilege \u2014 for whites, for men, for straights, and for others \u2014 has moved to the fore of American discourse.Yet one of the fastest-growing forms of power in our moment has gone relatively undetected: the power that comes with dominating the digital infrastructure that people have less and less of a choice not to ply.Even as certain networks rise in Silicon Valley, many of their leaders reject the idea that they hold any kind of network privilege and cling to the idea that they are just platforms, mere bulletin boards for users to make their own arrangements.Despite efforts to persuade the leaders of these networks to acknowledge the power that comes with privilege \u2014 beseeching them to purge their sites of abuse, or take care of drivers, or fairly compensate creators of the content they feed on \u2014 the denials have been steadfast.Auren Hoffman, a prominent entrepreneur and investor in the valley, captured the logic behind these denials when he told me, \u201cPower is way more diffused today than it has been before.\u201dDiscussing the billionaire founders of Uber and Facebook, he said that even they, compared with their counterparts at, say, Walmart, \u201cdon\u2019t run the joint as much as people like to think they do.\u201dThis is the kind of response many might have expected when, this year, scores of African-Americans took to social media to criticize Airbnb, the exploding home-rental empire, for tolerating racial discrimination by people renting out their properties.After absorbing the complaints and hiring legal experts to conduct a review, Airbnb last week published a report that marked something of a milestone for Silicon Valley: a major network owning up to the vast, if new and ethereal, kind of power it possesses.Airbnb could have stuck to a familiar line of reasoning: It is a passive bystander allowing a renter and landlord to find each other and make a private deal, with each party responsible for obeying the law.But Airbnb\u2019s report rejected this trope of powerlessness. It committed to put in place \u201cpowerful systemic changes to greatly reduce the opportunity for hosts and guests to engage in conscious or unconscious discriminatory conduct.\u201dThe company also announced a new team of engineers, data scientists and others \u201cwhose sole purpose is to advance belonging and inclusion and to root out bias.\u201dThe move could provide an interesting example to a number of Bay Area companies that have faced criticism for their bystander stances.He conceded that Uber\u2019s drivers were not employees in a traditional sense but suggested, citing the French philosopher Michel Foucault, that the company\u2019s digital surveillance of them creates power that may come with duties not yet contemplated by the law.This year, he predicted that before long, \u201cthe vast majority of the content that people consume online will be video.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention that his company had used its immense power to favor that outcome, with adjustments to its news feed algorithm.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Whole Trump-Clinton Election Could Probably Just Be Held in Pennsylvania", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 2016 RaceWith her polling lead slipping, Hillary Clinton still has Pennsylvania as a firewall \u2014 for now.He also discussed the potential importance of the ground game, the perceived failure of betting markets in predicting \u201cBrexit\u201d and the ethics of live forecasting on Election Day, among other topics. Here\u2019s the lightly edited text of our email exchange.It has been the state to put Hillary Clinton over 270 electoral votes, should she win all of the other more likely states for her. Conversely, it\u2019s also the state that would put Trump over the hump, if he wins all of the states that are more likely for him.Every day, I run 100,000 simulations of the election. I use the probability of each state going for Clinton or Trump, then I mix that with a correlation matrix that defines the relationships between the states. And every day since late July, Pennsylvania has been the state that most frequently is won by the candidate who wins the election. Currently, there are just 6 percent of scenarios where Clinton wins Pennsylvania but loses the election, and just 3 percent of scenarios where Clinton loses Pennsylvania and wins the election.Since Pennsylvania is more secure for the Clinton camp than other swing states, it\u2019s unlikely that Clinton loses Pennsylvania and wins either Florida or Ohio or other states to make up for the necessary electoral votes. And Trump could take Florida and Ohio and North Carolina, and go over the top with some other combination of swing states. But Pennsylvania is his most likely route.What I will be looking for in Pennsylvania over the next few weeks is simple: polls in Pennsylvania; polls in Ohio, which have similar demographics (and a lot of polling); and national polls that correlate heavily among the key swing states.Furthermore, I will be paying special attention to the crosstabs of national polls that focus on key swing demographics for Pennsylvania, when available and reliable, including white women. Beyond the polling for the presidential election, the ups and downs of the Pennsylvania Senate race could be important. The Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty, currently enjoys a slight lead, and that get-out-the-vote campaign will heavily overlap with Clinton\u2019s.Further, we will learn more soon about ad buys and get-out-the-vote operations in the state. Currently Clinton enjoys a comfortable margin in both categories. If they make a difference \u2014 and if they ever make a difference it will be this year with a massive disparity in both advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts \u2014 it should give Clinton a slight advantage over the polling average.While there are certainly surprises that could influence the race, the first debate looms very large as the last major set piece for Trump to make a move. The second and third debates are generally too late. Of course, the election is won on the state level, not the national level, but movements in national polls correlate heavily with state movement.I do not think too much about Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina, because if Clinton wins these states she has certainly won the entire election. The only thing I worry about there is how the tightness affects Clinton or Trump\u2019s ability to wage advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts in other key swing states.There is a complex relationship between the swing states that I model considering three things: the likely correlated impact of any major events or shocks in the days before Election Day (the correlated impact would be very high); the likely correlated errors between the polling and Election Day outcome (reasonably high); and the likely correlation of random chance on Election Day that affects voting (i.e., rain or shine, and this is not as high of correlation).The fact that the probability of victory for Clinton in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania continues to be a few percentage points above her probability of winning the election reflects a very high correlation between the states in both how events could impact all of the states and the sizes and correlation of any potential polling error.By the way, it is amazing that pundits spend so much time talking about how different this election is, how unique this election is, but the statisticians are looking at the same map and basically taking out Virginia and putting in Pennsylvania. Four years ago it was: Romney must take Florida, Ohio and Virginia. This year it is: Trump must take Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.To answer your question directly, I am not compelled to buy or sell Clinton contracts (that pay off $1 if she wins) at $0.70 . Of course, that is because I trust my model.The company spearheading the effort, VoteCastr, plans real-time projections of presidential and Senate races in Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It plans to publish a map and tables of its projected results on Slate, the online newsmagazine.I am not concerned about how the Slate-Votecastr plan will affect voting. Voting is a major cost for many Americans with hourly wage jobs. Those people who choose to get registered and vote are pretty committed to voting. They are more likely going to fixate on any projection that rationalizes voting than a particular projection that unmotivates them.If Slate reports the election is tight, people will use that to rationalize their decision to vote. If Slate reports that Clinton is winning, Clinton supporters will use that to rationalize winning big. And Trump\u2019s supporters will turn to Fox News to confirm that Trump still has a strong chance and needs them more than ever. That is why Karl Rove was still predicting a Romney victory to the very end; he knew that some people just needed someone to convince them that it was worth the investment to stay in line to vote.The Upshot\u2019s presidential forecast, updated daily.A smart reading of polling data is a prediction on who will vote and how they will vote. The \u201cWho Will Vote\u201d question, how polling translates into votes, is influenced by the get-out-the-vote operations (and the related voter-suppression efforts). Normally we assume these have a very low net effect, as both campaigns are pouring millions of dollars into states to get the marginal voters out to the voting locations. There is strong empirical evidence that this will not be the case this year. And if markets see that late in the cycle, with both spending and the results of early voting, they will assume that Clinton could be one to two percentage points better than her polling average.How can prediction markets deal with this problem? Should there be reason to worry that markets will again be slow to accept new information?To answer your more precise question, there is certainly a growing phase as traders learn about how and how quickly new information is absorbed into the markets. The more established the markets become, the less I worry about trader inefficiency.I am unconcerned about the market being slow to incorporate new information in the presidential election. Information is coming from many sources, and traders have a healthy feeling that they are the smart money trading against the dumb money. I am also very pleased at the measured responses prediction markets have given to major events, relative to most poll-based forecasts.Traders respond to the restrictions and fees by over-wagering on long shots, slightly distorting the prices from the underlying values. I correct for this, as best I can, on PredictWise, but it is unfortunate that the C.F.T.C.\u2019s restrictions limit both the overall involvement and efficient involvement of traders.In addition to providing accurate predictions that we use to understand politics, prediction markets are valuable tools for me (and others) to learn about financial markets. Distorted incentives make that more difficult. Further, can you imagine a world where average Americans invested in prediction markets the way they do in fantasy sports? It would be great to see people researching and rooting at the debates as much as they do each weekend for the N.F.L. We should encourage access to prediction markets.I should emphasize that should the election be held today, Clinton would be above 90 percent to win it. The uncertainty is that the election is held on Nov. 8, 2016, not today, and Trump still has time to close the race. There are still lingering questions and events that will be resolved.But she is around three points up in the national polls, and six points up or more in enough states to carry the Electoral College. Combine that polling lead with a larger advertising budget and get-out-the-vote apparatus that should help her perform well in reference to the polling. It would be a catastrophic polling failure if the election were held today and she lost.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Mobile Video Gets Another Look", "Date": "2016-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsFirst off, thank you for still reading words. Now let\u2019s talk about the ever-growing presence of video in our lives.As Katie Benner and Sapna Maheshwari write over two stories, short videos primarily made for viewing on mobile devices are reshaping both internet companies and much of the advertising industry.One major insight: The company seems aware of the ways that looking at things on phones change what and how people watch stuff. The platform calls for short, fast videos, and a lot of novelty in the mix.That is one reason Snapchat, which is renaming itself Snap Inc., is starting to make cool-looking glasses capable of shooting videos 10 seconds long. That short duration, along with Snap\u2019s branding itself as a place of fun ephemera, may help these glasses get past the objections Google faced with Glass, its camera for your face.Snap is a business, and it wants to sell ads to run with pretty much anything people are looking at. So do Facebook and its photo-sharing subsidiary, Instagram. Ultimately all of them, along with companies like Google\u2019s YouTube, want to draw away some of the billions of dollars now spent on television ads.But there\u2019s already trouble in that paradise.That situation worsened last week, they wrote, when Facebook said that for several years it has misstated, in a way favorable to Facebook, how much time people actually spend watching these videos.A setback, for sure, but the past is not returning, and mobile video is an increasing reality in much of our lives. We just need to see who is going to get rich on our attention, and how.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Avalanche of Distrust", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019m beginning to think this whole sordid campaign is being blown along by an acrid gust of distrust. The two main candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, are remarkably distrustful. They have set the modern standards for withholding information \u2014 his not releasing tax and health records, her not holding regular news conferences or quickly disclosing her pneumonia diagnosis. Both have a problem with spontaneous, reciprocal communication with a hint of vulnerability.Both ultimately hew to a distrustful, stark, combative, zero-sum view of life \u2014 the idea that making it in this world is an unforgiving slog and that, given other people\u2019s selfish natures, vulnerability is dangerous.Trump\u2019s convention speech was the perfect embodiment of the politics of distrust. American families, he argued, are under threat from foreigners who are as violent and menacing as they are insidious. Clinton\u2019s \u201cBasket of Deplorables\u201d riff comes from the same spiritual place. We have in our country, she jibed, millions of bigots, racists, xenophobes and haters \u2014 people who are so blackhearted that they are, as she put it, \u201cirredeemable.\u201dBut these nominees didn\u2019t emerge in a vacuum. Distrustful politicians were nominated by an increasingly distrustful nation. A generation ago about half of all Americans felt they could trust the people around them, but now less than a third think other people are trustworthy.The true thing about distrust, in politics and in life generally, is that it is self-destructive. Distrustful people end up isolating themselves, alienating others and corroding their inner natures.The rise of distrust has corroded intimacy. When you go on social media you see people who long for friendship. People are posting and liking private photos on public places like Snapchat and Facebook.But the pervasive atmosphere of distrust undermines actual intimacy, which involves progressive self-disclosure, vulnerability, emotional risk and spontaneous and unpredictable face-to-face conversations.As Garry Shandling once joked, \u201cMy friends tell me I have an intimacy problem, but they don\u2019t really know me.\u201dFurthermore, fear is the great enemy of intimacy. But the loss of intimacy makes society more isolated. Isolation leads to more fear. More fear leads to fear-mongering leaders. And before long you wind up in this death spiral.The great religions and the wisest political philosophies have always counseled going the other way. They\u2019ve always advised that real strength is found in comradeship, and there\u2019s no possibility of that if you are building walls. They have generally championed the paradoxical leap \u2014 that even in the midst of an avalanche of calumny, somebody\u2019s got to greet distrust with vulnerability, skepticism with innocence, cynicism with faith and hostility with affection.Our candidates aren\u2019t doing it, but that really is the realistic path to strength.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Snapchat Channel to Look at Final Leg of Presidential Campaign", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJim VandeHei\u2019s new media company, which he says is intended for dedicated news consumers, is scheduled to make its debut early next year. In the meantime, Mr. VandeHei, one of the founders of Politico, is keeping himself occupied with a more plebeian venture: a Snapchat channel.On Sunday, he and NowThis, a company that makes short videos for social platforms, introduced We The People, a Snapchat Discover channel focused on the final stages of the presidential campaign. It is running Sunday through Thursday until the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20.Mr. VandeHei will provide editorial guidance for the channel, while NowThis, which already has its own Snapchat channel, will create the content.The channel is separate from Mr. VandeHei\u2019s new media company, as yet unnamed, which has raised $10 million and will cover a wide range of subjects, including technology, business, media and politics. But there is a link between the two: Kenneth Lerer\u2019s firm, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, is an investor in both NowThis, whose short videos are all over social platforms including Facebook and Instagram, and Mr. VandeHei\u2019s new company.\u201cAs we were discussing that new company, we also were discussing this new product,\u201d Mr. Lerer, one of the founders of The Huffington Post, said about We the People. NowThis is providing the money for the channel.Mr. VandeHei said he viewed the Snapchat channel as an experiment that, if successful, could potentially \u201cinform what we do with our new media company.\u201dThe channel also underscores a bigger shift in the media industry. Over the last few years, Facebook has had little competition when it comes to wooing both established publishers and newer media companies that want access to the platform\u2019s vast user base and sophisticated targeting capabilities.Increasingly, however, publishers are viewing Snapchat as another viable distribution channel. Many, including BuzzFeed, The Wall Street Journal and Cosmopolitan magazine, have flocked to Snapchat Discover, where they can publish videos, graphics and text within the mobile app.\u201cSnapchat is now, and will grow to be, another very significant avenue to distribute content,\u201d said Mr. Lerer, who is also the executive chairman of BuzzFeed. \u201cIf you have an opportunity now to get on the Discover platform, you take it.\u201dMr. VandeHei\u2019s Snapchat channel is different from other Discover channels in that it will focus on one topic for an extended period of time. \u201cThe channels that we\u2019ve launched to date have been around broader subject matters,\u201d said Nick Bell, vice president of content for Snapchat. \u201cThis is very specific and very pointed.\u201d(Snapchat does have Specials \u2014 Discover channels that tend to focus on one topic and are live for only one or two days. Mr. Bell described those more as \u201cone-offs.\u201d)Mr. VandeHei did not define measures of success for the channel, but, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re all curious to see how big an audience we can get\u201d and whether users will return day after day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Social Media Got You Down? Be More Like Beyonc\u00e9", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyIn Gary Shteyngart\u2019s 2010 novel, \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story,\u201d characters carry around smart devices called \u00e4pp\u00e4r\u00e4ts, which are something like iPhones on meth. The book is set in the near future. Staten Island is the new Brooklyn, and all the characters use their \u00e4pp\u00e4r\u00e4ts to chat and shop and beam their lives out to the world, nonstop. \u00c4pp\u00e4r\u00e4ts are also equipped with a program called RateMe Plus, which constantly calculates (and broadcasts, of course) a status ranking based on users\u2019 jobs, financials and online popularity, which is gauged by the quantity and quality of what they share. Live-streaming the most intimate details of your life is the only way to get ahead \u2014 job promotions and romantic prospects depend on it.It all feels like harmless fun, but our online lifestyles have begun to make a real impact in our offline worlds, a trend that doesn\u2019t seem to be reversing. In 2014, Facebook talked with lenders about the possibility of linking profiles to credit scores, and one recent survey showed that 40 percent of college-admission officers now say they peruse applicants\u2019 social-media profiles in addition to evaluating G.P.A.s and essays.In high-definition contrast, let\u2019s look at Beyonc\u00e9 for a moment. Unless televised live performances count, she has never live-streamed a day in her life. She rarely gives interviews, so what we know is scraped from her social-media presence \u2014 which isn\u2019t much. I can tell you what outfit and hairstyle Beyonc\u00e9 posted on social media last week, but I couldn\u2019t tell you where in the world she was, what the inside of her house looks like or even which continent her primary residence is on. Her images tend not to be location-tagged, or even look as if they were taken with a cellphone. I couldn\u2019t tell you who took the photos of her, because, unlike most celebrities, Beyonc\u00e9 rarely posts selfies. I have no idea who comes to her pool parties, if she has a pool or has ever been to a pool party. I couldn\u2019t guess what she wears to bed. And yet, when I speak about her, it\u2019s as if we\u2019ve been attached at the hip since birth. I feel, very intimately, that I know her. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s feed is the rice cake of celebrity social-media feeds: low in caloric content but mystifyingly satisfying.Most people treat social media like the stage for their own reality show, but Beyonc\u00e9 treats her public persona more like a Barbie \u2014 she offers up images and little more, allowing people to project their own ideas, fantasies and narratives about her life onto it. Take, for example, her response after a video leaked of her sister, Solange, attacking Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s husband, Jay Z, in a hotel elevator. Rather than posting rapid-fire tweets explaining the whole thing, Beyonc\u00e9 simply posted a series of photographs of herself and her sister having fun, quelling any rumors of a rift.This logic extends to her creative work too. Earlier this year, she spent an entire album, \u201cLemonade,\u201d stoking rumors of marital strife with Jay Z. Lines like \u201cYou\u2019re gonna lose your wife\u201d seemed to confirm that her once-dreamy relationship was on the rocks. The release of that album felt cathartic, an answer to questions about her personal life that her fans had been obsessing over for months. But then, before the fervor over that album faded, news of another album leaked: this time, a duet album. With her husband. In a single calendar year, Beyonc\u00e9 managed to reveal what seemed to be a lifetime\u2019s worth of secrets and pain, without it being clear whether she had revealed anything at all. If anything, that only made people want more.Conventional wisdom casts Beyonc\u00e9 as a control freak, and perhaps she is, but control isn\u2019t such a bad thing. Lately, I\u2019ve been thinking about her bifurcated self in the context of somewhat-forgotten cyberfeminist theory. In the 1980s, academics believed that technology would introduce profound changes for humankind, especially women. Donna Haraway, emerita professor of the history of consciousness and feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an inspiration for cyberfeminism, wrote that new technologies could liberate women from patriarchy and other oppressive systems. In the distant future, she believed, people could assume virtual bodies, allowing for \u201cpermanently partial identities\u201d that could exist beyond gender, beyond reproach and without limits.The internet preserved many of the same biases and hierarchies Haraway so desperately hoped we could escape. And there are no true cyborgs yet. But social media has, in its own way, provided us a means of generating other selves. We just haven\u2019t yet learned to set them free. Beyonc\u00e9 has, in her own way. The Beyonc\u00e9 we follow seems to live and breathe, and provokes a real emotional reaction. It\u2019s an illusion that feels intimate and real, a hologram self for us to interact with that, in theory, provides the actual Beyonc\u00e9 space to exist away from our prying eyes.This isn\u2019t a strategy that works for only the incredibly rich and famous. I believe it\u2019s a useful way of thinking about how we could all behave online. Why fret about oversharing, or undersharing, or to what extent our online selves are true to our ac\u00adtual self? We could instead use social media as a prism through which we can project only what we want others to see. We can save the rest for ourselves \u2014 our actual selves.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

The first had the artist Vanessa Beecroft as its creative director and about 100 models; the other, the director Louis J. Horvitz (who is known for directing the Grammys and the Emmys) to orchestrate the live-stream with about 24 cameras. The first took place at Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island; the other in the former Four Seasons restaurant, just off Park Avenue.38 PhotosThough the results were not in any way alike, they shared a similar guiding principle: It\u2019s not enough for any designer just to offer clothes anymore. Now it\u2019s all about the experience.But here\u2019s the thing about experiences: Some of them are good, and some of them are bad. And while they can create an exciting aura around clothes, making the garments seem even more relevant and desirable, they can also cast a pall.On Wednesday, they did both.52 PhotosBut they weren\u2019t.It\u2019s not that they were terrible. They weren\u2019t original or risky enough to be terrible. They were just boring. Not ambitious or eclectic or even surprising. Yawn.A group of models of different sizes and shapes stood in formation in a variety of undergarments, forming a Spanx-like sea in shades of cream and chocolate, beige and black. Sometimes they sat, when they got hot. For a while, it seemed as if the underwear itself was the actual show, and maybe this was all meta-commentary on getting dressed and fame and the emperor\u2019s new clothes, except then the clothes actually appeared, undermining that possible point. There were oversize sweatshirts and off-the-shoulder sweater dresses. Thigh-high clear plastic stiletto boots and enormous backpacks. Anoraks and puffa jackets. Ribbed body-con minis and camouflage print. That\u2019s it.For a man known for his rambling, far-reaching riffs, in his fourth fashion season, it turned out Mr. West had nothing to say.At least Mr. Ford, who this season likewise kept his guests captive for a few hours, distracted them with Champagne and martinis, and then fed them smoked salmon with caviar and halibut in a mushroom cream sauce, in a room replete with white orchids and famous friends. So by the time the show actually began, everyone was so lubricated and loved-up that the golden glow extended to the louche, luxed-up looks on the runway (which extended down the center of the restaurant).The silhouette \u2014 a blouson shirt or peplum jacket wrapped by leather buckles at the waist over a below-the-knee stretch cashmere-tweed pencil skirt and high leather boots \u2014 was vintage Ford: a little \u201970s, a little cinematic, with hints of bondage and overindulgence. Ditto the sweeping leopard trench, the men\u2019s tux-and-turtleneck combo, and the evening looks of glinting sequined tops over long, feathered skirts; backless velvet columns traced in gold chains.This is Mr. Ford\u2019s comfort zone, as he defined it years ago: familiar, but nevertheless hard to resist.And that should work to his advantage, because everything on the runway was from Mr. Ford\u2019s fall collection, and all of it is now available in stores and online.The bet that both Mr. West and Mr. Ford were making is that the experiences will sell the clothes: To the people in the room and, even more important, the people who weren\u2019t in the room but really, really wished they could be in the room. The people, in other words, watching (on Instagram and Facebook and so on) the people in the room, and for whom the second-best way to maybe get a bit of the experience of being in the room will be to get a product that was in the room. Immediately.Sure, it\u2019s sleight of hand, but at least Mr. Ford made his audience complicit in the trick instead of casting them in the role of the sucker.Privileged insider versus patsy. How would you rather look?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gas Prices Surge in South After Pipeline Leak", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 Gasoline prices increased again across the Deep South on Monday, 10 days after the discovery in Alabama of a pipeline rupture that threatened fuel supplies and prompted worries about environmental contamination.The AAA motor club said that Monday\u2019s average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in Georgia was nearly $2.32, up from $2.26 on Sunday and about $2.10 the previous Monday. Prices also increased in Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, even as state officials asked drivers to conserve supplies and avoid topping off their tanks.\u201cI urge the public to maintain regular consumption levels and travel schedules in order to reduce further interruption in fuel supply,\u201d Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia said in a statement.The rising prices and sporadic uncertainty here followed the rupture of a 36-inch pipeline that ordinarily carries about 1.3 million barrels of refined gasoline a day. Colonial Pipeline, which operates the system and shut down the line soon after the discovery of the leak on Sept. 9, said up to 336,000 gallons might have been spilled in Shelby County, Ala., south of Birmingham.Colonial said that it was installing a bypass and that the line could resume normal operations this week. Industry observers said the effects of the disruption would fade once gas was again flowing freely.\u201cPrices are likely to rise even further until the pipeline is fully restored,\u201d said Mark Jenkins, a spokesman for AAA. \u201cOnce repaired, prices should quickly begin to decline.\u201dBut over the weekend and into Monday, people across the South used social media to document scattered shortages. Service station operators posted notices of how they had been forced to bring in gas from distant areas, and the authorities warned against price gouging.Despite the increases, most Southern states still posted lower average gasoline prices than other parts of the country. In South Carolina on Monday, drivers typically paid $2.04 a gallon, well below the national average of $2.21.The agency, which used the order to outline its preliminary findings, also said high benzene and gasoline vapor levels had at one point kept emergency responders from the \u201cassumed failure site\u201d for about 83 hours.But officials appeared cautiously optimistic that the leak had not led to an environmental calamity. Although the federal government\u2019s order said officials found dead vegetation and wildlife after the spill was detected, the gasoline was not expected to reach the nearby Cahaba River.Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama, who repeatedly praised Colonial\u2019s response after he visited a command center on Monday, expressed concern about the spill and its effects, but he also acknowledged the frailty of pipelines like the one that leaked in his state.\u201cWe don\u2019t know that won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Mr. Bentley said. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying is there a tornado going to happen again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Physicist in Albany Corruption Case Was a Geek With Big Goals", "Date": "2016-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for Alain E. Kaloyeros, a physicist who rose from a basement laboratory at the State University at Albany to oversee hundreds of millions of dollars in state economic development funds over a quarter-century, a more complex purpose seemed to be at work. Beyond money, the rewards he sought appeared to be power, prestige and, perhaps most of all, the fulfillment of a long-held dream: reinventing upstate New York as a Rust Belt Silicon Valley.With an early zeal for nanotechnology, a taste for head-turning cars, a sardonic tongue and a talent for luring major corporations with government financing, Dr. Kaloyeros, 60, is widely credited with transforming Albany from a drowsy government town into an unlikely center for high-tech research.\u201cIt was pretty much a miracle,\u201d said Lloyd Constantine, a top aide to Eliot Spitzer, the former governor. \u201cFrom my standpoint, from the administration\u2019s standpoint, he was doing a spectacular job. Revitalization of the upstate economy was Job No. 1. And he was doing it, and doing it really well.\u201dOften working with a lobbyist, Todd R. Howe, a former aide to Mr. Cuomo, Dr. Kaloyeros is accused of personally drafting and revising several requests for proposals to favor certain developers, including one for a SUNY Polytechnic dorm, another for a campus research building and two connected to huge economic development contracts in Syracuse and Buffalo.Untethered from the usual government safeguards, the university all but supplanted the state\u2019s economic development agency as the Cuomo administration\u2019s chief economic engine in upstate New York.The grants, rents and business he brought in to SUNY Polytechnic \u201call benefited him personally through his compensation package, and also added to his status as a kingmaker and an important person in state government,\u201d said the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who charged Dr. Kaloyeros with three felony counts of bid-rigging at a news conference. Additional federal charges were brought by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan.Michael C. Miller, a lawyer for Dr. Kaloyeros, said his client was innocent and \u201clooks forward to being exonerated.\u201dDr. Kaloyeros had bragged about his ability to \u201cwrite an RFP in such a way that only one company could win it,\u201d according to the state criminal complaint. Dr. Kaloyeros, referred to as \u201cDr. K\u201d in the federal complaint, did so, according to prosecutors, to preserve his status as one of the state\u2019s highest-paid employees, draw more research financing to SUNY Polytechnic and inflate his reputation as Albany\u2019s most successful rainmaker.\u201cThe job requires being a scientist, being a psychiatrist, being a priest, being a cop, being a negotiator, being a business developer or manager, being a teacher, being an adviser and being an ego-kisser,\u201d Mr. Kaloyeros told the Albany Business Review in 2011. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I do all of them very well.\u201dWheedling and wooing over sushi and Starbucks coffee, he made every college president, legislative leader and governor who supported him feel like a visionary, even as he outlasted, and out-earned, all of them. He consistently ranked among the state\u2019s highest paid employees, earning a total of $1.17 million in salary and other performance-based payments last year.\u201cHe worked the power, in a sense, and knew what buttons to push,\u201d said Ronald Canestrari, the former majority leader of the State Assembly. \u201cThe more he produced, the more he received. He was king of the hill.\u201dMr. Percoco, who had served as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315,000 in bribes. In addition, corruption charges were announced against another former aide, a senior state official and six other people.In 2012, after Mr. Cuomo announced that the state would spend $50 million to open a medical research hub in Buffalo, modeled on what Dr. Kaloyeros had done at SUNY Polytechnic, Dr. Kaloyeros christened the Albany-Buffalo pipeline \u201cthe Andrew Cuomo 21st century high-tech innovation canal.\u201dMr. Cuomo happily reciprocated: The state owed the scientist \u201ca tremendous amount of gratitude,\u201d the governor said last year.In the sometimes drab world of state government, awash in power suits and committee hearings, Mr. Kaloyeros \u2014 with his elegant but hard-to-identify accent, his taste for John Varvatos and his wardrobe full of jeans frayed just so \u2014 openly flaunted his unconventionality.Dr. Kaloyeros\u2019s Facebook page pulsed with off-color jokes about women (\u201cI bought a Ferrari for my girlfriend,\u201d read one image he posted. \u201cBest trade ever.\u201d) and lighthearted Darth Vader memes.Raised in East Beirut, Lebanon, Dr. Kaloyeros was a 19-year-old American University student when, he later told Albany acquaintances, he was attacked by members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the early stages of Lebanon\u2019s civil war. Later, he joined a small Christian militia before immigrating to the United States, where he earned a doctorate in physics from the University of Illinois.By the early 2000s, as a State University at Albany professor, Dr. Kaloyeros was persuading state leaders to commit millions of dollars of state funds to high-tech equipment and laboratories, which he used to entice corporations and jobs to the area.\u201cWe\u2019re out to put Stanford out of business,\u201d he told the Albany Times-Union in 2002.Two of his most important political relationships were with Sheldon Silver, the former State Assembly speaker, and Joseph Bruno, the former State Senate majority leader. To keep the state money flowing, he often played the governor and the two legislative leaders off one another.By the time Dr. Kaloyeros had amassed the clout to spin off the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at SUNY Albany into the independent campus known as SUNY Polytechnic, in 2013, the state\u2019s top politicians were all but squabbling over who should receive credit for his work.Whenever questions arose about the power and the money the state had concentrated in Dr. Kaloyeros, his bosses always concluded that he had earned it.\u201cHis salary was a bargain,\u201d Mr. Constantine said.Mr. Cuomo apparently made the same calculation.The professor\u2019s face spread into a corrugated smile.\u201cStay tuned,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends \u2014 topics like recessions and currency exchange rates \u2014 and help their employers deal with them.But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they are studying the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging.Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft and up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of improved efficiency means more profit.At Netflix, Randall Lewis, an economic research scientist, is finely measuring the effectiveness of advertising. His work also gets at the correlation-or-causation conundrum in economic behavior: What consumer actions occur coincidentally after people see ads, and what actions are most likely caused by the ads?At Airbnb, Mr. Coles is researching the company\u2019s marketplace of hosts and guests for insights, both to help build the business and to understand behavior. One study focuses on procrastination \u2014 a subject of great interest to behavioral economists \u2014 by looking at bookings. Are they last-minute? Made weeks or months in advance? Do booking habits change by age, gender or country of origin?\u201cThey are microeconomic experts, heavy on data and computing tools like machine learning and writing algorithms,\u201d said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics.Understanding how digital markets work is getting a lot of attention now, said Hal Varian, Google\u2019s chief economist. But, he said, \u201cI thought it was fascinating years ago.\u201dMr. Varian, 69, is the godfather of the tech industry\u2019s in-house economists. Once a well-known professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Varian showed up at Google in 2002, part time at first, but soon became an employee. He helped refine Google\u2019s AdWords marketplace, where advertisers bid to have their ads shown on search pages, based on the words users type into Google\u2019s search engine.Google\u2019s insight was to avoid giving the best ad placement to the highest bidder. Mr. Varian worked to develop a different model for ad placement, calculating the probability that a user will click on an ad and find the ad relevant. It was a classic example of smart market design.Seeing this emerging job market, the National Association for Business Economics held its first meeting for technology company economists in April in San Francisco. Another is set for October in Silicon Valley.Academia is also starting to take notice \u2014 and adapt. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening so fast, it\u2019s hard to keep up,\u201d said Susan Athey, an expert in the economics of technology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who is also a consultant to Microsoft.Many economics students also take computer science courses, and some major in both. But a new course this fall at Yale, called Designing the Digital Economy, seeks to blend economics and computer science in the way digital economists do at tech companies. The instructor is Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, and the course will have guest lecturers from Amazon, Pandora and Uber.The course is a pilot for curriculum change and perhaps a joint degree program focused on digital markets and their design. Dirk Bergemann, chairman of the Yale economics department, explained that economics was concerned with efficiency, prices and incentives, while computer science focused on algorithms and complexity.\u201cIn digital marketplaces, you are trying to address both sets of problems,\u201d he said.Mr. Weyl predicts that the rise of digital marketplaces in the economy is just getting underway. Uber in ride-hailing and Airbnb in room-renting, he said, may well be just the start of a redefinition of private property, made possible by digital technology.Things, according to Mr. Weyl, will increasingly be rented as services instead of owned. That is the long-term vision of driverless cars: When a vehicle just shows up on command, far fewer cars will sit in driveways. Transportation efficiency, resource consumption and industries will all be transformed, he said.The same could be true for household goods, Mr. Weyl said. One possible situation: After you use your espresso machine for breakfast, a drone comes to pick it up, and you rent it out for the day.A current market-design challenge for Amazon and Microsoft is their big cloud computing services. These digital services, for example, face a peak-load problem, much as electric utilities do.How do you sell service at times when there is a risk some customers may be bumped off? Run an auction for what customers are willing to pay for interruptible service? Or offer set discounts for different levels of risk? Both Amazon and Microsoft are working on that now.To answer such questions, economists work in teams with computer scientists and people in business. In tech companies, market design involves not only economics but also engineering and marketing. How hard is a certain approach technically? How easy is it to explain to customers?\u201cEconomics influences rather than determines decisions,\u201d said Preston McAfee, Microsoft\u2019s chief economist, who previously worked at Google and Yahoo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Woman Dies After Childbirth, and Her Husband Asks Why", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter Amy Lam prematurely went into labor and gave birth to their baby at home, her husband, Gilbert Kwok, thought the worst was over. Once emergency responders had arrived and loaded Ms. Lam, 34, into an ambulance, the couple took photos with the newborn and called family members, smiling and elated that \u2014 despite the unexpected circumstances \u2014 their son had arrived.On Monday, on behalf of Mr. Kwok and Ms. Lam\u2019s family, lawyers filed a notice of claim against the hospital, run by NYC Health & Hospitals, as well as more than a half-dozen doctors who treated Ms. Lam, alleging malpractice and medical negligence.Nearly two months after Ms. Lam\u2019s death, an autopsy from the New York City medical examiner\u2019s office is still pending, leaving many questions unanswered. Mr. Kwok, 33, has been left to care for their premature newborn, Zachary, and their 3-year-old son, Abel, while also grappling with his wife\u2019s sudden, inexplicable death.\u201cWhen the boys ask me what happened, how do I answer them?\u201d Mr. Kwok said in an interview last week.NYC Health & Hospitals would not comment on the case because of pending litigation and patient privacy laws. But Robert de Luna, a spokesman for the agency, said it is committed to ensuring patient safety and providing the best care and experience. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family during this difficult time,\u201d he said.But the increase in recent years has been driven largely by heart problems and chronic medical conditions, like diabetes and obesity, researchers say.In New York City, 38 pregnancy-related deaths were caused by hemorrhaging from 2006 to 2010, the most recent data available. More than 630,000 live births took place during those years, according to the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.Dr. Mary E. D\u2019Alton, chairwoman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Medical Center, said maternal deaths from hemorrhaging were \u201cstill quite rare,\u201d though, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say it\u2019s a problem of the past.\u201dMs. Lam and Mr. Kwok, both natives of Hong Kong, had come to New York for Ms. Lam\u2019s graduate studies at Columbia University\u2019s business journalism program. She had graduated in May 2015 and was working as a reporter at Brightwire Inc., a financial news agency. But what she wanted most was a younger brother for Abel, Mr. Kwok said.The couple had planned to move back to Hong Kong, but when Ms. Lam became pregnant, they decided to wait until October to avoid taking Ms. Lam on a long international flight. Moreover, they wanted the baby to be born an American citizen, with a United States passport. They trusted that the country\u2019s medical care was the best.The baby was due at the end of August. Doctors told Ms. Lam her pregnancy was healthy and normal, but that the baby might come a bit early, Mr. Kwok said.Early he came. On the eve of Aug. 1, Ms. Lam was sleeping with Abel in her bed, just like any other night in their Harlem apartment. Feeling contractions, she went to Mount Sinai Beth Israel hospital, following instructions from her obstetrician. After being examined, she was told that she was not yet ready for labor, and that she should return home.She went back to sleep in her apartment, and woke the next morning feeling intense pain and contractions. Around 11:30 a.m., she went into labor in the bathroom, and after a neighbor helped deliver the baby, was transported to the closest hospital, Harlem Hospital.Ms. Lam had not yet delivered the placenta, so she was transferred to a labor ward where a doctor tried to remove the retained placenta manually. The procedure was unsuccessful, and Ms. Lam went into shock, her blood pressure dropping, according to the notice of claim, which was compiled using records from Harlem Hospital.After a delay, Ms. Lam underwent a dilation and curettage procedure in which doctors removed her placenta by scraping the walls of her uterus. Toward the end of the surgery, her blood pressure dropped, her heart rate increased and doctors suspected she had begun to hemorrhage.\u201cHowever, the source and cause of the bleeding was not obtained and identified, nor were required steps taken to properly treat and address the internal bleeding,\u201d according to the notice of claim filed by the family\u2019s lawyer, Susan M. Karten.At 5 p.m., she was admitted to the intensive care unit, where she received rapid blood transfusions. But her vital signs were worsening, and her internal bleeding was progressing. Doctors asked Mr. Kwok for consent to perform an additional \u201cexploratory\u201d procedure. He said he did not understand much of what was happening, and was never told just how serious her condition was.\u201cThey said they needed to find out why she was unstable,\u201d Mr. Kwok said.Doctors said the surgery would take several hours, so Mr. Kwok left the hospital to pick up Abel, who had been home with a neighbor all day. Back at home, at 9:32 p.m., he posted a photo on Facebook of the couple, smiling with their newborn son in the ambulance earlier that day.\u201cPromise me that we will take million more selfie again,\u201d Mr. Kwok\u2019s post read.At 10 p.m., after Mr. Kwok had arrived home, he got a call from the hospital. Ms. Lam\u2019s heart had stopped.After trying to resuscitate her multiple times, doctors declared her dead at 10:37 p.m.When Mr. Kwok went inside the hospital room with Abel to see her, he told the toddler that his mother was just sleeping, and that he should say good night to her.\u201cI just wanted her to wake up,\u201d Mr. Kwok said, crying. \u201cI feel like my heart got ripped out.\u201dAt Ms. Lam\u2019s funeral in Chinatown later in August, her coffin was covered in red, white and yellow flowers and surrounded by a Hello Kitty stuffed animal and children\u2019s toys. During the service, Abel ran around the room wearing a black funeral band on his arm, seemingly oblivious to what was happening. Next to Mr. Kwok, in the front row, lay Zachary, in a car seat, having left the hospital just a few days earlier.\u201cThere\u2019s so many what ifs,\u201d Mr. Kwok said later. \u201cWhat if we didn\u2019t have a baby? What if we didn\u2019t go to Harlem Hospital? Or what if we just didn\u2019t come to the United States at all?\u201dMr. Kwok has tried to maintain a sense of normalcy in the home, for Abel\u2019s sake. After walking the toddler home from his summer camp recently, Abel started pointing in random directions, asking his father to keep walking.When Mr. Kwok asked him why, he said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Mommy.\u201dMr. Kwok did not hesitate. \u201cLet\u2019s find Mommy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cher\u2019s Latest Road Show? The Campaign Trail", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCher\u2019s first brush with politics was an act of teenage civil disobedience. It was right before the election of 1960. And she came home one day horrified to discover that her mother and stepfather had festooned their house in Hollywood with Richard Nixon paraphernalia.Cher purged it all.First she ripped the Nixon yard signs out of their front lawn. And after her mother fished them out of the garbage and put them back up, Cher found a more permanent solution.\u201cI took them to my girlfriend\u2019s house, and we threw them in her trash,\u201d she told me by phone from California the other day, the mischievousness and pride still in her voice after all those years.But the signs weren\u2019t all she got her hands on. \u201cAlso threw out those hideous straw hats with Nixon on them,\u201d she said.In many ways, Cher is the perfect political counterpart to Mr. Trump. Like him, she has always been defiantly indifferent toward her critics. Also like Mr. Trump, no one holds her to the rigid standards of campaign conduct, giving her license to say what she wants without all the consequences. Imagine for a minute that another septuagenarian supporter of Hillary Clinton like Madeleine Albright tweeted side-by-side pictures of John Gotti and Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s recently departed campaign chairman, and offered this critique: \u201cFYI.. Manafort\u2026John Gotti called..he wants his look back!!\u201dIf there was ever a presidential election perfect for a Cher moment, this is it. Personality, outrage and a quick-off-the-keyboard insult are the political currency of 2016.She has earned a reputation as one of the more effective and entertaining Trump neutralizers on Twitter, largely because she can go toe-to-toe with him both in the sheer volume of tweets she fires off (19,000 and counting) and in her lacerating, no-filter style. She often won\u2019t refer to Mr. Trump by name, for example, but with the toilet emoji. (And that is one of her few jokes that is printable here.)Now she is getting marquee billing on the campaign trail. The Clinton campaign realized the weapon it had at its disposal and reasoned that Cher would be a hit at fund-raisers \u2014 especially those with a larger than average guest list of gay men. She headlined three of them last month, in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, Fire Island and Provincetown, Mass. \u201cI\u2019m such an obvious person,\u201d she told me, \u201cto bring that message to, as I call them, my people.\u201d\u201cI think the one thing that I am,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m honest. And I say what I think.\u201dShe is self-aware enough to know her impetuousness may cause trouble for her and Mrs. Clinton. That is why she sheepishly acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019m trying not to use any bad words.\u201dI told her this when we had our first phone call because she wouldn\u2019t let me start the interview until I submitted to a minor grilling.\u201cI have to ask you a question,\u201d she said before I could get a word out. \u201cBecause most people think that if you\u2019re famous that you don\u2019t deserve an opinion. And so why are you calling me?\u201dI\u2019ve followed her career, the farewells, the reinventions, the public degradation and adulation, for quite a while. When I was in seventh grade, my performance in the talent show was to lip-sync Sonny and Cher\u2019s \u201cI Got You Babe.\u201d I was Cher, dressed in a hip-length black wig and a pair of my mom\u2019s old bell bottoms.I always thought Cher had a unique voice, and in more than just song.She told me she was so strongly moved to oppose Mr. Trump not solely because of his politics but because she felt he was dangerously misguided and intemperate. Ronald Reagan, she said, was a Republican she disagreed with politically but did not fear personally.\u201cHe did nothing for AIDS, and he just stood back when people were dying,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there were things that you could say, \u2018He makes a good president\u2019 \u2014 for some people. But I wasn\u2019t frightened really that he could bring the country to his knees because he knew nothing about how to govern.\u201dShe says she is no fan of the government and has little confidence it can solve the employment problems that come with a rapidly changing economy, which she blames on cold, impersonal decisions made by dollar-driven chief executives.\u201cIt\u2019s criminal what\u2019s happened to these people who had great jobs in Detroit, who worked in steel in Pittsburgh,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost respect for everything that doesn\u2019t make money.\u201d Or for jobs that don\u2019t require four-year college degrees, she added: \u201cThe janitor at my school, we called him \u2018Mr.\u2019\u201dPolitics have been at the periphery of Cher\u2019s life since the 1960s. Her first husband would become one of the country\u2019s most famous Republicans: Mr. Bono, who was the mayor of Palm Springs and a congressman for two terms until he died in a skiing accident in 1998.\u201cWhen Sonny and I were married, he was a Democrat,\u201d she said, recalling how thrilled he sounded after returning from the 1968 Democratic National Convention. \u201cHe said, \u2018Oh my God, Cher, I met this amazing guy McGovern,\u2019\u201d meaning George McGovern, the former senator from South Dakota, who ran for the Democratic nomination that year and lost.Cher did not expect much more than a tour that night. But she said that as she was downstairs in the White House basement looking at Mary Todd Lincoln\u2019s china collection, Amy Carter, the president\u2019s daughter, summoned her: \u201cAmy came down and said, \u2018Mama wants you to have dinner.\u2019\u201dI wondered, did she ever want to get in the game and run for office? \u201cNot even for a hot second,\u201d she assured me. She could never live with herself, she said, if she had to hold her tongue. \u201cIt would ruin me as a person.\u201dIn 1988, Cher publicly backed Michael Dukakis, who was not the only Dukakis she got to know. That year, she won an Oscar for her lead role in \u201cMoonstruck.\u201d Starring as Cher\u2019s mother in the film was Olympia Dukakis, Mr. Dukakis\u2019s cousin.Cher\u2019s support for Mrs. Clinton started with her Senate campaign and, later, in 2008 with her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination against Barack Obama.The similarities between the two women struck me as something that must have affected Cher. They are just a few years apart in age. Cher is 70. Mrs. Clinton is 68. They both triumphed in male-dominated professions and faced their own career humiliations and rebirths.But when I asked her about it, she wouldn\u2019t hear it. \u201cI have to stop you right there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s a woman does not \u2014 I don\u2019t care.\u201dWhen she was a child, she said, the idea of a female president was so foreign to the way she saw politics that she thought electing a woman might even be against the law. \u201cI\u2019m so blessed to be alive to see a woman president,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m so angry at the fact that I feel blessed \u2014 that it\u2019s not something that\u2019s natural.\u201d\u201cAnd even if they don\u2019t like Hillary, and many women don\u2019t,\u201d she added, they have to think to themselves \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to risk my children\u2019s future to this guy.\u201dDespite running in overlapping social circles for years \u2014 she and Mr. Trump were regulars in Aspen, Colo. \u2014 Cher said she has never met this man she has such disdain for. She said she would occasionally see him at Mezzaluna, a hot spot in Aspen that they both frequented. That cemented her opinion early on. \u201cI just thought, \u2018What an. \u2026\u201dShe stopped herself. She is trying not to use bad words anymore.An article last Sunday about Cher\u2019s political activism misstated the location of one of the Hillary Clinton\u2019s fund-raising events attended by the singer. It was held in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, not Miami Beach.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Hacking at Yahoo Means for Verizon", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the kind of phone call no chief executive wants to make \u2014 or receive \u2014 in the middle of a multibillion-dollar deal.But Ms. Mayer had some unexpected bad news. She caught up with Mr. McAdam and Marni Walden, a rising star at Verizon who is expected to oversee the Yahoo business after the deal is complete, by phone, according to people briefed on the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Yahoo recently discovered that at least 500 million of its user accounts had been breached by hackers two years ago, well before the two companies began talks. Yahoo and law enforcement officials were scrambling to unwind the intrusion.After calling Mr. McAdam and Ms. Walden, Ms. Mayer phoned Tim Armstrong, who leads the AOL business at Verizon and will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo, according to the people briefed on the conversation. Again, the news was not good.The calls set off a flurry of questions at Verizon \u2014 How could this possibly have happened? Who was behind it? Why is it only becoming known now? Could this jeopardize the deal? \u2014 but also the sounding of an alarm and the deployment of a triage team to assist Yahoo.The telecom giant directed its online security experts, including Chandra McMahon, Verizon\u2019s chief information security officer, to do their own investigation of the hack. And they enlisted the help of Verizon\u2019s security division, part of its enterprise solutions business, which helps companies defend against and manage hacks.Now, just a few days after Verizon learned of the breach, it is contending with the ramifications of what is believed to be the largest hack of a single company. Even as Verizon tries to assess the damage at Yahoo and prevent further security intrusions, the scope of the hack and the potential fallout \u2014 including the possibility of a costly class-action lawsuit \u2014 are inevitably prompting renewed scrutiny of a deal that was intended to transform the telecom behemoth into a digital media powerhouse.Simple tips to follow if you think your personal information online has been exposed to hackers.For now, Verizon has given no indication of whether the breach will affect its plans to acquire Yahoo. On Friday, the company declined to provide a comment beyond a statement it issued on Thursday, in which it said it would evaluate the situation \u201cas the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities.\u201dOn Friday, Yahoo said, \u201cOur investigation into this matter is ongoing and the issues are complex.\u201dThe effort is complicated because the sales proceedings between Verizon and Yahoo are at an early stage. Though teams from the two companies were already working together on integration plans, Verizon does not yet own Yahoo. As a result, Verizon does not have direct access to the Silicon Valley company\u2019s servers to conduct its own investigation.In late July, after the Verizon deal was announced, Yahoo became aware of a claim that about 280 million of its user credentials had been hacked, according to a person briefed on the specifics, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Yahoo started an investigation but could not substantiate the claim, this person said. It was not clear on Friday whether Yahoo had made Verizon aware that it was looking into this claim in July.During the course of that investigation, Yahoo learned of the more severe breach, which it has said it believes was state-sponsored. Yahoo has not yet said exactly when it realized how large the intrusion was, leaving open the question of whether Ms. Mayer and her team waited to notify Verizon of the hack. Yahoo is now working with outside security consultants and said its investigation was continuing.Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College Law School, said Verizon had two main options if it decided to use the hack as leverage in setting the terms of the deal.\u201cThey could say, \u2018This thing is huge. We want to walk away from the transaction,\u2019\u201d he said. Were Verizon to try to claim that the breach was so severe it was grounds to terminate the deal, it would have to prove that the hack amounted to a material adverse effect on the value of Yahoo.Such claims can be difficult to prove in court. According to Mr. Quinn\u2019s reading of the merger document for the deal, Verizon would most likely have to prove that certain high-level Yahoo employees were aware of the severity of the hack before the deal was agreed upon, and intentionally withheld that information.More likely, Mr. Quinn said, Verizon could pressure Yahoo to renegotiate the terms of the deal.\u201cThey go to court, or threaten to go to court, and renegotiate the price,\u201d he said. \u201cThat can be a very winning strategy.\u201dFind out which parts of your identity may have been stolen in major hacking attacks over the last four years.Like any big company contemplating an acquisition, Verizon performed due diligence on Yahoo before it agreed to the deal. It was not immediately clear, however, how seriously it took security issues during that process.But Verizon would have known that Yahoo has a history of breaches. In 2012, Yahoo said that more than 450,000 user accounts had been hacked.\u201cWith this concerted action and a series of high-profile strikes on businesses including eBay, Target and Yahoo, the risks of cyberattack are evident,\u201d they wrote.\u201cYet as the global economy recovers and deal activity rises,\u201d the report continues, \u201cincreasing awareness of cyber-risk has not resulted in meaningful changes\u201d to the mergers and acquisition process.Those motivations are unlikely to have changed in the course of two months. But it remains unclear whether this new information has made Yahoo a less desirable acquisition target.Some of Verizon\u2019s executives have indicated they may be up to the challenge of a big hack. In a recent talk at Penn State University, Ms. McMahon, the telecom company\u2019s chief information security officer, suggested that she relished the cat-and-mouse game between hackers and companies.Advertisement"}

And this colors our days, or rather bleeds them of color, reducing them to a single hue.We construct precisely contoured echo chambers of affirmation that turn conviction into zeal, passion into fury, disagreements with the other side into the demonization of it.\u2014 What is your reaction to this essay? Is Mr. Bruni right? Does your own social media feed give you a steady stream of information that is culturally and ideologically similar to your own?\u2014 Why might this lack of diversity matter? What are people missing if their social media and news sources are what Mr. Bruni calls \u201ca single hue\u201d?\u2014 How do you think this issue affects you personally? For example, during this contentious election season, has what you\u2019ve seen in your social and news feeds mostly validated and enforced the opinions you already held, or challenged them?\u2014 Mr. Bruni writes: \u201cBut that\u2019s not about a lopsided news feed. It\u2019s not about some sorcerer\u2019s algorithm.

{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s \u2018Fertility Day\u2019 Call to Make Babies Arouses Anger, Not Ardor", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 One ad pictured a woman holding an hourglass next to the words: \u201cBeauty has no age limit. Fertility does.\u201d Another portrayed a pair of baby shoes wrapped in a ribbon of the Italian flag. Yet another showed a man holding a half-burned cigarette: \u201cDon\u2019t let your sperm go up in smoke,\u201d it read.They were part of a government effort to promote \u201cFertility Day\u201d on Sept. 22, a campaign intended to encourage Italians to have more babies. Instead, the ads set off a furor, were denounced as being offensive, and within days were withdrawn.What they did succeed in doing, however, was to ignite a deeper and lasting debate about why it is that Italy has one of the lowest birthrates in the world, and what can be done about it.The problem is not a lack of desire to have children, critics of the campaign say, but rather the lack of meaningful support provided by the government and many employers in a country where the family remains the primary source of child care.\u201cI should be a model for their campaign, and I still feel very offended,\u201d said Vittoria Iacovella, 37, a journalist and mother of two girls, ages 10 and 8. \u201cThe government encourages us to have babies, and then the main welfare system in Italy is still the grandparents.\u201dMany working women, without an extended family to care for a child, face a dilemma, as private child care is expensive. Some also worry that their job security may be undermined by missing workdays because of child care issues. Many companies do not offer flexible hours for working mothers.Not surprisingly, Italy\u2019s long slowdown in childbirth has coincided with its recent economic slump. But Italian families have been shrinking for decades.By contrast, in France, the economy has been flat, too, but a family-oriented system provides a far more generous social safety net that includes day care and subsidies for families to have children. There, women have two children each on average.\u201cOn paper, Italian women have equal rights,\u201d said Tiziana Bartolini, the editor of Noi Donne, one of Italy\u2019s most prominent feminist magazines. \u201cBut reality tells us a different story. Women are expected to care for children. If they live in regions where services are good, or in small towns, they keep their job. If they live in big, chaotic cities and have no family nearby, they are very prudent about becoming pregnant.\u201cOr they stop working,\u201d she added.The Ministry of Health began the fertility campaign on Aug. 31 with a group of online advertisements and a hashtag on Twitter. The goal was to publicize a series of public meetings on Fertility Day and encourage Italians to have more children.Yeah, sure, thought Maria Scioli, 41, a teacher who depends on her family to care for her 15-month-old boy, when she spotted the debate on her Facebook page.\u201cI\u2019d love to have a second child,\u201d Ms. Scioli said, \u201cbut my job situation worries me. And I even feel lucky. I think about all those women my age or younger that couldn\u2019t have babies and had to watch that offensive ad.\u201dEven Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose own health minister started the campaign, distanced himself from the ads in a radio interview, noting ironically that none of his friends \u201chad their kids after seeing an advert.\u201dMr. Renzi said that to increase the birthrate, structural issues like day care and services needed to be addressed.Under Mr. Renzi, Italy\u2019s government has tried to help families with a so-called baby bonus of 80 to 160 euros, or about $90 to $180, for low- and middle-income households, and it has approved labor laws giving more flexibility on parental leave. But Italy allocates only 1 percent of its gross domestic product to social protection benefits \u2014 half the European average. One child out of three here is at risk of relative poverty.\u201cItaly has a terrible combination: low birthrate, low women\u2019s employment and high risk of child poverty,\u201d said Alessandro Rosina, a professor of demography at Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan. \u201cOn this path, Italy can only but have increasing costs for aging people, and increased public debt.\u201d\u201cWe defend our present, but can\u2019t design the future,\u201d Professor Rosina said.\u201cSo many young women are even asked to presign a resignation letter here, especially in small companies,\u201d said Teresa Potenza, a longtime women\u2019s advocate in Naples, referring to a practice in which some women are asked to sign a resignation letter in case of pregnancy before they are hired. \u201cEven to all those women, that campaign is a punch to the gut.\u201d\u201cWithout the \u2018family welfare,\u2019 I would have never been able to have children myself,\u201d Ms. Potenza said.Ms. Iacovella, the journalist, said her child\u2019s kindergarten closed two hours before she got off work and noted that working mothers \u201care frustrated by the little help that Italy gives to women.\u201dShe was so offended by the government advertisements that she vented her anger on Facebook soon after they started appearing, and her comments went viral online.Italy\u2019s health minister, Beatrice Lorenzin, responding on Facebook, wrote that the Fertility Day campaign was not a \u201ccall to reproduction\u201d but a day to discuss \u201cthe fertility issues that 15 percent of Italians deal with.\u201d She promptly canceled the campaign.\u201cI am saddened that the launch of the advertising campaign misled many people,\u201d Ms. Lorenzin said. \u201cI withdrew it to change it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lesson of Tesla Crashes? Computer Vision Can\u2019t Do It All Yet", "Date": "2016-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJitendra Malik, a researcher in computer vision for three decades, doesn\u2019t own a Tesla, but he has advice for people who do.\u201cKnowing what I know about computer vision, I wouldn\u2019t take my hands off the steering wheel,\u201d he said.The Tesla accident in May, researchers say, was not a failure of computer vision. But it underscored the limitations of the science in applications like driverless cars despite remarkable progress in recent years, fueled by digital data, computer firepower and software inspired by the human brain.Researchers are training computers to recognize actions and behaviors.Today, computerized sight can quickly and accurately recognize millions of individual faces, identify the makes and models of thousands of cars, and distinguish cats and dogs of every breed in a way no human being could.Yet the recent advances, while impressive, have been mainly in image recognition. The next frontier, researchers agree, is general visual knowledge \u2014 the development of algorithms that can understand not just objects, but also actions and behaviors.Computing intelligence often seems to mimic human intelligence, so computer science understandably invites analogy. In computer vision, researchers offer two analogies to describe the promising paths ahead: a child and the brain.The model borrowed from childhood, many researchers say, involves developing algorithms that learn as a child does, with some supervision but mostly on its own, without relying on vast amounts of hand-labeled training data, which is the current approach. \u201cIt\u2019s early days,\u201d Dr. Malik said, \u201cbut it\u2019s how we get to the next level.\u201dIn computing, the brain has served mainly as an inspirational metaphor rather than an actual road map. Airplanes don\u2019t flap their wings, artificial intelligence experts often say. Machines do it differently than biological systems.If successful, the outcome could be a breakthrough in computer vision and machine learning in general, Dr. Poggio said. \u201cTo do that,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need neuroscience not just as an inspiration, but as a strong light.\u201dThe big gains in computer vision owe much to all the web\u2019s raw material: countless millions of online photos used to train the software algorithms to identify images. But collecting and tagging that training data have been a formidable undertaking.ImageNet, a collaborative effort led by researchers at Stanford and Princeton, is one of the most ambitious projects. Initially, nearly one billion images were downloaded. Those were sorted, labeled and winnowed to more than 14 million images in 22,000 categories. The database, for example, includes more than 62,000 images of cats.Vast image databases like ImageNet have been employed to train software that uses neuron-like nodes, known as neural networks. The concept of computing neural networks stretches back more than three decades, but has become a powerful tool only in recent years. \u201cThe available data and computational capability finally caught up to these ideas of the past,\u201d said Trevor Darrell, a computer vision expert at the University of California, Berkeley.Just how far neural networks can advance computer vision is uncertain. They emulate the brain only in general terms \u2014 the software nodes receive digital input and send output to other nodes. Layers upon layers of these nodes make up so-called convolutional neural networks, which, with sufficient training data, have become better and better at identifying images.Or take a fluid scene like a dinner party. A person carrying a platter will serve food. A woman raising a fork will stab the lettuce on her plate and put it in her mouth. A water glass teetering on the edge of the table is about to fall, spilling its contents. Predicting what happens next and understanding the physics of everyday life are inherent in human visual intelligence, but beyond the reach of current deep learning technology.Recognizing situations enriches computer vision, but the ImSitu project still depends on human-labeled data to train its machine learning algorithms. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still very, very far from visual intelligence, understanding scenes and actions the way humans do,\u201d Dr. Farhadi said.\u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but the pace of improvement is getting us there,\u201d said Gary Bradski, a computer vision scientist who has worked on self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait years and years until some semblance of intelligence arrives, before we have self-driving cars that are safer than human drivers and save thousands of lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Off the Cuff, but on the Record", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Public EditorSuppose you\u2019re at a conference. The panels and keynotes and forums have broken up, and you head off to get a drink with a handful of attendees. Are you on the record?Suki Kim, a New York Times best-selling author, found herself in such a situation when she attended a book festival in Brisbane, Australia, over the weekend. After listening to a controversial keynote address on racial and cultural identity, Kim and a few other authors retreated to a small room in the hotel for what was billed by the conference hosts as an \u201cartist-only\u201d private conversation over cocktails.Kim says she knew Nordland was a journalist (she considers herself a journalist as well) but she says she had no idea they were having an on-the-record conversation for a story. They were at a book festival, after all, one exclusively for authors, and Nordland never mentioned he planned to write an article for The Times.That\u2019s Kim\u2019s version of events. But the more interesting fact is that\u2019s Nordland\u2019s version too.I spoke to both of them by phone after Kim wrote to the public editor\u2019s office Tuesday, angry that she had been quoted by name in the story.\u201cThis is so unethical. It\u2019s not acceptable what he did,\u201d Kim said from Seoul, South Korea. \u201cI would never talk about another writer in public. It\u2019s so ungenerous and tacky.\u201dNordland agrees about the circumstances of their meeting: it was authors only, in a hotel room, with eight to 10 people. But Nordland insists that because Kim knew he was a journalist, she should have had an expectation that the conversation was on the record. He also says that at the time of their conversation, he didn\u2019t have any plans to write a story about the conference.\u201cI don\u2019t consider that kind of stuff off limits,\u201d Nordland told me from London. \u201cI\u2019ve been in many social situations and someone might say, \u2018By the way, that\u2019s off the record.\u2019 She didn\u2019t say that.\u201dI found Kim\u2019s argument and perspective compelling and asked Phil Corbett, the editor who oversees issues of ethics and standards for the newsroom whether Nordland had complied with newsroom policy in this circumstance. Here\u2019s his reply:Our normal practice is for reporters to identify themselves when they are reporting. But in this case, Rod didn\u2019t go to the event expecting to write a story \u2014 he only realized later that there was a potentially interesting story here. That\u2019s not so unusual \u2014 good reporters often find stories that they didn\u2019t set out intending to cover. In this case, it led to an unfortunate misunderstanding or clash of expectations. In the ideal world, that wouldn\u2019t happen. In retrospect, it may well have been better to circle back to Suki Kim directly to interview her on the topic. On the other hand, as I understand it, this was a hotel room full of people, and she apparently was aware that Rod was a journalist. So I\u2019m not sure how much expectation of privacy there could reasonably be.That seems like a stretch to me in this case. I believe Kim did have an expectation of privacy at this \u201cartists-only,\u201d \u201cprivate\u201d gathering \u2014 as the literature promoting the event described it. She was discussing books with a man she knew was an author and journalist, just like her. And there was no mention of any story.Kim is insisting, unsuccessfully, that the quote be removed.Disagreements between sources quoted in stories arise with some regularity in newsrooms. They are difficult to sort out and take any action on because it quickly turns into one person\u2019s recollection against another\u2019s. What\u2019s unusual about this case is the agreement over the circumstances \u2014 Nordland acknowledges he didn\u2019t ask to quote Kim or mention any story.That strikes me as outside the bounds of good journalistic practice. If Nordland didn\u2019t know until the next day that he intended to write a story, he should have gone back to Kim and asked whether she was willing to be quoted. Or he should have quoted what she said the previous day at the event captured on video for the general public \u2014 the version that didn\u2019t attack an individual author.I believe editors should speak to Nordland and make clear that his approach did not meet Times standards and was not good journalistic practice.I also believe a note should be attached to the piece saying that a portion of Kim\u2019s remarks were inappropriately obtained at a private event. Unfortunately for Kim, at this point in the publication cycle it probably makes no sense to remove the passage.That\u2019s too bad, because Kim had every expectation of privacy, and didn\u2019t get it.An earlier version of this article incorrectly dated the public event that Suki Kim spoke at. It was the day before the private party, not the day after.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SpaceX Rocket Explodes at Launchpad in Cape Canaveral", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA spectacular explosion of a SpaceX rocket on Thursday destroyed a $200 million communications satellite that would have extended Facebook\u2019s reach across Africa, dealing a serious setback to Elon Musk, the billionaire who runs the rocket company.The blast is likely to disrupt NASA\u2019s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station, exposing the risks of the agency\u2019s growing reliance on private companies like SpaceX to carry materials and, soon, astronauts.The explosion, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., intensified questions about whether Mr. Musk is moving too quickly in his headlong investment in some of the biggest and most complex industries, not just space travel but carmakers and electric utilities.\u201cSpaceX is running a punishing schedule,\u201d said Scott Pace, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a former NASA official.\u201cThere is probably some human factor involved here. To what extent was human error part of this? And if so, why? Are you running your people too hard? What are your safety requirements?\u201dDr. Pace said an internal investigation would have to look at the company\u2019s operations as it tried to ramp up the pace of launches.The company\u2019s president, Gwynne Shotwell, said in a statement, \u201cOur No. 1 priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, and we will carefully investigate and address this issue.\u201cThe Falcon 9 rocket burst into flames in a violent series of blasts starting at 9:07 a.m., spewing plumes of dark smoke around the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and sending vibrations felt by residents nearby.The rocket had been set to launch on Saturday, carrying a satellite for Spacecom, an Israeli company.From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur\u2019s many companies.The explosion was particularly painful news for Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is touring Kenya, promoting a program reliant on the satellite, known as Amos-6, with entrepreneurs in the country. He had promised them connectivity.The Falcon 9, developed by SpaceX with NASA financing, has had previous problems. In June 2015, a rocket carrying NASA cargo to the International Space Station fell apart in-flight when a strut holding a helium bottle snapped, setting off a chain of events that destroyed the rocket moments later. This latest episode is likely to push back the timetable NASA had after hiring SpaceX and Boeing to carry astronauts to the space station by the end of next year.NASA said it was too soon to say how the explosion would affect its space station operations, asserting that it remained \u201cconfident\u201d in its commercial partners. \u201cToday\u2019s incident \u2014 while it was not a NASA launch \u2014 is a reminder that spaceflight is an incredible challenge, but our partners learn from each success and setback,\u201d the agency said.SpaceX\u2019s next cargo mission to the space station is scheduled for November.Coincidentally on Thursday, a report released by NASA\u2019s inspector general, Paul K. Martin, said SpaceX and Boeing were likely to face additional delays in their launch schedules anyway.Launches with crews will probably not lift off before the second half of 2018, three years later than planned, the inspector general said.Changes that SpaceX is making to the design of the capsule, to allow landing in water instead of on land, are causing the latest delays, Mr. Martin said. In addition, NASA has been slow in examining safety reviews submitted by the companies, and as a result, late and costly redesigns might be needed, Mr. Martin said.Space industry experts say that Mr. Musk faces risks in balancing SpaceX\u2019s backlog of contracts \u2014 spanning the next few years \u2014 without cutting corners to stay on the company\u2019s busy schedule.SpaceX had hoped for 18 rocket launches this year; so far, eight have occurred. Over all, SpaceX has had 27 successful launches of Falcon 9 rockets.An episode like Thursday\u2019s is rare. Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., who tracks rocket history, said the last time such an explosion happened on a Cape Canaveral launchpad, before the ignition of engines for liftoff, was in 1959.SpaceX is rebuilding a separate launchpad, one of the two formerly used for NASA\u2019s space shuttle missions, for the astronaut launches. That launchpad is scheduled to be ready by the end of the year.Business analysts were mixed on the effects of the explosion on Mr. Musk\u2019s other investments at a time when he is under considerable financial pressure with the planned merger of Tesla and SolarCity.Mr. Musk draws vocal admirers and detractors, some of whom are \u201cshort\u201d investors betting that Tesla cannot execute on its business plan.Trip Chowdry, a senior analyst at Global Equities Research who studies Tesla\u2019s performance, described Mr. Musk\u2019s situation as a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d\u201cWhen things work out well, people believe Musk to be a superstar,\u201d Mr. Chowdry said. But when things go wrong like an explosion at a separate company, Tesla investors tend to make more general inferences, too.\u201cWhen all is said and done, does it have any impact on Tesla stock? No,\u201d he said. \u201cBut events at SpaceX do create headline risk for Tesla stockholders.\u201dThe demise of the satellite, called Amos-6, puts a significant damper on Facebook\u2019s Internet.org initiative, a grand plan spearheaded by Mr. Zuckerberg to provide wireless connectivity to nations across the world that do not otherwise have easy internet access.On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg struck an upbeat tone in his post about the rocket failure, noting that the company has other strategies in the works to expand internet connectivity across the world. Aquila, the Facebook-built drone, he noted, recently undertook its first successful flight in the desert.Still, the setback will delay Facebook\u2019s ambitious plans and even more ambitious timetable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Serial Killer\u2019s Co-Author", "Date": "2016-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotebookBy the time Katherine Ramsland and I stopped at the Copper Oven Cafe and Bakery in the Indian Hills Shopping Center in Wichita, Kan., it was well past lunchtime. It was June 2015, and Ramsland, a professor of forensic psychology and prolific author, was in this sedate city to wind up the last bit of research on \u201cConfession of a Serial Killer,\u201d her book about Dennis Rader, which was published this month by University Press of New England. She wore jean capris and a T-shirt and carried a favorite handbag, made of a soft black cloth and decorated with skulls.That morning, we had begun a tour of the seven places where Rader murdered his 10 victims, the so-called kill sites. Ramsland had already had one final look at the stash of thousands of pieces of Rader\u2019s correspondence that Jim Thompson, the lawyer representing the victims\u2019 families, kept in his office. She was still hoping to get clearance to visit Rader, now 70, in El Dorado Maximum Security Prison, where he has been serving 10 consecutive life sentences since his arrest in 2005.At the Copper Oven Cafe, the petite 62-year-old grew tired of my questions about why she studied these horrifying crimes. She reached across the table, grabbed my notebook and quickly sketched the two hands in Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cCreation of Adam.\u201d She spun the notebook around and pointed to the space between them. She was \u201cinterested in everything that is unseen,\u201d she said.What Ramsland, the director of the master\u2019s program in criminal justice at DeSales University, means by \u201cunseen\u201d is the near undefinable process by which an apparently ordinary young person, in this case Rader (a.k.a. the \u201cBind, Torture, Kill\u201d murderer, or \u201cB.T.K.\u201d), becomes a serial killer. Although Ramsland regularly talked to Rader on the phone and had corresponded with him for years, she hoped that a visit might provide additional insight into his ghoulish imagination. Later, in an email, she mentioned to me that there was a special \u201ccreep factor\u201d to the choice of Copper Oven Cafe as our meeting site: It was right across the street from the house of Vicki Wegerle, whom Rader murdered in 1986. In fact, she informed me, Rader \u201cprepared for the assault in the parking lot,\u201d putting on a hard hat to pretend he was a phone repairman.Rader is famous for how long he evaded capture, living a normal life for three decades before his arrest in 2005. Many books have already been written about the grisly string of crimes he committed in Kansas from 1974 to 1991. But \u201cConfession\u201d stands out as the first that takes the form of a collaboration with the serial killer. Unlike many crime books, it does not merely speculate about a predator\u2019s deranged thoughts and schemes but rather plunges the reader into them, revealing in remarkable detail how a well-known serial killer at the end of his life sees himself. Ramsland\u2019s rationale in undertaking this unusual project was to overturn what she sees as clich\u00e9s about serial killers, thereby deglamorizing them and better protecting the public from their depredations. And yet the project raises a host of intellectual and ethical questions \u2014 including whether it\u2019s possible to uncover the whole truth about these horrifying crimes, and what might be the cost of letting killers tell their own stories.Ramsland\u2019s career has been an unusual one. In her day job at DeSales, she oversees the master\u2019s degree in the criminal-justice program that offers classes in criminology, ethics, forensics, criminal justice and criminal law. But she also has an astonishingly prolific sideline as a popular author, writing some 59 books on a variety of macabre subjects, including ghosts and ghost hunters. In the early 1990s, she broke out with two biographies of genre writers who specialized in depicting fictional monsters: \u201cPrism of the Night,\u201d an authorized biography of Anne Rice, and later \u201cDean Koontz: A Writer\u2019s Biography,\u201d about the best-selling horror writer. Since then, she has often written multiple nonfiction books per year, a number of them in the true-crime genre, with titles like \u201cInto the Devil\u2019s Den\u201d (about an F.B.I. informant who went undercover among white supremacists), \u201cDarkest Waters\u201d (about serial killers in the Great Lakes states) and \u201cThe Murder Game\u201d (about murder in Michigan, specifically). She has collaborated with other forensic psychologists and F.B.I. profilers, dug up cold cases, exploited new angles or missed clues.Even within her oeuvre of murderabilia, \u201cConfession of a Serial Killer\u201d stands out. Composed of roughly 80 percent of Rader\u2019s words and 20 percent Ramsland\u2019s commentary, it is a murderer\u2019s \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d obsessed with Knausgaardian minutiae, including mistakes in the police report and biographies. One of the book\u2019s scoops is that Rader planned to kill many more people than he actually did, and he specifically describes stalking an 11th victim. Equally unsettling, for people familiar with the case, is reading the accounts of the murders Rader committed from his perspective. It has long been believed that he put a chair in the bedroom of one victim, Joseph Otero, purely for the purposes of watching him die; Rader denies this, though he claims not to remember the actual reason, saying it might have been to prevent Otero from \u201crolling off the bed.\u201d Rader also claims that he drank a glass of water in every house in which he killed someone, then cleaned it and put it back in the cupboard. He describes turning up the thermostat in each home, because he read that doing so could impede a medical examiner\u2019s attempt to determine a victim\u2019s time of death.The C.S.I.-worthy level of detail makes \u201cConfession\u201d more chilling than the same story told \u2014 as it already has been \u2014 from the point of view of the heroic cop, the celebrity F.B.I. profiler, the local lawyer, the priest (who believed Rader was possessed), the work colleague unaware of his secret identity or the victim\u2019s family member envisioning a conspiracy. Seeing things through Rader\u2019s eyes is indeed a stranger vantage point than all of those. The oddness of his language \u2014 his fractured diction and superhero jargon (Ramsland includes a glossary) sets it further apart. Serial killers are \u201cMinotaurs.\u201d \u201cFactor X\u201d is Rader\u2019s drive to kill. \u201cCubing\u201d is the extreme compartmentalization that he used to perpetuate his double life. \u201cD.T.P.G.\u201d stands for \u201cDeath to pretty girls.\u201dYears before she started studying serial killers, Ramsland wrote her Ph.D. dissertation on Soren Kierkegaard, the \u201cfather\u201d of existentialism. She sees Kierkegaard as informing her most controversial idea in \u201cConfession\u201d \u2014 that some serial killers are more like the rest of us than common wisdom tells us. In the annals of serial killers, Rader is hardly the only one who held down a facade of normalcy while hunting his prey, but he managed it far longer than many others. There are many qualities, Ramsland writes, that ordinary people share with so-called monsters: \u201coverestimating our willpower, idealizing ourselves, daydreaming about power, indulging in secret behaviors that keep attracting us, deceiving others and keeping secrets.\u201d She believes that all of us should lock our doors at night.Ramsland next had to gain Rader\u2019s trust, which she did by writing him a letter expressing her interest and listing her credentials. She apparently impressed him. Soon Ramsland and Rader were corresponding, mostly by mail. \u201cHe\u2019ll slip into the third person, as Ted Bundy sometimes did,\u201d Ramsland said. Sometimes his letters would start with elaborate fake monograms, \u201cFrom the desk of Dennis Rader.\u201d Sometimes he would spend days on a single letter to her. His correspondence could sometimes run to more than 30 pages, composed in a tiny, scratchy hand. They played chess by mail, sending each other their moves. Rader once said, \u201cDon\u2019t cheat,\u201d Ramsland recalled with a snort, adding in a half-mock-outraged aside: \u201cYou\u2019re a freakin\u2019 serial killer. I\u2019ll cheat if I want to!\u201dOne question people often ask about this unusual collaboration is whether Rader profits from it. He doesn\u2019t, Ramsland explained. In the past 40 years, so-called Son of Sam laws \u2014 named after David Berkowitz, who considered selling his story to great outrage in 1977 \u2014 have prevented a number of murderers from making money from their stories. In 2005, Thompson worried that Son of Sam laws did not go far enough: They varied from state to state, and a 1991 court ruling had found them to be too broad and possibly unconstitutional. So Thompson and his then co-counsel, Mark Hutton, drew up a contract that gave the families of the victims 75 percent of the profits of all media rights. The current contract, though slightly different, is similarly generous. (Sony has already optioned a TV series.)Another question \u201cConfession\u201d has raised is about Rader\u2019s veracity in his comments and how much it matters whether what he recounts is true. Through her daughter, Rader\u2019s ex-wife, Paula Rader, contested two claims Rader makes in the book, particularly his accusation that she knew he was killing people while they were married. And several people who worked on the case have criticized Ramsland for giving Rader a platform, allowing him to portray himself as an evil genius.Ramsland has responded to these objections by saying that she is seeking to show readers how a serial killer really thinks: lies, exaggerations and all. But she is also acutely aware that Rader \u2014 who, from early on, played to the media and tried to exploit it \u2014 is looking to make an impression with their book. Although books are not allowed in El Dorado, he has nonetheless been making bookplates to send to pen pals who buy the book. He somehow got a hold of a photo of the cover, which is red, with the title superimposed on a photo of a coil of rope, to suggest strangling, his method of choice. He liked the design.But Ramsland thinks we\u2019re kidding ourselves if we think we can tell the Raders from the civilians just by looking. Rader\u2019s outward life was one of normalcy: He served in the Air Force, attended community college, married and had children. He held a variety of jobs \u2014 in a supermarket, a factory, for ADT Security Services and the city. He attended Christ Lutheran Church, where he became president of the church council. He was a Cub Scout leader.I had watched Rader\u2019s confession on YouTube, and I liked to think that I would have known he was a psychopath if I met him. He talked about himself in the third person, answering the judge\u2019s questions with phrases like \u201cIf you know anything about serial killers. \u2026\u201d As he used the phrase \u201cput him down\u201d to describe killing Joseph Otero, he appeared to be shrugging and twitching; I wondered if he spoke that way ordinarily, and if so, what his wife and children made of it.When I mentioned my thoughts to Ramsland, though, she disagreed that people who knew Rader could have connected the dots. Why would they? To the contrary, one reason Ramsland believes that Rader was able to keep his cover was that \u201che grew up in a Germanic Midwestern family where there was not a lot of emotion. Like my family.\u201dWe reached Holcomb around noon. We drove by the Valley View Cemetery, stopping briefly to find the Clutter family headstones. Then we headed through town to Oak Street, where the notorious Clutter farmhouse still stood. We parked at the end of the muddy driveway and got out of the car. We could see the two-story building set back on a long, flat parcel of land, the top floor in gray-white siding, the bottom a dull yellow brick. The house seemed so ordinary that it was hard to believe that something so horrible happened there. I looked to see what Ramsland\u2019s next move would be, but a do-not-trespass sign discouraged her from going any further. The branches of the Chinese elms bowed as the sky darkened.Advertisement"}

Trump made it local.When Lester Holt, the debate\u2019s moderator, said stop-and-frisk had been ruled unconstitutional in New York for singling out black and Hispanic young men, Mr. Trump objected, saying that the case had been taken away from the judge who issued that ruling.Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, appealed the judge\u2019s ruling, but when Mayor Bill de Blasio took office, he repudiated the policy and dropped the appeal.Mrs. Clinton retorted that under Mr. de Blasio, crime had continued to drop, to which Mr. Trump said: \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201dAs expected, there was also a nod to the explosion in Chelsea, during the segment on national security.

She plans to print the portraits on used military uniforms that have been transformed by hand into paper.\u201cWhen you think of a veteran, you see a male image,\u201d Ms. Rochielle said. The artists\u2019 work, she hopes, will change that perception.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Scorns TV Networks. For Once, They Return the Favor.", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySimmering tension between Donald J. Trump and the television networks that cover him entered an extraordinary new phase on Friday, as a consortium of news executives refused to participate in a media session with Mr. Trump after his aides barred a producer from attending.In a quickly arranged conference call, the network bureau chiefs who oversee the pooled television coverage of Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, agreed to forgo coverage of a tour of his new luxury hotel in Washington, declining the access because the Trump campaign would allow in only a cameraman, and not a reporter or producer who could ask questions of the candidate.It was an unusual show of solidarity by a television news industry that has profited handsomely from Mr. Trump\u2019s success, even as its journalists have been routinely taunted and confounded by a candidate with a penchant for lies and bullying.But Friday also brought perhaps the news media\u2019s most ignominious moment yet.Mr. Trump extracted nearly an hour of uninterrupted airtime from the cable news networks to promote his hotel, after promising a major revelation and a news conference about his views on President Obama\u2019s birthplace. In a break from typical practice, the networks televised the speeches of supporters who were introducing Mr. Trump, a privilege rarely granted during appearances by the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.\u201cWe got played,\u201d CNN\u2019s John King said afterward on the air, a moment of unusual candor that echoed the frustration and self-flagellation of many journalists in television news.The episode capped a bizarre week in which Mr. Trump\u2019s slights of the news media seemed to build by the hour.On Thursday, Mr. Trump began a rally in New Hampshire before the arrival of the journalists who travel with him, and then he took delight in the fact that they had missed much of his appearance.Once a fixture of political talk shows who relished jousting with the news media, Mr. Trump has turned more cautious: He has not held a news conference since July 27. This week, he instead sat for chummy interviews with the daytime host Dr. Mehmet Oz and the \u201cTonight Show\u201d host Jimmy Fallon, whose playful mussing of the candidate\u2019s famed combover was widely circulated in photos and videos on the internet.The hotel tour on Friday was expected to take place immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance, but aides to Mr. Trump told an ABC News producer, Candace Smith, that she could not attend. (Networks rotate responsibility for pooled footage of a presidential candidate, and it is distributed broadly.)\u201cOur editorial team member was barred from going on the tour with a videographer,\u201d Bryan Boughton, Fox News\u2019s Washington bureau chief and the current chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s television press pool, said in a statement. \u201cThe TV pool traditionally doesn\u2019t participate in events that our reporters or producers are not allowed to attend.\u201dThough the networks\u2019 move on Friday might have amounted to a minor revolt of sorts, it was not clear if it would prove a turning point or merely a circumstantial blip. Representatives of the television networks on Friday were quick to note that the pooling decision had been made collectively, not by a single channel.Mr. Trump also remains a significant ratings draw at a moment of challenges for the television news industry, which is struggling to retain viewers against digital competition like Facebook.Barring another dust-up with his traveling press corps, Mr. Trump\u2019s next major clash with the political news media could come on Sept. 26 during the first debate, which is expected to draw tens of millions of viewers.On \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d Mr. Trump said the debates should have no moderator, with just the candidates addressing each other. He said that the NBC anchor chosen to handle the debate, Lester Holt, \u201cis going to hammer me, and I think that\u2019s not the right thing to do.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re trying to make it so that Lester is going to come out and be really tough on me,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Fallon. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfair.\u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting.videovideoAdvertisement"}

And for good reason: To swing most elections, dozens or hundreds of fraudsters would have to conspire to commit easily detected felonies at polling places on behalf of their favored candidate.\u201cIt is a shameful falsehood, given the extremely low rates of voter fraud in the U.S., especially the kind of fraud targeted by Republican voter ID laws,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt undermines faith in the fairness of the electoral process, which is the bedrock of all functioning democracies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worst of the Trumps", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a presidential campaign often inhabits the gutter it\u2019s not easy to establish its low point.We\u2019ve seen Donald Trump vilify Muslims, Mexicans and women. We\u2019ve seen him indulge airy suggestions that rifle-bearing Americans might like to shoot Hillary Clinton. We\u2019ve seen him belabor the lie that President Obama was not born in the United States \u2014 until he recanted. For Trump, the low road to the White House is paved with boorishness. But perhaps his son Donald Trump Jr. set the nadir this week when he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles.A caption accompanying a photograph of the candy said: \u201cIf I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That\u2019s our Syrian refugee problem.\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted, \u201cThis image says it all.\u201dWhere to begin? With the fact that human beings are not Skittles? With the fact that after more than five years of war 4.8 million Syrians are refugees and 6.1 million are internally displaced and Trump Jr., even with his coddled New York existence, can surely make the calculation that this amounts to almost 2.5 million more human beings than live in the five boroughs?With the fact that you do not flee your home because you have a choice (like choosing between Skittles and M&Ms after a Manhattan dinner party) but because you no longer have one? With the fact that, according to a Cato Institute study of refugees admitted to the United States between 1975 and 2015, the chance of an American being killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion? With the fact that Syrians want to work, make a living, put their kids in decent schools, and recover their dignity, just like the rest of us?Or perhaps with the fact that comparing Syrians to Skittles carries echoes of the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher comparing Jews to mushrooms in a popular children\u2019s book that posited the ticklish dilemma of how to distinguish poisonous toadstools from edible fungus; and has a mother saying to her son Franz:\u201cYes, my child! Just as a single poisonous mushroom can kill a whole family, so a solitary Jew can destroy a whole village, a whole city, even an entire Volk.\u201dWe all know, even the Trumps know, that the door into the United States was closed to desperate European Jews trying to escape the Holocaust.If I may be pardoned for extending an awful analogy, I\u2019d suggest to the Trumps that a better caption would read: \u201cIf I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three of them would turn out to be Sergey Brin, Elon Musk and Pierre Omidyar, would you take a handful?\u201dThe co-founder of Google, co-founder of Tesla, and founder of eBay were all immigrants. Steve Jobs\u2019 biological father was a Syrian immigrant. In fact, earlier this year, the National Foundation for American Policy found that 51 percent of the country\u2019s start-up companies valued at over $1 billion had at least one immigrant founder. A study by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a coalition of governors and business leaders, found that in 2013 more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies, including seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable brands, were started by immigrants or their children.The strength of the United States is its creative churn. In contrast to European states, it is hard-wired to reinvention through immigration. When Trump traffics in fear about immigrants, whether Muslim or Mexican, he guts America of its greatness and turns his back on its singular idea.The American response to the Syrian crisis has been paltry \u2014 almost 12,000 refugees admitted since the war began, or 0.25 percent of the total. Part of the slowness has come from the rigor of the vetting process. But what do the Trumps care? They are concerned with just one message: Muslim equals danger.Let\u2019s see now. Trump\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was a German immigrant. He arrived in the United States in October 1885. For decades, the family lied: They said he hailed from Sweden. In his book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump says his grandfather \u201ccame here from Sweden as a child.\u201d The family historian, John Walter, explained that Trump\u2019s father, Fred, \u201chad a lot of Jewish tenants and it wasn\u2019t a good thing to be German in those days.\u201dMake up stories: It\u2019s the Trump way. So here was a German-American posing as a Swedish-American opting not to rent to African-Americans.Friedrich Trump, the immigrant, was young. He was penniless. He came not from Sweden but from Bismarck\u2019s recently formed nation state in the middle of a turbulent Europe. A U.S. immigration officer allowed him into the United States in 1885 \u2014 not a decision without risk.But an American decision taken in the spirit the Trumps now trample with cavalier untruth and vile innuendo.Advertisement"}

But the police use of force \u2014 sometimes lethal \u2014 against those with diminished mental capacity is distressingly common. The experts and advocates say that while training and practices have improved in the last generation, officers in many agencies still receive little or no education in how to recognize and deal with people who may not behave rationally.\u201cThere are hundreds of thousands of times when officers are helpful, but far too often, people in crisis end up being Tasered, beaten, arrested and even shot, and a lot of families are very scared to call the police, knowing something like that can happen,\u201d said Laura Usher, criminal justice and advocacy manager at the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\u201cThe underlying problem is there aren\u2019t enough crisis services so people turn instead to 911, but there also needs to be a lot more police training.\u201dThe tactics can involve the officer keeping a distance, coaxing rather than commanding, and maintaining a quiet, conversational tone of voice.\u201cYelling commands at someone who\u2019s agitated and maybe delusional is not going to help,\u201d said Jim Bueermann, the president of the Police Foundation, a policy research group, and a former police chief in Redlands, Calif.We\u2019d like to hear from female police officers about how being a woman plays out while in the line of duty.\u201cThat way, when you have a group of two, three, four officers on the scene, one of them is going to be a C.I.T. officer, and that officer is going to be the leader,\u201d said Sam Cochran, the former chief of the crisis intervention team in Memphis, which pioneered the approach in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the subject\u2019s safety; it\u2019s about the officer\u2019s safety.\u201dMore than 3,000 state and local law enforcement agencies have created similar teams of varying strengths, out of about 18,000 forces nationwide, said Mr. Cochran, a consultant to agencies around the country. \u201cWe still have a tremendous amount that is lacking,\u201d he said.It is a lot to demand from officers that they know how and when to alternate between aggressiveness and a gentler approach, but it is necessary, said Hassan Aden, a former police chief in Greenville, N.C., and the senior adviser on policing at the Vera Institute of Justice, a research and advocacy group.\u201cWe see these situations where a family member calls the police, and the situation, once the police arrive, turns into a deadly force situation,\u201d he said. \u201cDe-escalation training is something that every officer \u2014 every officer \u2014 should get.\u201dAdvocates and law enforcement agencies commonly cite an estimate that at least one in 10 calls to the police involves a person experiencing some sort of mental health crisis or diminished capacity.Even when a department provides advanced training, advocates say, there are many places where the system can break down. Callers to 911 do not always make it clear that a person\u2019s behavior might indicate mental illness; emergency dispatchers do not always communicate the information to the officers headed to the scene; and those officers do not always call for a crisis intervention officer, even when one is available.\u201cCalling in the C.I.T. should always be the first choice,\u201d Ms. Usher said, but merely having the team is not enough. \u201cThe key is that every officer has enough awareness to recognize when there might be a mental health issue involved, and to call for specialized backup.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hopes Rise That Staten Island\u2019s Young Eagle Is a Native New Yorker", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI had to change lenses and, of course, I missed him,\u201d said Mr. Pugliares, 52, a stenography instructor who has taken thousands of photos of eagles. \u201cBut we met again and again and again.\u201dOnce considered rare, bald eagles have become increasingly common along New York City\u2019s waterways over the last few years. Seven to 10 of the birds are thought to live on Staten Island, including two adult eagles frequently found at several coastal parks in three neighborhoods.Recently, a younger bird has been seen consistently with the two adults, leading many to believe that Staten Island\u2019s bald eagles have achieved a milestone this summer.Birders say the juvenile\u2019s behavior suggests it was born to that pair of adult eagles. Thick-billed but not yet white-headed, the young bird has been photographed taking food from the beaks of the older birds, something that is considered a sign of successful breeding.\u201cThis behavior certainly indicates that it is a young bird that hatched recently,\u201d Debra Kriensky, a biologist with the Audubon group, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting.\u201dMike Shanley, a birder on Staten Island and the president of the Friends of Blue Heron Park, said the feeding suggests \u201cprobable nesting,\u201d meaning two adult birds building a nest to try to have offspring. It is \u201cnot confirmed breeding,\u201d he added, \u201cthough it is a very good indicator.\u2019\u2019But birders say there are plenty of remote places on Staten Island where a nest could be hidden.\u201cThere are a lot of thick woods,\u201d Mr. Shanley said. \u201cIf they nested in the top of a tall tree in the middle of those, nobody would have found them.\u201dIt is not uncommon for eagles to fail to breed \u2014 meaning a nest was built and eggs were laid but did not hatch \u2014 several times, said Ed Johnson, the former director of science at the Staten Island Museum. \u201cThey need a few tries to get it right,\u201d he said.There is mounting circumstantial evidence that they did so this year: The adult birds and the juvenile, which is at most a few months old, have been spotted perching on the same branch, communicating and feeding together, implying that the young bird hatched in the area.What is undeniable is New York\u2019s place among urban areas to which eagles, once threatened with extinction, have returned.Widespread pesticide use after World War II had decimated their numbers. \u201cIn 1960, there was only one breeding pair in all of New York State,\u201d Ms. Kriensky said. But after decades of federal protection, the birds were removed from the endangered species list in 2007.\u201cThe way I grew up,\u201d Mr. Pugliares said, \u201cwe knew about the national bird but we never saw it. Now they\u2019re here. I mean, they\u2019re right here.\u201dSince 2009, over 900 eagle sightings on Staten Island have been reported on eBird.com, a website that tracks bird sightings and population trends. Most have been of the adult male that Mr. Pugliares has seen so often that he gave it a nickname: Vito, after the patriarch in \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d The eagle often flies over a church where parts of the movie were filmed, and perches conspicuously on telephone poles throughout his sliver of territory.The juvenile bird was easily spotted recently at one of Mount Loretto\u2019s ponds. Mr. Pugliares took photos as it spread its wings, exposing its brown belly, to bask in the sun for several minutes. It certainly appeared at home.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any eagle act this way,\u201d Mr. Pugliares said.But the nest where the eagle was born still eludes him, as it does everyone else.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say exactly what happened with the nest,\u201d Ms. Kriensky said. \u201cThe fact that they are here in general is pretty amazing and a sign that these birds are thriving.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The girl was wailing. The mother looked lifeless.A store employee recorded the scene while waiting for medics. When they arrived, they revived the mother and took her and her daughter to a hospital. The video, which became public two days later, spread across the internet.What is new, they said, is that addicts are increasingly buying drugs, getting high and passing out with their children in tow.The Lawrence police estimate that children are now present in perhaps 10 percent of the drug calls to which they respond.\u201cIt\u2019s just a horrifying byproduct of this opiate crisis,\u201d said Thomas Cuddy, a special assistant to Police Chief James Fitzpatrick of Lawrence.In New Hampshire, heroin was identified as a risk factor in 7.62 percent of investigations of child neglect this year through April, according to the state Division for Children, Youth and Families; that is up from 4.8 percent from October to December 2014.Marylou Sudders, the secretary of health and human services in Massachusetts, said more and more children were coming to the attention of the child welfare system as parents bought drugs or overdosed in front of them.\u201cChildren are as much the victims of what we\u2019re seeing in this epidemic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a poignant reminder that our interventions have to be broader than just treatment for the individual but have to include loved ones, especially children.\u201dAt the same time, the video may have been the push that the mother needed to persuade her to seek help.After picking up her daughter, Ms. McGowen went to buy diapers at the Family Dollar store in Lawrence, just over the Massachusetts border. Lawrence, an old mill town, is at the nexus of New England\u2019s heavy drug trade.As she was shopping in the toy aisle, Ms. McGowen collapsed and slumped to the floor on her back. Her daughter started wailing, prompting another shopper to alert a store clerk.Employees called 911, and one began recording the scene with a cellphone.At one point in the video, an unidentified man stepped up, called out \u201cMandy, Mandy\u201d and slapped her a few times. Receiving no response, he then reached into her bag, removed a cellphone and eventually left. Otherwise, no one touched the mother or tried to comfort the daughter, who continued to cry.The video appeared two days later on the website of The Lawrence Eagle-Tribune and was released by the Lawrence police at about the same time.\u201cYou want to draw awareness to the problem,\u201d Mr. Cuddy said, explaining why the police had released the video.Drug deaths have surged in nearly every U.S. county.\u201cIt is time that the non-drug-using public sees what we are now dealing with on a daily basis,\u201d East Liverpool officials wrote.In Lawrence, medics revived Ms. McGowen with two doses of naloxone, which reverses the effects of an overdose.Eventually, an ambulance took her and her daughter to Lawrence General Hospital.The police alerted the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, which took emergency custody of the daughter.The video soon popped up on Facebook, before the police and the newspaper released it. One of those who first saw it was a woman who is tangentially related to Ms. McGowen. The woman called Pamela Gani, a New Hampshire mother who is active in helping people with drug problems. Ms. Gani called Ms. McGowen.\u201cShe broke down and said, \u2018I want to die,\u2019\u201d Ms. Gani recalled. Ms. Gani then asked another mother, Lisa Carter, who lives near Ms. McGowen in Salem, to check on her.\u201cShe was being evicted, she had lost her daughter and she was in pretty rough shape,\u201d Ms. Carter said. \u201cShe\u2019s sitting there in the candlelight, all alone, with no water, no electricity. She couldn\u2019t even flush the toilet.\u201d\u201cI posted to my warrior moms on Facebook that we were desperate for a detox bed,\u201d Ms. Carter said.By this time, the video was ricocheting across social media, and other mothers in Magnolia \u2014 which has chapters in 25 states, including New Hampshire and Massachusetts \u2014 had seen it.\u201cI was absolutely livid that people were sharing that video,\u201d said Maureen Cavanagh, the founder and president of Magnolia, who lives in Massachusetts. \u201cIt perpetuates the shame and stigma of the disease.\u201dMs. Cavanagh also put out the word that Ms. McGowen needed a detox bed and longer-term treatment. Dozens of mothers began calling their contacts in search of help across two states.\u201cWe had to take measures into our own hands, because there\u2019s no help whatsoever,\u201d Ms. Gani said.But no one could find an available detox bed.Anxious for Ms. McGowen to receive medical help, Ms. Carter took her on Thursday to a hospital in Massachusetts, where people in New Hampshire often turn because their own state provides so few resources. After a day, the hospital discovered that Ms. McGowen had only New Hampshire Medicaid for insurance, which the hospital did not accept.The hospital discharged her on Friday \u2014 the same day, Mr. Cuddy said, that the Lawrence police charged her with child endangerment.Near despair, Ms. McGowen, who until then had not seen the video of herself, decided that she should watch it, Ms. Carter said. Ms. McGowen was feeling humiliated, embarrassed and deeply regretful, Ms. Carter said, and might have been on the brink of an intentional overdose.But she thought watching the video would give her the resolve she needed to seek help.Late Friday, a contact of Ms. Cavanagh\u2019s in Massachusetts came through with a detox bed for Ms. McGowen for a week. He is also providing a bed at a treatment facility at no expense for 28 days. Intensive inpatient treatment with medical support can cost $30,000 a month.Before Ms. McGowen went to detox, she told WBZ-TV that she wanted to get clean and regain custody of her daughter and hoped that the video would not define her life.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened, period,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want my daughter to see \u2014 her holding my hand trying to get me up and crying her eyes out.\u201dMs. Carter said that the daughter was being placed in foster care, not up for adoption, on the theory that Ms. McGowen would someday be well enough to get her back.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wild About Watches", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 \u201cWelcome. Please sit in the Spitfire chair.\u201dDr. Bernard Cheong, a physician and probably one of the world\u2019s quirkiest watch collectors, gestured at a red leather seat from the cockpit of a former Royal Air Force plane. It sat on a covered porch at his home, along with a mounted water buffalo head, antique ice-making machines, some hoverboards and a handful of watches \u2014 just a small part of the collection he estimates to be worth $15 million to $20 million, most of which he keeps at a secure site.Just home from work at his medical clinic, Dr. Cheong poured the first of several Chivas on ice and settled at a stainless-steel seat-and-table structure, the vibration-free platform he usually uses to inspect his watches. He had the 3-ton piece designed by a Canadian-Chinese sculptor and, once it was fabricated, air-lifted onto his porch \u2014 \u201cWe had to remove the roof,\u201d he explained.Dr. Cheong, 58, is one of the few self-taught watch enthusiasts accepted by Switzerland\u2019s elite industry organizations. In 2002, he helped create a more transparent jury system for the Grand Prix d\u2019Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve, the annual watchmaking competition. In 2011, he became the first lay expert \u2014 and the first Asian \u2014 to be appointed as an ambassador for the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva.He is an oddity in the rarified world of top watch collecting: He is not European, he is not an industry professional and he does not have inherited wealth. As the co-owner of a chain of medical clinics, he would most likely describe himself as comfortably affluent, but certainly not in the ranks of the global elite. When he started attending watch fairs in the late \u201990s, he paid for his own economy-class tickets to Switzerland.He is as passionate about watches online as he is in person and began posting on the Singapore-based watch website TimeZone in the mid-\u201990s. His own blog and Facebook page have dazzling photos of his acquisitions, as well as insider tips that the industry may or may not appreciate. (One watch-enthusiasts\u2019 online forum has essentially barred him for what it described as being too self-promotional.)He and his wife Dolly Ong are regulars on the Singapore society scene, often photographed with something very pricey strapped to their wrists.\u201cWhy am I famous?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cNot because I\u2019m some rich famous dude but because I\u2019m a loudmouth. When I say something bad \u2014 like \u2018This watch isn\u2019t worth a fraction of its sales price\u2019 \u2014 I\u2019m lambasted.\u201dDr. Cheong says that like all good collectors, he looks for quality, rarity, beauty and price \u2014 and also is motivated by the thrill of the hunt.Among his most prized acquisitions are two No. 00/11 watches; the zero is used to label the watchmaker\u2019s own piece in an 11-item limited edition.One is a Greubel Forsey Invention Piece 1, a platinum watch with a double tourbillon, that Dr. Cheong said cost him $2.2 million in 2014. (He said he saved for nearly a decade and sold some less-valuable pieces from his collection to afford it.) \u201cThis actual piece was on Robert Greubel\u2019s wrist,\u201d he said of the Swiss watchmaker. \u201cI will not sell it for profit. It should end up in a museum.\u201dHis other \u201c00/11\u201d belonged to Vianney Halter, the French-born watchmaker who has a strong cult following. \u201cThere should be more people like Bernard Cheong in the world,\u201d Mr. Halter wrote in an email interview, praising the doctor for supporting independent watchmaking.Dr. Cheong\u2019s collection also includes classics from Rolex, Cartier and Omega, as well as historic pieces like a 19th-century Hamilton, a pocket watch made in the United States, and another pocket watch made of cheap metal in Germany during World War II.Many of the doctor\u2019s watches are unusual contemporary designs, especially those with a steampunk look. One is a Devon Tread One, an American-made watch whose face is a blocky black square with stark white numbers. Another is a red-gold Cabestan, which is run with old-fashioned winch-and-chain mechanisms, made in Switzerland. And he has a timepiece by the independent Swiss watchmaker Romain Jerome that includes metal from the Titanic.Dr. Cheong\u2019s first watch, a Flyback Seiko Chronograph, was a gift from his parents, a sculptor and a nurse, when he was 15. At 23, he got his first paycheck as a doctor and used part of it to make his first watch purchase, an Omega Seamaster Titanium. He still has both watches, their bands now faded and too tight, their cases strangely small against the giant models of today.He began collecting in the 1980s and has many stories of those early days. \u201cThe time I started collecting, it was just luck,\u201d he said, describing, for example, how he bought a lot of Panerai watches in the \u201980s and early \u201890s from a Singapore shop that was having trouble moving stock.\u201cI had a gut feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cI just let them sit in my warehouse until 1998. One day I thought, \u2018Goodness! I forgot about those watches!\u2019 So I released them via auction a bit at a time.\u201d He says he bought the Panerais for about $3,000 each, and the best ones ended up selling for almost $90,000 each.In an age of smartphones and Apple Watches, the mechanical timepieces Dr. Cheong collects are, practically speaking, no longer necessary. He does not feel, however, that the march of technology will diminish the connoisseur\u2019s love of luxury watches.\u201cWhen photography was invented, some people said, \u2018What\u2019s the point of painting? A photograph will always be easier and more accurate,\u201d\u2019 he said. \u201cBut photography didn\u2019t kill art. There are still great painters, and their works have only gone up in price.\u201dOn his own wrist the day of the interview was a Seiko, the same brand he coveted as a 15-year-old. Only this time, his Seiko had parts carved from a single piece of synthetic diamond. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he said, sotto voce. \u201cThis model is not out yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was taken into custody without incident around 6:30 p.m.Officials said that they had received numerous tips about the gunman and that surveillance footage had helped locate him.Lt. Michael Hawley of the Island County Sheriff\u2019s Office said he had received a report that Mr. Cetin\u2019s car was less than a mile from his office and when he headed that way, he found Mr. Cetin walking on the sidewalk. Mr. Cetin was carrying a satchel with a computer inside and was in a \u201czombielike\u201d state when he was taken into custody, the lieutenant said.Charges were pending, said the authorities, who said it was too early to say what led to the shootings.His Facebook page offered a glimpse of his life. A posting by a friend in 2011 described him as \u201creally annoying,\u201d \u201cfunny\u201d and \u201csometimes really nasty.\u201d Mr. Cetin referred to lifting weights in high school and posted videos of the video game Call of Duty.Another Facebook posting, by a friend in 2012, said of Mr. Cetin: \u201cTruth is: You are a very odd character. You were always going on about being Russian and stuff like that, but under that you really supported America (or so it seemed to me) and I always thought that was really cool.\u201dMr. Cetin was active in the Reserve Officers Training Corps, said a former classmate, Uhlaine Finnigan, 19, of Port Angeles, Wash.She called Mr. Cetin \u201csexist\u201d and said he would touch girls on their buttocks, \u201ceither slapping or grabbing them.\u201d\u201cHe did that to girls of all grades at the high school including my best friend and I, regardless of the blatant disgust from the girls and being told to stop,\u201d she said in an interview by Facebook Messenger. She said he appeared to have few friends.The attacker at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Wash., killed four women in the cosmetics section of a Macy\u2019s department store, the authorities said. A man was critically wounded in the shooting and was taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he died. The youngest female victim was a teenager, law enforcement officials said at a news conference on Saturday morning.The gunman, who was armed with a rifle, left the scene before the police arrived. Officials said they recovered the weapon at the scene. They declined to give details about the weapon or to say how many rounds were fired. Photographs of Mr. Cetin on a Myspace account showed him holding a handgun and a rifle.A spokesman for the F.B.I.\u2019s Seattle field office said on Saturday that there was no evidence to suggest that the shooting was an act of terrorism.At the news conference on Saturday night, Mayor Steve Sexton of Burlington said the shootings happened at a time and in a setting that were ordinary: a Friday night at a mall.Referring to the shootings, he said: \u201cThey changed those families forever. It changed our city, I\u2019m afraid to some extent, forever.\u201dThe names of the victims had not yet been released by officials.Security camera footage showed the man entering the mall without a weapon. Footage taken 10 minutes later showed him entering Macy\u2019s with a rifle.At the news conference earlier on Saturday, the authorities described the tense moments after the shooting, as officers searched the roughly 440,000-square-foot mall for the attacker, finding only store employees and shoppers.Police officers entered the mall in teams, unaware during the search, which lasted for hours, that the gunman had fled before their arrival.

{"Headline": "Protecting Humans and Jobs From Robots Is 5 Tech Giants\u2019 Goal", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive major technology companies said Wednesday that they had created an organization to set the ground rules for protecting humans \u2014 and their jobs \u2014 in the face of rapid advances in artificial intelligence.The organization has been created at a time of significant public debate about artificial intelligence technologies that are built into a variety of robots and other intelligent systems, including self-driving cars and workplace automation.The industry group introduced a set of basic ethical standards for engineering development and scientific research that its five members have agreed upon.In a conference call on Wednesday, five artificial intelligence researchers representing the companies said they thought the technology would be a major force in the world for social and economic benefits, but they acknowledged the potential for misuse in a wide variety of ways.They said their effort was not intended to be an enforcement organization to force technology companies into self-regulation. Rather, they want to foster \u201cpublic understanding\u201d and set \u201cbest practices\u201d for work in artificial intelligence.\u201cWe passionately believe in the potential for it to transform in a positive way our world,\u201d said Mustafa Suleyman, head of applied A.I. for DeepMind, an artificial intelligence development company acquired by Google in 2014. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s critical now to start to think about new models of engagement with the public, new models of collaboration across the industry and new models of transparency around the work that we do.\u201dThe group released eight tenets that are evocative of Isaac Asimov\u2019s original \u201cThree Laws of Robotics,\u201d which appeared in a science fiction story in 1942. The new principles include high-level ideals such as, \u201cWe will seek to ensure that A.I. technologies benefit and empower as many people as possible.\u201dNevertheless, at least one of the tenets implies that the companies realize they could be drawn into sticky ethical situations, and it calls on engineers to oppose the use of artificial intelligence technology in weapons or other tools that could be used to violate human rights.\u201cWith the hyperbole about A.I. over the last two to four years, there have been concerns in an echo chamber of anxiety that the government itself will be misinformed,\u201d said Eric Horvitz, managing director for Microsoft Research.The researchers said they were talking with other companies like Apple and research laboratories like the new nonprofit research group OpenAI about participating in their organization.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Q. and A.: Eric Korita Shares the Keys to a Power Serve", "Date": "2016-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did you develop such a fast serve?For me, it started with a lot of throwing \u2014 throwing footballs and baseballs. That was a key. I was taught good mechanics, too, but then I used my own creativity to develop my serve. I would toss balls way out to the side to work on kicks and twists. I have seven different tosses. That\u2019s not for everyone, but even four tosses would give different options. I think creativity is missing in sport today.How old were you when you realized you had something special with your serve?When I was playing junior tournaments, I hit serves so hard sometimes my opponents didn\u2019t have time to react, and it would just hit them in the chest and knock them over.When did you know just how fast your serve actually was?I was signed to a sponsorship with Prince, and they wanted to say you could serve 140 miles per hour with the Prince Boron. So to document that, they brought out the guns, and I served in the mid-to-high 140s and even broke 150.What is the most important thing to keep in mind on a serve?I\u2019m 6-5, but power is not just size and strength. You can be 5-10 and add more speed to your serve. You need to stay really relaxed, and then at the top of your swing, you need to really have a good wrist snap.People would say to me, \u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re doing anything, you\u2019re so relaxed.\u201d Pancho Segura told me I reminded him of Pancho Gonzalez that way, that my body was so relaxed. That allowed me to stay loose. If you maximize relaxation and there\u2019s no tension in your grip, wrist, elbow or shoulder, then you can really go up and fire. Without that, there\u2019s no free flow. And then you need to really snap your wrist. There\u2019s so much force in that snap.Do you think that looseness would help pro players improve, too? Even the biggest servers, whether it\u2019s John Isner or Serena Williams, could serve even harder and get more on their serves if they were loose with their wrist. People lose velocity and spin. There\u2019s more opportunity if you know what your wrist can do.I could serve 150 miles per hour with the rackets and strings we were using back then. My rackets were strung at 80 to 82 pounds, and when strings broke, they would just explode. Someone now could hit 180 miles per hour.It could be a big difference for the women; their serve could be much, much harder. The game is so tough and so physically demanding now, who wouldn\u2019t want one or two free points per game?How fast do you think you can serve now?I\u2019m 53, but if I worked my way up to it for a little while, I can still serve hard. I could probably get into the 130s.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a shame folks don\u2019t go to jail, but white collar crime is never considered a serious issue, no matter how many lives it damages.In no other realm within child development, including school and health care, are parents are so sidelined \u2014 discouraged from speaking up, making requests, asking questions, told to wait 48 hours, and given little or no information or input into the decision-making processes \u2014 from adults (predominantly males) who are probably complete strangers who may or may not be credentialed and background checked.How did we as a society get to the point where coaches have unlimited and unchecked power over young minds and bodies? And where parents stepping in to voice a concern or provide input is viewed negatively, with potentially significant repercussions on status and playing time?That way he can be sure. Humph.It\u2019s a LOT to take in. By the time I got to Recy Taylor in 1940, I was emotionally spent.I started crying and couldn\u2019t stop. Then I heard the woman behind me sniff.

{"Headline": "Allo\u2019s Tryout: 5 Days With Google\u2019s Annoying Office Intern", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixYou may now have more messaging apps than you have close friends.\u201cHaving more apps than close friends doesn\u2019t help, as something will have to go,\u201d Mr. Dunbar said in an email, though he noted that the various messaging apps serve different purposes. Younger people are shying away from chatting on Facebook, for example, to have more private conversations on apps like WhatsApp.With that backdrop in mind, I tested Allo for five days and compared it with the apps that are most similar to it: Google Hangouts, Apple iMessage and Facebook Messenger.After weighing the pros and cons, my advice is that people can hold off on downloading Allo, largely because its artificially intelligent assistant was unhelpful. But if Allo matures, users will probably want to ditch the Hangouts app.First, some context about Allo. Google announced the app in May, aiming to highlight the company\u2019s push into artificial intelligence. Its older chat app, Hangouts, will remain, but Google will emphasize that product\u2019s use as a videoconferencing and messaging app for businesses.To understand how Allo works, it\u2019s easiest to think of the app\u2019s A.I. assistant as an office intern who is lurking in the background, eager to chime in. The assistant analyzes messages you have typed or dictated and, when appropriate, springs into action with automatically generated phrases you can choose to reply with or suggestions for Google searches that may help accomplish tasks.When you\u2019re having a conversation with another person, for example, the assistant suggests ways it can help. Saying \u201cWant to see a movie tonight?\u201d prompts the assistant to offer a Google search for movie showtimes or to reply with suggestions like \u201cSure, what time?\u201d or \u201cNot really.\u201dHere is where Allo became frustrating for me. Asking an assistant to search \u201cmovie showtimes tonight\u201d should load a list of movies and corresponding showtimes. Instead, Google\u2019s assistant shows a list of movies without showtimes; only after tapping on a film can you ask for times.Sometimes that doesn\u2019t even work. Asking for showtimes for the movie \u201cSnowden\u201d loaded movies playing at a movie theater called UA Snowden Square Stadium 14. Not helpful \u2014 unless, of course, you live in Columbia, Md.Allo also tries to guess what your written response might be to certain types of phrases, questions or photos. With photos, the app occasionally identifies what\u2019s inside the photo to generate a suggested reaction. So when you receive a photo of a dog, Allo loads responses like \u201cadorable.\u201dThis feature ran into several problems. When I sent a picture to a friend of my cat sitting inside my car, Allo suggested this response to the friend: \u201cWhat a cute car!\u201d (Sorry, Allo, but my Prius is the opposite of cute.)For now, Allo\u2019s artificial assistance feels limited. So if I were a manager seeking an assistant, I probably wouldn\u2019t hire Allo. But I would politely tell the candidate to reapply after getting more experience.Each messaging app has its own purpose, but Allo has the most in common with Facebook Messenger, iMessage and Google Hangouts. That\u2019s because all four are capable of adding some personality with stickers and emojis.So I tested Messenger, iMessage and Hangouts against Allo to determine their pros and cons. The highlights:\u25a0 iMessage, Hangouts and Messenger work on mobile devices and computers. Allo works only on Android and iOS mobile devices, though Google plans to expand Allo to computers later.\u25a0 iMessage and Messenger support third-party apps, adding features like sending money to friends within messages. Google has no plans to support outside apps in Allo.\u25a0 Messenger has more sticker packs than Allo, which has only about 25.\u25a0 IMessage stickers are more fun to use. In iMessage, stickers can be placed on top of messages and photos \u2014 add a cartoon mustache to your selfie, for example. On Allo, stickers can be sent only as stand-alone messages.\u25a0 The Hangouts app is very much like Allo, without the half-baked assistant. Allo has more entertaining stickers, including a muscular yellow bull that appears to be twerking. The big difference between the two is that the Hangouts app relies primarily on your contacts list linked to a Google Mail account, whereas Allo pulls contacts from your device\u2019s phone book.The upshot: iMessage and Messenger have more features than Allo. There are two major features missing from Allo: the ability to chat using a computer and using third-party apps and games to do more within messages.With Allo, Google has the opportunity to stand out by offering superior artificial intelligence. Neither Messenger nor Allo has great A.I. yet, but Google\u2019s assistant has a better start.Finally, there is privacy to consider. It\u2019s tough to say how Allo will fare in terms of security until encryption experts take a close look at the app.Here\u2019s what we know so far: By default, Apple\u2019s iMessage service is end-to-end encrypted, which means a message is encrypted when it is sent from your device and remains encrypted when it passes through Apple\u2019s server and reaches the recipient. Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger both lack end-to-end encryption, so at some point when messages pass through their servers, they can see your messages.Allo has end-to-end encryption turned off by default because its server needs to see the messages to work its A.I. magic. However, Allo includes a mode called Incognito with full encryption enabled, which people can use for private conversations, similar to a private mode on a web browser. But, of course, the A.I. features do not work in Incognito.So Allo is a step ahead of Hangouts and Messenger for privacy. But by default (and by design), it is not as secure as iMessage.I recommend waiting for Allo to become available on computers and for its A.I. to become smarter. At the moment, Allo\u2019s assistant will waste more time than it saves when it comes to helping you make plans, and it will probably make conversations more awkward.Google said it was still improving and refining its algorithms, and Allo\u2019s assistant will get better over time.Once Allo\u2019s assistant matures, the Hangouts app will become redundant and you\u2019ll be able to delete it from your device. The catch, of course, is that Allo\u2019s A.I. won\u2019t become sophisticated until more people use it and share feedback.For now, if I really need help, I\u2019m going to request a competent intern.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Protests Erupt in Charlotte After Police Kill a Black Man", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout 16 police officers in Charlotte, N.C., were injured when a standoff between law enforcement and demonstrators turned ugly overnight after an officer fatally shot a black man on Tuesday afternoon.Protesters clashed with police officers in riot gear and blocked a stretch of Interstate 85. Video from local television early Wednesday showed some demonstrators looting trucks that had been stopped on the highway and setting fire to the cargo.Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference on Wednesday morning that the officers had sustained minor injuries and that one person had been arrested during the protests, which began in the University City neighborhood in northeast Charlotte, near the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.WSOC-TV reported that looters later moved off the highway and tried to break into a Walmart before officers arrived in force to keep them out, and at least one family driving on Interstate 85 reported that their windshield had been shattered by demonstrators throwing rocks.\u201cThe community deserves answers and full investigation will ensue,\u201d Ms. Roberts said. \u201cWill be reaching out to community leaders to work together.\u201dThe shooting occurred just before 4 p.m. on Tuesday as officers were trying to serve an arrest warrant for another person in an apartment complex.Police officials said the officer opened fire because Mr. Scott, who they said was armed with a gun, \u201cposed an imminent deadly threat.\u201dAlthough their accounts sometimes diverged, members of Mr. Scott\u2019s family generally told local news outlets that he had not had a weapon. Instead, they said, he had been clutching a book while waiting to pick up a child after school.The shooting revived scrutiny of a police department that drew national attention about three years ago when a white officer was quickly charged with voluntary manslaughter after he killed Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed black man.In Charlotte, dozens of chanting demonstrators, some of them holding signs, began gathering near the site of the shooting on Tuesday evening. Around 10 p.m., the Police Department said on Twitter that it had sent its civil emergency unit to the scene \u201cto safely remove our officers.\u201d\u201cDemonstrators surrounded our officers who were attempting to leave scene,\u201d the department said. It identified the officer who fired his weapon as Brentley Vinson, an employee since July 2014. Officer Vinson is black, according to local reports.According to the department, officers saw Mr. Scott leave a vehicle with a weapon soon after they arrived at the apartment complex.\u201cOfficers observed the subject get back into the vehicle, at which time they began to approach the subject,\u201d the department said in its first statement about the shooting. \u201cThe subject got back out of the vehicle armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers, who subsequently fired their weapon, striking the subject.\u201dA police spokesman did not respond to an after-hours inquiry about whether a dashboard or body camera had recorded the shooting. Chief Putney had acknowledged that Mr. Scott had not been the subject of the outstanding warrant.On Facebook, a woman who identified herself as Mr. Scott\u2019s daughter said that the police had fired without provocation.\u201cThe police just shot my daddy four times for being black,\u201d the woman said moments into a Facebook Live broadcast that lasted about an hour. Later in the broadcast, she learned that her father had died and speculated that the police were planting evidence. (The police said that investigators had recovered a weapon.)The department, which said on Tuesday that Officer Vinson had been placed on administrative leave, said it was conducting \u201can active and ongoing investigation\u201d into the killing of Mr. Scott.An earlier version of this article misstated the day protesters remained on Interstate 85. It was Wednesday, not Thursday.Advertisement"}

When it comes to understanding natural selection (or indeed, any aspect of natural science), his ignorance is shocking, as when he claimed in an interview on NPR that \u201cit\u2019s misleading to say that human beings evolved from animals \u2014 actually, nobody knows whether they did or not. There are very few physical signs, aside from the general resemblance of apes and humans.\u201dBrains, including the human variety, exist because and only because of evolution. And language is a potent product of those brains. Moreover, the \u201cphysical signs\u201d of human connectedness to the rest of the animal world are so deep and abundant (including DNA, cellular mechanisms, anatomy, physiology, paleontology, embryology, etc.) that their enumeration essentially occupies nearly all of modern biology. It\u2019s time for people who don\u2019t know anything about biology in general and evolution in particular to stop saying stupid things about either. I urge Tom Wolfe to stick with producing what he at least has accurately labeled fiction.DAVID P. BARASHREDMOND, WASH.The author is a professor of psychology at the University of Washington.\u2b25To the Editor:Much of Caitlin Flanagan\u2019s review is a nasty attack on Noam Chomsky\u2019s left-wing politics that slavishly mimics Wolfe\u2019s flippant, right-wing sarcasm. She more or less implies that Chomsky\u2019s standing as a linguist is due largely to his continuing critique of United States foreign policy, which she in turn caricatures. The simple truth, however, is that Chomsky\u2019s work in linguistics had already gained ground in the academy before the publication of \u201cThe Responsibility of Intellectuals\u201d in 1967. At any rate, Chomsky\u2019s linguistic investigations and his political writings are completely separate enterprises and should be seen as such. Meanwhile, Flanagan spends approximately a paragraph on Chomsky\u2019s actual theory, and allots just a few lines to Darwin, who is the other target of Wolfe\u2019s meanspirited book.GENE H. BELL-VILLADACAMBRIDGE, MASS.\u2b25To the Editor:I\u2019ve read \u201cThe Kingdom of Speech\u201d and enjoyed it immensely, and I thought Caitlin Flanagan\u2019s review was an excellent description, with all due praise. I must take issue, however, with the snide reference to \u201can old man\u2019s willingness to digress.\u201d If Flanagan had written \u201can old woman\u2019s willingness to digress,\u201d the letters of protest would have overwhelmed your system.I find ageism (and obesity, for that matter) to be the last acceptable contemporary biases. I\u2019m neither an old man nor obese, but I am someone offended by this kind of gratuitous, needless insinuation. Age has improved Tom Wolfe, not diminished him.ALAN WEISSEAST GREENWICH, R.I.\u2b25BulletproofTo the Editor:Regardless of the use of the term \u201cmagic bullet\u201d in discussions of the Kennedy assassination, it was coined by the German scientist Paul Ehrlich at the beginning of the 20th century in reference to Salvarsan, which he had developed for the treatment of syphilis.

{"Headline": "Benjamin Netanyahu Draws Fire After Saying Palestinians Support \u2018Ethnic Cleansing\u2019", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut many have cheered for him, saying Mr. Netanyahu is exposing the hypocrisy of Israel\u2019s detractors, whose concern for human rights, they feel, seems to apply only to the Palestinians.Days after the release of the video, Israelis and Palestinians were still debating the effects of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s \u201chasbara\u201d offensive, using a Hebrew term for pro-Israeli advocacy. Was Mr. Netanyahu destroying Israel\u2019s international relations, ties already strained over the continued settlement construction in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that much of the world considers illegitimate? Or was he a public relations genius, using the world stage to score points with his home audience?Mr. Yemini wrote that population transfers were historically intended to ensure the right of self-determination and to establish nation states. He maintained that Mr. Netanyahu has turned that concept on its head. Israelis settling in the heart of Arab-populated areas of the West Bank were, he wrote, \u201cthe antithesis of the idea of self-determination and a Jewish and democratic nation state, because instead of separation there is a mix-up of hostile populations.\u201dHe described Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s use of the \u201creligion card\u201d as dangerous, adding, \u201cThere is a difference between settlers living in exclusive communities on stolen land and someone who is living in the country as a citizen like anybody else.\u201dMr. Abu Eid said that some American and Israeli Jews were already living in areas of the West Bank under Palestinian control. He said that his neighbors in Ramallah included Christians, Muslims, a Druse family from the Golan Heights and a Jewish woman.\u201cThe prime minister is twinning his powerful message with powerful technology to spread the truth farther and faster,\u201d said David Keyes, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s recently appointed foreign media adviser.Mr. Keyes did not answer a question about the status the prime minister envisioned for Jews living in a future Palestinian state: as Palestinian citizens or Israeli citizens under military protection.Tzipi Hotovely, Israel\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said in an interview that Mr. Netanyahu had been using similar terminology to that in the video for over a year in official meetings with foreign diplomats. Ms. Hotovely described the West Bank as \u201cthe tribal land of the Jewish people, the bible land.\u201d\u201cOur connection is much deeper than those who came later,\u201d she said.Mr. Keyes said that Mr. Luntz had not been consulted for the Netanyahu videos. Mr. Luntz did not respond to questions sent by email about his work in Israel.\u201cSometimes the English is meant for the Hebrew audience,\u201d said Yoaz Hendel, a former director of communications in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office, noting that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s speeches in Congress and the United Nations have often played well back home.Some have also questioned whether Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s predecessors should be considered guilty of ethnic cleansing. These include Israeli leaders such as Ariel Sharon, who destroyed all the settlements in Gaza in 2005, or Menachem Begin, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who evacuated the Sinai settlements as part of the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Medieval Monasteries of Kosovo", "Date": "2016-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultured TravelerThe main street in Gracanica, a village on the outskirts of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, is lined with bakeries and markets strung together in a jumble until the shop fronts give way to a high stone wall. Step to the other side, and the hum of Volkswagens and Skodas falls away almost entirely. At the center of a wide lawn sits Gracanica Monastery, a masterpiece of late-Byzantine ecclesiastical architecture, its rosy domes like steppingstones that draw the eye and the spirit toward the sky.Gracanica was the last monastery constructed, in the early 14th century, by the Serbian King Stefan Milutin, who had promised God that he would build a church for each of the 40-odd years of his reign. Inside the nave, scarcely an inch of the stone shows through the hundreds of frescoes that ascend the walls and pool in the arches of the cupolas. One need not count oneself among the faithful to be silenced by the suffusion of contemplation and color \u2014 seabed blue, the opulent scarlets and gold halos of the sainted patriarchs of the Serbian Orthodox Church, their faces blackened remarkably little over seven centuries.\u201cSo the painters were Greek?\u201d I said.Mr. Parlic shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they were Greeks or if they were Serbs. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dAt Gracanica, I stood next to Mr. Parlic before the figure of John the Baptist washing the darkness from Christ, while just above them the soldiers of a Roman army battalion advance into the frame, demanding to be baptized. This was the first instance, Mr. Parlic told me, of medieval iconography displaying pagans who sought to become Christians.Mr. Parlic leaned in closer to me. \u201cAre you very religious?\u201d he said.I took that as my exit cue, and made my way across the clean lawn. From there it was a seven-minute walk through town to my hotel. Hot pink stucco houses tumbled down a country road, and a scattering of wire chicken coops backed up against freshly laid brick sidewalks.He returned to Bern in 2004 but grew bored with the bureaucracy and came back to Kosovo to invest. Mr. Wormser found local partners in Hisen Gashnjani, who had worked as a translator at the embassy, and Atlan Gidjic, whom he\u2019d met at a concert in the town where Mr. Gidjic lives. \u201cWe quickly became \u201ckucni prijatelji,\u201d Mr. Gidjic told me, \u201chome friends.\u201dThe partners had hoped for a rural location, but after two years searching the treacherous market for a land permit (\u201cIt\u2019s never boring here,\u201d Mr. Wormser told me), they compromised by laying out the hotel at the edge of town in a slender \u201cL\u201d; the 15 rooms line the length of the edifice, each with a single wall of solid glass that looks out back onto quiet hills planted with corn, the bluish outline of Kosovo\u2019s more dramatic mountain ranges \u2014 the Accursed Mountains \u2014 hovering beyond. The airy tranquillity of the building, which opened in 2013, evokes a kind of Balkan Grand Budapest Hotel with its hard-won inoculation from the swirl of politics outside.It seems hard to believe, but Hotel Gracanica is also one of the few multiethnic businesses in Kosovo, where Albanian and Serb communities remain in de facto segregation, and is perhaps the only hotel in the world with a majority Roma management.In late May, just shy of the summer season, I found myself the only diner in the hotel restaurant on a Saturday night, its pine tables covered in bright geometric textiles from a nearby town. In a short time I had before me a full platter of meze in the Kosovar style, which is Turkish-inspired but distinctly Balkan: ground chicken and beef kofte, mushrooms stuffed with carrot and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, hot peppers cooked in spicy yogurt, accompanied by a large disc of pitarke bread, which is like pita but softer inside, and was clearly intended for multiple diners though I finished it all myself without any problem. Ajvar, a sweet red-pepper jam, brightens everything.I wasn\u2019t surprised to learn that the hotel is not yet turning a profit. It asserts its role as a community hub by hosting shows for local artists and musicians, and its weekend brunch draws guests from Pristina\u2019s sizable expat crowd (the European Union maintains a heavy presence in local governance). British lawyers laze next to the pool as the afternoon sun arcs over the hills, gossiping about recent convictions of Albanian mobsters and future postings to Africa before heading back to Pristina, a 15-minute drive away.Pristina has the beginnings of a tourism industry without the tourists, so to speak. The recently renovated airport gleams with anticipation but remains low in traffic, reflecting the euphoria that accompanied statehood eight years ago, which has turned into frustration.The city is a postwar boomtown of sorts, with luxury high-rises popping up in every other neighborhood and cranes in primary colors punctuating the skyline. Everyone seems to know but won\u2019t say what\u2019s driving the boom; Kosovo remains one of the poorest countries in Europe, and corruption has helped keep it there.Back at Hotel Gracanica, the staff helped arrange for a Serb driver to pick me up at six o\u2019clock on Sunday morning. We drove across the Kosovo plain, through the early morning shadows, toward the Visoki Decani monastery, reputedly one of the most beautiful places in the western Balkans.The monasteries have been viewed as symbols of Serbian oppression during moments of tension, and have been the target of protests. Outside the town we slalomed between brightly striated roadblocks that led to a checkpoint, where Italian marines, remnants of the NATO forces during the war, photographed our license plate before letting us inside the property.The Decani monks are also known for their magnificent chanting. On Sunday morning the church\u2019s nave, cool and damp and smelling lightly of incense, fills with the clear harmonies of the monks\u2019 voices during an hourlong liturgy, the textures expanding into diminished chords before resolving into the consensus of unison. Among the hundreds of darkened frescoes, strips of light from a few high-placed windows irradiate the face of the Madonna, her mystical gaze inviting the worshiper to trust that what is unknowable to the human mind might be experienced through the ecstasy of the spirit.\u201cWe happen to be something different, which doesn\u2019t fit into someone\u2019s political and historical narrative,\u201d Father Sava told me, his face framed by a halo of frizzy blond hair, his expression soft except when he hit on a particularly urgent thought. The day before, the church had won a 16-year lawsuit over ownership of the property. \u201cUnfortunately there seem to be some people who believe that they have to change history and everything in the nation-building process,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I always say the identity of these places has to be understood in layers.\u201dThe drive back to Hotel Gracanica took me past a construction lot promising \u201cluxury living\u201d at something called the Diamond Residence, and a BMW dealership that had been erected next to a junkyard. The country seemed to be barreling ahead in its rush to cover up the old layers with new ones. Maybe, it occurred to me, that\u2019s not the only way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Spy Tech Firms Let Governments See Everything on a Smartphone", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Want to invisibly spy on 10 iPhone owners without their knowledge? Gather their every keystroke, sound, message and location? That will cost you $650,000, plus a $500,000 setup fee with an Israeli outfit called the NSO Group. You can spy on more people if you would like \u2014 just check out the company\u2019s price list.Now, internal NSO Group emails, contracts and commercial proposals obtained by The New York Times offer insight into how companies in this secretive digital surveillance industry operate. The emails and documents were provided by two people who have had dealings with the NSO Group but would not be named for fear of reprisals.The company is one of dozens of digital spying outfits that track everything a target does on a smartphone. They aggressively market their services to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. The industry argues that this spying is necessary to track terrorists, kidnappers and drug lords. The NSO Group\u2019s corporate mission statement is \u201cMake the world a safe place.\u201dTen people familiar with the company\u2019s sales, who refused to be identified, said that the NSO Group has a strict internal vetting process to determine who it will sell to. An ethics committee made up of employees and external counsel vets potential customers based on human rights rankings set by the World Bank and other global bodies. And to date, these people all said, NSO has yet to be denied an export license.But critics note that the company\u2019s spyware has also been used to track journalists and human rights activists.\u201cThere\u2019s no check on this,\u201d said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. \u201cOnce NSO\u2019s systems are sold, governments can essentially use them however they want. NSO can say they\u2019re trying to make the world a safer place, but they are also making the world a more surveilled place.\u201dThe NSO Group\u2019s capabilities are in higher demand now that companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are using stronger encryption to protect data in their systems, in the process making it harder for government agencies to track suspects.The cyberarms industry typified by the NSO Group operates in a legal gray area, and it is often left to the companies to decide how far they are willing to dig into a target\u2019s personal life and what governments they will do business with. Israel has strict export controls for digital weaponry, but the country has never barred the sale of NSO Group technology.Since it is privately held, not much is known about the NSO Group\u2019s finances, but its business is clearly growing. Two years ago, the NSO Group sold a controlling stake in its business to Francisco Partners, a private equity firm based in San Francisco, for $120 million. Nearly a year later, Francisco Partners was exploring a sale of the company for 10 times that amount, according to two people approached by the firm but forbidden to speak about the discussions.The company\u2019s internal documents detail pitches to countries throughout Europe and multimillion-dollar contracts with Mexico, which paid the NSO Group more than $15 million for three projects over three years, according to internal NSO Group emails dated in 2013.\u201cOur intelligence systems are subject to Mexico\u2019s relevant legislation and have legal authorization,\u201d Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThey are not used against journalists or activists. All contracts with the federal government are done in accordance with the law.\u201dZamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said that the sale of its spyware was restricted to authorized governments and that it was used solely for criminal and terrorist investigations. He declined to comment on whether the company would cease selling to the U.A.E. and Mexico after last week\u2019s disclosures.For the last six years, the NSO Group\u2019s main product, a tracking system called Pegasus, has been used by a growing number of government agencies to target a range of smartphones \u2014 including iPhones, Androids, and BlackBerry and Symbian systems \u2014 without leaving a trace.Among the Pegasus system\u2019s capabilities, NSO Group contracts assert, are the abilities to extract text messages, contact lists, calendar records, emails, instant messages and GPS locations. One capability that the NSO Group calls \u201croom tap\u201d can gather sounds in and around the room, using the phone\u2019s own microphone.Pegasus can use the camera to take snapshots or screen grabs. It can deny the phone access to certain websites and applications, and it can grab search histories or anything viewed with the phone\u2019s web browser.

To spy on 10 iPhone users, NSO charges government agencies $650,000; $650,000 for 10 Android users; $500,000 for five BlackBerry users; or $300,000 for five Symbian users \u2014 on top of the setup fee, according to one commercial proposal.You can pay for more targets. One hundred additional targets will cost $800,000, 50 extra targets cost $500,000, 20 extra will cost $250,000 and 10 extra costs $150,000, according to an NSO Group commercial proposal. There is an annual system maintenance fee of 17 percent of the total price every year thereafter.What that gets you, NSO Group documents say, is \u201cunlimited access to a target\u2019s mobile devices.\u201d In short, the company says: You can \u201cremotely and covertly collect information about your target\u2019s relationships, location, phone calls, plans and activities \u2014 whenever and wherever they are.\u201dAnd, its proposal adds, \u201cIt leaves no traces whatsoever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Rough Rider", "Date": "2016-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 To those who concede that the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, is not entirely prepared for the presidency but argue that he would \u2014 of course! \u2014 surround himself with admirable advisers, I have one name for you: Sid Miller.Mr. Miller, at 61, is weathered, blue-eyed and beefy, a classic backslapping good ole West Texas boy. He favors a wide-brimmed, white-as-snow cowboy hat and pointed boots. A former Baptist, he is today an elder in the Cowboy Church of Erath County. The United States Calf Roping Association named him a world champion in 2004. You get the idea.The right-leaning Mr. Miller spent 12 years in the Texas House of Representatives. After losing his seat in 2012, he rose, phoenix-like, to be elected agriculture commissioner in 2014. The work of hard-rock musician Ted Nugent as his campaign treasurer certainly helped.Despite the obvious contrasts, the West Texas rodeo star and the New York real estate magnate may have more in common than you\u2019d think.You can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t share the largess with his staff. A newly elected commissioner, Mr. Miller didn\u2019t post all job openings among his staff and filled several positions with friends and campaign team members. And he gave out more in bonuses in his first nine months in office \u2014 $413,700 to 144 employees \u2014 than his predecessor had in more than two years. One person Mr. Miller hired, at $180,000 a year, has a conviction for abuse of campaign funds.Mr. Miller\u2019s own financial affairs have drawn scrutiny. The Dallas Morning News reported that he invested $97,000 of campaign contributions in stocks; then he used the proceeds to pay himself back for loans he\u2019d made to his campaign fund \u2014 without recording these transfers in his final campaign finance reports.In 2015, Mr. Miller used campaign funds to travel to Mississippi for a rodeo. In another case that year, Mr. Miller took a taxpayer-funded trip that he said was to visit lawmakers in Oklahoma, but was also to visit a practitioner known as Dr. Mike for an injection known as the \u201cJesus shot\u201d that supposedly takes away pain for life.Mr. Miller and Mr. Trump also share an aversion to \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d\u201cIf one more person says \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 to me I just might slap them,\u201d he wrote on Facebook last December. \u201cEither tell me \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 or just don\u2019t say anything.\u201dAs agriculture commissioner, he created the \u201ccupcake amnesty\u201d to defend parents\u2019 right to send their kids to school with sugary confections. He also welcomed deep fryers and soft drinks back to Texas schools, where they had been banned for a decade because of soaring obesity rates.\u201cWe\u2019ve been raising big, strapping, healthy young kids here in Texas nearly 200 years,\u201d Mr. Miller declared. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t need Washington, D.C., telling us how to do it.\u201dMr. Miller was also the author of a Texas House bill requiring women to have a sonogram 24 hours before an abortion and to listen to the fetal heartbeat, accompanied by a doctor\u2019s narration: an approach that some people, like Mr. Trump, might welcome as a \u201cpunishment\u201d for women seeking abortions.And like Mr. Trump, Mr. Miller believes that Muslims belong anywhere but here. One of his Facebook posts suggested we make peace with the Muslim world as we did with Japan \u2014 by using the atomic bomb. In another post, Mr. Miller likened Syrian refugees to rattlesnakes.This is not a guy who is going to raise a stink about building a wall on the southern border \u2014 he\u2019s more likely to lasso illegal crossers with his own rope. Paid for by his campaign contributors, of course.Mimi Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Free-Speech Fatality", "Date": "2016-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 In January 2015, King Abdullah and Queen Rania of Jordan marched in Paris with other world leaders to pay tribute to the murdered cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo and to stand up for freedom of expression. Less than two years later, when Nahed Hattar, a 56-year-old Jordanian writer from a Christian family, shared a cartoon on his Facebook page that some perceived to be mocking God, the Jordanian government swiftly ordered his arrest and charged him with \u201cinsulting religious belief and sentiment.\u201dMr. Hattar deleted the cartoon and clarified that he meant to mock only how the Islamic State\u2019s followers viewed God. When the police went to arrest him and did not find him at home, the governor of Amman called him a \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d before he turned himself in. He was detained for 25 days before being released on bail in early September.Knowingly or not, the government contributed to a wave of incitement and public outrage against Mr. Hattar. That culminated on Sunday, when he was shot dead in front of a courthouse here in Amman, in an unprecedented assassination that sent shock waves throughout a kingdom that boasts about its security and stability above all else.But perhaps people shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Public death threats against Mr. Hattar \u2014 including calls for his execution \u2014 had spread across social media since his arrest. The charges against him gave further legitimacy to the public anger. Some wrote that if the judiciary was lenient with Mr. Hattar, they would take matters into their own hands. None of this prompted the government to take action against those making the threats. The suspect in the killing is a 49-year-old man who preached at a neighborhood mosque and, in 2011, was arrested for beating up a 15-year-old boy who insulted God.The incongruity between the king and queen\u2019s support for the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists and the government\u2019s willingness to help incite against dissidents here is symptomatic. The Jordanian government has always handled anything related to religion this way: On one hand, officials claim to fight radicalization and violent extremism; on the other, they appease fundamentalist Islamists by banning books or censoring films and by claiming to be defenders of Islam.Mr. Hattar\u2019s arrest came while Mr. Qourshah was still in jail. Many believe that the Jordanian authorities were attempting a balancing act, demonstrating that even if they were willing to detain a popular, conservative preacher they were still vigilant about protecting Islam from mockery.This isn\u2019t a new trend. Jordan\u2019s penal code and its press and publication law include numerous articles that prohibit and criminalize speech that insults \u201cthe divine entity\u201d and religious symbols, or \u201cincites sectarian strife.\u201d These crimes are punishable by up to three years in prison. And the laws are vaguely worded, allowing them to be used arbitrarily and selectively.Every year, Jordan\u2019s Media Commission bans dozens of books and poetry collections for reasons that vary from offending the Hashemites and other Arab rulers to insulting Islam to \u201ccontradicting public morals.\u201d In 2014, for example, the commission banned a book of philosophy by a professor of comparative literature at the University of Jordan because it included the phrase \u201cGod is not a good scriptwriter.\u201dIn a statement after Mr. Hattar\u2019s assassination, the government said it would bring the killer to justice and vowed to \u201crespond with an iron fist to anyone who uses this incident as an opportunity to spread hate speech in society.\u201d But this is meaningless as long as the government continues to prosecute free expression on the grounds that it offends one group or another.Tension is high in Jordan today. As authorities claim to press charges against anyone who publishes hate speech after the assassination, hundreds of comments online are either celebrating Mr. Hattar\u2019s killing, or justifying it.If Jordan is going to fight radicalization and violent extremism, it needs to start by upholding the right to free speech. It is not a question of \u201crule of law\u201d when the law is used to restrict freedoms. Mr. Hattar\u2019s assassination may be the first time someone was killed for expressing an opinion in Jordan, but if speech continues to be criminalized and vilified the way it is today, it might not be the last.Advertisement"}

Now the world is changing automobiles \u2014 in a big way.There is much to learn from both articles. For one thing, riding in a self-driving Uber car is kind of boring \u2014 it goes the speed limit and closely obeys all traffic rules, something apparently out of the ordinary in Pittsburgh. The real thrill is being a momentary celebrity for being inside one, as Mr. Isaac found out when people pointed and stared at him while he was riding in the robot car.Uber seems to be taking advantage of that celebrity, and hoping that its early riders help with the company\u2019s marketing. After each ride, Uber will send each passenger a text message with an animated GIF of the route in 3-D, plus a picture of the car. Facebook and Twitter, brace yourselves for a lot of these posts.Uber has a long way to go before truly autonomous vehicles are widespread \u2014 and will truly mess with the company\u2019s current business model of persuading people to drive for it in their own cars.Mr. Manjoo\u2019s ride may be more consequential, at least in the near term.As he tells it, this Chevy has nailed something often important in the car business: excess. Even though the average American drives only about 30 miles a day, electric cars that go 100 miles on a charge still feel as if they might leave someone stranded. The Bolt\u2019s ample range should ease that.In addition, Chevy seems to be making an effort to make the Bolt feel like a luxury vehicle, at a lower price than the very luxurious Tesla. Feeling like a boss on less money \u2014 that is car marketing.That may be the next hurdle, as driving becomes more futuristic, and the futuristic becomes more normal.Advertisement"}

I was having trouble getting someone to tell their full story and was ready to piece together several people\u2019s accounts when I discovered Mr. Siddiqui. I had been posting in Facebook groups dedicated to the crush when one of his relatives connected us.Mr. Siddiqui had been vocal about his experience on social media, and had even made maps to help tell his story. We felt lucky that he was an American because it would help make his experience more relatable to our U.S. readers. It was also surprising since we had not found any other Americans at that point who were involved in the crush.Mr. Siddiqui had identified himself in a wire photograph before we spoke. (He was doing his own research into what had happened.) The photo he found eventually became the lead element of the story.Derek Watkins, my co-author on this piece, and I are both members of the graphics department, and our instincts are to find visual ways of telling stories.The department has a decades-long history of doing its own reporting, so my first task was to do an initial round of research to identify visual opportunities.The piece evolved into a narrative after I interviewed Mr. Siddiqui. It was clear that his personal story could be a powerful backbone to the piece.A lot of official sources (not just Saudi) were not very willing to share information. So, finding the large online community that was created after the crush became crucial to my reporting. People were sharing all kinds of updates, experiences and photos, and it was easier to reach out to witnesses or relatives of victims that way.Because there was such limited information on the disaster, I studied dozens of photographs to fill in some of the gaps in what we knew. For example, the area of the crush had not been reported on previously, but matching photos to locations in Mina\u2019s tent city allowed us to determine that the crush extended at least 1,000 feet, which is almost three football fields in length.Advertisement"}

Fortunately I have a bulletproof vest and a steel ballistic helmet to keep me warm. .\u2008.\u2008. How on earth did I get here?\u201dShe got there by being a \u201cforensic \u00adcyberpsychologist\u201d \u2014 an adviser to Interpol, the F.B.I. and the White House on the psychology of online criminals. This is a much more exciting-sounding job title than the rest of us who write about the dark side of the internet tend to have, and she\u2019s not afraid to play her advantage. She often begins a thought by writing, \u201cAs a forensic cyberpsychologist. .\u2008.\u2008.\u201dEven though our dysfunctional relationship with technology is the story of our times, readers often prejudge books on the topic as boring. So I\u2019d have loved Aiken to continue in this thrilling \u2014 if slightly hacky \u2014 vein. Unfortunately, the raid is over within a couple of pages, and after that \u201cThe Cyber Effect\u201d frequently descends into the familiar trudge of the pop-psychology book.There are the regular research \u00adstudies \u2014 on disinhibition, moral disengagement and deep vein thrombosis \u2014 peppered with anomalous case studies: the boy who played World of Warcraft for 36 hours straight and then jumped out of a window; the 12-year-old Wisconsin girls who stabbed a classmate 19 times while in thrall to Slender Man, a monster they had read about online and misjudged as real. Aiken sometimes ends these horrifying stories noting that this \u201cis an extreme and thankfully uncommon example,\u201d which makes you wonder why she included them. In fact, one of the Slender Man girls later received a diagnosis of early-onset schizophrenia, though Aiken suggests that might have been the internet\u2019s fault too.This is her provocative and at times compelling thesis: The internet \u2014 \u201cthe largest unregulated social experiment of all time,\u201d in the words of the clinical psychologist Michael Seto \u2014 is turning us, as a species, more mentally disordered, anxious, obsessive, narcissistic, exhibitionist, body dysmorphic, psychopathic, schizophrenic. All this might unleash a \u201csurge in deviant, criminal and abnormal behavior in the general population.\u201d We check our mobile devices 1,500 times a week, sometimes even secretly, before the plane\u2019s pilot tells us it\u2019s safe. Our ethics have become so impaired that some of us take selfies in front of people threatening to jump from bridges. (Having spent years with people disproportionately shamed on social media for some minor transgression, I can attest to how the internet can rob people of empathy.)She paints an evocative image of sitting on a train to Galway, watching a woman breast-feed her baby: \u201cThe baby was gazing foggily upward .\u2008.\u2008. looking adoringly at the mother\u2019s jaw, as the mother continued to gaze adoringly at her device.\u201d How will such a seemingly tiny behavioral shift like less eye contact between mother and baby play out over time? Aiken asks. \u201cThis small and simple thing, millions of babies around the world getting less eye contact and less one-on-one attention, could result in an evolutionary blip. Yes, I said it. Evolutionary blip. Less eye contact could change the course of human civilization.\u201dIf you think she\u2019s getting a little overblown here, so do I. She makes important observations but weakens them by wildly overplaying her hand. Take the chapters on online pornography. It\u2019s startling that a generation of 8- to 12-year-olds is learning about sex via easily accessible free porn. And the porn itself is getting more lurid than ever, thanks to the tech world\u2019s devotion to algorithms. \u201cExtreme content and scary scenarios, which always draw the most adult eyeballs, can be presented first .\u2008.\u2008. due to the popularity of the sensational information,\u201d she explains.But then, while writing about how the internet normalizes aberrant sexual behavior, she lays into \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d for introducing \u201cserious paraphilias, sexual sadism disorder and sexual masochism disorder, to the general reading public as a fun and fascinating pastime.\u201d Surely, few of the novel\u2019s millions of readers have fallen into sexual pandemonium. She diagnoses the former New York representative Anthony Weiner \u2014 who resigned from Congress after a sexting scandal \u2014 with \u201cexhibitionistic disorder,\u201d a paraphilia \u201cthat centers on a need to expose one\u2019s genitals to others. .\u2008.\u2008. I call this cyber-\u00adexhibitionism.\u201dAfter labeling Weiner from afar \u2014 never a likable practice, and one that\u2019s been banned as irresponsible by the American Psychiatric Association \u2014 she goes on to sucker-punch him. After he disastrously attempted to run for mayor of New York, reporters asked him what he planned to do next. \u201cHe whipped out his middle finger and flipped the bird,\u201d Aiken writes. \u201cPerhaps the next best thing to the open raincoat.\u201d Actually, Weiner flipped the bird for reasons that had nothing to do with exhibitionism. He was evidently venting his frustration at a media that had, throughout his campaign, fixated on his scandal while ignoring his policies. At times like this, \u201cThe Cyber Effect\u201d can feel like a nasty book.Then there\u2019s the constant unhelpful mental health labeling. Internet trolls have \u201ca set of characteristics that are found together in a cluster: narcissism, sadism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism.\u201d She declares herself scandalized that hypersexual disorder was snubbed for inclusion in the DSM-5, making her a member of a rare group \u2014 someone who thinks there aren\u2019t enough mental disorders in the DSM.In one particularly objectionable passage, she compares a 10-year-old boy showing his school friends a picture of his topless \u201cvery young girlfriend\u201d to adult sex offenders who \u201cgenerate an original indecent image of a child\u201d to prove they have \u201caccess to a victim \u2014 and to original content.\u201d While troubling, a middle schooler sharing photographs of his middle-school girlfriend with his peers does not equate to a propensity toward child pornography. Assertions like that are a small step from advocating that children be criminalized and placed on the sex offenders\u2019 registry for this kind of behavior. (To her credit she later notes that law enforcement should differentiate between \u201cteenage voluntary sexual exploration\u201d and the \u201ccriminal generation of child abuse material.\u201d So why liken the two so alarmingly herself?)Given that Aiken is a forensic cyberpsychologist, it\u2019s no surprise that she tends to advocate \u201cmore governance\u201d and \u201cmore regulation.\u201d But there\u2019s something a little \u201cReefer Madness\u201d about this book. I wish it were less stigmatizing and more humanizing. Not every troll is a \u00adpsychopath.Still, I nodded vigorously at times \u2014 especially at Aiken\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe greatest trick social media and telecom companies ever pulled is trying to convince us that they can do nothing about cyberbullying.\u201d Try complaining to Twitter when you\u2019ve been subjected to abuse on their platform. You\u2019ll almost certainly get a form letter telling you the abuse isn\u2019t in contravention of their policies.But then Aiken undermines her case by accusing \u201cdevice manufacturers\u201d and \u201cinternet providers\u201d of \u201ccollectively participating in the abuse of that child\u201d when he or she comes across pornography or images of decapitation online. What? That\u2019s Tim Cook\u2019s fault? \u201cAll those complicit should be held accountable,\u201d she writes. \u201cMark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have pledged to donate 99 percent of their Facebook shares to the cause of human advancement. That represents about $45 billion at Facebook\u2019s current valuation. I would respectfully suggest that all of this money be directed toward human problems associated with social media.\u201dOh, come on! All of it? While sporadically absorbing, \u201cThe Cyber Effect,\u201d like the internet, frequently takes things out of proportion and creates hysteria from fragments.Jon Ronson is the author of \u201cSo You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed.\u201d His forthcoming series on sex and the internet \u2014 \u201cThe Butterfly Effect\u201d \u2014 is being produced by Audible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Apologizes for Overstating Video Metrics", "Date": "2016-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook apologized on Friday for an error in the way it measured video viewership, a miscalculation that greatly overstated how much time, on average, its users were spending watching videos.The incorrect numbers were displayed to partners, including advertisers and publishers, for more than two years, as Facebook aggressively challenged YouTube for online video dominance and urged partners to embrace video publishing and advertising on the platform.While Facebook called the problem a \u201cdiscrepancy,\u2019\u2019 it is a troublesome admission for major advertising agencies and publishers that rely on Facebook\u2019s metrics to assess their investments on the platform \u2014 whether a 15-second ad or a lengthy video production.It is also likely to add to advertisers\u2019 long-held frustrations with Facebook and other internet platforms over how closely they guard valuable audience data, and the limits the tech companies place on outside measurement companies.\u201cAbout a month ago, we found an error in the way we calculate one of the video metrics on our dashboard \u2014 average duration of video viewed,\u201d wrote David Fischer, a vice president of video and marketing partnerships for Facebook, in a post on Friday. \u201cWhile this is only one of the many metrics marketers look at, we take any mistake seriously,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur clients\u2019 trust and belief in our metrics is essential to us, and we have to earn that trust.\u201dAdvertisers, however, buy Facebook video according to different metrics: either by \u201cimpressions,\u201d which are measured as soon as a user sees a video in the news feed, or in 10-second views.\u201cAverage duration of video viewed\u201d is neither a public metric nor does it determine how much advertisers pay for video placement. But the figure is displayed prominently in partners\u2019 dashboards, and it has helped assuage discomfort about the platform\u2019s generous view-counting methods.While Facebook\u2019s update last month largely passed under the radar, Mr. Fischer\u2019s post on Friday was prominent and contrite. \u201cWe sincerely apologize for the issues this has created for our clients,\u201d he wrote.Facebook has made a number of stumbles lately that it has had to scramble to fix. In May, it grappled with reports that editors of its Trending Topics \u2014 which displays some of the most talked-about stories on the social network \u2014 were suppressing conservative content. The company later laid off the Trending Topics team.\u201cWe see a world where video is first, with video at the heart of all of our apps and services,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call with investors at the time.Advertisers are unlikely to cut back or change spending on Facebook in a big way because of the metric error, but it could affect \u201clarger brand-focused advertisers who may have been influenced to alter their budget planning\u2019\u2019 based on Facebook\u2019s previous data, said Brian Wieser, a media industry analyst at Pivotal Research in New York.It could also benefit companies with digital video inventory like YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat, he added.Above all, it reinforces the importance of outside measurement when it comes to data from Facebook and other media companies.\u201cWhile publishers\u2019 data has the potential to be more accurate, it also has the potential to be more inflated,\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThis risk supports an ongoing role for third parties in the field of measurement.\u201dJill Sherman, senior vice president for social strategy at the agency DigitasLBi, noted that the metric was one of many that influences investment decisions in Facebook video and that it remained a viable platform for brands. Still, she said, Facebook\u2019s acknowledgment could make it harder for it to compete with YouTube.\u201cIf the data suggested that people were staying with video longer on the Facebook platform, that\u2019s an indication people were starting to use the Facebook platform similar to a platform like YouTube,\u201d she said in an interview. That would be a crucial \u201cbehavioral shift,\u201d she said.With the new revelation about the error, she added, \u201cthe implication is really there that how we\u2019ve been perceiving the evolution of the Facebook platform may be off.\u2019\u2019In a statement on Friday, a Publicis Media spokesman said: \u201cWe take the job of being stewards of our clients\u2019 investments very seriously.

{"Headline": "Young Rural Women in India Chase Big-City Dreams", "Date": "2016-09-24", "News": "Experiments like one in Bangalore, luring migrants to fill factory jobs, collide with an old way of life that keeps women and girls in seclusion until an arranged marriage.Supported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 The factory floor is going full throttle when the new girls walk in. Everywhere is the thrumming of sewing machines, the hum of fans, the faint burning smell of steam irons. On narrow tables that run between the machines, half-assembled Marks & Spencer miniskirts are thrust forward by fistfuls. The tailors, absorbed in the task of finishing 100 pieces per hour, for once turn their heads to look.The new girls smell of the village. They have sprinklings of pimples. They woke well before dawn to prepare themselves for their first day of work, leaning over one another\u2019s faces in silence to shape the edges of each eyebrow with a razor blade. Their braids bounce to their hips, tight and glossy, as if woven by a surgeon. On their ankles are silver chains hung with bells, so when they walk in a group, they jingle.But it is impossible to hear this sound over the racket on the factory floor. The tailors glance up for only a moment, long enough to take in an experiment. The new workers \u2014 teenagers, most of them \u2014 have been recruited from remote villages to help factories like this one meet the global demand for cheap garments. But there is also social engineering going on.Experiments like the one in Bangalore run against deep currents in India, whose guiding voice, Mohandas K. Gandhi, envisioned a socialist future built on the small-scale economy of the village. They also collide spectacularly with an old way of life, in which girls are kept in seclusion until they can be transferred to another family through arranged marriage.Bangalore is the first city the 37 trainee tailors have seen. They are dazzled by the different kinds of light. Picking their way through the alleys around the factory, a column of virgins from the countryside, they stare up at an apartment building that towers over the neighborhood and wish their mothers could see it.Among them are two sisters, Prabhati and Shashi Das. They have come from a village at the end of a road, a place so conservative that the single time they went to a movie theater, their male cousins and uncles created a human chain around them, their big hands linked, to protect them from any contact with outside men. They are, as far as they know, the first unmarried women who have ever migrated from the village to work.Neighbors in the village are waiting to see what happens. The nasty ones say, with obvious relish, it will end badly. They whisper about migrant workers whose eyes were removed by organ traders while they slept. They say Prabhati and Shashi will be \u201cused this way and that.\u201dStill, they go. Prabhati, at 21, is stubborn and able, and Shashi, two years her junior, pretty and fizzing with suppressed laughter. The two sisters hook pinkies when they walk down the lane that leads to the factory.\u201cAll the flirts and ruffians in the whole world must have been born on this lane,\u201d Shashi grumbles, but she is laughing. Attention is like water to her.The sisters are waiting, too, to see what will happen to them. They are both at the age when they could be summoned at any moment to be displayed to a family of strangers as a potential daughter-in-law. And each of them wants something else, something impossible.It is late May, the first day of their factory summer \u2014 of love letters folded into squares and dropped onto work stations; of fevers sweated out on the floor of a bare hostel room; of supervisors shouting in a language they do not understand, a couple of words \u2014 \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cfaster\u201d \u2014 gradually becoming clear; of capitalism, of men and of a bit of freedom.It all started in March, in the drippy jungle of rural Odisha, when two distant relatives happened to meet on the roadside.One of the men had found employment as a \u201cmobilizer\u201d for Gram Tarang, a for-profit agency contracted by India\u2019s government to recruit and train workers. He mentioned that Gram Tarang was offering a cash incentive \u2014 roughly 450 rupees, or about $6.75, a head \u2014 to mobilizers who identified young women willing to enroll in a training program for garment factory jobs.The second man, Hemant Das, perked up, sensing the approach of a change of career. Hemant had an underfed look and teeth rimmed with tobacco stains. Among the first college graduates from his family, he had tried his hand at laying bricks, tutoring schoolchildren, programming computers, setting up wedding tents and waiting tables before finally falling back on the only job widely available to men here, working as a field hand for 200 rupees a day.Hemant was from a village called Ishwarpur, and as it happened, idle young women were something Ishwarpur had in great quantity. That they could be monetized came as good news.On its economic merits alone, Hemant figured, the government scheme would prove tempting: After two months of training, their daughters would be placed in a factory in the industrial center of Bangalore, where they would earn the legal minimum wage, 7,187 rupees per month, or about $108, which is more than most of their fathers make. Six months after arriving in Bangalore, they would be free to return home if they wished.Hemant set out the next day with a fistful of pamphlets and an uncharacteristically sunny disposition. But as he made his rounds of local families \u2014 30 of them, at least \u2014 they shook their heads. No. \u201cLetting go of female children is dishonorable, in itself,\u201d explained Pramanand Das, who presides over an informal family council.Minati Das, the mother of a 19-year-old, got to the point quicker. \u201cNot everyone wants a daughter-in-law who is a working woman,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think she has lost her chastity.\u201dThe village had its own plan for these young women. Upon reaching adulthood, they would be transferred to the guardianship of another family, along with a huge dowry that serves as an incentive to treat them well. The transfer is final. Once married, the new bride cannot return to visit her parents without permission, which is given sparingly, so that the bonds to her old home will weaken.She must show her submission to the new family: She is not allowed to speak the names of her in-laws, because it is seen as too familiar, and in some places she is not allowed to use words that begin with the same letters as her in-laws\u2019 names, requiring the invention of a large parallel vocabulary. Each morning, before she is allowed to eat, the daughter-in-law must wash the feet of her husband\u2019s parents and then drink the water she has used to wash them.Hemant would have been completely out of luck if he had not thought to try Karuna Das, who had two daughters of marriageable age. Karuna was a sinewy day laborer, and he had roamed far from the village in his younger days to work in iron foundries in Chennai and Hyderabad. The gossip was that Karuna agreed to enroll his eldest daughters because he was unable to scrape together 100,000 rupees for dowries. That was undoubtedly the case.It was also true that Karuna did not care much what other people said. He had never behaved like a poor man. When word spread that he had agreed to send Prabhati and Shashi, the village elders convened emergency meetings to determine whether this violated \u201cpurdah,\u201d or separation between the sexes, and whether this would damage the marriage prospects of their own daughters. Women stopped by to tease the girl\u2019s mother, Radha Rani, who wept inconsolably.It turned out that Karuna had not been asking for permission. He instructed his daughters to pack four or five changes of clothes. Go see what the world is like, he told them. \u201cThey were reluctant to go anywhere because they were a bit scared,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them being scared is O.K. O.K., you\u2019re scared. Now you have to move on.\u201dPrabhati has never seen a train, much less ridden in one, and on the 33-hour journey to Bangalore the earth seems to heave under her. As miles of paddy fields slide by, she vomits. Thatch roofs are replaced by peaked roofs, and she vomits. When they reach south India, rain begins to hit the window in fat spatters.It had come as news to Prabhati that the training program involved traveling 900 miles. But some intention had hardened within her. She wanted to prove the neighbors wrong. She did not care about her marriage prospects because, after examining the marriages that surrounded her in Ishwarpur, she decided she did not want to marry at all.\u201cI will go to Bangalore,\u201d she told her parents. \u201cIf I come back, then you can get me married. If I don\u2019t come back, you can\u2019t get me married.\u201dShashi sits beside her retching sister and strokes her back. She had not wanted to come. Happy enough with a future as a housewife, she had focused her energy on making mischief. Among friends, she introduced herself as \u201c45 kilograms of hotness.\u201d Out of the corner of her mouth came a stream of dirty jokes, and she made the other girls dissolve in helpless laughter by comparing breast sizes to vegetables (including, mournfully, a kernel of corn).Working on an assembly line was not Shashi\u2019s idea of fun. But Prabhati plunged forward, and, as usual, Shashi cruised along in her wake.The sisters, lugging a bag of clothes, sit with 35 other girls from Odisha who are making the same journey.They have all dressed in baggy purple-and-gray uniforms, with ID cards swinging from their necks. Their parents had made last-minute attempts to keep them from leaving, which had to be repelled with sustained tantrums. A girl called Baby, who is 18 and bespectacled, said that she had secured her mother\u2019s permission only by refusing to eat for two days.\u201cThey wanted me to come home,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not going home.\u201dThe Gram Tarang instructors had taught them an anthem about self-sufficiency, and they sing it on their journey to Bangalore, again and again, for comfort.The sun has not yet risen when they arrive at the hostel that will be their new home for the next six months: 137 women in 15 unfurnished rooms, every inch covered with girlish flotsam, underwear and bras drying on the window grates, sentimental verses penciled on the walls.Prabhati and Shashi\u2019s room is being painted, so on the first night 25 of them crowd into two rooms, so tight that one of their roommates stretches out on the kitchen counter. \u201cI thought there would be beds,\u201d murmurs one, and the chaperone from Gram Tarang looks exasperated.\u201cThey complain, \u2018You could have given us this, you could have given us that,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWe sweetly explain that it is not possible. They don\u2019t have the bed system in Bangalore.\u201dBut the girls are too keyed up to sleep. Climbing onto the roof, they can see the sun rising over a landscape of other roofs, where, in all directions, migrants seek a breath of quiet. There they can gaze up at the 22nd story of an apartment building, where residents come out to hang their laundry on balconies. It is the most amazing thing they have ever seen: big people looking tiny.\u201cI want to see what I haven\u2019t seen,\u201d murmurs one of the girls, sleepily. \u201cI want to see what I don\u2019t even know exists.\u201dBaby says something about her eventual return to India, and when someone corrects her, she looks up sharply.\u201cBangalore is in India?\u201d she asks.For the first few weeks, everything is new. Stepping out of the hostel, the trainees are surrounded by men: Men on balconies, men on scooters, men lounging in doorways, staring. The road is plastered with signs saying \u201ctailors wanted,\u201d and one girl gives a yelp of alarm, mistaking them for wanted posters.On the day of a Hindu festival, Prabhati peers down from the roof at a troupe of transgender dancers, smiling and twitching suggestively as men press in around them. When one bends down so that an onlooker can stick a folded bill in her cleavage, Prabhati is so shocked that she has an impulse to reach for a stone and throw it.\u201cIf this happened in the village,\u201d she says, \u201cyou would all be dead.\u201dIn rural Odisha they like to say that \u201ca girl\u2019s shyness is her jewelry.\u201d But here, there is no space for the newcomers unless they make space for themselves. To cross the street \u2014 a throbbing two-lane road coursing with auto rickshaws, clattering cargo trucks, scooters carrying whole families \u2014 requires stepping in front of the slower-moving vehicles, if necessary stopping them with their bodies. The girls waver, and then they plunge.Much of what they learned in the village must be unlearned here. One evening when Baby begins preparing dinner, several of her roommates protest. She is menstruating, and caste tradition dictates that menstruating women must live in isolation, sleeping alone and taking care not to step into the kitchen, lest they contaminate the food and water. So two of the younger roommates cook, emerging an hour later with a glutinous, inedible glop. At this point, Baby is irritated. Menstruating women are allowed to work in the factory, aren\u2019t they? She walks into the kitchen, and the scent of spices and onions fills the room. After a brief discussion, they agree that the menstruation rules will be void for as long as they are living in Bangalore. Then they stuff themselves with food and fall into a deep sleep.When they are introduced to a factory supervisor and dive to touch her feet, a traditional gesture of respect toward elders, the supervisor jumps back as if she has been stuck with a hot poker. She then assumes a slight crouch, as if preparing to defend herself from further reverence.Back in their bedrooms, the girls laugh hysterically at this. From childhood, they have been told that it is disrespectful for a girl to laugh out loud in the presence of elders. In the event of irrepressible laughter, girls must cover their mouths with anything at hand: the corner of a dupatta, a hand, a washcloth. This lesson, too, flies out the window. In the hostel they laugh like tractors. They laugh so loud they spit their water out.\u201cI\u2019m giving you 25 seconds to thread this needle,\u201d the supervisor says in Hindi. The recruits, whose native language is Oriya, barely understand. Thirty-seven tailors bend their heads, trying to guide frayed threads through a maze of eight loops.At the K. Mohan & Company Exports Private Limited, the girls have entered a world of machines: massive industrial extractors, laser cutters, a rapid-response protocol that kicks in when a needle tip breaks off.And yet, incredibly, garments worn in the West are still made by humans \u2014 nearly all of them women, working exhausting hours, with few legal protections and little chance of advancement, for some of the lowest wages in the global supply chain.As the trainees practice sewing straight lines on pieces of scrap fabric, supervisors pace the aisle, hoping to spot one with machinelike dexterity and speed. One of them slows, and then stops, beside a girl called Cuddles, the daughter of a truck driver. The supervisor blinks, looks again. This is \u2014 there is no other word for it \u2014 talent. She has covered the fabric with seams as straight as the lines on ruled notebook paper.Cuddles is among the first in the group to be integrated into an assembly line, bent over, eyes straining. Her task is to stitch together three small tags for the Marks & Spencer stretch corduroy skirt: one that identifies the brand, one that gives washing instructions and one the size, a scrap so tiny that it is nearly impossible to hold straight between finger and thumb. If she allows a tag to slip to the floor, or fly away in the gusts from the ceiling fan, her salary will be docked. She will be under pressure to complete this task 100 times per hour for eight hours, with one half-hour break for lunch, for a base daily wage of around $2.A man with a loft of dyed black hair steps out of his office to greet the group. This is N. Manjunath, the assistant general manager for human resources at the factory. He is recruiting rural workers through the government program because he is desperate: City-dwellers are no longer interested in factory jobs like these, with their low pay and punishing conditions, and attrition rates are high. Migrant women are more docile. This is what Manjunath is hoping.Prabhati, Shashi and the other recruits take seats in a canteen, and sit with their hands folded in their laps. They are to work every day but Sunday. They can collect their pension in 40 years. Should they die on the job, state health insurance will cover funeral costs.They are drowsy. The numbers fly by them in flocks. When a response is expected, they chorus \u201cYes, miss,\u201d or \u201cYes, sir,\u201d as they would to a schoolmaster.Any questions?\u201cCan we work on Sundays?\u201dManjunath thinks of himself as a kind man. But the complications of employing village girls have strained his last nerve: the weepy petitions for leave to return to the village for essential functions, like a father having a hemorrhoid removed; the domestic squabbles, which on one occasion ended in the consumption of toilet cleaner; and the \u201clove cases,\u201d in which a tailor, upon forming a romantic attachment in the factory, is summarily ordered home.Lately, when the girls come to him with complaints, he listens skeptically, with a sardonic smile. He assesses this latest batch of recruits, the second from Odisha, as \u201clackadaisical.\u201d He believes they have come here for an adventure, and will gravitate back to the village as soon as their parents tell them to come home.He is right to worry. After six months on the job, when the government incentives are paid out, around half the trainees brought in by Gram Tarang return to their villages. Only 40 percent stay longer than a year.It comes down to this: If the village has a plan for the girls, so does the factory. Leading them through the rows of machines, Manjunath wags his finger.\u201cDon\u2019t get married too soon,\u201d he warns them.Within two weeks of their arrival, one of the sisters\u2019 roommates has eloped straight from the factory gates, not even stopping by the hostel to pick up her clothes. Those who remain spill their secrets to one another. Tanushree Behera sleeps entangled with a girl she calls her wife. Jayasmita Behera is divorced, having left her husband less than two weeks after the wedding.\u201cIf I had stayed,\u201d she says, \u201cmy life would have been destroyed.\u201dSitting cross-legged on the floor, they compare notes on evasive maneuvers they use to avoid being shown to prospective in-laws, like Roadrunner slipping away from Wile E. Coyote. Shradhanjali Mallick, the beauty among them, says she used to have success with bouts of hysterical crying, but that moving to Bangalore has been more effective. \u201cHow can they marry me off if I am not physically present?\u201d she asks innocently, and Prabhati laughs. \u201cLet them hold a wedding of mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the only kind of wedding they will be able to pull off.\u201dThis is not something Prabhati can laugh about at home. Her views on marriage were set in stone several years back, when a young wife in her village was set on fire in a domestic dispute. Prabhati has been arguing for years that she should be allowed to remain single, that her parents should proceed to fixing a marriage for Shashi, who is pretty and will get better offers. \u201cI will become a nun,\u201d she says. But her parents flick away her comment, casually, as if it were a fly. So she thinks of escape.This is a subject she cannot discuss with her sister. Three years ago, Prabhati came across a mobile phone that a secret boyfriend gave Shashi as a way of keeping in touch, rigged, as if for espionage, with no audible sound or light, to be switched on at times when they have agreed to speak. Prabhati snatched the phone away and informed her father. Shashi screamed at her father that day \u2014 don\u2019t break that phone! \u2014 but she never saw it again. For months, she could not look him in the eye.The sisters were never as close again. When it comes to the future, Prabhati and Shashi keep their own counsel.By the first week of June, the new girls are praying for Sunday to arrive. Their joints hurt. Their backs hurt. They come home from the factory with fingers punctured by needles or sliced by industrial clippers. Sitting still for eight hours is strange and new, and at times, the boredom is maddening. They sing to their machines. They pull hairs out of their chins. Baby amuses herself by giving herself little scratches on the wrist.They are locked into the hostel except for \u201cout passes\u201d on alternate Sundays, which are granted by the factory human resources staff. A Gram Tarang \u201clife skills\u201d instructor makes the rounds inside the hostel, selling them 600-rupee jars of an Herbalife energy drink, which she tells them will help them keep up with the pace of work in the factory. It does give them energy \u2014 it includes caffeine and maltodextrin \u2014 but it also gives them diarrhea and eats up their remaining cash. This is no small problem, because they are running out of money for food.They count the days until June 10, when they will be paid for their first two weeks of work. Prabhati and Shashi, who had left home with 5,000 rupees, or about $75, find themselves with 100 rupees between them. \u201cIf there\u2019s no salary today, it\u2019s going to be a problem,\u201d Prabhati says.On June 10, they are not paid. Three more days pass, and they still are not paid. Outside the factory window the sky has turned black and the air is churning; a curtain of monsoon rain is about to sweep in.About 15 girls walk into Manjunath\u2019s office, hearts pounding, to demand their pay. He looks up from his desk, annoyed. The usual genial expression has vanished from his face. He explains that he cannot solve their problem: The company has opened bank accounts for them, but the bank has not delivered their A.T.M. cards. Anyway, he dismisses the suggestion that the girls are running out of money. And who, he wonders, has given them the idea that they can make demands? He surveys the group in search of its leader.\u201cMy clear understanding is that if you have a basket of fruits and only one is not good, it will spoil the other fruit,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou have to take one out.\u201dWhen Jayasmita steps forward to say they have not eaten since yesterday, he swivels his head in her direction. He does not speak Oriya. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d he asks a caseworker.The girls are promised an advance for rice and are ordered to leave his office. They shuffle out. They had been planning to stop working unless they were paid immediately, but their strike has lasted less than five minutes. Jayasmita slumps against a wall, and vows never to try anything like that again.\u201cWhen you come to a new city,\u201d she says, \u201cyou have to learn to care for yourself, and not bother with others.\u201dThe money for the first two weeks\u2019 work comes through three or four days later \u2014 after withholdings for pension, health insurance, lodging, food and kitchen furnishings, a grand total of 1,874 rupees, or roughly $28. This sum must last them for the next month. In the hostel room where Prabhati and Shashi stay, the amount of the paycheck is not relevant. They have never earned money before, only asked their fathers for it. A wave of happiness washes over all of them. They do not feel like girls, they say: They feel like boys.They transfer credit \u2014 30 rupees, 50 rupees \u2014 to the cellphones of their mothers, brothers, sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law and boyfriends, as if they were distributing sweets to celebrate some windfall.Unable to wait, they call their families from cubbyhole A.T.M.s to share the news. This is not always welcome. Cuddles transfers a balance of 50 rupees to her father\u2019s phone, but he considers it shameful to accept money from a daughter. He calls her, angrily, to say, \u201cNever do that again.\u201d Cuddles doesn\u2019t care; she has never been so happy.Prabhati and Shashi are among the last to receive their A.T.M. cards. They find a bank machine in between Krishna Jewelers & Pawnbrokers and Blooming Buds India Playschool. Leaving the A.T.M., Prabhati feels joy, but she is not the type of person who shows it. She scans the street, looking for some way to celebrate, and finally asks a man if she can borrow his bicycle for a moment. She climbs on top of it and pedals as hard as she can, her braid flying behind her. Then, taking note of his look of worry, she swings the bicycle around and returns it to its owner.Shashi dances down the stairs and most of the way home. The money sends a wild thrill through her, so that she wishes she could fast-forward through the next month, and the month after that, and after that. So that life is a long string of paydays.The two sisters make a pact: They will stay in Bangalore at least a year. They spend much of their paychecks on nose rings for each other, tiny specks of 22-carat gold. They place them on each other in front of their roommates, beaming, their faces so close together that they could be kissing.Then Prabhati lies down on her stomach, full length, cheek to the cool linoleum. She is not feeling well.It is strange that one of the first girls to falter is Prabhati, who was the most resolute about staying in Bangalore.She has contracted a fever that comes and goes for two weeks. She stops eating and then stops talking; her eyes are so hollow that you could place a handful of rice in them. Shashi stays home, combing her sister\u2019s hair and forcing her to bathe.Minati Mahji, who has lived in the hostel for six years, observes them wearily. Of 130 women who arrived at the same time, only she and her four roommates have stuck it out. She tried switching to another factory, but it was no better, and she wound up back in the hostel. Her pay has crept up to 9,800 rupees, or $146 per month.She has seen wave after wave of young women arrive from the countryside, freshly hatched, and she knows how it usually ends \u2014 with the girl\u2019s disappearance into that old world as a daughter-in-law. \u201cWhatever they are planning, it doesn\u2019t happen like that,\u201d she says.Even through her fever, Prabhati knows she wants to stay. She tries to keep her illness from her family, handing her crisp new 500-rupee bills to a street-corner doctor who seems to give all his injections in the buttocks. It is Shashi who tells their father that her sister is sick. Her father calls the Gram Tarang training center, demanding that Prabhati be sent home, and the training center calls the factory.On the day she is to board a train to return to Ishwarpur, Prabhati stands at the edge of the roof, tears streaming down her face, and watches her younger sister walk down the lane toward the factory.The mood in the hostel sags. \u201cThe day she left, she told me: \u2018I told you I would stay a year. And I couldn\u2019t even stay for two months,\u2019 \u201d Jayasmita recounts.Minati doubts Prabhati will return. The family, having violated custom once by letting the daughters go, is not likely to do it twice. \u201cPeople mean to come back,\u201d Minati says. \u201cBut they don\u2019t come back.\u201dOn the assembly line, someone covers Prabhati\u2019s sewing machine with plastic sheeting. Three weeks later, two burly men come to push it to an area marked \u201cidle machines.\u201dJust like that, Prabhati is back in her mother\u2019s thatch hut, feeding kindling into a clay oven. Coming home is like falling into cotton. Rice is sprouting up through great reflective planes of water, so vivid it hurts your eyes to look at it.The neighbors stop by, seeking an outcome to the family\u2019s experiment. \u201cSo, are your daughters back from their jobs?\u201d asks one, in a voice thick with self-satisfaction.Prabhati\u2019s mother, Radha Rani, takes her to a country witch, who traces shapes around her head with a broom and declares that someone has cast an evil eye on her. He blows on her, a holy wind. Outside there is the smell of things growing. Prabhati sleeps as if she is under a spell. When she calls her sister, hoping to arrange for her return to Bangalore, Shashi sounds far away.It turns out factory life agrees with Shashi. She has been absorbed into an assembly line expected to produce 100 pairs of khaki chinos an hour. In the morning she takes her seat among hillocks of pants, and spends the next eight and a half hours in a work-trance, punctuated by the shouting of supervisors and a half-hour break for lunch. A whiteboard lists the per-hour target. They are always behind.Behind her in the assembly line, a potbellied man in his late 30s peppers her with the gustatory queries that pass for small talk in south India. Have you eaten today? Are you hungry? Do you want to eat more? She swivels in her chair to ask him, \u201cWould you like me to shove these pants down your throat?\u201dShashi finds it interesting that she, the screw-up in the family, is the one becoming a city person. She examines her face in the mirror for signs that she is becoming paler. She tells the family that Prabhati should not return, and that she cannot send money home this month. Instead, Shashi arranges for a meeting with Sunil, a boy from a neighboring village whom she wants to marry.Six years ago, when Sunil first asked Shashi to meet him in person, she was escorted by a female cousin and was too shy to look at Sunil\u2019s face. When he sat on the chair, she would go to the bed. When he went to the bed, she would go to the chair. Finally he told her to stop and listen. She sat still. Whatever it was he said to her, it made her feel that he was her own.\u201cI love him, you know?\u201d she says. \u201cI do not know whether he is good or bad.\u201dSince that day three years ago when Prabhati discovered the cellphone Sunil had given her, Shashi has been proceeding cautiously with a plan to persuade her parents to agree to her choice for a husband. She and Sunil have chosen names, Situ and Sukhi, for a girl and boy. \u201cIf I work for a long time,\u201d she says, \u201cand I really insist on it, there is a chance.\u201dNow that her sister is gone, it is no longer necessary for Shashi to keep this a secret. It is a blessed relief, like taking off a shoe that is cutting into a tender part of your foot.On the August day when her third paycheck comes in, Shashi doesn\u2019t tell anyone what she has planned. Leaving the hostel means breaking curfew, but she persuades her friends to go with her. The small group threads its way along the darkening street, past rotting cauliflower and coconut shells. The girls are headed to a bright shop where smartphones are displayed in glass cases.The shopkeeper is about 25, his shirt unbuttoned to reveal a glint of gold chain. He has seen many girls like these, provincials, fishing out coins at the vegetable market. He does not hide his disdain. But when Shashi announces that she wants to buy a 4,000-rupee Lava A59 smartphone, he is suddenly wide awake, respectful.Shashi\u2019s face is a mask of concentration as she repeatedly counts the bills and arranges them into a fan to show the shopkeeper. The girls around her are hushed. The amount is more than half her month\u2019s pay. It is the weightiest decision she has ever made.When they step back onto the street, something flickers across Shashi\u2019s face \u2014 triumph \u2014 and she pumps her fist. Back at the hostel, she drops her new purchase into the hands of her roommates, who immediately go through it, looking for WhatsApp, which they discovered the week before.Sunil will be calling soon. He has been badgering Shashi to make this purchase so she can send pictures over the internet. She disappears into the bathroom to splash cold water on her face. She is gone a long time. She lies for a moment on the floor, staring at the ceiling. Then she dials a number in the village.\u201cElder sister,\u201d she says. \u201cI got my phone!\u201dSeptember has arrived, and every day there is a new reason Prabhati cannot return to Bangalore. Her mother has stomach cramps. Her younger siblings\u2019 tuition bills are due. No adult male is available to accompany her on the train journey. Prabhati mentally reviews the cost of the ticket: 1,350 rupees for the train, 300 more for the auto rickshaw from Majestic Station. She jokes, a little nervously, that she should steal the money. A voice in her head tells her that if she doesn\u2019t go now, she never will.And yet that voice is becoming fainter. She can feel the village\u2019s drowsy peace overtaking her. Her mother says, in an offhand way, that it is time to start finding a groom. This is not how it was supposed to go. Shashi ensconced in the city, and Prabhati stuck in Ishwarpur. \u201cBefore, I was at home, and I didn\u2019t know anything, and it was O.K.,\u201d she says, dully. \u201cNow I know something, and it\u2019s not O.K.\u201dBack in Bangalore, the factory girls\u2019 fathers have begun to call. They expect them to come home on leave in December, after the six-month factory stint is up.Jayasmita\u2019s father says a marriage proposal has come from a man in Cattuck. \u201cI tell them I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cThe moment I heard talk about marriage, I hung up.\u201d Shradhanjali says she will return, and plans to wriggle out of yet another proposal. \u201cIf possible, I\u2019ll fight it off,\u201d she says, but sounds uncertain.\u201cYou know where you\u2019ll find her in a year?\u201d Jayasmita says, teasingly. \u201cAt her in-laws.\u201dThe factory girls seem less afraid every month.Shashi sees her boyfriend, Sunil, as planned. He takes the overnight train in from Kerala, where he has migrated for work. They meet at a nearby gas station and walk in a park for most of the day, holding hands. At 4 p.m., he returns to the train station and boards another overnight train back to Kerala. She uses Facebook and WhatsApp to communicate with him, as if the internet were two tin cans attached by a piece of twine. Every time they get into a fight, she uninstalls the apps.Her smartphone has become an appendage. She presses it to her ear while she is walking down the lane, striding over rats flattened into the pavement. Waking in the night, she rolls over and checks it for new messages. A group of her friends are toying with the idea of leaving the hostel, seeking higher-paid work at another factory.She is amazed at how far she has come.On an outing last Sunday, she arranged to meet a male cousin, another migrant worker, and a group of them strolled together at the edge of a highway overpass, breathing in the exhaust from 12 lanes of traffic. They don\u2019t have money to step into a restaurant, so they sit on a pipe on the ground outside a Toyota dealership, in the bright sunshine, comparing phones.That\u2019s another thing: Shashi and her friends are not the new girls anymore. The new girls are arriving from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. Their braids are tight and glossy. Dropping their bags in their rooms, they climb up to the roof to gaze at the 22-story building, which is the most amazing thing they have ever seen.Their eyes widen at the girls from Odisha, in their jeans and T-shirts. The girls from Odisha regard them with friendly condescension. They invite them into their rooms, as if they\u2019ve been here forever.This article was reported over four months by Ellen Barry in Bangalore and Ishwarpur, India.

{"Headline": "How Tech Giants Are Devising Real Ethics for Artificial Intelligence", "Date": "2016-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For years, science-fiction moviemakers have been making us fear the bad things that artificially intelligent machines might do to their human creators. But for the next decade or two, our biggest concern is more likely to be that robots will take away our jobs or bump into us on the highway.Now five of the world\u2019s largest tech companies are trying to create a standard of ethics around the creation of artificial intelligence. While science fiction has focused on the existential threat of A.I. to humans, researchers at Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and those from Amazon, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft have been meeting to discuss more tangible issues, such as the impact of A.I. on jobs, transportation and even warfare.Tech companies have long overpromised what artificially intelligent machines can do. In recent years, however, the A.I. field has made rapid advances in a range of areas, from self-driving cars and machines that understand speech, like Amazon\u2019s Echo device, to a new generation of weapons systems that threaten to automate combat.The specifics of what the industry group will do or say \u2014 even its name \u2014 have yet to be hashed out. But the basic intention is clear: to ensure that A.I. research is focused on benefiting people, not hurting them, according to four people involved in the creation of the industry partnership who are not authorized to speak about it publicly.One main concern for people in the tech industry would be if regulators jumped in to create rules around their A.I. work. So they are trying to create a framework for a self-policing organization, though it is not clear yet how that will function.\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that there should be no regulation,\u201d said Peter Stone, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the authors of the Stanford report. \u201cWe\u2019re saying that there is a right way and a wrong way.\u201dWhile the tech industry is known for being competitive, there have been instances when companies have worked together when it was in their best interests. In the 1990s, for example, tech companies agreed on a standard method for encrypting e-commerce transactions, laying the groundwork for two decades of growth in internet business.The authors of the Stanford report, which is titled \u201cArtificial Intelligence and Life in 2030,\u201d argue that it will be impossible to regulate A.I. \u201cThe study panel\u2019s consensus is that attempts to regulate A.I. in general would be misguided, since there is no clear definition of A.I. (it isn\u2019t any one thing), and the risks and considerations are very different in different domains,\u201d the report says.One recommendation in the report is to raise the awareness of and expertise about artificial intelligence at all levels of government, Dr. Stone said. It also calls for increased public and private spending on A.I.\u201cThere is a role for government and we respect that,\u201d said David Kenny, general manager for IBM\u2019s Watson artificial intelligence division. The challenge, he said, is \u201ca lot of times policies lag the technologies.\u201dA memorandum is being circulated among the five companies with a tentative plan to announce the new organization in the middle of September. One of the unresolved issues is that Google DeepMind, an Alphabet subsidiary, has asked to participate separately, according to a person involved in the negotiations.Separately, Reid Hoffman, a founder of LinkedIn who has a background in artificial intelligence, is in discussions with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab to fund a project exploring the social and economic effects of artificial intelligence.Both the M.I.T. effort and the industry partnership are trying to link technology advances more closely to social and economic policy issues. The M.I.T. group has been discussing the idea of designing new A.I. and robotic systems with \u201csociety in the loop.\u201dThe phrase is a reference to the long-running debate about designing computer and robotic systems that still require interaction with humans. For example, the Pentagon has recently begun articulating a military strategy that calls for using A.I. in which humans continue to control killing decisions, rather than delegating that responsibility to machines.\u201cThe key thing that I would point out is computer scientists have not been good at interacting with the social scientists and the philosophers,\u201d said Joichi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times. \u201cWhat we want to do is support and reinforce the social scientists who are doing research which will play a role in setting policies.\u201dThe Stanford report attempts to define the issues that citizens of a typical North American city will face in computers and robotic systems that mimic human capabilities. The authors explore eight aspects of modern life, including health care, education, entertainment and employment, but specifically do not look at the issue of warfare. They said that military A.I. applications were outside their current scope and expertise, but they did not rule out focusing on weapons in the future.The report also does not consider the belief of some computer specialists about the possibility of a \u201csingularity\u201d that might lead to machines that are more intelligent and possibly threaten humans.\u201cIt was a conscious decision not to give credence to this in the report,\u201d Dr. Stone said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet Ends Effort to Create Modular Smartphone", "Date": "2016-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is dropping plans to create a customizable, or modular, smartphone with interchangeable parts, two people briefed on the matter said Thursday.The decision to shelve the effort known as Project Ara comes after the company announced plans in May to release an early version of the product for developers in the fall. Google told partner companies on the project that senior management decided to rethink the initiative as part of a consolidation of its hardware operations, said one of the people.A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. Reuters earlier reported the move to shutter the project.It\u2019s the latest sign of Google\u2019s attempts to bring more financial discipline to a company that had long encouraged ambitious projects without much thought to profitability. Last year, the company moved to a holding company structure, separating the profitable advertising business from the money-losing \u201cmoonshots.\u201d By forcing those projects to report losses publicly, the thinking was that it would help to rein in never-ending investment.The project also suffered from some organizational upheaval. It was part of Google Advanced Technology and Projects, known internally as ATAP, a group headed by Regina Dugan, the former director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Ms. Dugan left Google to spearhead a similar group at Facebook.This led many observers to speculate that Project Ara was dead, but Google said at its developers conference in May that it was moving forward with plans to get the customizable phone in the hands of customers by 2017.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Hero\u2019s Burial for a Long-Dead Dictator", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThese corpses aren\u2019t the only ones in the spotlight. Mr. Duterte, making good on a campaign promise, has ordered the mummified body of our former dictator, Ferdinand E. Marcos, transferred this month to the Cemetery of Heroes here in Manila, the capital.Marcos is notorious as one of history\u2019s great kleptocrats. After declaring martial law in 1972, during his final term, he suspended democracy until his ouster 14 years later. His regime is remembered for its summary executions, torture, rape, enforced disappearances, censorship, electoral fraud and epic corruption. The Marcos family is believed to have plundered as much as $10 billion, only a portion of which has been recovered.This hero\u2019s burial is the latest move to whitewash the Marcos regime\u2019s crimes. In the years since the dictator\u2019s death in 1989, his family has returned from exile unpunished. His wife, Imelda, is a congresswoman; their daughter is a governor. This year, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., known as Bongbong, a former senator, lost by less than a percentage point in his bid for the vice presidency, which is elected separately. His supporters say that the father\u2019s sins are not the son\u2019s, but the younger Mr. Marcos is reported to have blocked attempts by the government to retrieve the missing wealth while at the same time campaigning to regain power and gild his father\u2019s legacy.Several groups of human rights advocates and torture survivors have filed cases against the burial, prompting the Supreme Court to order a 20-day injunction. It will end nearly a week before the proposed Sept. 18 funeral date. Thousands of Filipinos have protested across the country. Walden Bello, a former congressman, warned against what the burial would represent: \u201cIts message,\u201d he said, \u201cwould be that dictatorship is O.K.\u201dHow have so many Filipinos forgotten? Disillusionment with the presidents since Marcos\u2019s ouster, as well as censorship and propaganda during his two-decade rule, probably explains his popularity with many middle-aged voters. Meanwhile, history textbooks have not been thoroughly updated since Marcos left office, leaving those born after his death, more than half the population, susceptible to miseducation.Recently, slickly produced videos have recast the Marcos dynasty as victims of the Aquino family, its longtime rival. Anonymous blogs and specious news sites manufacture articles supporting the Marcoses and their political allies. People who speak against Mr. Duterte and the Marcoses have had Facebook posts removed.Many Filipinos now claim that Marcos made the country safer, forgetting that dictatorships suppress democratic rights along with crime. Many trumpet his ambitious building projects, forgetting that development and graft went hand in hand. Others claim that Marcos stewarded the country toward prosperity, ignoring how the initial economic gains of his dictatorship led to crippling foreign debt, poverty and crony capitalism.How can a plunderer get a hero\u2019s burial while petty criminals are shot and dumped in the streets? Mr. Duterte speaks admiringly of Marcos, and some of his actions are reminiscent of the strongman\u2019s. After a deadly bombing in his home city, Davao, Mr. Duterte declared a national state of emergency, further empowering the police and military. His chief legal counsel later revealed that the declaration was being drafted even before the attack.Most telling, however, is Mr. Duterte\u2019s relationship with the younger Mr. Marcos. During this year\u2019s election, Mr. Duterte said that if he failed to \u201cget rid of corruption, drugs and criminality\u201d he would cede the presidency to the younger Mr. Marcos, who was running for a rival party. After Mr. Marcos lost the vice-presidential election, Mr. Duterte initially refused the winner a cabinet position typically given to vice presidents, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt the feelings of Bongbong Marcos.\u201dMr. Duterte claims that burying Marcos, 23 years after he was embalmed and refrigerated under glass, will promote national healing, even though the wound was inflicted by the dictator. The president also says the law mandates that Marcos, a former soldier and president, must be buried in the Cemetery of Heroes, despite a 1992 agreement allowing for the repatriation of his body from Hawaii to the Philippines on the condition it be quickly buried in his home province.Mr. Duterte insists. We must ask what he gains. And what we all are losing.Last month, I took my niece and nephew to the Cemetery of Heroes to teach them about the patriots who nobly served our country. We went nowhere near the high walls surrounding Marcos\u2019s future grave site, but we were harassed anyway by soldiers who demanded our names and made us delete our photos. We were unable to continue our discussion of our history. \u201cSo this is what a dictatorship feels like,\u201d my nephew said.As we drove away, we looked back. On the cemetery gates, an inscription is written: \u201cI do not know the dignity of his birth, but I do know the glory of his death.\u201d Soon, Mr. Duterte will be burying a dictator there.Miguel Syjuco is the author of the novel \u201cIlustrado.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The search company makes virtually all of its money from ads placed on the World Wide Web. But what happens to the cash machine if web search eventually becomes outmoded?That worry isn\u2019t far-fetched. More of the world\u2019s computing time keeps shifting to smartphones, where apps have supplanted the web. And internet-connected devices that may dominate the next era in tech \u2014 smartwatches, home-assistant devices like Amazon\u2019s Echo, or virtual reality machines like Oculus Rift \u2014 are likely to be free of the web, and may even lack screens.But if Google is worried, it isn\u2019t showing it. The company has long been working on a not-so-secret weapon to avert its potential irrelevance. Google has shoveled vast financial and engineering resources into a collection of data mining and artificial intelligence systems, from speech recognition to machine translation to computer vision.But Google has much grander aims for the Assistant. People at the company say that Sundar Pichai, who took over as Google\u2019s chief executive last year after Google was split into a conglomerate called Alphabet, has bet the company on the new tech. Mr. Pichai declined an interview request for this column, but at Google\u2019s developer conference in May, he called the development of the Assistant \u201ca seminal moment\u201d for the company.If the Assistant or something like it does not take off, Google\u2019s status as the chief navigator of our digital lives could be superseded by a half-dozen other assistants. You might interact with Alexa in your house, with Siri on your phone, and with Facebook Messenger\u2019s chatbot when you\u2019re out and about. Google\u2019s search engine (not to mention its Android operating system, Chrome, Gmail, Maps and other properties) would remain popular and lucrative, but possibly far less so than they are today.The Assistant, in Google\u2019s most far-out vision, would always be around, wherever you are, on whatever device you use, to handle just about any informational task.Consider this common situation: Today, to book a trip, you usually have to load up several travel sites, consult your calendar and coordinate with your family and your colleagues. If the Assistant works as well as Google hopes, all you might have to do is say, \u201cO.K., Google, I need to go to Hong Kong next week. Take care of it.\u201dBased on your interactions with it over the years, Google would know your habits, your preferences and your budget. It would know your friends, family and your colleagues. With access to so much data, and with the computational power to interpret all of it, the Assistant most likely could handle the entire task; if it couldn\u2019t, it would simply ask you to fill in the gaps, the way a human assistant might.Computers have made a lot of everyday tasks far easier to accomplish, yet they still require a sometimes annoying level of human involvement to get the most out of them. The Assistant\u2019s long-term aim is to eliminate all this busywork.If it succeeds, it would be the ultimate expression of what Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, once described as the perfect search engine: a machine that \u201cunderstands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want.\u201dAt this point, a few readers may be recoiling at the potential invasion of autonomy and privacy that such a machine would necessitate.The Assistant would involve giving ourselves over to machines more fully. We would trust them not just with our information but increasingly with our decisions. Many people are already freaked out by what Google, Facebook and other tech companies know about us. Would we be willing to hand over even more power to computers?Those are important questions, but they are also well down the road. For now, the more pressing question for the Assistant is: Will it even work?Google has technological advantages that suggest it could build a more capable digital assistant than others have accomplished. Many of the innovations that it has built into its search engine \u2014 including its knowledge graph database of more than a billion people, places and things, and the 17 years it has spent trying to understand the meaning of web queries \u2014 will form the Assistant\u2019s brain.Google has also been one of the leaders in machine learning, the process that allows computers to discover facts about the world without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is at the heart of a number of recent advances, including Google Photos\u2019 uncanny capacity to search through your images for arbitrary terms (photos of people hugging, for instance).\u201cWe are in the process of transforming into a machine-learning company,\u201d Jeff Dean, who is in charge of Google Brain, the company\u2019s artificial intelligence project, told me this year. For each problem Google solves this way, it gets better at solving other problems. \u201cIt\u2019s a boulder going downhill gathering more momentum as it goes,\u201d Mr. Dean said.That\u2019s an amazing technological feat. But as Brian pointed out, it\u2019s also pretty useless. Why does your friend care if you know his dog\u2019s a Shih Tzu?This gets to a deeper difficulty. The search company might have the technical capacity to create the smartest assistant around, but it\u2019s not at all clear that it has the prowess to create the friendliest, most charming or most useful assistant. Google needs to nail not just Assistant\u2019s smarts, but also its personality \u2014 a new skill for Google, and one that its past forays into social software (Google Plus, anyone?) don\u2019t speak highly of.\u201cWhen I was trying to book a movie, it didn\u2019t really narrow things down for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there were some times it was wrong. I asked it to show me my upcoming trip, and it didn\u2019t get that.\u201dOf course, it\u2019s still early. Mr. Sullivan has high hopes for the Assistant. It would be premature to look at the technology today and get discouraged about its future, especially since Google sees this as a multiyear, perhaps even decade-long project. And especially if Google\u2019s future depends on getting this right.Advertisement"}

His postings included two stints as the police chief of southeastern Ghazni Province, and one term each in Zabul and Paktika Provinces.General Zahid was seen as a hands-on commander, often arriving at the front lines unannounced. When a major cultural event drew world leaders to the ancient city of Ghazni, the general was photographed riding around the city on the back of a motorcycle to check on security measures. He had been wounded twice and had lost two brothers during the decades of war in Afghanistan.Sediq Sediqqi, the spokesman for Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Interior Affairs, called General Zahid \u201cone of the bravest commanders of Afghan police.\u201d\u201cHe lost his life on the front line of duty in the fight against terrorism,\u201d Mr. Sediqqi said.Khalid Alokozay and Fahim Abed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On the Via Francigena in Tuscany, Monasteries and Fellowship", "Date": "2016-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExplorerSummoning our courage, my husband and I knocked on the unmarked door of the Convento di San Francesco, a 13th-century monastery in the Tuscan hill town of San Miniato.When at last a sound came from within, it was not reassuring: a deep, resounding clang of metal on metal. Footsteps approached the door, and a tall, gaunt man in a button-down shirt opened it.\u201cPellegrini!\u201d my husband, Jesse, and I blurted \u2014 pilgrims, one of the few words of Italian we knew.We were in Italy on our honeymoon, and in front of this doorway because we had read about the Via Francigena at home in Northern California, and been tantalized by descriptions of a beautiful, historical footpath welcoming of religious and secular pilgrims alike, in the manner of the Camino de Santiago in Spain.While not religious, both of us had found spiritual meaning in outdoor adventures and physical challenges in the past, and a long walk into the unknown together struck us as the perfect way to cement the start of a marriage. So here we were, even though we had been able to find little information on the practicalities of planning a Via Francigena trip. We would show up, we told ourselves, and figure it out.The man hesitated and then waved us inside. Moments later we were bounding after him up a stone staircase, down a hallway with a painted sign on the wall that commanded \u201cSILENCIUM,\u201d under a low lintel, and into a room with two cots and an achingly lovely view of the sunset over the valley and town below.Then he left us, and we turned to each other, almost laughing in relief and surprise. We were inside. Our pilgrimage had begun.That evening in the monastery\u2019s cavernous dining room, we gathered with the same man (he turned out to be a priest named Father Luigi), four other pilgrims and a white-haired monk in a brown cassock, over a meal of soup, sliced meat, stewed vegetables and bread, washed down with Chianti from a jug.Talk turned to pilgrimage. Our neighbor across the table, a Frenchman who had been crisscrossing Europe on various footpaths for years, showed off a zip-lock bag full of his pilgrim\u2019s passports, documents that are stamped at official waypoints to record a journey; the booklets bulged like phone books left to dry in the sun. For the meal and our stay, we paid 35 euros (about $40) apiece.The official history of the Via Francigena begins with Sigeric, an archbishop of Canterbury who traveled to Rome in A.D. 990 to receive honors from Pope John XV. The detailed journal that he kept, describing his 79-stage trip back to England, became the basis for the Via Francigena, one of the main pilgrimage routes of the Middle Ages.After dinner, the cassocked monk circled the table with a plate of tiny fruit pies he had made himself. As I bit into mine \u2014 flaky, delicious and not too sweet \u2014 I slipped into the illusion that I\u2019d already been in this ancient, soothing place a long time, my life\u2019s messy logic replaced completely by the simple, appealing shape of the journey.In the morning, two pilgrims from Turin told us we could walk with them that day. Father Luigi gave Jesse and me our pilgrim\u2019s passports, and he slipped a wooden Franciscan cross on a slender brown thread around each of our necks.Our new friends introduced themselves as Roberto and Ceppo. In their late 40s and best friends since kindergarten, they told us that they hike a portion of the Via Francigena together every year, for spirituality and for fun. Their destination was Gambassi Terme, a 15-mile ramble to the south.For most of the day we walked on a packed dirt track, following a ridgeline in the Val d\u2019Elsa. Though it was high season for tourism, we passed almost no one. We crossed through fields of knee-high grasses, above irregularly shaped plots of farmland that formed a crazy quilt of gold and green.In fact, light bags and full stomachs are among the main pleasures of a walk on the Tuscan stretch of the Via Francigena. Walking stimulates the appetite, and each day\u2019s efforts end in a variation on a theme: local wine, hearty food and a real bed, luxuries almost impossible in the United States, where multiday walks usually mean wilderness backpacking.While we walked on a chalky white road through vineyards, the vines bursting with the new, bright-green leaves of springtime, I tried to define what\u2019s so pleasant about traveling by foot. There is something addictive about the sense of purpose that comes from starting each day with a destination firmly in mind. To walk a path is to not be hectored by the endless choices that usually beset a tourist \u2014 and that constraint, paradoxically, leaves one more open to the experiences that do arise.In midafternoon, a view of San Gimignano\u2019s famous spires peeked through the trees, and soon we joined a road filled with cyclists in bright spandex outfits.Roberto and Ceppo had recommended we spend the night at the 13th-century Augustinian monastery in San Gimignano, a building attached to a church famous for a fresco cycle of the life of St. Augustine, painted in the 1460s by Benozzo Gozzoli. (As of this writing, the monastery no longer hosts pilgrims overnight.)Unsure of how to get in, Jesse and I wandered into the gift shop.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a hotel, it\u2019s a church,\u201d the man we encountered there snapped, in Spanish, as we fumbled to produce our pilgrim\u2019s passports.\u201cAre you true pilgrims?\u201d he demanded.\u201cYes,\u201d I insisted, hoping the question was about our mode of transportation, and not our faith.At last he relented. After a skeptical comment about my flimsy Tretorn sneakers, he led us to a room with pitted walls, three narrow cots and a small tray for donations, issuing a stern reminder to leave the key in the door when we departed in the morning.And that brought us straight to the question. Were we pilgrims? And did we have any business being where we were?But he also said that he frowns on affluent travelers taking advantage of welcoming monasteries. \u201cI just draw the line at prosperous pilgrims, whether believers or secular, in exploiting religious hospitality for a subsidized holiday,\u201d he said.Alison Raju, author of an English-language guide to the Via Francigena, said she believes that anyone who walks with real contemplative intent should feel welcome. Many of the pilgrims she meets are secular people who have taken the trail to process a trauma or turning point in their lives: divorce, bereavement, job loss, illness or recovery.\u201cIf you get challenged, you can say that you\u2019re not religious in the sense of being a regular churchgoer, but that you have things that you need the time and space to think about,\u201d she said.In the morning we faced a 20-mile walk, the longest of our trip. Navigating the Via Francigena is not difficult, at least in Tuscany, where every twist and turn in the trail sports a multitude of cheerful red-and-white waymarkers, many bearing the trail\u2019s logo, a medieval pilgrim with a knapsack and stick.We followed the steep path downhill from the town\u2019s walls, then into a woodland where it wove past young walnut trees and a seemingly abandoned center for pig breeding.After lunch, I developed a serious blister \u2014 perhaps the man at the monastery had been right about my bad shoes after all. We hobbled off the trail and into the town of Colle di val d\u2019Elsa, where I salved my pain with espresso and pastry.It rained, and then the rain passed over, leaving roiling clouds and a silver light that intensified the colors of the landscape. We trudged through olive groves and a beautiful field where red poppies and purple flowers grew among stalks of undulating, sea-green wheat.In the perfectly preserved tiny medieval walled town of Monteriggioni, we checked into a pilgrims\u2019 hostel and put our aching feet up just as a fresh fall of rain splattered the town square.About 25,000 people walked on the Via Francigena in 2015, according to Luca Bruschi, director of the European Association of the Via Francigena, most of them for short distances. The number is minuscule compared with the Camino de Santiago, where 262,459 pilgrims checked in at the pilgrim\u2019s welcome office in Santiago in 2015. But it is on the rise, in part because of the very popularity of that route; many discover the Via Francigena after walking the Camino de Santiago first, leading some to call it the \u201cItalian Camino.\u201dSoon the home\u2019s owner, Marcello Pagnini, pulled up in a sporty car. He unloaded a large prosciutto ham from the trunk, carried it inside, then returned and made us espressos and sandwiches. (We placed some euros in a donation box there.) A retired hairdresser, Mr. Pagnini opened the Punto Sosta in 2012, after pilgrims began knocking on the door of his house and asking for water.On leaving, we quickly found ourselves on the outskirts of Siena. We passed a cemetery, and a wooded area with a sign forbidding passers-by to forage for mushrooms or truffles, a regional specialty.After a lunch of pici pasta with sausage and truffles at a roadside restaurant, we passed through Siena\u2019s impressive walls. Florence\u2019s age-old rival city has similar medieval architecture, but a scrappier feel. We liked it immediately.In the sociable, bowl-shaped Piazza del Campo, the focal point of town, we sat down between a young couple making out and two students reuniting with a former teacher. We took a selfie. The clouds parted, and the afternoon sun struck the clock tower, turning it blinding white against a deep blue sky.At our last hostel, we had been given the name of a monastery in Siena where pilgrims can spend the night. But as we wandered the city amid intermittent showers, we couldn\u2019t find it. Eventually we stopped trying to, and the failure began to feel appropriate. Our trip was over. As quickly as we\u2019d entered it, the parallel world of the journey had released us. I slipped my hand into my husband\u2019s, and we walked on down the street, not pilgrims anymore, just ordinary people looking for a place to stay.On the trail, it\u2019s wisest to pack a lunch and ample water. Because each day\u2019s itinerary ends in a town, you will have multiple options for a restaurant meal (and glass of wine). Additionally, some pilgrim\u2019s accommodations offer dinner and breakfast.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Video Ads That Work on Facebook\u2019s Silent Screen", "Date": "2016-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingTHE GEICO commercial that made its premiere this summer seemed like a standard 30-second television ad. It features two men building sand castles on a pristine beach with their children. \u201cGuess what I just did?\u201d one of the men asks. \u201cBuilt a sand castle?\u201d the other responds. \u201cHa \u2014 no. I switched to Geico and got more,\u201d the first man says.But another version of that ad was created by the Martin Agency, which worked on the commercial for Geico. This one was half as long, with text that popped up as the men spoke, and the word \u201cGeico\u201d appeared after six seconds.The goal: to make the ad understandable to people who viewed it on Facebook without sound.\u201cFor a lot of our clients, Facebook is a very important platform, so thinking about how it\u2019s going to play out there without sound is coming into the discussion earlier and earlier in the process,\u201d said Neel Williams, a creative director at the Martin Agency, which has also repurposed TV Chips Ahoy commercials for Facebook.Advertising is a medium that has long relied on the hummable jingle, the memorable catchphrase and the familiar voice-over to connect with its audience. Now, as technology companies like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat hustle for a bigger cut of television marketing dollars by adding videos, they have been working to show advertisers that their videos can be just as effective, even if they are played on mute or are viewed for just a few seconds. With advertisers seeking to reach an increasingly fractured and fickle audience, the challenges of presenting ads on platforms that are not one-size-fits-all are sure to be much discussed at Advertising Week, a top industry gathering that begins Monday in Manhattan.Even before Facebook drew criticism for that metric, advertisers were charting new territory with sound on Facebook. Facebook has visited the Martin Agency \u201cseveral times\u201d to share tips on how to tailor ads effectively, Mr. Williams said, and it has emphasized the importance of catching a user\u2019s attention in the first three seconds of a video, at which point it officially counts as a view.\u201cIf you\u2019re a creative person, this is an extraordinary time to be in the opening chapters of quite an extraordinary development platform,\u201d said Mark D\u2019Arcy, chief creative officer of Facebook\u2019s Creative Shop, which helps companies tailor their ads to the social network.\u201cYou can\u2019t elicit the same amount of emotion as when you have sound and visual working together,\u201d said Julian Cole, head of communications planning at BBDO.Even as such ads have been shortened or created anew for the web, particularly for mobile devices, where Facebook says 75 percent of its video views occur, sound has remained on in apps like YouTube and Snapchat.\u201cWhen people are watching on YouTube, they have earbuds in and the volume up,\u201d said Kellie Judge, senior vice president of global media partnerships at Amplifi, the central investment division of the ad agency Dentsu Aegis Network.\u201cWith Facebook and Twitter, people are scrolling a feed with the volume off. The distinction we\u2019ve been talking more and more about is not just creating for television versus in-feed, but how it\u2019s so different from other video,\u201d she said.It is difficult to tell brands they need to tailor their ads for each platform \u2014 not to mention pay TV-like dollars to place them there \u2014 without proof of their effectiveness, so \u201cFacebook and Twitter are doing a ton of research in that space to combat the advertiser hesitation,\u201d Ms. Judge said.In the United States, television still commands 72 percent of all video viewing time and television advertising still accounts for about 36 percent of all video-related revenue, according to Activate, a consulting firm for tech and media companies.\u201cPeople are less willing to sit through an online ad than a 30-second TV commercial,\u201d said Michael J. Wolf, managing director at Activate. \u201cMost online video ads get about six seconds of play before they are skipped.\u201dJoe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group, said the lack of sound was a factor that made it hard to assess the value of online video advertising against traditional TV commercials.\u201cIt\u2019s not that this is not valuable. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d Mr. Marchese said. \u201cTV dollars would flood into online if online impressions were the same thing as TV impressions, meaning 100 percent of the screen, the sound very likely on, and all 30 seconds viewed.\u201dFor its part, YouTube said that ad recall was more than three times higher among people exposed to video ads that could be seen and listened to compared with video ads that could only be seen, citing a study of more than 1,400 mobile-ad campaigns.\u201cSound ensures that users are getting the most robust and comprehensive exposure to our film as possible,\u201d said Doug Neil, executive vice president of digital marketing at Universal Pictures.Imran Khan, Snapchat\u2019s chief strategy officer, went so far as to say that \u201cads that play without sound are more like a moving banner.\u201dStill, it\u2019s hard to argue with the sheer size of Facebook and how much time people spend there. The company said users spend five times longer looking at video content on Facebook and Instagram compared with unmoving content, including ads.\u201cThe most important factor is where the consumer\u2019s focus is,\u201d Mr. Williams, of the Martin Agency, said. \u201cYou can have the most epic TV spot that is a visual feast, packed with the best, most well-written voice-over, read by the most famous person, but if you\u2019re not paying attention to it, then it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arrest Made in Arson at Mosque That Orlando Nightclub Gunman Attended", "Date": "2016-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Florida man who espoused anti-Islamic views on social media was charged with arson on Wednesday in connection with a fire on Sunday that damaged a mosque in Fort Pierce, Fla., the authorities said.Mr. Schreiber had \u201cmultiple anti-Islamic posts and comments\u201d on his Facebook page, said Maj. David Thompson, the director of law enforcement at the sheriff\u2019s office. Mr. Schreiber also wrote about the Sept. 11 attacks, but officials did not elaborate further on a possible motive for the fire.In a July 12 Facebook post, Mr. Schreiber, who grew up in Mastic, N.Y., on Long Island, according to his social media profile, wrote that Americans should view \u201call forms of Islam as radical\u201d if they want peace and safety. \u201cThere is no such a thing as radical ISLAMIC extremism...ALL ISLAM IS RADICAL,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Schreiber faces a charge of second-degree arson but a hate crime designation will raise the charge to first-degree arson, Major Thompson said.The authorities did not directly address whether others were involved in the arson, saying only that the investigation was still in its early stages.Officials said tips from members of the community along with surveillance video from businesses and homes helped match Mr. Schreiber with footage of an individual on a motorcycle who was seen leaving the mosque after the fire started.A surveillance camera recorded a man who appeared to be carrying paper and a bottle as he approached the mosque. Then came a flash as flames damaged the house of worship. No one was injured.The fire burned a 10-by-10-foot hole in the roof at the back of the mosque\u2019s main building and blackened its eaves with soot, The Associated Press reported. Rewards totaling $10,000 were offered for information leading to the arrest of the arsonist.With its painted star and crescent, and palm trees and an occasional protester outside, the Sunni mosque is central to Islamic life in Fort Pierce, a city of around 44,000 people about an hour\u2019s drive north of Palm Beach. Yet it has also been a source of controversy, drawing attention twice in recent years as a place where young men who staged attacks had worshiped.In June, the Islamic Center\u2019s imam, Syed Shafeeq Rahman, distanced himself and the mosque from Mr. Mateen and, more generally, from extremist ideology. A representative of the mosque was not available to comment on Wednesday about the arrest of Mr. Schreiber.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Every Day\u2019s a Safety Drill as Chipotle Woos Customers Back", "Date": "2016-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA large digital kitchen timer perches near a sink at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. It is reset every 30 minutes, and 12 minutes have passed.\u201cIn about 18 minutes, everyone will stop what they\u2019re doing and wash their hands,\u201d said James Marsden, the company\u2019s new executive director of food safety.There isn\u2019t much sexy about food safety, and that goes for regular reminders to scrub hands. But for the last year, Chipotle has been forced to focus on little else, after a string of illnesses among diners at the Mexican restaurant chain grew into nationwide alarm. The concern has battered the company\u2019s sales, reputation and stock price.Similar kitchen timers occupy a similar position in each of Chipotle\u2019s more than 2,000 restaurants, a prosaic symbol of the company\u2019s efforts to prevent similar problems in the future. On Wednesday, the company was highlighting several new initiatives as well, including work it is doing to enhance food safety among its suppliers, hoping that pointing to the moves will help regain the public\u2019s confidence \u2014 and profits.At the center of the action is Dr. Marsden, a longtime academic whom Chipotle hired in the spring. In one of his first extended interviews since arriving at the company, he said his challenge had been clear: to allow Chipotle to continue using fresh ingredients \u2014 not frozen or precooked \u2014 while making its farm suppliers, food and restaurants safer.\u201cAnybody can spray a bunch of chemicals around and improve food safety,\u201d Dr. Marsden said. \u201cThis was going to require something more innovative and different.\u201dDr. Marsden and the company have their work cut out for them. First, they will need to convince Americans that the company\u2019s food is safe. Then, they need to get those people back into the restaurants.For many months now, the company has offered an array of promotions, most recently offering free drinks for high school and college students who buy a meal.\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s accomplishing what they want,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski, an analyst at Nomura Securities. \u201cWhen you\u2019re giving away food, it\u2019s discounting \u2014 and to me, this isn\u2019t a brand built on discounting, so it creates some new questions about the future.\u201dSome sales have returned, but more slowly than investors expected, and shares have fallen 45 percent in the last year. Even Steve Ells, the company\u2019s founder and co-chief executive, said he thought the company would rebound faster.Yet Mr. Ells also noted that Chipotle was in \u201cuncharted waters.\u201d\u201cNo one has ever had this kind of a food safety crisis in the era of social media,\u201d Mr. Ells said.Jack In The Box, a burger chain where more than 700 people got sick in 1993 after eating E. coli-contaminated meat, \u201cnever had to deal with Facebook and Twitter,\u201d he said.Chipotle\u2019s problems began in August 2015, when more than 200 people were sickened with norovirus after eating at one of its restaurants in Simi Valley, Calif. The same month, 64 people who ate at one of 22 Chipotle restaurants in Minnesota and Wisconsin got salmonella poisoning.But it wasn\u2019t until November, when the company announced it had closed a string of stores across the Pacific Northwest because of E. coli contamination, that investors began to flee. The next month, there was another E. coli problem in the Midwest. And in February, some 200 people got sick with norovirus after eating at a Chipotle in Boston.\u201cPart of the thing that was so devastating was because there were multiple incidents, and so it may have looked like we were out of control,\u201d Mr. Ells said. \u201cWe had good food safety standards in place \u2014 but were they good enough to ensure something like this wouldn\u2019t happen given the momentum of our business and that we rely on fresh ingredients prepared on the spot? Maybe not.\u201dMichelle Greenwald, a marketing professor at Columbia University, said it would be difficult for Chipotle to recover all of its sales because the restaurant industry was more competitive than ever.\u201cYou can be a pioneer in the market and get surpassed by other things,\u201d Professor Greenwald said. \u201cI think that\u2019s partly what\u2019s happening to them \u2014 their food safety problems coincided with all these new concepts like Cava Grill and Sweetgreen.\u201dChipotle began looking around for a food safety expert to hire. The company landed on Dr. Marsden, a soft-spoken man who had recently retired from teaching at Kansas State University. (He is also the father of the actor James Marsden, best known as Cyclops in the \u201cX Men\u201d film series.)Dr. Marsden had a long history of dealing with food-safety crises, including a stint at the American Meat Institute during the Jack In The Box crisis. The Chipotle situation intrigued him.\u201cThis was an interesting case involving multiple pathogens and multiple outbreaks, but with no precise indication of the cause,\u201d he said.So Dr. Marsden put together a plan to cover practically every base \u2014 from ensuring that employees are checked every morning for illnesses to frequently checking the temperature of foods \u2014 all of which must be logged into \u201cthe black book,\u201d a daily record of each location\u2019s safety procedures.Some of those procedures are something of a throwback to old-school food safety practices.Guacamole, for instance, now takes advantages of the cleansing properties of the lemon and lime juices in the recipe. Before getting mixed, the chopped tomatoes, onions and jalape\u00f1os are laid on top of avocados and drizzled with citrus juices in one last effort to ensure food safety.Some scientists may question such tactics, saying they have been supplanted by newer methods. But Dr. Marsden said he was confident of them.\u201cWe\u2019re doing research and are going to publish papers on what we\u2019re doing, so people can see for themselves that it works,\u201d he said.Lettuce is now rinsed, drained and immersed in a solution of vinegar and water and drained again. It then is chopped, immersed in an antibacterial solution and rinsed again. And if any sediment is left in the sink, the chopped lettuce is washed in the solution again.In addition, two employees must verify that produce like onions, jalape\u00f1os and avocados have been immersed in hot water for five seconds to kill germs on their peels. Containers storing the food must get a printed sticker indicating when they were sanitized and when they should be discarded if not used.Chicken is now marinated in the evening, when restaurants are less busy, to reduce risk of cross contamination, instead of whenever there is time. Steak and other meats are cooked \u201csous vide,\u201d a process in which meats are vacuum-packed in plastic and immersed in a water bath at low temperature for several hours, while chorizo is treated with high pressure to eliminate contamination.And all of this is overseen by a food safety leader in each restaurant, a new position. The food safety leader must also ask every employee how they feel before they clock in, to make sure they aren\u2019t coming to work sick, and keep records when an employee is sent home because of illness.Robert Gravani, who teaches food safety at Cornell University, said what he had heard about what Chipotle was doing under Dr. Marsden\u2019s direction seemed good. The trick, he said, will be training employees to stick with the new programs. Chipotle has tried to address that by pushing some 300 of the company\u2019s managers, who oversee five to 12 restaurants, to receive a certification in food safety.\u201cYou can have all the procedures in place, but you have to get the people who work with you and for you to do them,\u201d said Mr. Gravani. \u201cYou have to build a culture of food safety so that employees become unconsciously competent in it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Sexual Abuse of 1-Year-Old, No Jail Time in Sentence for Teenager", "Date": "2016-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn Iowa teenager who was accused of sexually assaulting a 1-year-old girl while the act was recorded will not serve further jail time after he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of engaging in a lascivious act with a child.He was released after 2 years and four months in jail when he pleaded guilty in July.Some public reaction to the sentencing this week centered on whether the sentence was strong enough. A man whose Facebook page about missing children and fugitives helped investigators identify the defendant was particularly disappointed.Responding to the criticism, Gary Oldenburger, the county attorney for Wapello County, defended the sentence in a statement dated Thursday, presenting Mr. Grooms as the unwitting lackey of child pornographers who tricked him into the assault, as they had done to hundreds of other children.By pretending to be a girl his age, then 16, the two men, one in New Orleans and one in Ireland, persuaded the teenager to perform sex acts he wouldn\u2019t otherwise have done, Mr. Oldenburger said.Mr. Grooms did not know he was being recorded, the prosecutor said in the statement.He added that the child was uninjured, no pain was inflicted, and the child was too young to be aware of what was happening. Though the crime was no \u201cless horrible because the child was too young to understand,\u201d the lack of injury is an important factor in sentencing, he said.\u201cWhile it is easy for the outside observer to advocate a hard-line stance that every sexual offense against a minor should result in a long prison sentence,\u201d he wrote, \u201canyone who actually deals with these situations knows that each case is unique and every case must be handled on its own merits.\u201dMr. Oldenburger said the case likely would have been dismissed had it gone to trial. The parents of the victim did not want Mr. Grooms to serve significant jail time and were more focused on him receiving treatment, he said.The prosecutor also said that important witnesses were unwilling to testify, so the video might not have been admissible as evidence, making a trial more difficult.He said a long sentence likely would have been overturned on appeal, with a quick parole. The 860 days he had already spent in jail would have counted toward his time served.Mr. Oldenburger said psychologists did not believe Mr. Grooms was a high-risk candidate for committing more offenses.\u201cIf Grooms was sent to prison for a long period of time rather than being sentenced to probation, he more than likely would be a greater risk to the community after his release than he will be after serving the sentence he received,\u201d he said.It was not immediately clear whether the men in New Orleans and Ireland have been arrested.Advertisement"}

Some are here to innovate and bring new ideas to the world. Some are here to teach us about love and compassion. And still others are here to test us via the crossword puzzle, most likely to make sure we have not fallen asleep facedown into our bowl of Cocoa Puffs.Well, Mr. Kaye is back today and he\u2019s doing it again, sort of. Gird your loins and get ready to think outside the box. Or at least brush up on your division skills.Let\u2019s start with the revealer, because that will clear a lot of things up: at 61A, we have the clue \u201c\u00f7 ... or a literal hint to interpreting eight squares in this puzzle.\u201d The answer is the phrase DIVIDED BY, and that is exactly what we are doing today: dividing the word \u201cBY\u201d whenever it occurs in the puzzle. If you bisect or divide the letters B and Y horizontally, what you are left with is this:D V\u2014\u2014\u2014D IThe only thing to remember is that the word is read as BY going across, but as DD and VI going down. And you have to fit the DDs and the VIs in their respective single squares.How does one do that, you ask? Well, in the print version of the puzzle, it\u2019s easy; just write small and stack your DDs and VIs vertically. Online, you can use the Rebus key and I\u2019m told that the formats will accept B, Y, DD or VI. Unfortunately, the software does not have the ability to record rebuses vertically, so you will need to write in DD and VI. Alternatively, you can write in B and Y and just imagine that the letters are divided.Here\u2019s what it will look like in The New York Times web game if you use the Rebus function:So, the answer to 17A will read BYPRODUCT, but the answer to 1D and 2D are BUDDIES and INVITRO. Got that? Now go forth and DIVIDE BY.This is a really innovative theme (O.K., maybe Mr. Kaye fits into more than one \u201creason for being here\u201d category) and I was amazed that Mr. Kaye was able to make this work. The only theme entry that felt a bit forced to me was M.D. DEGREE, but the rest of them worked very well.\u2022 34A: A common crossword trick, cousin to \u201cleader\u201d/\u201dfollower\u201d clues. \u201cLawful ends?\u201d means that you are looking for what\u2019s at the ends of the word lawful. That would be the two letters L, or ELS.\u2022 8D: \u201cIs written on papyrus?\u201d is great misdirection. When you see a clue like this, think \u201cHow would the word \u2018is\u2019 be written back in the days of writing on papyrus?\u201d The answer is EST.\u2022 12D: Whenever you see a \u201cconnection\u201d clue, there will typically be two words separated by a hyphen (in this case, \u201cPay-click\u201d), and they may look like they belong that way, but there is really a word missing. In this case, the missing word is PER, as in \u201cpay-per-click.\u201d\u2022 50D: Not the hamburger. \u201cBig Mac?\u201d with a question mark refers to the mortgage institution kind of Mac, FREDDIE Mac.I\u2019m pleased with how all aspects of this puzzle came together. My original concept was to simply divide the \u201cB\u201d into DD, but single-letter splits have been done before in The New York Times Crossword, and I wondered if there might be two letters that could be split together. I was fortunate to find that a divided \u201cBY\u201d would work nicely, including as part of a spot-on revealer, which in turn could be neatly clued as \u201c \u00f7 .\u201dThe 12 theme entries (the four \u201cBY\u201d words and the eight that cross them at the divided \u201cB\u201d or \u201cY\u201d) use 75 squares, which could have led to a very tight grid \u2014 but with some effort I managed to keep it relatively open, with only 33 blocks.At first I wanted the \u201cBY\u201d words to be more challenging, but Will and Joel asked me to change the toughest one in my submission: PRESBYOPIC. They felt a fairly obscure theme answer would throw many solvers, as there was already a difficult gimmick. I can see their point (even without my presbyopic reading glasses!) and I agree that the final puzzle is better without it.I came up with the ATARI clue with Will in mind, as he\u2019s known to be an avid player of table tennis. I had to double-check to be sure that my memory was correct: Pong\u2019s graphics were so primitive that the ball was actually square.Enjoy!Have you joined us yet to solve the Thursday Crosswords on The New York Times\u2019s Facebook page?

No More iPhone Headphone Jack?", "Date": "2016-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo understand this story it helps to go over the Andreessen Horowitz back story. The firm was founded in 2009 as a new kind of V.C. Rather than just give start-ups money, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, storied tech entrepreneurs, would also help companies with hiring, communications and other functions that young firms need. The model has been widely copied and hailed as game-changing, and A16Z, as the firm is known, is now recognized as one of the Valley\u2019s elite investors.But apparently its returns don\u2019t match its reputation. The Journal said other top V.C.s had made a lot more money for their investors. Two funds raised by Sequoia Capital last decade have returned eight times their investors\u2019 money, and its 2010 fund is up 5.5 times. Benchmark\u2019s 2011 fund has rung up returns of 11 times\u2019 investors\u2019 money. A16Z, by comparison, is at around two times its investors\u2019 money so far. That\u2019s better than a lot of other venture firms, but not earth-shattering.I think the Journal story is ultimately a small stain on the firm\u2019s reputation, but it won\u2019t deter the firm from raising another giant fund in another year or two. And, um, entrepreneurs will probably still accept the millions of dollars that A16Z wants to give them. So this is more about pride than it is dollars. And if there\u2019s one way to get under a venture capitalist\u2019s skin, it\u2019s to ding their egos.

Step by step, little by little, a lot of boring announcements culminate into interesting things.I realized at some point that nothing could beat that initial change of your TV, which once weighed as much as an N.F.L. lineman, becoming sleek enough to mount on a wall.

{"Headline": "J\u2019ouvert Will Continue, de Blasio Says, but Its Hours May Change", "Date": "2016-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the hours after two people were killed early Monday, the mayor seemed to suggest that he was open to ending J\u2019ouvert. But on Tuesday, he ruled that option out, saying that his statement that \u201cevery option will be on the table\u201d had been misinterpreted.\u201cI think it was very clear yesterday that we were not including the option of ending something which has gone on for decades and decades,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference with police officials. \u201cWe have to find out a way to make it safer.\u201dViolence has erupted with regularity in and around the festivities, prompting repeated questions about whether the event, with large crowds celebrating in the middle of the night in largely residential neighborhoods, can be kept free of violence. After two killings last year, the city doubled the number of police officers in attendance and set up hundreds of temporary lighting towers along the route.Even as officials were debating the future of the event, the police were searching for the people responsible for the two killings, and on Tuesday afternoon, an arrest was announced in connection with one of the deaths.Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives, said a 20-year-old man was being charged with second-degree murder with depraved indifference in the killing of Tiarah Poyau, a 22-year-old St. John\u2019s University student who was shot in the face on Empire Boulevard while participating in J\u2019ouvert with her friends.The suspect, Reginald Moise, was arrested on Monday after crashing into three cars while driving drunk, according to the police. Chief Boyce said Mr. Moise was linked to the crime after the police found a gun he had hidden at a friend\u2019s apartment after firing it into a wall there. Ballistics tests matched the weapon, a Glock 9-millimeter handgun, with shell casings found at the home and near where Ms. Poyau was killed.Under questioning, Mr. Moise \u2014 whose given name police officials also spelled as Regenald \u2014 told detectives he believed he had shot somebody, Chief Boyce said. \u201cAnd then he requested an attorney,\u201d the chief added.J\u2019ouvert draws more than 250,000 people to a part of Brooklyn where gang violence flares from time to time, and along with the two people killed on Monday morning, two others were wounded by gunfire.In an effort to prevent such violence and bolster security, the parade was issued a permit for the first time in the event\u2019s history, and organizers worked with community activists to head off violence.\u201cAll the right things were done in advance, including targeting gangs and getting additional guns off the street, but we have more to do,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said. \u201cEven with the right steps being taken, there\u2019s more we have to do. We have to find new ways and additional ways to address this situation.\u201dThe mayor pointed out that the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade and the Puerto Rican Day Parade in Manhattan and the West Indian American Day Parade in Brooklyn all had managed to tamp down the disorder and violence that were once more common at those large events.\u201cAnd each one of them was brought under control,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the same here with J\u2019ouvert.\u201dSitting next to him, the departing police commissioner, William J. Bratton, said the comparison was not necessarily applicable.\u201cThe nature of some of the violence that\u2019s associated with J\u2019ouvert is different than the levels of violence at other events the mayor has mentioned,\u201d said Mr. Bratton, who last year called the event the most violent in the city.\u201cThis celebration of cultural heritage, on a day fought so hard for by our brothers and sisters in the labor movement, has unfortunately become synonymous with gun violence,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand until we as a community can collectively come together to address the root cause of these violent acts I cannot lend my support to it going forward.\u201dBut City Councilman Jumaane D. Williams, also a Democrat, said on a conference call with reporters that suspending the parade would be unrealistic because people would still take to the streets. He said that the elimination of J\u2019ouvert should not be offered as a solution to the gun violence that hides behind it.\u201cI don\u2019t want people to have the false impression that you got rid of J\u2019ouvert, and now there\u2019s no more gun violence in the city of New York,\u201d he said.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bombing Case Points to Gaps in Trump\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s Antiterrorism Plans", "Date": "2016-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There is nothing in Donald J. Trump\u2019s or Hillary Clinton\u2019s antiterrorism plans that would have had much chance of stopping the bombings in New York and New Jersey that Ahmad Khan Rahami is accused of carrying out.The subject of how to prevent terrorism will almost certainly be a major topic on Monday night, when the two presidential candidates face off in their first debate. But the truth is that cases like Mr. Rahami\u2019s fit neatly into no categories.And his journey from childhood immigrant to naturalized citizen to accused terrorist shows that the debate now underway on the campaign trail is too simplistic. It fails to address the hardest and most common cause of radicalization in the United States, when personal demons morph into ideologically driven violence.Mr. Rahami came to the United States from Afghanistan as a 7-year-old, and later became a citizen. Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence in recent days that he has no problem with ethnic profiling might have led to tougher interrogations of Mr. Rahami when he traveled to Quetta, Pakistan, the center of Taliban power, and returned, or when he came back from there with a Pakistani wife.That was a technique, Mr. Trump told Time magazine in December, that he might or might not have supported at the time. He added that as undesirable as it would be to revive such an arrangement, in an age of terrorism, \u201cwar is tough.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s approach would be to rely on countermessaging to prevent radicalization and to try to recognize early signs of extremism. But no one seems quite certain how Mr. Rahami was radicalized \u2014 on the internet, during trips to Pakistan or perhaps by his new wife. And Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach, even its advocates acknowledge, is no guarantee \u2014 it tries to stem the tide, rather than reverse it.Mr. Trump, in short, has described a policy of keeping potential terrorists out of the country altogether, even if that means suspending or violating America\u2019s longstanding principles of taking in refugees and not discriminating against immigrants on the basis of their religion. Mrs. Clinton, in contrast, has argued for the vetting of immigrants \u2014 about their history or sympathy for radical ideology \u2014 but working to counter extremists messages or behavior.A core element of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s counterterrorism strategy has been to build on pilot programs in four communities that, among other features, offer residents ways to report individuals who could become radicalized or otherwise exhibit troubling behavior. The four communities are Minneapolis-St. Paul, Los Angeles, Boston and Montgomery County, Md.Mrs. Clinton aims to set up an early-warning system, community by community. That builds on a growing number of programs that the Obama administration terms \u201ccountering violent extremism.\u201d The aim is not just to rely on religious leaders such as imams to help detect the early signs of radicalization, but also to enlist teachers, coaches, physicians and others who might notice subtle changes in an individual\u2019s behavior and, perhaps with family and friends, intervene.Mrs. Clinton also suggested, in December, that she would accelerate work with technology companies to take radical speech off Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and encrypted apps used by terrorists.\u201cYou are going to hear all the familiar complaints: \u2018Freedom of speech,\u2019\u201d she told the Brookings Institution. She suggested those complaints should be dismissed.Her advisers acknowledge this would not constitute a complete solution \u2014 but neither would immigration bans, which they view as counter to American values.\u201cLook, we\u2019re never going to be able to identify every potential bad actor solely through a police record or their involvement with other bad actors,\u201d said Daniel Benjamin, a former State Department terrorism coordinator and now a scholar at Dartmouth College. \u201cSo having more eyes on this, and more awareness within communities, is absolutely essential, and will have to be a key part of the solution.\u201dMrs. Clinton spoke by phone for 45 minutes on Tuesday morning with a group of top national security and counterterrorism advisers about lessons learned from the most recent terrorist attacks and what additional steps a Clinton administration would need to take to prevent strikes on American soil, according to a summary of the call that the campaign released.They also discussed how to ensure that the police and other law enforcement agencies followed up on individuals who had been previously identified as possible threats. Mrs. Clinton has called for \u201can intelligence surge\u201d to improve information sharing among federal agencies and with foreign partners.Mrs. Clinton and her advisers mulled over ways to combat so-called lone-wolf attacks and online radicalization \u2014 without specific direction or enabling from groups like the Islamic State or Al Qaeda \u2014 and \u201chow we can best balance the right to privacy with this modern national security imperative,\u201d according to the summary.Finally, the group examined \u201cthe dangers of inflammatory rhetoric, generalizations and expressions of prejudice,\u201d all of which Mrs. Clinton and her supporters have accused Mr. Trump of using in his social media comments and campaign speeches.Mr. Trump has one word for those solutions: \u201cWeak.\u201dHe argued during the primaries that he would temporarily ban all Muslim immigration, a position that received withering criticism from his own party. (He also said he would \u201ctake out\u201d the families of terrorists, a violation of international conventions.)He combined that with what he maintains would be a far more relentless attack on the Islamic State, including seizing oil in areas where it operates, presumably in Iraq (although most of the oil belongs to Iraq, and the Bush administration always went to some lengths to say it would be preserved for the benefit of the Iraqi people, not sold by the United States).Under pressure, Mr. Trump amended his approach to saying he would temporarily ban immigration from countries that have been breeding grounds for terrorism; he seemed to have Afghanistan and Pakistan in mind. But that definition could easily embrace Germany, France, Belgium and Britain as well.Had that program been in effect in 1995, it might have stopped Mr. Rahami\u2019s entry into the country as a 7-year-old, or his readmission in 2000, when he and his family were admitted as refugees.Mr. Trump said in a rally on Tuesday that the lesson of the New York and New Jersey bombing attacks was the need for an immigration crackdown.\u201cThese attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country,\u201d he said. \u201cAttack after attack \u2014 from 9/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando \u2014 we have seen how failure to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in great danger.\u201dHe said Mrs. Clinton was \u201cfor people pouring in from Syria,\u201d though the 10,000 refugees who have come from there this year is a tiny fraction of what European nations have taken in. Mr. Trump called for stopping \u201cthe massive inflow of refugees, which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting from High Point, N.C., and Jackie Calmes from Washington.Advertisement"}

It standardizes the strange.Several new features, meanwhile, blow up iMessage\u2019s intimate chat experience to help it compete with the social networks. A handy GIF keyboard jumps off the reaction-GIF empire that Tumblr built, calling up video loops of broadly accessible cultural references (Honey Boo Boo dancing, two Minions giggling) to convey a range of emotional states. Another feature lets you finger-paint directly onto your photos, just like you can on Snapchat. But mostly, this thing feels like Facebook. A new class of iMessage apps \u2014 yes, apps within an app \u2014 lets chatters play Words With Friends, send money through Square or make dinner reservations on OpenTable, all right within the chat window. It feels like iMessage is trying to swallow the rest of your phone.The camera is in here, and so too can be Fandango, ESPN, and, if you want, Carrot, a snarky robot that reads you the weather report for $3.99. In many of these cases, the service is so slight that exchanging actual words would work just fine: Want to see \u201cSnowden\u201d at 10:15? Did you catch the Nats game? It\u2019s 77 and sunny \u2014 greeaaaaat. It\u2019s not clear why every shade of human interaction needs to be mediated by its own app.Here\u2019s one theory: Each tap into the iMessage world sends you further away from your chat bubbles and deeper into Apple\u2019s labyrinth of special features. Follow the path to its inevitable conclusion, and all of a sudden, you\u2019re no longer talking with your friends. You\u2019re shopping.Five clicks into iMessage, you\u2019ll arrive at Apple\u2019s brand-new sticker shop. Offering colorful sets of illustrations to drag and drop into your chats, it\u2019s one of iMessage\u2019s most tantalizing new destinations. If our chat windows function as modern living rooms, stickers offer the opportunity to appoint our walls with art from cutting-edge digital creators.iMessage is the iPhone\u2019s most trafficked feature. Its chats facilitate an endless combination of social interactions and emotional expressions. But Apple\u2019s shop suggests that all conversations would improve from a Party City-style redecoration, with generic celebratory sentiments and Disney-branded flair.\u201cStickers\u201d sound inherently childish, but they don\u2019t have to be. The stickerification of chats was pioneered by Line, a Japanese chat giant that swept Asia and is lately making a bid for western audiences. Line loves corporate synergy, too, heralding sticker sets starring Snoopy, Super Mario and Hello Kitty.But even as it attempts world chat domination, Line services online subcultures. Dozens of sticker sets feature gay characters, and more than one \u2014 \u201cFangirl\u2019s Activities\u201d and \u201cI Love KPOP\u201d \u2014 depicts anime girls in various states of obsession. Then there\u2019s the sex stuff. The \u201cUMAOTOKO\u201d sticker shows two men in horse costumes, uh, stretching together. The most risqu\u00e9 sticker I could find in Apple\u2019s version was in a set called \u201cFailmoji.\u201d It\u2019s a hand-drawn butt with the caption \u201cFART!!\u201dAdvertisement"}
