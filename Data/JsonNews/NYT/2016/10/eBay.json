{"Headline": "Can the Democrats Resurrect the Middle Class?", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byWith the likelihood of major gains for their party on Election Day rising, the most important task facing Democrats is the development of a coherent economic agenda that addresses issues that were central in both the Republican and Democratic primaries.There are preliminary signs that Democrats and their allies are willing to put together just such an agenda.The two authors outline numerous proposals, including some that would be risky for Democrats, particularly those that call for the redistribution of resources from the party\u2019s upscale wing to downscale voters.These proposals include changes in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to benefit families with incomes of less than $100,000 (while reducing the benefits of the tax credit to the affluent) as well as the reduction or elimination of tax breaks in education savings plans for the affluent to generate revenues to boost Pell grants for poorer students.Sawhill and Rodrigue don\u2019t shy away from what they see as a necessary step in combating economic inequality:If we could empower young adults to only have children when they themselves feel ready to become parents, we could reduce unplanned pregnancies and out-of-wedlock births. That alone would reduce poverty and lack of mobility. The solutions here are often nongovernmental and involve changing social norms around the importance of responsible, two-person parenthood.They go on:Some have called for a new generation of government-sponsored marriage or relationship programs and for reducing marriage penalties in tax and benefit programs. But with some exceptions, these do not appear to be a cost-effective way to bring back the two-parent family. More promising are efforts to make the most effective forms of birth control (IUDs and implants) more widely available at no cost to women.the specter of secular stagnation and inadequate economic growth on the one hand, and ascendant populism and global disintegration on the other, has caused widespread apprehensionamid fears that \u201cthe global economy is entering unexplored and dangerous territory.\u201d And when economies worldwide stagnate, the result, Summers writes, is that \u201celectorates turn surly.\u201d The way to counter these negative trends, in his view, is to abandon \u201causterity economics in favor of investment economics.\u201dFurman focuses on a pair of crucial factors underlying slow growth: a lack of corporate dynamism and the weakening of competitive forces in the marketplace. Diminishing vitality in the marketplace has become a mounting concern among economists and policy makers.One advantage of Furman\u2019s approach is that it cuts across ideological boundaries.To support his case, Furman cites a wide range of data and reports. These include the finding that \u201cin 42 percent of the roughly 900 industries examined, the top four firms controlled more than a third of the market in 2012, up from 28 percent of industries in 1997\u201d and that in financial services, \u201cthe loan market share of the top ten banks increased from about 30 percent in 1980 to about 50 percent in 2010.\u201dIf the creation of new firms is a marker of a thriving competitive economy, Furman argues that the trends are not favorable. The accompanying chart shows a sharp decline over the past 30-plus years in the percentage of companies that are five years old or less, from just over 50 percent in 1982 to roughly 33 percent now, and a decline in the share of total employment provided by these young firms, from roughly 21 percent in 1982 to about 11 percent now.The decline in corporate dynamism has been accompanied by a decline in labor dynamism, with \u201cworkers less likely to move between jobs, industries, occupations, and locations,\u201d Furman writes.What Furman describes is a nation suffering from what amounts to economic arteriosclerosis. This has not hurt corporate management and the owners of capital \u2014 stockholders \u2014 but it has been disastrous for workers.Furman argues that \u201cboth market concentration and frictions that reduce worker mobility can lead to greater monopsony power for employers\" (monopsony is a buyer\u2019s monopoly). \u201cWith fewer firms competing for a given type of worker,\u201d Furman contends,each firm is more likely to exercise local monopsony, and their smaller numbers may also facilitate tacit or explicit collusion. If, on top of that, employees face greater search frictions or costs of moving, then this reduces their ability to raise their wages by changing jobs and thus also reduces their bargaining power with their current employer.The growing strength of businesses to bargain for low wages, bolstered by the decline in unionized employment and the falling value of the minimum wage, has contributed to the declining share of total income going to workers. Furman describes the trend as follows:Starting around 2000, the distribution of income between labor and capital shifted noticeably away from the former and towards the latter. Today, the labor share of income is in the mid-50s, compared to the mid-60s two decades ago.Despite rising returns to capital, there has not been a parallel increase in business investment. \u201cOne explanation,\u201d Furman argues, \u201cis that monopoly power has increased \u2014 which is consistent with higher returns and lower output.\u201dTogether, \u201cdeclining firm dynamism, high returns and low output, and disparities in the rate of return on investment are all potential consequences of increasing barriers to entry\u201d and restraining the operation of a free and open market.With these findings in place, Furman has laid out the groundwork for a liberal Democratic agenda:To the extent that these macroeconomic trends are related to decreased competition, then procompetitive policies have potential to not only benefit consumers but also improve the state of the macroeconomy by, for example, increasing productivity and ensuring that the benefits of growth are widely shared.Furman describes four areas where pro-competitive reforms are possible \u2014 and in some cases have already been initiated.The first is intellectual property and patent reform, areas where there is growing bipartisan agreement that excessive and often frivolous patent claims and the emergence of a new breed of patent tort litigators have held back innovation, especially technological innovation.The second is the need to increase the bargaining power of workers, whose leverage has steadily declined. More stringent antitrust enforcement could break up some business consolidation, giving workers access to job mobility; the practice of requiring employees to sign noncompete agreements should also be restrained.The third area is reform of state laws requiring occupational licensing, which Furman describes as an \u201cexample of policies that create inefficient and inequitable rents,\u201d and which have grown fivefold in the second half of the 20th century, from less than 5 percent of the work force in the early 1950s to 25 percent by 2008.While such licensing is needed in the case of health and safety occupations, in otherslicensing requirements create economic rents for licensed practitioners at the expense of excluded workers and consumers \u2014 increasing inefficiency and potentially also increasing inequality.Insofar as the licensing serves a legitimate need, the federal government can press for cross-border portability, giving licensees more opportunity to cross state lines for better jobs.The fourth is reform of land use regulation.\u201cOverly burdensome land-use restrictions \u2014 like minimum lot sizes, off-street parking requirements, height limits, prohibitions on multifamily housing, or lengthy permitting processes \u2014 can instead artificially reduce competition by acting as supply constraints,\u201d Furman contends. \u201cIn doing so, such policies both allow a small number of landowners to capture economic rents and reduce the stock of available affordable housing.\u201dFurman notes that land use constraints limit productivity growth and labor mobility by making it more difficult for workers to move to higher-productivity cities.One of the most vexing problems facing those seeking to develop a liberal, pro-competition agenda is the emergence of the digital marketplace.The complexity of the economics of the internet is, according to Furman, reflected in the following contradiction. On one hand, internet markets \u201chave tended to favor digital giants that hold high market shares\u201d and digitalization also poses an increased danger of opaque price fixing through the \u201cuse of advanced machine learning algorithms to set prices and adapt product functionality.\u201d On the other hand, the digital marketplace has encouraged competition by lowering \u201cmany costs for small businesses, increasing their ability to rapidly and inexpensively scale up, collect information on potential consumers, and create new products and ideas.\u201dThere is disagreement among economists concerning Furman\u2019s work.Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, wrote me by email: \u201cI am a big fan of Jason Furman and think the directions he has been sketching on technology, competition, and globalization make a lot of sense.\u201dDavid Card, an economist at Berkeley, conversely, wrote that he does not think Furman\u2019s proposals \u201cwill amount to more than a couple of percentage points higher wages (or a few percent lower prices) for low to middle income folks.\u201d Overall, Card said, \u201cI am deeply skeptical, to say the least.\u201dI would argue that even if Card is right, wages that are a couple of percentage points higher are nothing to sneeze at.Furman\u2019s proposals should not be viewed in isolation, but as one piece of a broader liberal agenda \u2014 an agenda that could include some or all of what Larry Summers, Isabel Sawhill, and others, have proposed.The economy has added nearly 10.7 million jobs; median household income has gone up $1,140, or 2 percent; the buying power of the average worker\u2019s weekly paycheck is up 4.2 percent; the median sales prices of existing single-family homes are up 23 percent; the unemployment rate has dropped well below the historical norm; job openings are at a 15-year high; corporate profits and stock prices have both soared to record highs; the number of people lacking health insurance has gone down by 16.5 million; the murder rate is down nearly 5 percent, despite an increase in 2015; and the number of unauthorized immigrants estimated to be living in the U.S. is down, according to demographers.There have also been a number of failures, as Factcheck.org also pointed out, perhaps most notably a 36 percent rise in the number of Americans on food stamps and a 0.3 increase in the poverty rate.Assuming for the moment that Clinton is Obama\u2019s successor, it will fall to her to build on his record and to address the yearning of those hard-pressed voters who have felt for far too long like beggars at the banquet.Advertisement"}

No, not the election: What to wear for Halloween.Some cities have banned or strongly discouraged clown outfits, while costume sellers have faced protests from Native Americans, Muslim Americans and other groups about anything that mimics traditional ethnic or religious dress.The fall ritual of dress-up has particularly haunted American universities, where past problems have led to annual warnings about costume choices.A recent visit to an Upper West Side outpost of Ricky\u2019s, the costume superstore chain in New York City, was like taking a field trip through the cultural markers of our unsettled times.The storefront window was festooned with the sign \u201cMaking Halloween Great Again!\u201d Inside were heaps of rubbery Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton masks..\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a funny joke,\u201d said Rose Fredman, 33, an Upper East Side resident, as she brushed past displays of the candidates\u2019 masks. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t wear one.\u201d\u201cLess scary, more upbeat,\u201d said Taycha Lino, an assistant manager, when asked about customers\u2019 preferences. \u201cI think it\u2019s because of the whole clown thing.\u201dPresidential politics seemed out of favor online.

A search for Hillary Clinton did not even rank.An analysis by state shows \u201cStar Wars\u201d costumes are popular in Texas; Batman in Alaska; and gumball machines leading searches around Helena, Mont.In recent years, some Halloween costume choices have reflected the darker side of current events, allowing people to feel a little less powerless by making fun of, or coming to grips with, their worst nightmares, according to Jack Santino, a folklore expert and professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He recalled people who dressed as priests and altar boys during the height of the Catholic Church\u2019s abuse scandals.\u201cThe whole idea of pushing boundaries or crossing lines is that there always is a line, but different people will cross it at different places,\u201d he said.Campuses tend to be at the forefront of Halloween controversies. Universities and colleges have started putting out annual warnings.This year at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, resident assistants posted advice about possibly offensive \u201ccultural appropriation,\u201d but the university does not ban costumes, said Ed Blaguszewski, a spokesman, in an email.The University of Florida, where students have posted photographs of themselves in blackface in previous years, reminded students this month that Halloween costumes can reinforce negative stereotypes.But the nature of this year\u2019s political campaign has some bracing for costumes that challenge ideas of good taste in public.Dr. Santino said public figures were typically viewed as fair game. \u201cThe whole moment of Halloween is reclaiming power and the public spaces as ours, and our public figures answer to us and we have the desire to bring them back to earth,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is one of those things that contribute to Islamophobic sentiments in the country, \u201c Mr. Hooper said. \u201cPeople can do it, there is no law against it, but everybody just needs to be respectful of each other.

{"Headline": "A Brand Inspired by a Hardworking Father", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byOn the Verge8 PhotosGrowing up in the suburbs of West Palm Beach, Jerome Peel spent hours watching his father fix old Hondas and dirt bikes. \u201cHe\u2019d be wearing this work shirt,\u201d Peel recalls. \u201cJust that blue shirt, unbuttoned, with a tank top tucked into his jeans. That was the coolest look to me.\u201d Last year, Peel was inspired to launch Peels NYC, a unisex line comprised of work shirts and utilitarian garments that pays homage to hard workers.Peel, now 26, moved to New York five years ago as a college student and spent most of his days skateboarding; like so many others, he saw the city as the ultimate source of accessibility and creative freedom. Last winter, his father asked him to design a company T-shirt for Peel\u2019s Painting \u2014 his small Florida house-painting business \u2014 and Peel was inspired. While sketching ideas for tees, all he could think of was the shirt his dad used to wear, a simple, short-sleeved button-up with embroidered patches above each chest pocket: one displaying the company name, the other that of the employee. With no real plan of starting a brand, Peel set about recreating his own version of the shirt he remembered, to give to his dad and a few friends. \u201cThose first shirts \u2014 there was no plan to sell them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for a few months before I was like, maybe I should actually try this.\u201dBefore long, Peel enlisted the help of his girlfriend, the model Sarah Brannon, who helped him with everything from creative direction to marketing. After a few months of orders trickling in, mostly from close friends and fellow skaters, they were picked up by the Lower East Side skate shop Labor, and by June they\u2019d received startlingly large orders from Prov, a cult concept shop in Tokyo. Peel was able to get a wholesale work-wear account through his dad\u2019s business to order the blank shirts in bulk to keep up with the rapidly growing demand. \u201cThey must think he has a ton of employees,\u201d he jokes.The brand\u2019s original shirt now comes in five colors (pale pink is the most popular) with two patch options, along with a variety of tees and hats. New fall styles include an embroidered bomber jacket in black and navy, a long-sleeved T-shirt featuring the brand\u2019s popular rose logo and a long-sleeved version of the signature shirt. Peel and a small team hand-dyes and embroiders the shirts in the basement of his Bushwick apartment on a rickety old embroidery machine he found on eBay and taught himself to use. It\u2019s only fitting that the homespun production reflects what the brand reveres: no-frills hard work. It\u2019s why their customers range from models and fashion editors (the shirts were everywhere during fashion month) to Ryan Moutinho of the band Thee Oh Sees and New York skateboarding legend Mark Gonzales to city kids skating through traffic.Though keen to expand, Peel is decidedly uninterested in growing too fast. \u201cI want the steps to be small and I want them to come naturally,\u201d he says. Among the tangle of emerging T-shirt brands riding the skate and streetwear trend wave, the brand feels unmistakably authentic.

{"Headline": "The Funfetti Explosion", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byRainbow sprinkles (also called jimmies in parts of the Northeast) are made from sugar, various waxy shortenings and bright artificial colors. They did not align with Ms. Nelson\u2019s vision for \u201celevated\u201d cupcakes, which are made from quality ingredients like Madagascar vanilla and Dutch cocoa, and topped with a two-tone button of color that she calls a \u201cmodern dot.\u201d\u201cThe top is the aspirational part of the cupcake,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted it to have a more evolved aesthetic.\u201dBut Ms. Nelson did not reckon with the awesome power of rainbow sprinkles.In the intervening years, largely through photo-friendly social media sites like Pinterest and Instagram, they have coated the entire world of baking \u2014 and beyond. Rainbow sprinkles (also known as Funfetti and unicorn food) first invaded cookies and waffles; then marched on, swarming over cocktails and croissants, and finally, as a design motif, onto phone cases, scented candles and press-on nails.Dannon Sprinkl\u2019ins, yogurt with rainbow sprinkles packed on top, arrived in 1992. Pillsbury owns the trademark for the word, but it became so popular as people grew up with it that it is now a synonym for rainbow sprinkles, the way Kleenex is for tissues.But her baking experiments began long ago \u2014 with Funfetti. \u201cI loved transforming cake mixes into cake-mix cookies,\u201d said Ms. Tosi, 34. \u201cThey were sandy but fudgy. The Funfetti cookie was my favorite one to bring around the neighborhood.\u201d Birthday Cake remains the bakery\u2019s best-selling cake, and in homage, an entire wall of the newest Milk Bar outpost, in NoLIta, is coated with (plastic) rainbow sprinkles.In home kitchens, rainbow sprinkles showed up in pancakes and waffles, cookies and cupcakes. \u201cThey\u2019re just so photogenic,\u201d said Ms. Yeh, who put them in unlikely places like tahini blondie ice cream sandwiches and mandelbrot. \u201cI think of it like garnishing a dish with parsley, and they make anything look festive.\u201d (True story: At Ms. Yeh\u2019s 2014 wedding, guests threw rainbow sprinkles instead of rice.)On Instagram and Pinterest, Funfetti has run rampant, transforming formerly plain food like cheesecake, sugar cookies and even oatmeal into dizzying rainbow treats. You can marvel at Funfetti martinis (made with white chocolate liqueur and cake-flavored vodka and rimmed with sprinkles), Funfetti cheese balls (sweetened cream cheese coated with sprinkles) and rainbow sprinkle cinnamon rolls. According to Pinterest, in the last year, users 25 to 34 years old have saved 260 percent more Funfetti ideas than the year before. Among all users, the increase is 20 percent.\u201cWe are obsessed with Funfetti, and we\u2019re the first generation to grow up with social media,\u201d said Ms. Yeh, 27. \u201cThe combination of that and nostalgia explains why rainbow sprinkles are all over the internet.\u201dIn the real world, rainbow sprinkles have been vaulting up the food chain. At Faun, an ambitious New York restaurant, a slice of Gorgonzola crusted with rainbow sprinkles is sometimes served as the cheese course.And of course, in Brooklyn, there is a hip, slightly ironic diner where the husband-and-wife owners produce rainbow sprinkles from scratch.The diner\u2019s tall vanilla layer cake is plastered with \u201csprinkles\u201d that are as long and thin as a pretzel stick, giving it an eccentric, shaggy quality that clearly does not come from a box.Nonpareils, tiny round candies that are a European relative of our sprinkles, are also popular in rainbow colors. But rainbow sprinkles \u2014 the cylindrical, waxy kind invented in the United States around 1920 \u2014 have a special place in the hearts of many Americans.The Merlin cone wears a thick Elizabethan ruff of rainbow sprinkles, and even an order for a plain vanilla cup arrives as a parfait, striped with sprinkles. \u201cWith soft-serve, there aren\u2019t many toppings or mix-ins that we can use, so sprinkles are particularly important,\u201d he said.Mr. Quint, who constantly tests new brands and mixtures, says that sprinkles are not merely decoration; he loves their \u201cwaxy crunch\u201d and trace of vanilla flavor. \u201cThey are candy, after all,\u201d he said.He also has strong feelings about colors. \u201cWhite is a waste of real estate,\u201d he said, advising me to buy solid-colored sprinkles and concoct my own rainbow mixture. \u201cUse half as much yellow as everything else,\u201d were his parting words.With white frosting and my new house blend (two parts blue, one part pink, one part orange and one part yellow sprinkles), the effect was brightly irresistible.It tastes like a vanilla cake, but it looks like a happy childhood.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Paid $2,500 for a \u2018Hamilton\u2019 Ticket. I\u2019m Happy About It.", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewConsumers of goods and services do not typically wish that producers charged higher prices. But that was exactly my desire on a recent trip to New York City.The story begins with a basic mismatch: I am a big fan of theater, and I live just outside Boston. While Boston is a good city for the arts, it is not the mecca that New York is. Unfortunately, I\u2019m in New York only a few times every year. But when my professional or personal life takes me into the city, I always try to squeeze a play into my schedule.That occurred most recently over Columbus Day weekend. I was in New York visiting colleges with my wife and younger son, who is a high school senior. Most colleges don\u2019t give tours on Sunday, so we had Sunday afternoon free \u2014 perfect timing to see a matinee.We had no doubt about what we wanted to see. \u201cHamilton\u201d had received rave reviews from both critics and our friends who had seen it. We had much enjoyed \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d an earlier musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the genius behind \u201cHamilton.\u201d And as an economist, I have always viewed Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary, as one of the most important and intriguing founding fathers.We, however, had no problem getting tickets. Two weeks before our trip, I logged into StubHub, the online ticket marketplace owned by eBay. I found the performance we wanted, located some great seats and within a few minutes was printing our tickets.Now, at this point, some people might object to this price. Terms like \u201cscalping\u201d and \u201cprice gouging\u201d are pejoratives used to demonize those who resell tickets at whatever high prices the market will bear.To be sure, most people can\u2019t easily afford paying so much for a few hours of entertainment. That is indeed lamentable. The arts expand our horizons, and in a perfect world, everyone would have the opportunity to see a megahit like \u201cHamilton.\u201dYet there is another way to view the situation. It was only because the price was so high that I was able to buy tickets at all on such short notice. If legal restrictions or moral sanctions had forced prices to remain close to face value, it is likely that no tickets would have been available by the time my family got around to planning its trip to the city.High prices are a natural reflection of great demand and scant supply. In a free market, in which private individuals can engage in mutually advantageous gains from trade, they are inevitable until demand subsides or supply expands.Yet zero is not, as economists put it, the equilibrium price to see a live performance by Jay Leno. Some of the unemployed who received free tickets tried to turn around and sell them on eBay for about $800. When Mr. Leno learned about this, he objected, and eBay agreed to take down offers to resell the tickets.But why should Mr. Leno have objected? Some unemployed workers, presumably short on cash, thought that the $800 in their pockets was more valuable than an evening of laughs. Similarly, the ticket buyers would voluntarily give up their $800 for a seat. The transaction makes both buyer and seller better off. That is how free markets are supposed to work.The only person made worse off by the sale is, perhaps, Mr. Leno himself. He wanted to be seen performing before an audience of the unemployed. Doing a show for higher-income residents of Michigan might not be viewed as altruistic, even if it left the unemployed better off. In other words, Mr. Leno\u2019s objection to the eBay resale was arguably a rationally self-interested act in that the resale impeded his ability to appear selfless to others and, even, to himself.Although I don\u2019t object to ticket resales above face value, and I think it is pernicious when others do, I was saddened by my \u201cHamilton\u201d transaction in one important way. About 80 percent of what I paid went to the ticket reseller, rather than to Mr. Miranda and his investors.Such a move would surely increase the show\u2019s profitability. From my standpoint as a theater consumer, that\u2019s a good thing. Future talents like Mr. Miranda would find it easier to fund their innovative theater projects. And with more projects funded, those consumers who don\u2019t buy \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets \u2014 perhaps deterred by its uniquely high prices \u2014 would find a greater variety of other shows from which to choose.N.

Covetable clothing like vermilion corduroy sailor pants finished with black piping by Yves Saint Laurent and a carmine velvet dress by Sonia Rykiel hang on her racks.So busy is Koenigsberg \u2014 in addition to curating threads, she raises her 8-year-old adopted daughter alone \u2014 that wandering the neighborhood is a welcome respite for her. \u201cI\u2019ve never noticed that building before,\u201d she says, pointing upward as we head south on Ludlow. The smooth bricks of Seward Park High School look mauve in the morning light. Crossing Delancey, she stops at the corner to adjust her black Robert Clergerie shoes. A man in bluejeans, toting a blue plastic bag slouches besides us.\u201cYou know what I used to do along here?\u201d he gestures to the empty street. \u201cBuy shirts, shorts, underwear by the dozen!\u201d\u201cI know, all gone now, right?\u201d Koenigsberg gamely replies.\u201cThe buildings are here,\u201d he points, his clear aqua eyes bulging. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll be here after you and I are gone.\u201d\u201cSee,\u201d she confides, as the man rounds the corner. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like this neighborhood.\u201d We continue south, passing the new Metrograph theater, which shows old 35 mm films (playing \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d that evening), then veer east on Canal toward Seward Park. \u201cLook,\u201d Koenigsberg says, glancing toward the Crayola-colored playground. \u201cThey\u2019re dancing.\u201d A cluster of Chinese women \u2014 dressed in vibrant, mismatched polyester \u2014 twirl together. She says they are an inspiration for her own style. \u201cThey always wear like three different patterns, jackets with little flowers and polyester pants and \u2014 oh my god. I still would dress like that.\u201dKoenigsberg seemed destined to deal vintage. Raised on Long Island, she and her brother often thrifted together. Her career, however, has been circuitous. Before opening Ellen, she was a makeup artist, working on fashion editorial photo shoots. Then she turned 40 and explains, \u201cI had this mini sort of, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019\u201d So she opened a vintage pop-up in a now-defunct furniture boutique on Bleecker and Lafayette. \u201cIt was $800 a month and I was terrified I couldn\u2019t make the rent,\u201d she remembers. (She made that \u2014 and more \u2014 opening week.)As we walk up Orchard Street, trendier restaurants and shops \u2014 The Fat Radish, Bar Belly, Lindsey Thornberg \u2014 punctuate every block. \u201cIt used to be a destination for vintage,\u201d she remembers of the Lower East Side\u2019s many iterations. And though Koenigsberg refers to her shop as \u201ceveryone\u2019s best-kept secret,\u201d her neighbors know her well. At North Dumpling, a hole-in-the-wall on Essex, the proprietors greet her warmly; as we exit Economy Candy \u2014 a 1937 establishment crammed with confections \u2014 the store\u2019s owner stops to say hello. Koenigsberg too saves everyone\u2019s stories, pointing to shops on her street, remembering when they moved in, what stores they replaced.\u201cWho knows how long I\u2019ll be here,\u201d she wonders from her shop\u2019s counter, fearing the future \u2014 but unconditionally devoted to her labor of love. \u201cI could have never worked as hard at being a makeup artist as I do this,\u201d she says, then neatly adjusts a navy Bill Blass coat on its hanger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marmite Survives After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Spurs Tesco-Unilever Price Dispute", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the first tangible victim of that decision has emerged and, like the 28-nation bloc itself, it is something that has divided the country for years: Marmite, a sludgy and odd-tasting breakfast spread.But they probably never thought it would come to this.Fears that Marmite and other British classics, like the PG Tips brand of tea, might disappear from store shelves had gripped Britons after reports that the supermarket chain Tesco and the owner of those brands, the British-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever, were locked in a price dispute over who should bear the cost of the weakening pound. Marmite was briefly unavailable in Tesco\u2019s online market, and store supplies dwindled.The pound has fallen drastically against other major currencies since the vote to leave the bloc, and as worries have increased that Britain would opt for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2014 shorthand for a strict break with the European Union \u2014 which could limit its tariff-free access to the region\u2019s single market for goods and services.But after the markets closed on Thursday, Tesco reassured the public that the crisis had been averted. In a statement, Tesco said, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased this situation has been resolved to our satisfaction.\u201dIn reality, consumers will most likely have to dig deeper into their pocketbooks. Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer, said during an earnings call on Thursday that \u201cprices should start to increase to cover the cost of imported goods due to weaker sterling.\u201dStill, the concerns over the beloved consumer goods led to a political uproar.\u201cWho would have thought that the first casualty of a hard Brexit would be the nation\u2019s supplies of Marmite?\u201d asked Pete Wishart, a member of Parliament for the Scottish National Party, which campaigned to remain in the European Union.On Twitter, Britons wryly noted that store shelves were emptied of Marmite jars, and one used jar was put up for sale on eBay for 100,000 pounds, or about $122,000. News bulletins on the BBC led with the possible Marmite shortage.\u201cThis is a concrete case of Brexit affecting people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Pinar Hosafci, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor International. \u201cTalk of Brexit had been more political, financial and a bit abstract\u201d before, she added. \u201cThis touches their lives.\u201dAmong the affected brands is Colman\u2019s Mustard, which, like Marmite, is produced in Britain.Analysts noted that although Marmite and some of the other affected brands were made in Britain, Unilever published its company results in euros, meaning that those products were still affected by a weaker pound. Imported household goods like Dove soap and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream are also under the Unilever umbrella.In 2011, Tesco refused to stock Branston Pickle after another supplier, Premier Foods, tried to pass on cost increases.Analysts have predicted that food prices will start to rise across the board in the coming months as supermarkets struggle to absorb the extra cost of imported goods, which are more expensive when a currency weakens.Stores have already stopped promotions and discounts on their products, Ms. Hosafci said. But \u201cprice increases will start happening in the next four to five months, when they will need to renew their stocks.\u201d\u201cEventually, they\u2019ll need to increase prices,\u201d she added. \u201cOtherwise, their businesses will no longer be profitable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Salesforce Has Had Its Eye on Twitter. But Why?", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byBitsOctober in San Francisco is a special time. The fog lifts. The temperature rises. The Blue Angels buzz overhead for Fleet Week as tens of thousands of business technology types descend on the city for Salesforce.com\u2019s annual conference.This year\u2019s Salesforce shindig comes with a little extra noise: For weeks now, there have been reports that the company, which makes online software to help users manage tasks like sales and marketing, is looking to buy Twitter.It is not a stretch to say that this would be a puzzling move. Salesforce has become a staple of San Francisco. It is arguably the city\u2019s biggest tech employer, and the soon-to-be tallest building in town will carry the company\u2019s name. While it has never had big profits, the Salesforce business appears stable and growing.Just a few miles down the road from Salesforce\u2019s main office is the home of Twitter, a company with a much-better-known brand but a far less successful business. Twitter is a giant of social media, of course, used by celebrities, athletes and presidential candidates. But it is struggling with growth and its problem with trolls, a term for those who torment others online, and various sorts of hateful content have proved hard to fix.How the two companies would jell is not clear. Could Salesforce absorb all of Twitter\u2019s content to improve its artificial intelligence projects? Could Salesforce help its customers gain a better understanding of their brands by having close access to the world\u2019s Twitter feeds? And would any of that justify putting up with Twitter\u2019s problems?\u201cThis would be a disaster,\u201d said Joel Fishbein, managing director at BTIG, a financial services firm. \u201cBenioff is a visionary, but this could blow up. Engineers could leave Salesforce, and it would send the stock down 30 or 40 percent.\u201dMixing different kinds of tech companies into one big outfit rarely goes well. EBay and Skype didn\u2019t work, before eBay sold Skype to a group of investors. Cisco Systems, the networking technology company, tried to get into the consumer electronics business with acquisitions like Pure Digital, but it eventually shut down the whole consumer effort. And do we even need to mention star-crossed combinations like Google and Motorola, and Microsoft and Nokia?Sometimes it\u2019s best to stick to what you\u2019re good at. Your product may not be a fixture on the celebrity circuit, but having your name on the tallest building in your hometown is a pretty high-profile thing, too.Advertisement"}
