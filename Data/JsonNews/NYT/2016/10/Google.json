{"Headline": "A New Era of Internet Attacks Powered by Everyday Devices", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When surveillance cameras began popping up in the 1970s and \u201980s, they were welcomed as a crime-fighting tool, then as a way to monitor traffic congestion, factory floors and even baby cribs. Later, they were adopted for darker purposes, as authoritarian governments like China\u2019s used them to prevent challenges to power by keeping tabs on protesters and dissidents.But now those cameras \u2014 and many other devices that today are connected to the internet \u2014 have been commandeered for an entirely different purpose: as a weapon of mass disruption. The internet slowdown that swept the East Coast on Friday, when many Americans were already jittery about the possibility that hackers could interfere with election systems, offered a glimpse of a new era of vulnerabilities confronting a highly connected society.The attack on the infrastructure of the internet, which made it all but impossible at times to check Twitter feeds or headlines, was a remarkable reminder about how billions of ordinary web-connected devices \u2014 many of them highly insecure \u2014 can be turned to vicious purposes. And the threats will continue long after Election Day for a nation that increasingly keeps its data in the cloud and has oftentimes kept its head in the sand.Remnants of the attack continued to slow some sites on Saturday, though the biggest troubles had abated. Still, to the tech community, Friday\u2019s events were as inevitable as an earthquake along the San Andreas fault. A new kind of malicious software exploits a long-known vulnerability in those cameras and other cheap devices that are now joining up to what has become known as the internet of things.The advantage of putting every device on the internet is obvious. It means your refrigerator can order you milk when you are running low, and the printer on your home network can tell a retailer that you need more ink. Security cameras can alert your cellphone when someone is walking up the driveway, whether it is a delivery worker or a burglar. When Google and the Detroit automakers get their driverless cars on the road, the internet of things will become your chauffeur.But hundreds of thousands, and maybe millions, of those security cameras and other devices have been infected with a fairly simple program that guessed at their factory-set passwords \u2014 often \u201cadmin\u201d or \u201c12345\u201d or even, yes, \u201cpassword\u201d \u2014 and, once inside, turned them into an army of simple robots. Each one was commanded, at a coordinated time, to bombard a small company in Manchester, N.H., called Dyn DNS with messages that overloaded its circuits.Few have heard of Dyn, but it essentially acts as one of the internet\u2019s giant switchboards. Bring it to a halt, and the problems spread instantly. It did not take long to reduce Twitter, Reddit and Airbnb \u2014 as well as the news feeds of The New York Times \u2014 to a crawl.The culprit is unclear, and it may take days or weeks to detect it. In the end, though, the answer probably does not mean much anyway.The vulnerability the country woke up to on Friday morning can be easily exploited by a nation-state such as Russia, which the Obama administration has blamed for hacking into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign officials. It could also be exploited by a criminal group, which was the focus of much of the guesswork about Friday\u2019s attack, or even by teenagers. The opportunities for copycats are endless.\u201cIf the attacker has a bigger fire hose of data than the defender has,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe attacker wins.\u201dBut in recent times, hackers have been exploring the vulnerabilities of the companies that make up the backbone of the internet \u2014 just as states recently saw examinations of the systems that hold their voter registration rolls. Attacks on the companies escalated, Mr. Schneier wrote, \u201cas if the attack were looking for the exact point of failure.\u201d Think of the mighty Maginot Line, tested again and again by the German Army in 1940, until it found the weak point and rolled into Paris.The difference with the internet is that it is not clear in the United States who is supposed to be protecting it. The network does not belong to the government \u2014 or really to anyone. Instead, every organization is responsible for defending its own little piece. Banks, retailers and social media hubs are supposed to invest in protecting their websites, but that does not help much if the connections among them are severed.The Department of Homeland Security is supposed to provide the baseline of internet defense for the United States, but it is constantly playing catch-up. In recent weeks, it deployed teams to the states to help them find and patch vulnerabilities in their voter registration systems and their networks for reporting results.The F.B.I. investigates breaches, but that takes time \u2014 and, in the meantime, people want to bank online and stream television shows. On Nov. 8, Americans will have to look up where they are supposed to vote, and, in a few cases, they will cast their votes on the internet. Yet the voting system is not considered part of the nation\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201dThe head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, said recently that experts were looking at the problem the wrong way. \u201cWe are over-focused on places and things,\u201d he said in a talk at Harvard. \u201cWe need to focus on the data,\u201d and how it flows \u2014 or doesn\u2019t flow.That is where the internet of things comes in. Most of the devices have been hooked up to the web over the past few years with little concern for security. Cheap parts, some coming from Chinese suppliers, have weak or no password protections, and it is not obvious how to change those passwords.And the problem is quickly expanding: Cisco estimates that the number of such devices could reach 50 billion by 2020, from 15 billion today. Intel puts the number at roughly 200 billion devices in the same time frame. (Assuming the global population is around 7.7 billion people in 2020, that would be about six to 26 devices per person.)Security researchers have been warning of this problem for years, but that caution has largely been written off as hype or fear-mongering. Then Brian Krebs, who runs a popular site on internet security, was struck by a significant attack a few weeks ago. The company protecting him, Akamai, gave up. The malware behind the attack, called Mirai, had a built-in dictionary of common passwords and used them to hijack devices to become attackers.Chester Wisniewski, a principal computer research scientist at Sophos, a security company, said that attacks like the one on Dyn \u201cmight be the beginning of a new era of internet attacks conducted via \u2018smart\u2019 things.\u201d\u201cThere are tens of millions more insecure \u2018smart\u2019 things that could cause incredible disruptions, if harnessed,\u201d Mr. Wisniewski added in an email.It is possible, investigators say, that the attack on Dyn was conducted by a criminal group that wanted to extort the company. Or it could have been done by \u201chacktivists.\u201d Or a foreign power that wanted to remind the United States of its vulnerability. The answer may not come by Election Day, but the next wave of attacks very well could.David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Living in China\u2019s Expanding Deserts", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "People on the edges of the country\u2019s vast seas of sand are being displaced by climate change.By JOSH HANER, EDWARD WONG, DEREK WATKINS and JEREMY WHITEFor years, China\u2019s deserts spread at an annual rate of more than 1,300 square miles. Many villages have been lost. Climate change and human activities have accelerated desertification. China says government efforts to relocate residents, plant trees and limit herding have slowed or reversed desert growth in some areas. But the usefulness of those policies is debated by scientists, and deserts are expanding in critical regions.BeijingARIDREGIONSTENGGERDESERTShanghaiHong KongBeijingARIDREGIONSTENGGERDESERTShanghaiHong KongNearly 20 percent of China is desert, and drought across the northern region is getting worse. One recent estimate said China had 21,000 square miles more desert than what existed in 1975 \u2014 about the size of Croatia. As the Tengger expands, it is merging with two other deserts to form a vast sea of sand that could become uninhabitable.Liu Jiali, 4, lives in the Tengger.Like Jiali\u2019s family, many people herd animals and run small tourist parks on the edge of the Tengger Desert.Jiali lives in an area called Alxa League, where the government has relocated about 30,000 people, who are called \u201cecological migrants,\u201d because of desertification.Across northern China, generations of families have made a living herding animals on the edge of the desert. Officials say that along with climate change, overgrazing is contributing to the desert\u2019s growth. But some experiments suggest moderate grazing may actually mitigate the effects of climate change on grasslands, and China\u2019s herder relocation policies could be undermining that.Officials have given Jiali and her family a home in a village about six miles from Swan Lake, the oasis where they run a tourist park. To get them to move and sell off their herd of more than 70 sheep, 30 cows and eight camels, the officials have offered an annual subsidy equivalent to $1,500 for each of her parents and $1,200 for a grandmother who lives with them.Jiali\u2019s mother, Du Jinping, 45, said the family would live in the new village in the winter, but return to Swan Lake in the summer.Jiali\u2019s mother, Du Jinping, 45, said the family would live in the new village in the winter, but return to Swan Lake in the summer.The family charges each tourist $4.50 to visit Swan Lake.Visitors also rent camels and dune buggies.And they can pay to eat in the round Mongolian tents, called gers.But the oasis, which is the main attraction, is shrinking.Many of the oases in the Tengger are drying up.Local governments in desert regions began relocating people away from the encroaching sands decades ago.JILINMONGOLIAINNERMONGOLIALIAONINGNORTHKOREAGOBIDESERTSeoulBeijingHohhotXINJIANGSOUTHKOREAHEBEITengger DesertTaiyuanGANSUSHANDONGSHANXININGXIAJIANGSUCHINALanzhouHENANShanghaiQINGHAISHAANXIANHUIHUBEIZHEJIANGTIBETChengduJIANGXISICHUANHUNANTaipeiFUJIANGUIZHOUJILINMONGOLIAINNERMONGOLIANORTHKOREALIAONINGGOBIDESERTSeoulBeijingHohhotXINJIANGSOUTHKOREATengger DesertHEBEITaiyuanGANSUSHANDONGSHANXININGXIACHINAJIANGSULanzhouXi\u2019anShanghaiHENANQINGHAISHAANXIANHUIHUBEIZHEJIANGTIBETChengduJIANGXISICHUANTaipeiHUNANFUJIANGUIZHOUJILINMONGOLIAINNERMONGOLIALIAONINGGOBIDESERTNORTHKOREAHohhotBeijingTengger DesertHEBEITaiyuanSHANDONGSHANXININGXIAJIANGSUHENANLanzhouShanghaiSHAANXIANHUICHINAHUBEIZHEJIANGChengduJIANGXISICHUANHUNANFUJIANGUIZHOUGUANGDONGGUANGXIZHUANGZUYUNNANVIETNAMMONGOLIAGOBIDESERTHohhotBeijingTengger DesertTaiyuanShanghaiLanzhouChengduCHINAVIETNAMBut China\u2019s densely populated areas are pushing toward the deserts, as the deserts grow toward the cities.JILINMONGOLIAINNERMONGOLIALIAONINGNORTHKOREAModerately populated areasSeoulBeijingXINJIANGDensely populated areasSOUTHKOREADesertExpansionHEBEITaiyuanGANSUYinchuanSHANDONGSHANXININGXIAJIANGSUCHINALanzhouXi\u2019anHENANShanghaiQINGHAISHAANXIANHUIHUBEIZHEJIANGTIBETChengduJIANGXISICHUANHUNANTaipeiFUJIANGUIZHOUMONGOLIAModerately populated areasHohhotBeijingTaiyuanDesertExpansionShanghaiLanzhouDensely populated areasChengduCHINAVIETNAMJILINMONGOLIAINNERMONGOLIALIAONINGModerately populated areasNORTHKOREAHohhotBeijingHEBEIDesertExpansionTaiyuanSHANDONGSHANXININGXIAJIANGSUHENANLanzhouShanghaiSHAANXIANHUICHINAHUBEIZHEJIANGChengduJIANGXIDensely populated areasSICHUANHUNANFUJIANGUIZHOUGUANGDONGGUANGXIZHUANGZUYUNNANVIETNAMINNERMONGOLIAJILINMONGOLIANORTHKOREAModerately populated areasSeoulBeijingHohhotXINJIANGSOUTHKOREADesertExpansionHEBEITaiyuanSHANDONGYinchuanGANSUDensely populated areasSHANXININGXIACHINAJIANGSULanzhouXi\u2019anShanghaiHENANQINGHAISHAANXIANHUIHUBEIZHEJIANGTIBETChengduJIANGXISICHUANTaipeiHUNANFUJIANGUIZHOUStorms of wind-driven sand have become increasingly frequent and intense, reaching Beijing and other large cities. \u201cWe dread the sandstorms,\u201d Ms. Du said.JILINMONGOLIAINNERMONGOLIAHigh sandstorm severityLIAONINGNORTHKOREAModerate sandstorm severitySeoulBeijingHohhotXINJIANGSOUTHKOREAHEBEITaiyuanGANSUYinchuanSHANDONGSHANXININGXIAJIANGSUCHINALanzhouHENANShanghaiQINGHAISHAANXIANHUIHUBEIZHEJIANGTIBETChengduJIANGXISICHUANHUNANTaipeiFUJIANGUIZHOUJILINMONGOLIAHigh sandstorm severityINNERMONGOLIANORTHKOREALIAONINGModerate sandstorm severitySeoulBeijingHohhotXINJIANGSOUTHKOREAHEBEITaiyuanYinchuanGANSUSHANDONGSHANXININGXIACHINAJIANGSULanzhouShanghaiHENANQINGHAISHAANXIANHUIHUBEIZHEJIANGTIBETChengduJIANGXISICHUANTaipeiHUNANFUJIANGUIZHOUJILINMONGOLIAINNERMONGOLIALIAONINGNORTHKOREAHohhotBeijingHEBEITaiyuanSHANDONGSHANXININGXIAJIANGSUHENANLanzhouShanghaiSHAANXIANHUICHINAHUBEIZHEJIANGChengduJIANGXISICHUANHUNANFUJIANGUIZHOUGUANGDONGGUANGXIZHUANGZUYUNNANVIETNAMMONGOLIAModerate sandstorm severityBeijingTaiyuanShanghaiLanzhouHigh sandstorm severityChengduCHINAVIETNAMResidents who live on the edge of the deserts try to limit the steady march of the sand. Along with local governments, they plant trees in an effort to block the wind and stabilize the soil.Many people in this area are from families that fled Minqin, at the western end of the Tengger Desert, during China\u2019s Great Famine from 1958 to 1962, when tens of millions died.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Guo Kaiming, 40, a farmer who also manages a tourist park at the edge of the Tengger Desert, planted rows of trees by a new cross-desert highway in June.Mr. Guo took saplings that the government had left behind after it completed a tree planting operation.He said he was not ready to join the climate refugees. He has his corn and wheat fields, plus income from running the tourist park.Last year, the company that operates the park paid students to build seven giant sand sculptures as its centerpiece.But strong desert winds steadily eroded them.\u201cThey are all a mess now,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cThe wind is fierce.\u201d\u201cIt has messed up everything.\u201dThe government encourages farmers like Mr. Guo because it says agriculture can help reclaim land from the desert. Officials offer subsidies: Mr. Guo gets $600 per year for \u201cgrassland ecological protection.\u201dBut farming is also becoming more difficult. Huang Chunmei, who grew up in the town of Tonggunao\u2019er and now farms there, said the water table was two meters, or about six feet, below ground during her childhood, and \u201cnow, you have to dig four or five meters.\u201dMs. Huang planted more than 200 trees on her own last spring, in the hope that they would help block sandstorms and hold back the sand.Ms. Huang, 38, grows corn and tomatoes, some in greenhouse structures.\u201cThe soil is not as soft or good as it was before,\u201d she said. \u201cWe use more fertilizer now.\u201dMs. Huang and her husband have sent their 14-year-old daughter to a boarding school in a nearby city.\u201cI don\u2019t want my girl to return,\u201d she said.\u201cThe sand and wind make life tough here.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see what she wants to do when she finishes school.\u201dAbout 17 percent of the population in Alxa League are ethnic Mongolians, whose lives and livelihoods have long been tied to the herding the government is trying to halt.Mengkebuyin, 42, and his wife, Mandula, 41, grow corn and sunflowers, but their 200 sheep provide most of their income: They sell the meat to a hotel restaurant in a nearby city.The sheep graze in the desert, where grass is growing scarce. They roam by his old family home, near the shores of a lake that dried up years ago. Mengkebuyin and his wife maintain the old home but do not stay for long periods.They have moved to a village five miles away.Mengkebuyin uses a motorcycle and a desert buggy to drive the sheep to graze. He herds the sheep toward the old family home, where he can give the animals water. He would like to move to better pasture, but the government will not allow it.Mengkebuyin uses a motorcycle and a desert buggy to drive the sheep to graze.He would like to move to better pasture, but the government will not allow it.He herds the sheep toward the old family home, where he can give the animals water.Mengkebuyin and Mandula have decided that they want their 16-year-old daughter to live and work in a city.Four generations of Mengkebuyin\u2019s family lived by the lake in a thriving community.

{"Headline": "Salesforce Rules Out a Bid for Twitter", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter may have to fix its problems on its own, at least for now.Salesforce.com, the enterprise software maker that had been the most likely bidder for the embattled social media company, has declined to pursue a takeover.As Salesforce exits, virtually no other suitors seem likely to emerge. Rumors of potential other bidders \u2014 Google, Disney and Apple were among the names floated \u2014 quickly evaporated.Shares of Twitter, which had stabilized on the hopes that Salesforce might still make a bid, dropped about 5 percent in afternoon trading on Friday, to $16.88.And shares of Salesforce rose about 5 percent, to $74.27.Mr. Benioff confirmed his remarks but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Twitter, Kristin Binns, declined to comment.The interview all but confirms that Twitter will need to pursue a self-help plan rather than looking to a new owner that could shield it from the skepticism of stock market investors.Despite its prominence as a forum for public discussion \u2014 especially during the presidential race \u2014 Twitter has still lost ground to competitors old and new. Some Twitter users have been leaving the service, and the company has found it difficult to persuade people to join. Its advertising revenue growth is also on a path toward slowing down.During the weeks when rumors of a Twitter deal reached fever pitch, speculation swirled around potential divides within the company\u2019s board. Among those who opposed a sale, at least at first, was Jack Dorsey, its co-founder and chief executive.More recently, Mr. Dorsey had become increasingly open to selling the company. Without a deal, Mr. Dorsey and his team are more likely to face tough questions when earnings are reported on Oct. 27.\u201cThere is declining advertising interest in Twitter,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cWhen you overlay that with the company\u2019s current fundamentals, you\u2019ll see very little top line revenue growth next year.\u201dAt the same time, companies mooted as potential buyers had decided that Twitter at its current valuation \u2014 its market capitalization has surpassed $13 billion at certain points \u2014 was too expensive and required too much work to fix.Salesforce\u2019s investors are probably feeling some relief.For much of its 17-year existence, Salesforce has relied on acquisitions to grow, augmenting its core customer-relationship management offerings. But 2016 has proved a particularly active time for deal-making at the company. Salesforce has bought 13 companies for more than $4.4 billion.Shareholders were upset that in August, Mr. Benioff agreed to pay $582 million for a company called Quip, a maker of real-time collaboration software that had negligible revenue. But Mr. Benioff said he needed its founders to rebuild his corporate architecture for the next new things in corporate software.A bid for Twitter \u2014 a consumer-oriented company with significant challenges \u2014 represented to many investors an act of overweening ambition. At a $12 billion market cap, Twitter would have been the largest deal yet for Salesforce, which is worth $50 billion.In an interview during his annual customer conference this month, he said he was attracted to Twitter as a way for companies to field customer complaints and promote themselves, and pursued the deal in part to learn more about the current tech market.Some of that may have been bluster. Mr. Benioff has often treated his company a bit like a start-up, both in his generous stock grants to employees and his single-minded decision-making. Yet many large Salesforce shareholders, including the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, sent emails and other messages to Salesforce executives voicing their displeasure.The prospect of a shareholder revolt could have proved disastrous for the company, which relies heavily on its stock for its deal-making and to pay its employees. A sustained drop in Salesforce\u2019s stock price would harm both activities.In a meeting with analysts last week, Mr. Benioff sounded unusually contrite and somewhat shocked that his impetuous style had riled his biggest shareholders. \u201cWe will think through everything, but we would never do a deal that would ever do the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails,\u201d Mr. Benioff said at that meeting.By Friday, Mr. Benioff conceded that Twitter was a deal he could afford to pass up.\u201cIt\u2019s not the right fit for us for many different reasons,\u201d he said in the Financial Times interview.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Something is always listening in to hear that command to invoke the functions of the device, which means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listening in all the time. So where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the protection of your privacy? I think they have to work on some way to get around that creepiness factor. That may be something to do with why Siri and Cortana haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t caught on bigger.But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the general problem with artificial intelligence, that sometimes the jobs you would like an assistant to do are very big jobs, all packed into some phrase like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet me ready for a trip to Indonesia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not anywhere near as easy as it sounds.Do these privacy questions come up on \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Trek\u00e2\u0080\u009d?I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember them talking about it, but they could always verbally call for the command of the computer, so they must have implicitly meant that. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also kind of interesting the limits on what they thought of. They were very visionary and forward-looking, but there were some things that they missed that we have today. They basically confined their ideas to a monolithic computer in the ship; they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of these networks of smaller or simpler computers that were bigger than sum of their parts. And of course they never thought of social stuff like Facebook, that people would spend so much time interacting, posting their family photos and stuff like that.They had a lot of problems with robots in their storylines. A lot of times the robots would rebel. In the \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Trek\u00e2\u0080\u009d movie #1 this robot explorer comes back and tries to destroy the world. It was a little bit of an ambiguous relationship to computers.Beyond privacy concerns, are there other problems that a really good digital assistant would pose? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hacking problem, if somebody gets unauthorized access to it. We have the Internet of Things appearing now, and a lot of the things are not very secure. People are saying, put a piece of tape over your camera on your computer or someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to spy on you. Things like that are already present dangers.There are the chess-playing computers which don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work like the human mind but they can still beat a chess player, so it may be that the mind problem will not be solved in same way that biology did it with humans. It may be that other sorts of programming devices will work in a different way, and have different powers than we have.Everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always worried that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll construct something superior to us that acquires its own motives. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the ways we are sort of safe now: We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come up with a way to give a computer motives that are somehow its self-interest. But some technologists are working on computers that can spontaneously put together programs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to say how much success\u00c2\u00a0that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to have, but it might be more successful than we anticipate.Should we worry about creating an artificial intelligence that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more powerful than we are?It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not out of the bounds of possibility that we would create something that could overpower us, but I think at this point the route to get there is pretty obscure. We barely can get computers to do valuable things now.However, if you go into a big factory and you see a lot of robots moving around, it can be fearsome. You can think, what if they went into business for themselves?And the Pentagon is working on weapons systems that have an automated feature. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an aircraft that comes within range of a battleship, some of these systems are prepared to take action themselves. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always important to have a human being in the loop who can exercise prudent judgments.What \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Trek\u00e2\u0080\u009d technology would you most like to see become reality in your lifetime?I need an android.

{"Headline": "Paying $15 Billion for Twitter Will Be Hard for Anyone to Justify", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTwitter\u2019s openness to being sold has set off a tweetstorm with a direct message: It will be hard for a new owner to make buying the $15 billion social network stack up.All the excitement has shaken up investors. Twitter shares soared as much as 35 percent in the days after a Sept. 23 report on CNBC that said the company was moving closer to a sale. They tumbled 20 percent on Thursday after the news reports that Google and others had lost interest.In the meantime, the stock of Salesforce.com has fallen more than 5 percent in a day on two occasions after being linked to the auction \u2014 and rebounded again after remarks by its chief executive, Marc Benioff, suggested that he might not be that eager. Salesforce, a $50 billion business-software maker, is short on cash, and investors probably aren\u2019t thrilled about the idea of being diluted for Twitter. More generally, though, there is no way conventional financial analysis can help any company rationalize an acquisition of the purveyor of 140-character messages.Twitter is expected to lose about $270 million next year. Add back around $100 million of interest, then cut in half the roughly $1.7 billion of research and development and marketing costs, as a buyer might do. Twitter\u2019s operating profit would then be about $700 million. According to Morningstar, Twitter\u2019s weighted average cost of capital is roughly 9 percent. To generate an equivalent return on investment, even generously assuming a zero tax rate, would mean paying no more than $7.7 billion for the company, about half its current market value.Silicon Valley often prefers its own oddball math. Twitter may look cheap next to what Microsoft is paying for LinkedIn if the chosen metric is price per monthly active user. Or a company like Alphabet, the parent of Google, might think it can wring more value from Twitter\u2019s ample data. The topic that seems to be trending, though, is that it will be hard for anyone to justify buying Twitter.Advertisement"}

In the case of Eos, this means about 375 rental apartments over 122,000 square feet of office space and 49,000 square feet of retail space.\u201cThe housing definitely makes the commercial more feasible,\u201d said Ms. Durst, the chief administrative officer.Mixed-use development has long been a dream of city planners, who see it as a way to promote density, a crucial need as cities worldwide continue to swell.Crowding is what first dispersed these uses in New York, just as it is now bringing them back together. In the early part of the 20th century, the growth of dirty garment factories around the expensive shops and fine residences of Fifth Avenue spurred the creation of the zoning code, and commercial and residential spaces became more segregated.Such developments are not unheard-of in Manhattan, though zoning quirks tend to stifle variety. One of the earliest modern examples of mixed-use development is Trump Tower.When shops began fleeing Fifth Avenue in the 1970s, the city permitted developers, who preferred to construct housing, to build bigger structures if they included commercial uses. This allowed Donald J. Trump to create a five-story atrium that is home to Gucci\u2019s flagship store, as well as many campaign rallies for Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president. Above the atrium are 26 floors of offices and 39 floors of apartments.More recent examples include the 72-story CitySpire, built in 1987 on West 56th Street, where the first 23 floors are dedicated to offices; and the Bloomberg Building on Lexington Avenue, which houses the headquarters of the financial news service.There may, however, be a disconnect between downstairs businesses and billionaire tenants. \u201cDo you really think people like Steven A. Cohen are shopping at the Home Depot,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti said, referring to the hedge fund manager whose penthouse at the Bloomberg tower was once on the market for $115 million.The Dursts did not always plan to create a mixed-use building.In 2010, the Durst Organization, in partnership with Fetner Properties, bought the debt then foreclosed on the 855 Avenue of the Americas property, then owned by the Brooklyn developer Joseph Chetrit. For two years, the developers considered building a hotel, but eventually turned to Seymour Durst\u2019s office space idea. Fetner is no longer involved in the project.\u201cWhen we first started this project, people thought we were crazy to include office space,\u201d Ms. Durst said.Last year, Nike agreed to rent all of the 122,000 square feet of office space on the second through sixth floors.Residents and workers have separate lobbies, elevator cores and terraces. Both sets of tenants do share at least one thing: the basement gym. There, Nike is working with the Dursts to build a basketball court and outfit gym equipment so professional athletes can test new gear in the same spaces frequented by weekend warriors and part-time yogis.\u201cYou need treadmills that go a lot faster,\u201d said Julia Limongello, the project manager for Eos, as she stood in the unfinished gym over the summer. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a lot more 50-pound dumbbells.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It doesn\u2019t imagine interstellar civilizations or postapocalyptic scenarios. Instead, it depicts variations on a near future transformed by information technology \u2014 our world, just a little worse.In one episode from an earlier season, characters carry an implant that records their every experience \u2014 a kind of cranial Google Glass that ends up torturing a man who learns his wife has cheated on him. Another imagines a society in which citizens can block people who displease them, rendering them as mute blobs of static \u2014 a whole-body version of Facebook unfriending.In still another, a foul-mouthed cartoon TV star runs a political campaign that begins as a lark and spirals out of control \u2014 abetted by a jaded public and cynical media \u2014 into vicious demagogy. (No further comment.)Pace yourself, though: This is very much the same disorienting, relentless series, touching on techno-cultural themes \u2014 hacking, social-media mobs, drones, the narcotic allure of nostalgia \u2014 in stories that are both dreamily speculative and of-the-moment.As before, there\u2019s no theme music, no narrator to escort you into its clean dystopias. (Each episode imagines a different alternative reality, but they share a minimalist high-design aesthetic \u2014 what your nightmares would look like if they were art-directed by Apple\u2019s Jonathan Ive.) \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d buzzes onto your screen like a malware attack, dropping you in media res and leaving you, blinking, to figure out the rules. You don\u2019t watch an episode so much as get abducted into it.But the bigger canvas and larger episode order give Mr. Brooker more room to play with genre and tone. The feature-length crime procedural episode \u201cHated in the Nation,\u201d in which a London detective (Kelly Macdonald, \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d) investigates a deadly online-outrage campaign, uncomfortably compares crowd-sourced justice with state surveillance. (\u201cHated\u201d is the season finale, though you can watch the self-contained episodes in any order.)\u201cNosedive\u201d \u2014 by Rashida Jones and Michael Schur from a story by Mr. Brooker \u2014 is a tart satire set in a society where social-media ratings hold totalitarian sway. It stars Bryce Dallas Howard, whose neurotic monitoring of her personal ranking will ring familiar to anyone who can\u2019t stop checking their Instagram feed for hearts. \u201cPlaytest,\u201d about an immersive augmented-reality game, feels like a digital-culture version of an \u201cX-Files\u201d horror lark.The best of the new batch, \u201cSan Junipero,\u201d is also the biggest departure. First, because it deposits its lead characters, played by Mackenzie Davis and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, in the past, 1987 to be precise. (I\u2019ll say no more, except that, per usual, the story takes more than one unexpected turn.) Second, because it\u2019s bittersweet and moving \u2014 even hopeful \u2014 rather than horrific.When the season goes dark, however, it goes very dark, as in \u201cMen Against Fire,\u201d a Rod Serling-esque parable about war and dehumanization, and \u201cShut Up and Dance,\u201d about a man who falls prey to online blackmail.That latter, while suitably ghastly, touches on themes of cruelty and vigilantism that earlier episodes, like \u201cWhite Bear,\u201d have treated better. More episodes, it seems, means a little more chaff. Typical of the Netflix large-portions ethos, a few new episodes are too long, and feel diluted compared with the lapidary early seasons.Still, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d hasn\u2019t lost its currency. Its title refers to the glass screens of computers, tablets and phones, but the machines are not the danger here: it\u2019s the anonymous, antiseptic monstrousness they can empower. The brilliance of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is that it\u2019s not about how technology imperils our humanity. It\u2019s about the all-too-human faces reflected in our own black mirrors, staring back at us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Companies That Avoid Taxes", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byThe most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes.Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax.Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It\u2019s called cash taxes paid \u2014 the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes.I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country\u2019s 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. If Hillary Clinton wins, it may well be.A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes.Remember: That\u2019s not just federal taxes. It\u2019s federal, state, local and foreign taxes.How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices.Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent.\u201cThe tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. \u201cAll these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.\u201dThere is another victim, too \u2014 one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can\u2019t take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren\u2019t as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven\u2019t persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can\u2019t easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon\u2019s rate.This system is cumbersome \u2014 causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance \u2014 and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors\u2019 money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they\u2019re just looking out for the rest of us.Don\u2019t be fooled.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Peek at the Secret English Farm Where Amazon Tests Its Drones", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byWORSTED LODGE, England \u2014 After hours of searching, I pulled onto a dirt track here in the rolling hills of Cambridgeshire and spotted a small dot whirring across the blue sky, gently swaying in the breeze as it steadily flew about 200 feet above the ground.Jackpot: It was an Amazon drone.Barely visible to the naked eye, the unmarked aircraft, about the size of a large model plane, floated across a field about 1,000 yards in the distance, the lights on its four-pronged sensors flashing brightly against the afternoon sun.In retrospect, signs of Amazon\u2019s secret tests were hidden in plain sight.Amazon is not alone, however, as other companies conduct drone trials around the world.In Britain, Amazon is working with local authorities to test several aspects of drone technology like piloting the machines beyond the line of sight of operators, a practice still outlawed in the United States.A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the English test site.With competitors aplenty, it is not surprising that Amazon wants to hide efforts from prying eyes. In Fulbourn, the nearest village to the test site, where thatch-roofed houses and a centuries-old church stand guard over the quiet main street, few people even knew that the American technology giant had moved in down the road.\u201cDrones? Here?\u201d said Linda McCarthy, who was taking her two Labrador retrievers for their morning walk as I trudged by on a public footpath with a map of the area and a pair of decades-old binoculars. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything about that.\u201dOver coffee and surrounded by wildlife maps of the area, Ms. Napier, 78, complained that Amazon had not consulted many local residents about its tests. She questioned what right the company had to fly across the British countryside, possibly without the permission of landowners, even though such authorization may not be required.Ms. Napier refuses to use Amazon\u2019s services, preferring to visit her local bookshop or smaller online British rivals.Her stance against the e-commerce giant has not gone unnoticed. A company employee called last week, Ms. Napier said, trying to persuade her that the local drone trials were safe and did not pose a risk to wildlife.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.She remains skeptical.\u201cThey are testing those drones here because they can\u2019t do it in America,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever the Americans don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t want it, either.\u201dNothing looked out of the ordinary. Commuters arrived at a rural office park and dog walkers basked in the late-summer sun. And as I walked miles (I ended up covering the distance of a half-marathon) along a Roman road built roughly 2,000 years ago \u2014 now a grassy public footpath \u2014 I was no closer to finding the elusive machines.My ears pricked up to every noise that broke the rural tranquillity, only to be disappointed when the buzzing turned out to be a tractor, car or just a swarm of bees flying in the midday sun. Returning to my car after exhausting almost all the public footpaths, I had a sinking suspicion I was on a wild-goose chase.Only one route remained.Less than 300 yards down the grassy track on the edge of a farm, a security guard with a walkie-talkie popped up from behind a hedgerow and pointed to a sign declaring: \u201cPrivate property. No trespassing.\u201dWhen he repeatedly told me this was indeed private property and that he had called the farmer to evict me, I knew I was onto something. As I circled the property with Andrew Testa, a photographer for The New York Times, my suspicions only grew.At the entrance to the farm \u2014 despite Amazon\u2019s presence, farm work was still underway \u2014 a security guard in a fluorescent vest was checking the identifications of people arriving at the site. In the distance, hay bales were piled at least 20 feet high (presumably to test the drones\u2019 ability to navigate between buildings). A large, metallic blue platform in a far-off field provided a panoramic view of the surrounding farmland.Then we spotted it.Actually spying the drone \u2014 best seen through my colleague\u2019s long camera lens \u2014 was an anticlimax. Instead of performing a series of aerial acrobatics, the device merely bobbed along for about 20 minutes, slowly working its way from one side of the field to the other with barely a waver or shudder.The stakes for Amazon\u2019s drone test are unquestionably high. The next day, a police officer questioned my colleague as he again photographed the area, though the officer denied that Amazon had tipped him off.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "One Last Growl for F.C.C.\u2019s Sharp-Toothed Watchdog", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byBut after days on the job, Mr. Wheeler quashed the idea that he would look favorably on his past employers. In a meeting at the F.C.C. with the heads of telecommunications, cable and technology lobbying groups, he held up a newspaper article quoting industry executives publicly calling for weaker oversight from the regulatory agency.\u201cThis is a rough way to begin a relationship,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said, according to one lobbyist at the gathering, which was confirmed by the F.C.C. It turned out that the chairman had big regulations in mind for those industries instead.Yet some say that even if Mr. Wheeler does not directly review the deal, his regulations have created new restrictions for AT&T and other broadband companies at a time when they are trying to find new growth beyond their internet businesses.Now nearly all of these moves have created more challenges for cable and telecom companies such as AT&T. Many of those companies say Mr. Wheeler\u2019s regulations have favored tech companies like Netflix and Google over them.At AT&T, James W. Cicconi, the recently retired head of lobbying, once called Mr. Wheeler an \u201cinspired\u201d choice. But in an interview last month on C-Span, Mr. Cicconi said AT&T was investing more in Mexico right now because \u201cit is, frankly, a better regulatory environment\u201d than in the United States.Even some tech companies that have benefited from the new regulations said Mr. Wheeler had injected the government too deeply into the free market.The F.C.C. has \u201coverreached,\u201d Barry Diller, chairman of the internet holding company IAC/InterActiveCorp, said at a conference this month. Mr. Diller supported the net neutrality rules passed last year but said that Mr. Wheeler had been \u201canti-cable\u201d and that reclassification of broadband was a \u201ccrazy overreach.\u201dMr. Wheeler, 70, said consumers needed greater government protection as the nation makes a transition to smartphones and streaming services from landline phones and television. His job, he has said, is to encourage nascent technologies and protect them from powerful incumbents that may want to block their success.\u201cInstitutions such as the F.C.C. are the point where the diverse interests of consumers and business converge in an effort to decide how society will deal with those changes,\u201d he said in a statement.Mr. Wheeler declined to comment on AT&T\u2019s proposed purchase of Time Warner. AT&T declined to comment on the F.C.C., and Time Warner didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Aides and friends said Mr. Wheeler\u2019s actions in tightening the regulatory landscape around cable and telecom firms were not surprising. He has always fought incumbent communications providers, they said: first against broadcasters as the head of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association from 1979 to 1984; and then against telephone companies as the head of CTIA-The Wireless Association from 1992 to 2004.By the time he was a venture capitalist in the mid-2000s, cable and wireless were the powerful incumbents, and he saw their grip on access to the internet as a threat to the web.At the F.C.C., Mr. Wheeler became even more strong-handed. He was publicly criticized by the late-night television host John Oliver, and protesters sat in the driveway at his home, after he released weaker early versions of net neutrality rules. The F.C.C. was flooded with millions of comments protesting the rules.President Obama, who in late 2014 posted a video message in favor of treating broadband more like a utility, was crucial to the change. Mr. Obama weighed in again early this year to support rules on set-top boxes that would require cable and satellite companies to share programming with third-party device makers and free consumers from cable box rentals.Mr. Wheeler\u2019s friendship with the president began when Mr. Obama was a junior senator in 2006 and called him to learn more about tech and telecom issues. Mr. Wheeler and his wife moved temporarily to Iowa in 2007 to campaign for Mr. Obama, and the couple became fund-raisers, collecting $700,000 for the candidate. The relationship led Mr. Wheeler into government.Now some lawmakers say Mr. Obama\u2019s comments on F.C.C. issues are examples of coordination between the White House and an independent agency. Republican leaders in Congress have called for investigations, threatened to take away F.C.C. funding and urged laws to limit the agency\u2019s abilities.\u201cFor the president to tout the achievements of the F.C.C. is a new dynamic in politics,\u201d said Richard Bennett, the head of the policy website High Tech Forum.The F.C.C. said that the White House did not drive the decision to pursue broadband reclassification or set-top box reforms and that Mr. Obama\u2019s support in both cases came months after the agency had agreed to draft rules.\u201cChairman Wheeler welcomed the president\u2019s point of view, as he welcomed the nearly four million Americans who made their views known during the proceeding\u201d for broadband reclassification, the F.C.C. said in a statement.The most effusive supporters of Mr. Wheeler are now the most bitter.Michael Powell, president of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, who at one point called Mr. Wheeler an \u201cexceptional\u201d choice as F.C.C. chairman, said in a speech in May that the cable and telecom industry had faced a \u201crelentless regulatory assault.\u201d Mr. Powell, whose group was recently renamed N.C.T.A.-The Internet & Television Association, declined to comment further.Yet while Mr. Wheeler has lost early supporters, he has won some former critics.\u201cThis is a guy I fought in the 1980s and 1990s who was Mr. Deregulator,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group instrumental in child online privacy rules. \u201cTalk about a conversion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Has an Old Media Problem. Here\u2019s a Solution.", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Twitter is a communications marvel, with 317 million active users who instantaneously convey a collective reaction to news.But a business based primarily on advertising needs advertisers. Twitter has not figured out how to attract enough of them to eke out regular quarterly profits. A few potential buyers, including the Walt Disney Company and Salesforce.com, have kicked the tires but decided not to buy the company.I have a solution: Larry Page, a founder of Google, should buy Twitter. Pull out his own wallet and buy it. Personally.It doesn\u2019t literally have to be Larry Page; it could be any civic-minded billionaire who sees Twitter for what it is: a primary source for news and information, not the next Google or Facebook.When Jeff Bezos purchased The Washington Post, it wasn\u2019t because the newspaper was a compelling business opportunity. It was, and remains, a hallowed institution of journalism.The country\u2019s pre-eminent newspapers, including this one, have long been controlled by families who have understood that the press is not just an ordinary industry, but a civic calling. Twitter is not yet treated as hallowed, but it has the makings of an institution that could be.Twitter puts no intermediary between speaker and listener. When public figures do the actual composing \u2014 and, oh, what a difference between Donald J. Trump\u2019s own tweet eruptions and those prepared by his staff \u2014 we get not just information but also a glimpse of the candidate\u2019s unguarded self that we don\u2019t get in other media outlets. For that alone, we should thank the heavens for Twitter.This election has also highlighted Twitter\u2019s capacity to augment coverage of civic events like the three presidential debates as they are happening. Instead of waiting for the predictable reactions of network anchors, guests and pundits, we can use Twitter to see reactions, smart and snarky alike, from hundreds of personally chosen observers while the debate is still on.Put another away, if journalism is the first draft of history, Twitter is the first draft of journalism.The nation\u2019s founders recognized the importance of speedy dissemination of news when they provided for low postal rates for newspaper subscribers and allowed newspaper printers to mail one another newspapers without charge. The content of many newspapers consisted mostly of reprints of articles obtained from these exchanges. In the same way, links in tweets serve as an indispensable guide to the best of journalism that originates outside of Twitter.So who better to rescue Twitter than Mr. Page, a founder of the company dedicated to organizing the world\u2019s information? Twitter takes the first cut of doing that organizing, in real time.Mr. Page also commands an empire built on algorithms. And Twitter has a pressing need for better algorithms to keep the platform free of the sludge discharged by racists, anti-Semites and other trolls.The Anti-Defamation League, in a recent study, counted 2.6 million tweets with anti-Semitic language in a year, but despite Twitter\u2019s disavowal of \u201chateful conduct,\u201d the league found, only 21 percent of the anti-Semitic accounts were suspended. Twitter relies on humans, not software, for enforcement, and they are overwhelmed.This computer-science problem \u2014 filtering out trolls \u2014 remains as difficult as any of the moonshots being tackled in Alphabet\u2019s Google X division. If Mr. Page developed a way to help Twitter keep the hate speech out, that technology would not only win back the advertisers who are fleeing because of trolls, but also, if shared, enable newspapers to reopen their comments\u2019 sections at their own websites, promoting the airing of differing views in public space. What service to the public could surpass that?While I\u2019m offering Mr. Page unsolicited advice about what he should do with his money, I\u2019ll also note that Twitter\u2019s current market capitalization, of around $12 billion, is a triumph of hope over reality. If Twitter\u2019s revenue and user growth fail to surge, the asking price will fall. Look at Yahoo: Eight years ago, the company spurned an acquisition offer from Microsoft for more than $45 billion. This year, it accepted an offer from Verizon for about a tenth of that.In 2011, Mr. Page had an exploratory conversation with one of Twitter\u2019s founders, Jack Dorsey, about Google\u2019s acquiring the company, but Mr. Page\u2019s interest then was in using tweets in search results. Google subsequently struck a deal to gain access to tweets that allows it to enjoy the milk without buying the cow.As Twitter\u2019s prospective suitors have one by one turned away, Twitter\u2019s board surely has come to the realization, at last, that the company has less to do with the sexy, endlessly expanding world of \u201csocial media\u201d \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat \u2014 than with the seemingly duller world of old-school newspapers, limited circulation and less-than-stratospheric profit margins.Mr. Page does not have a Twitter account and is a famously reticent chief executive. But a stray remark he once made suggests he is well suited temperamentally to be Twitter\u2019s white knight. Mr. Page told a friend that our laws would be much improved if their length, in characters or words, was capped to keep them brief. This would ensure that lawmakers would actually read the drafts in their entirety before voting on them.William Randolph Hearst built a newspaper empire on sensationalism when that\u2019s what the audience demanded. Today, consumers are, above all else, impatient, preferring a news snack rather than a feast. Mr. Page, a connoisseur of brevity, would seem to be the perfect billionaire rescuer for Twitter, the highest-circulation short-form \u201cnewspaper\u201d on earth.Randall Stross, a professor of business at San Jose State University, is working on a book about Stanford University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fragrance Debut? First, It\u2019s Lights, Camera, Action", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byFashion perfumes originated in Belle \u00c9poque Paris, and for generations, it was their intoxicating scent that proved to be their most effective selling tool. A cloud of tuberose hanging in the air, for example, might prompt a woman to head out in search of Robert Piguet\u2019s Fracas.From 1960 \u2014 when Marilyn Monroe revealed to a journalist that \u201call she wore to bed was Chanel No. 5\u201d \u2014 celebrity endorsements of a fragrance began to influence consumers powerfully, and continue to do so today. But for a fashion perfume to be a true success story, its introduction must be accompanied by a slick film debuting on YouTube.Examples abound, from \u201cMy Mutant Brain,\u201d a musical comedy that Spike Jonze directed to promote the August 2016 debut of Kenzo World, to \u201cThe One That I Want,\u201d a 2014 romantic drama by Baz Luhrmann for Chanel No. 5. Such productions may be just three minutes long, but Hollywood talent is involved, with an average yearlong shooting schedule on par with a major motion picture, and budgets generally match those of independent features.Brands are more than willing to invest the time and money. \u201cPerfume videos launched online definitely lead to online sales,\u201d said Alexandre Choueiri, the president of international designer collections at L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA. One of the brands he oversees, YSL Black Opium, had a surge in sales after a short film by Harmony Korine went live on YSLBeauty.com and Sephora.com in February 2015. \u201cThe 30 milliliter was the No. 1 seller at Sephora in the first week of the launch,\u201d he said.Roja Dove, a fragrance specialist, historian and perfumer, noted that such films are \u201ca really great method of communication for a brand, as it begins like a seed but has the potential to spread like wildfire.\u201d\u201cThe internet has beyond a doubt transformed perfumery \u2014 as it has everything else,\u201d he added.While filmmaking for the internet is a new endeavor for the perfume industry, fragrance films have been made for decades. In 1979, Jacques Helleu, Chanel\u2019s artistic director, invented the medium by enlisting an up-and-coming Ridley Scott to direct \u201cThe Swimming Pool,\u201d a television commercial for Chanel No. 5.\u201cThis was before Mr. Scott reached world fame with \u2018Blade Runner,\u2019 proving how much Helleu had an unmistakable flair for emerging talents,\u201d said Thomas du Pr\u00e9 de Saint Maur, head of global creative resources for Chanel Fragrance and Beauty.Chanel later replaced Mr. Scott with the art director Jean-Paul Goude, whose flamboyant, big-budget perfume ads went against the grain of traditional romantic advertising and became a pop culture phenomena. In 1986, Giorgio Armani enlisted Martin Scorsese to direct a short, arty love story gone awry to promote his citrusy Armani Pour Homme, and Calvin Klein and Yves Saint Laurent would later work with David Lynch. Yet the auteur advertising, which dominated consumer brands and intrigued the most inventive fashion names, remained an uncommon approach for fragrance brands.Today, the insatiable demand for content from consumers has prompted brands to look beyond the traditional realm of fashion photographers to Hollywood, as well as to the independent film world, for directors admired by their target market: millennial customers.Mr. Choueiri also attributes the surge in production to big data, the computer-assisted analysis of consumer behavior that helps companies refine their offerings to specific audiences. \u201cLaunching the traditional 30- to 45-second TV spot is still very important for big brands,\u201d Mr. Choueiri said. \u201cBut the market now in Europe and the U.S. is asking for more personalized stories.\u201d So brands will often release several variations of their films to entice different customers.And not all films have to be big-budget productions to be successful. Short, inexpensive films and moving images made by brands from Comme des Gar\u00e7ons to Maison Margiela also have proved appealing.For example, three London-based niche perfumers, Bertrand Duchaufour, Geza Schoen and Mark Buxton, have created a narrative-driven brand called Project Renegades. Each of their perfumes is represented by an avatar of its creator, and the brand\u2019s website will be the forum for a digital series involving them.\u201cIt is not just about putting an ad on TV \u2014 like that customary pre-Christmas television slot,\u201d Anna-Marie Solowij, a journalist, consultant and co-founder of the Beauty Mart retailing website, said. Social media is the platform for this new brand of visual communication. The creativity has to go live online and on YouTube when it launches.\u201dHere\u2019s a look at some of the most noteworthy fragrance films:Kenzo World\u201cMy Mutant Brain,\u201d Mr. Jonze\u2019s short film promoting Kenzo World, has been described as the story of a woman who \u201cbreaks free of social constructs through a movement study.\u201dDebuting in late August \u2014 shortly before the start of New York Fashion Week and the Toronto International Film Festival \u2014 it became one of the most talked about perfume campaigns in recent memory. Its success was partly due to its star, Margaret Qualley, and her unexpected burst of dance (ballet, yoga poses and even break dancing) through the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles.Comme des Gar\u00e7ons What is a typical Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Parfums project? Pharrell Williams collaborated with the house in 2014, pumping sales of the woody unisex scent Girl by introducing it as he released a studio album with the same title.And Katerina Jebb, the photographer and filmmaker who rose to prominence in the 1990s working for avant-garde magazines like The Face, is a longtime collaborator. Her most recent short feature for Comme des Gar\u00e7ons \u2014 for the fruity floral eau de parfum Dot \u2014 is a wacky mash-up of her video archive, with a promotional spin. Titled \u201cWe Can Find Beautiful Things Without Consciousness,\u201d the one-minute-and-25 second vignette debuted on Purple\u2019s television website in February, with offbeat footage ranging from close-ups of a routine dental checkup to moody moving images of Dot\u2019s polka-dot patterned bottle.YSL Black OpiumFiguring out how to promote Black Opium, a \u201cyouthful interpretation\u201d of the legendary 1977 Yves Saint Laurent fragrance Opium, was a challenge, Mr. Choueiri of L\u2019Or\u00e9al said. \u201cCustomers do not typically react very well to products that are named after a drug, or seem dark, controversial or dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we had to find a way to introduce the perfume to the market in a creative way.\u201dPrada Candy L\u2019EauFor Candy L\u2019Eau, a lighter take on the original musky caramel scent of Candy, a short film series charted the antics of Candy, a self-involved Parisian played by L\u00e9a Seydoux, in a riff on Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s 1962 film \u201cJules et Jim.\u201d Prada used not one but two hip Hollywood directors: Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola.\u201cName directors can push a perfume film way beyond the beauty industry and trigger a level of curiosity which prompts someone, who is not particularly interested in beauty, or fragrance, to want to know more about the scent,\u201d Emily Dougherty, the beauty director at American Elle, said. \u201cSo someone who would never Google the perfume film, might Google it and then buy it if they are interested in the director.\u201dSusan Irvine, a fragrance writer and novelist, credits the Prada Candy series for initiating the spirit of nonconformist transgression that has influenced campaigns like Kenzo World. \u201cL\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s Candy is only interested in stuffing her face with popcorn in one film and cream cakes in another, even though she is being courted by two men throughout the series,\u201d Ms. Irvine said. \u201cFragrance has always been a safe and very easy way for a women to get a shot of this style of transgressive behavior. It is about buying into the idea of danger and glamour that you can safely partake in but without having to do any of the bad stuff. That is very seductive.\u201dGivenchy Very Irr\u00e9sistible Electric RoseThe 2012 film for Very Irr\u00e9sistible Electric Rose is the fragrance industry\u2019s closest thing to a music video \u2014 the bottle doesn\u2019t even make an appearance. \u201cJust how a music video animates a song, a fragrance video can bring the vibe of a scent to life and tell its story,\u201d Ms. Dougherty said.The three-minute short marked the singing debut of Liv Tyler, the daughter of Steven Tyler, Aerosmith\u2019s lead singer, who covered the INXS hit \u201cI Need You Tonight\u201d in this carefully staged black-and-white production by the Swedish filmmaker Johan Renck. Amanda Seyfried has since replaced Ms. Tyler as the face of the perfume, and while its ads are now more conventionally romantic, each is accompanied by downloadable soundtracks.Dior J\u2019AdoreOct. 12 is the introduction date for the fifth in a series of lavish ads in the \u201cJ\u2019Adore saga,\u201d as Christian Dior calls its celebration of a modern classic. It also will be the third in the gilt-hued series shot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino.Though details about the new film remain under wraps, Charlize Theron is slated to return. The Oscar-winning actress has portrayed the \u201cWalking Woman\u201d for J\u2019Adore, performing a leggy runway-style strut in every film, since her 2004 appointment as the fragrance\u2019s celebrity representative. John Galliano, Dior\u2019s former creative director, hired Ms. Theron, and told WWD that she ended up directing the early films. \u201cShe knows what she\u2019s doing,\u201d he said.Calvin Klein ObsessionThe photographer Mario Sorrenti was a 21-year-old member of a new generation of emerging photographers with only three assignments to his name in 1991, when the art director Fabien Baron appointed him to shoot a TV commercial for Calvin Klein\u2019s Obsession. The perfume was already iconic thanks to a dramatic narrative-driven 1986 commercial directed by Richard Avedon and powered by a multimillion-dollar budget that helped sell more than $100 million worth of Obsession.Chanel \u00c9go\u00efsteSales of \u00c9go\u00efste \u2014 the sandalwood-infused third scent for men from Chanel, introduced in 1990 \u2014 ultimately proved disappointing. But the commercial that Mr. Goude directed is widely considered the finest fragrance ad ever made. Mr. Helleu at Chanel put it in motion after admiring Mr. Goude\u2019s staging of a lavish procession through Paris for the bicentenary of the French Revolution.The \u00c9go\u00efste spot featured 47 Chanel-clad models stepping onto the balconies of a white stucco building and shouting, \u201c\u00c9go\u00efste!\u201d (The facade, erected in Rio de Janeiro for the shoot, evoked the InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel, that landmark of the French Riviera. Though surreal in its imagery, Mr. Goude said reality prompted the story line. \u201cI noticed every time someone mentioned the word \u2018egoist,\u2019 women immediately said, \u2018It\u2019s so true. Men are all the same!\u2019 So that\u2019s why you have all these wounded woman on the balcony,\u201d he told Vogue. \u201cBecause women all over the world agree that men are a bunch of bastards.\u201dAt the time, \u00c9go\u00efste\u2019s anti-romantic theme was a novel idea and became a potent alternative to the fairy tale story lines customarily used to sell fragrances. Mr. Goude has gone on to direct other Chanel fragrance ads \u2014 he also did the introductory commercial for Prada Candy and has been a consultant for Kenzo \u2014 but his blockbuster approach to perfume films remains the touchstone for those made by Chanel since then, from the likes of Mr. Luhrmann, Mr. Scorsese and Luc Besson.An earlier version of this article misstated a fragrance writer\u2019s name.

Among the dead was a 3-year-old. Hours later, a young man was arrested in connection with the killings.No official reports indicated any possible motive, and there was no indication what weapon Mr. Yang is accused of using, though in China it is far more common to commit homicide with a knife than with a gun.It was also not clear when the killings took place. Xinhua reported that the police received calls around 7:50 a.m. on Thursday. But The Beijing News referred to a document listing the names of the dead from the \u201c9/28 incident,\u201d suggesting they might have occurred the day before.The list of the victims reported by The Beijing News included three people surnamed Yang who all also had the character \u201cqing,\u201d which means clean or pure, in their names, suggesting that they might have been related. In all, 10 of the victims were surnamed Yang.Then, people learned that the suspect in the killing was from the area, socially awkward and liked to gamble, Mr. He said, adding that most of the dead were relatives of Mr. Yang.Another resident, a woman surnamed Li, said that the tiny hamlet within Yema where the killings took place, called Baifengwan, was particularly remote, and that many people had never heard of it.At midday on Friday, the home page of the official news portal in Kunming focused on a story about the local real estate market. The train crash in Hoboken, N.J., received extensive coverage nationwide, as did the override of President Obama\u2019s veto of the Sept. 11 victims\u2019 bill, which was a \u201chot topic\u201d on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like social media platform. The Yema killings were not.\u201cNineteen people died, and CCTV doesn\u2019t have a report on it,\u201d wrote one Weibo user called \u201cStarry Sky in a Sunny Room,\u201d referring to the state television network. \u201cSpeechless. Chinese news is villainous.\u201dDavid Bandurski, a China researcher at the China Media Project of the University of Hong Kong, said that even with the country\u2019s restrictions on the news media, the lack of information about the killings in Yema was unusual.Many news organizations in China depend on commercial success for their viability, so, as in the United States, a sensational story is catnip for enterprising reporters, he said.There are many possible explanations for the lack of news about the Yema killings, he said.

{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s 4-Year Odyssey With the 6-Second Video App Vine", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byEarly use skyrocketed, and it looked like Mr. Dorsey\u2019s $30 million dollar bet on the tiny start-up was going to pay off.The rapid ascent \u2014 and even steeper decline \u2014 of Vine is a reminder of a Silicon Valley axiom: Being first to a trend rarely means you will win. And when a little company with a good idea gets acquired, more often than not, what made the little guys worth buying gets lost in the shuffle.\u201cI think like any big company swooping in, the acquisition was a kind of blessing and a curse,\u201d said Ry Doon, one of Vine\u2019s earliest stars. \u201cTwitter made Vine huge, then Twitter put Vine on the back burner \u2014 and now, Twitter is shutting it down.\u201dIn 2012, video on smartphones was a fairly new idea, and a scary one for people worried about burning through the data limits on their cellphone plans. Vine avoided the problem by setting a six-second limit \u2014 long enough to create little narratives more interesting than a single photo but short enough to not devour data.Mr. Dorsey, who is now Twitter\u2019s chief executive, spotted an opportunity in Vine after he was introduced to it by an acquaintance in the venture capital community. Eight months earlier, archrival Facebook had outmaneuvered Twitter by acquiring the up-and-coming photo-sharing app Instagram. Vine could offer a way to leap past Instagram\u2019s static photos.The Vine stars, people who took to the app\u2019s six-second looping constraints and used them in unique ways, became internet staples.But in June 2013, Instagram introduced video to its app, allowing users to record up to 15 seconds. It was an instant threat \u2014 Instagram\u2019s network was 10 times the size of Vine\u2019s.Nine former employees and executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to publicly discuss the company, said the impact of Instagram video was felt right away.Users who already posted photos on Instagram found it easier to stay in that app to post videos, too, instead of using Vine. And Instagram users already had their social connections with other users. If they went to Vine, they\u2019d have to start all over again.The leadership at Vine tried to rally the troops, according to the former employees. Driven by the prospect of fighting a copycat competitor, Vine\u2019s employees created more tools like importing video and better editing features. More features, the idea went, could mean the creation of more popular Vines, which could in turn bring in more users.Other leaders came and left. Colin Kroll, a co-founder and former chief technical officer, was temporarily in charge before Jason Toff, a former Google employee, took over as general manager. Mr. Toff left roughly a year later to go back to Google to work on virtual reality projects.And, as often happens at start-ups, Vine employees balked when they were asked to move to Twitter\u2019s office in New York. Yet many did it anyway.Leadership turnover, not surprisingly, slowed product development, four employees said, and Vine quickly fell behind the fresher features of its competitors, like some of Instagram\u2019s GIF-like animated photos and trademark filters.Vine stars also left for more lucrative opportunities at Instagram, which began paying social media celebrities to post to its platform, and for other competitors like Snapchat. Vine and Twitter, which never paid users and did not have Facebook\u2019s deep reservoir of cash, could not compete.While Niche worked across all platforms like Instagram and YouTube, it was also a chance to make Vine into a moneymaking business for the first time.Unfortunately for Vine, the attrition in talent meant that there were fewer Vine stars who needed to cut deals, and most of Niche\u2019s talent brokering went to other platforms, like Instagram. While Niche still operates inside of Twitter, it could do little to help Vine.In the end, Vine proved too expensive to keep running. The app was costing about $10 million a month for infrastructure and employees, according to two former employees. When Twitter began to take stock of its business and decide which assets to trim down, the Vine was at the top of the list.Twitter, which has attempted to find a buyer for itself in recent months, will cease support for Vine in the coming months. Previously uploaded Vine content will still be available online.After Twitter\u2019s announcement, former executives and employees were sentimental about the company\u2019s rise and fall.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zymergen Raises $130 Million in New Round of Financing", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over its three-year life, Zymergen has focused on helping genetically engineer tiny microbes, while using advanced computing to help better automate the process.Now the start-up has attracted a big round of financing to help expand its work.Zymergen said late Monday that it had raised $130 million in its latest round, led by the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. The company also added two high-profile directors: Steven Chu, the former energy secretary, and Deep Nishar, a senior executive at SoftBank.Others in the round include the returning investors Data Collective, True Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Innovation Endeavors, Obvious Ventures and Two Sigma Ventures. New investors include Iconiq Capital, Prelude Ventures and Tao Capital Partners.From the beginning, Zymergen has used robotics and machine learning to better manipulate microbes used in processes like industrial fermentation, making customers\u2019 operations more efficient. But the company\u2019s chief executive, Joshua Hoffman, says its technology will ultimately help in a more important task: producing new materials unconstrained by the limits of traditional petroleum-based manufacturing.Its main components include robotics, which helps eliminate human error, and machine learning, which is meant to help find more advanced patterns that could lead to scientific breakthroughs.\u201cThe human ability to understand and predict what\u2019s happening is really limited,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. Zymergen\u2019s approach, he said, amplifies the work of industrial scientists and frees them to work outside traditional approaches.To illustrate, he pointed to the differences between Yahoo in its early days, which relied on human curators to organize web content, and Google, which from the start drew on complicated algorithms to make searching more powerful.Mr. Hoffman described the new financing, despite its technically being a \u201cseries B\u201d round, as one equivalent to a later-stage growth round at a more mature company. Zymergen, based in Emeryville, Calif., employs just under 200 people. He declined to discuss the company\u2019s financial performance, other than to say that it was producing revenue and was on a path to profitability.Such is the promise of Zymergen that in about four months it drew support from the likes of SoftBank \u2014 better known for its telecommunications network in Japan and its control of Sprint in the United States \u2014 and Dr. Chu, who shared a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997.\u201cWe are investing in Zymergen because they are a pre-eminent bioengineering company and the market leader,\u201d Mr. Nishar of SoftBank said in a news release.Dr. Chu, who was introduced to Zymergen via a former lieutenant from the Energy Department who also knew Mr. Hoffman, said the start-up\u2019s offerings could help produce new materials beyond plastics, helping create more sustainable products.\u201cIf you can really control an organism to produce something, your palette of materials is greatly enlarged,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.And, he added jokingly, the company was \u201capplying machine learning to something other than selling you things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Doomocracy\u2019 Puts the Politics of Fear on Display in Brooklyn", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byThe artist Pedro Reyes is a biting social critic whose pieces often hold out hope \u2014 in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary \u2014 that things will get better.But when he and the New York public art organization Creative Time began discussing a piece to coincide with the homestretch of the American presidential campaign, Mr. Reyes settled on an idea that allowed little in the way of light: the professional haunted house, an essentially American creation (by way of Grand Guignol and Victorian ghostiana) for generating shock and fear.Or, as Nato Thompson, Creative Time\u2019s artistic director, puts it: \u201cWe sometimes joke that this is a choose-your-own-adventure where no matter which path you choose you always die.\u201dBut Mr. Reyes added that the house\u2019s half-dozen fright scenarios are less about the failures of political leaders and more about systems at work in the world economy \u2014 the military complex, the financial industry, the gun industry, the fast-food industry and Big Pharma, just to name some headliners \u2014 that have become so vast they seem to govern themselves, rendering political control almost ineffectual. And making satire a tall order.For example, one room of \u201cDoomocracy\u201d (through Nov. 6, groups of a dozen will be led through the rooms at timed intervals beginning at 6 p.m.) is a cozy, profoundly creepy funeral home, presided over by an organ-playing undertaker who explains that the home specializes in coffins made in the shape of the processed-food item most loved by the deceased. A child-size coffin in the shape of a pink-frosted Twinkie dominated the room on a recent visit. And during a rehearsal in September, an actor tinkled the organ keys, intoning earnestly: \u201cI\u2019d like to think that in the afterlife, kids can taste their coffins and they\u2019re happy,\u201d enjoying \u201cthe milkshake coffin, the fried chicken coffin\u201d and many other available flavors. Then he crooned: \u201cEvery kid wants a candy coffin.\u201dIn the interest of avoiding spoilers (something a visual-arts reporter rarely has to worry about), some of the scenarios in the piece are probably best undescribed.But it might give an idea of the range of topical phantasmagoria to say that one room involves cheerleaders singing about abortion. Another features a kind of Tupperware party for handguns. (\u201cI think for a lot of liberal people who have never been around guns, it\u2019s going to be a pretty tense situation,\u201d Mr. Reyes said.)There will be a classroom presided over by a racially shape-shifting computer avatar spouting corporate come-ons through a large computer screen \u2014 \u201cI Googled \u2018classroom of the future,\u2019 and that\u2019s pretty much what it looked like,\u201d Mr. Reyes said \u2014 and a fake cocktail party hosted by a rich couple who are having their own spaceship built.\u201cThey just have so much money that they\u2019re into racing space rockets,\u201d said Mr. Reyes, a compact, bespectacled man who comes off in person like a philosophy professor moonlighting as a late-night comedy host. \u201cThey asked Zaha Hadid to design their spaceship, but then she died, so of course they got Frank Gehry, who\u2019s done most of their houses.\u201dThe actors will have to repeat their parts, written by the playwright Paul Hufker \u2014 some of them highly emotional and physically demanding \u2014 40 times over the course of a night. \u201cWhen I enlisted people to be in this, I told them that it was going to be an act of political rigor,\u201d Ms. Finn said. \u201cIt really is endurance performance.\u201dKatie Hollander, Creative Time\u2019s executive director, said that the organization hadn\u2019t planned earlier in the year to present a major fall piece. But when Mr. Reyes proposed a \u201cpolitical/satirical haunted house,\u201d she said, \u201cthe idea stuck with us, and as the political climate became more and more terrifying to a certain extent, it just became more and more relevant, and we knew that the time this had to happen was now. So we jumped from the frying pan into the fire. It\u2019s not a usual thing for us to do something of this complexity in such a short period of time.\u201dEspecially against the backdrop of this election, Mr. Thompson said, the project made a kind of perverse sense in 2016, the centennial of the birth of the Dada art movement. \u201cI think that\u2019s the kind of moment we\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like a joke but the joke is really not funny at all.\u201dMr. Reyes acknowledged that the piece would probably be received far differently were it presented in suburban Ohio or rural Tennessee; he knows he is preaching mostly to a choir of liberal art lovers who oppose many of the late-capitalist demons he holds up to ridicule. \u201cBut I still very much hope I can offend at least a few people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be so intense that I think people are going to be shaken and pretty worn out after the hour they\u2019re inside.\u201dWhich might be worth something in itself. \u201cThis piece\u2019s inner logic isn\u2019t about hope, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve lost hope in art\u2019s ability to help change things,\u201d Mr. Reyes said. \u201cI still think it\u2019s crucial to keep a critical muscle that mocks the motivations of the system \u2014 to say, \u2018Why are we doing this?\u2019 and to say, \u2018This is crazy.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T and Time Warner Seek to Mollify Deal\u2019s Critics", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byAT&T\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner has no shortage of skeptics.First, there are the analysts.\u201cVertically challenged,\u201d was the headline from a research note by Craig Moffett, a play on the term \u201cvertical integration,\u201d where a company combines with its customer, rather than competitor.Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a \u201cbold step,\u201d wondering whether the companies were \u201cswinging for the fences.\u201d Nomura said the deal was \u201cpuzzling.\u201dThen, there are the investors.At midday on Monday, shares of Time Warner, the recipient of by all accounts a rich offer from AT&T, were down more than 2 percent, nearly 20 percent off the deal\u2019s price tag. AT&T\u2019s shareholders did not seem too thrilled either \u2014 its shares were off nearly 2 percent.The question for the market is whether it makes sense for a cable and wireless provider to spend all of that money to acquire the home of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros.On a conference call with analysts on Monday, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, and his Time Warner counterpart, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, sought to address some of their biggest criticisms:During the hourlong call, a form of the word \u201cinnovate\u201d was used 32 times. The two chief executives believe combining their companies will help them innovate around advertising, the shows and movies people watch and where they watch them (hint: on their cellphones).Innovation, of course is not a strategy. It is something that every top executive is focused on, with or without a deal.There is one aspect to this deal that could help the two companies foster such innovation: data. AT&T has access to 133 million mobile subscribers, as well as 25 million for video. Owning the content that its users are watching will give the company better insight on how to focus on their customers through both programming and advertising, the executives argued.One analyst asked why the combination of cable and content made sense now, despite Mr. Bewkes\u2019s decision to spin off Time Warner Cable in 2009. Mr. Bewkes responded by saying, \u201cThe world has changed,\u201d citing new competition from companies like Netflix, Google, Facebook and Amazon.Over the weekend, politicians from across the political spectrum came out against the deal. Both Democrats and Republicans argued that too much consolidation between telecommunications and media could only be bad for consumers.On the call, Mr. Bewkes argued that consumers would not feel the effect of this transaction, that the cost would be \u201cborne by advertisers and consumers get a break.\u201dWhen asked about what gave him comfort on the regulatory approval process, Mr. Stephenson joked, \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but once Time Warner closes, I\u2019ll play one on TV.\u201dHis non-lawyerly take, however, focused on the fact that the companies are proposing a vertical merger. Most of the pushback lately from the Justice Department has been on companies that were taking out competitors. Because Time Warner supplies programming for AT&T, their deal would not get that same type of scrutiny.\u201cIn fact, I\u2019m not sure I know of a situation where vertical integration has been blocked by the government in our two sectors,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Vertical integration may help the two companies on the regulatory front, but it does not get them far from a cost-savings standpoint. The companies pegged so-called synergies at $1 billion in annual run rate, within three years of the deal closing.That figure is small for a deal this size because there is little duplication by which to cut costs. The customer service representatives at AT&T cannot also anchor the news on CNN, for example.Analysts have been dubious of AT&T\u2019s ability to integrate another huge acquisition after closing on a $48.5 billion takeover of DirecTV last year. Why do another large acquisition now, they asked? Mr. Stephenson said that AT&T was ahead of schedule in achieving cost synergies from the DirecTV deal and that \u201cthe convergence of media and distribution is moving fast.\u201d\u201cWe want to be at the front of it. We don\u2019t want to be chasing it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swarovski, Maker of All Things Bejeweled, Tries On a Hoodie", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Supported byWATTENS, Austria \u2014 A group of millennial programmers swapped jokes recently in their office\u2019s well-stocked kitchen while preparing salads for a weekly barbecue. Others mingled around a new foosball table, playfully arguing over the prospective teams.Fearful of cheap Chinese competition and wary of a profitable complacency that has felled giants in the past \u2014 Eastman Kodak, destroyed by digital cameras, is often cited \u2014 the company is developing new crystals that double as solar panels or that change color when tapped with a finger. It has revamped how it sells online, invested millions in high-tech machinery and signed partnerships with smartwatch makers like Misfit.Swarovski has also hired Silicon Valley advisers and sent executives to the West Coast of the United States to meet venture capitalists and others, trying to add a little tech pizazz to a business whose roots date to the days of buggy whips.\u201cTech companies can disrupt whole industries within a couple of months,\u201d said Markus Langes-Swarovski, 42, chairman of the board of the Swarovski Group and a great-great-grandson of the founder. \u201cWe need to do that to ourselves before it happens to us.\u201dTo many, Swarovski\u2019s tech dream seems an odd strategy for a 121-year-old crystal maker better known for its (sometimes ostentatious) figurines, designer jewelry and even a $2,000 Cinderella slipper. It also raises questions about whether it is an industry suited to embracing the hoodies, start-up incubators and other trappings that have given Silicon Valley global cachet.\u201cBig legacy companies want to reinvent themselves for the digital era,\u201d said Julian Birkinshaw, a professor entrepreneurship at the London Business School. \u201cFew, if any, have been successful at it.\u201d8 PhotosWithin Swarovski, which is owned by members of the extended Swarovski family, the revamp was not a slam dunk. Family shareholders were concerned that Mr. Langes-Swarovski and his executives were merely jumping on the Silicon Valley bandwagon, forgoing the company\u2019s heritage for the chance to mingle with West Coast technorati. Some were skeptical that the company, which employs more than 31,000 people and owns retail stores from New York to New Delhi, would benefit from shifting toward sensors and start-ups rather than focusing on making shiny crystal.\u201cIt was hard to get the family on board,\u201d said Mr. Langes-Swarovski, who in 2002 at the age of 28 took over the company from his father. \u201cAnd of course, it still is.\u201dThe crystal maker, which has avidly guarded its trade secrets for over a century, rarely gives a glimpse into its inner workings. The company\u2019s manufacturing center is usually off-limits even to most Swarovski employees. One enters via a high-security revolving door that would not seem out of place in a spy movie.More industrially functional than catwalk chic, the campus was dotted with people driving forklifts, shuttling boxes of crystal and other raw materials between buildings. At one new production line, two robotic arms, painted bright yellow, spun in a midair ballet as workers checked the gauges while Kings of Leon, the rock group, played on the radio.In another building, several 3-D printers whirred away, producing spare parts and prototypes of jewelry designs. Engineers kept watch over machines that were originally built for the semiconductor industry but have since been modified to pump out minuscule crystals, some barely visible when held on a fingertip. Only a disused, shabby warehouse \u2014 one of the company\u2019s original buildings \u2014 harked to the company\u2019s past.Crystal is almost identical to glass, but it includes another ingredient \u2014 lead \u2014 that adds extra sparkle. It is notoriously difficult to shape into small fragments. Mr. Swarovski\u2019s machines set his crystal apart because of their ability to create tiny, uniform cuts, which give off more light than rivals\u2019 products.\u201cOne hundred and twenty years ago, we were the Google of the age,\u201d said Taro Nordheider, a Swarovski executive vice president who was hired five years ago from McKinsey & Company to help with the company\u2019s transformation.Over the decades, the company shifted with the times. After World War I, Swarovski branched out into precision drilling tools. After World War II, it added binoculars and telescopes. And when sales to fashion designers and other companies flagged in the 1980s, the company opened retail stores to sell jewelry and figurines directly to shoppers worldwide.Eventually, Swarovski became complacent, Mr. Nordheider said. It was unprepared in 2008 when the global financial crisis hit and the company was suddenly confronted with a wave of Chinese competitors selling high-end crystals at a fraction of the usual cost, thanks mostly to cheap labor. By 2010, Swarovski had laid off almost 2,000 workers and begun rethinking how to operate in a world where price, not pedigree, was the name of the game.In 2012, Mr. Langes-Swarovski started outlining a new strategy to the company\u2019s 79 family shareholders. At dinners, board meetings and social gatherings, he told them that despite Swarovski\u2019s decades of success, things had to change. The company, Mr. Langes-Swarovski said, needed to channel his great-great-grandfather\u2019s engineering roots to cut costs, respond faster to new ideas and, most important, embrace technology that had become part of people\u2019s everyday lives.Resistance came mostly from older family shareholders who had benefited from profits produced by the company\u2019s traditional crystal business, according to several family shareholders and executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. Yet because Mr. Langes-Swarovski\u2019s generation now dominated daily management of the company, and his father, Gernot Langes-Swarovski, remained the largest shareholder, he was able to push ahead.The revamp began with small steps. Starting in 2013, a team of engineers spent a combined 50,000 hours and almost $5 million to build a production line that made smaller batches of crystals, at a cheaper price, to compete better with Chinese rivals and to meet demand for smaller orders.Swarovski\u2019s tech development, marketing and sales teams also were given more independence to try new ideas. In 2014, one engineer \u2014 part of an 80-person research-and-development team in Wattens \u2014 stumbled onto a way to turn a Swarovski crystal into a solar cell. After some tweaks, including making the crystal round and thinner to meet jewelry standards, Swarovski signed a deal with Misfit, which sells smartwatches and other wearable gadgets, to build the world\u2019s first solar-powered fitness tracker. It went on sale in early 2015.\u201cWe created a solar cell that isn\u2019t boring,\u201d said Michael Hutter, head of the applied research group behind the technology. \u201cWe want to be the missing link between the tech and fashion industries.\u201dThe new devices are a tech-tinged extension of Swarovski\u2019s longstanding marketing strategy for the fashion world. In the past, it has worked with design houses such as Christian Dior to affix crystals to dresses and jewelry. In the company\u2019s corporate archive, Swarovski earrings worn by Marilyn Monroe in \u201cGentlemen Prefer Blondes\u201d sit side by side with an oversize necklace once worn by Beyonc\u00e9.The building, basically an all-singing, all-dancing amusement park to sell Swarovski merchandise to visitors, included avant-garde artworks and an outdoor lake with artificial clouds dotted with crystals floating above on almost invisible wires.\u201cWhen I heard about their visit, I was a bit confused,\u201d said Brian Hoffman at StartX, a Silicon Valley tech incubator linked to Stanford University, who met with Swarovski\u2019s team for about an hour. \u201cTheir industry is not one you typically associate with technology or innovation.\u201d Swarovski\u2019s executives peppered him with questions, he said, about how best to work with outside developers and to adapt to the latest online shopping habits.In part, that new endeavor competes with the likes of Etsy, where a community of fashion-conscious buyers already can find an almost limitless supply of custom jewelry. But Swarovski hopes to use its global brand, and significant financial resources, to entice high-end designers and retailers (and high-end shoppers) onto its own site.\u201cNow we think about online platforms, not just products,\u201d said Roland Harste, who runs Swarovski\u2019s e-commerce division. The online service, which began in May, currently receives fewer than a million visitors a month, a relatively small number compared with online giants like Amazon.Design houses including Oscar de la Renta already use the site, though people are still sent to third-party websites to complete transactions. Now, Swarovski takes a cut of each purchase, but it plans to move all digital sales onto its own platform soon.Another lesson from the Silicon Valley trip, which was arranged by a former senior executive at Apple who is now advising Swarovski, was to focus more on partnerships that could give the company access to new tech ideas and trends. Such collaborations were not previously part of the company\u2019s DNA.So far, few partnerships have resulted. The Fraunhofer Society, a German foundation that has turned scientific projects into business ideas, opened a three-person office here in September, but much of the refurbished factory remains empty.He decided to set up shop here, he said, partly because of his local roots \u2014 but also because the rent is so much more affordable than in the city. \u201cWhen we started out, it would have been impossible to do it from here,\u201d he said.In February, his start-up received more than $200,000 in investments from a separate Swarovski family fund. \u201cPeople now recognize that something is going on here with technology,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Troubles and Snap\u2019s Appeal: It\u2019s All About the Mojo", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorMomentum can mean everything when it comes to the fortunes of social media giants. Just look at Twitter and the company formerly known as Snapchat.In Silicon Valley, if you are not a hero, you are a loser. And this all-or-nothing narrative is driving the fates of companies beyond all reasonable expectations.For one, the reports of the Salesforce negotiations come on the heels of reports that others, including Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; the Walt Disney Company; and possibly even Microsoft had taken a look at Twitter and decided to pass. All of this reduces whatever leverage the micromessaging service, which has a market value of more than $12 billion, might have possessed before the frenzy of deal speculation began.Salesforce, meanwhile, is stuck in a situation similar to the one Microsoft found itself in when it tried to acquire Yahoo in 2008, with its bidding conducted more or less on a public stage and its own shareholders protesting.As a result, Salesforce will have to show its shareholders that any deal is a good one for the company, and this will come at the expense of Twitter. And if Salesforce subsequently walks away from the discussions, a broken deal will leave Twitter with the label of damaged goods.Any way you look at it, it\u2019s not a great place to be for Twitter.Revenue growth may be on track, increasing about 20 percent in the quarter ending June 30 over the same period of last year, but it is the user growth numbers that have put Twitter into the loser category.It\u2019s the secret sauce of internet valuations. Revenue and earnings are forgiven if you can show growth in users. Whether that makes sense, of course, is another matter.It does explain the puzzle of why Twitter struggles to sell itself and LinkedIn goes for a huge premium. In short, the story line isn\u2019t clean at Twitter, and the growth is not phenomenal. Even though by some metrics Twitter is worth more, it has failed to adequately find a way to make money from its user base. Other Twitter properties like Vine are also struggling with no or low growth.Still, the gloom around Twitter seems overblown. Twitter is an important part of the internet, and even Yahoo found a buyer willing to pay $4.8 billion despite being in slow-motion collapse. A figure twice that high for Twitter would seem to be a bargain. And remember that Facebook faced issues after its initial public offering, but was able to find solid footing in mobile.Sharp leadership \u2014 whether that is from its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, or new blood \u2014 could certainly help Twitter exploit its huge user base.But the problem is that in the eyes of the Valley, Twitter has lost its mojo.A $25 billion valuation would be about 25 times its projected 2017 revenue. In comparison, Facebook went public in 2012 at 19 times revenue, which at the time was considered a rich valuation.It\u2019s easy to be skeptical about such a rock star valuation. Snap lives and dies on the fickle under-30 crowd. At any time, the youth of the world may turn to another product. (WhatsApp appears to be increasingly popular among the tween crowd, for example.) And Snap has no pretensions of being useful or changing the world. It is simply about having fun. So Snap has quite a few risk factors beyond those of Facebook.There are, however, only a few big social media companies left. The rest have been bought up by Google, Microsoft and the like. And Snap has the growth.The question is whether Snap can sustain its messaging business and turn into another Facebook or Google, justifying that $25 billion valuation. So far, Snap has worked hard to keep its product nimble and updated, and it has retained users.The start-up might have just gotten lucky with its messaging product, but there is a clearly a belief at the moment that its co-founder and chief executive, Evan Spiegel, can be a visionary like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and push successfully into new products.Momentum can mint money in Silicon Valley, but you have to sustain it. Snap, if it manages the public offering process right and isn\u2019t too headstrong with the markets, may get the valuation it seeks.Yet the fickle gods of Silicon Valley will turn if the company can\u2019t sustain its growth story. You can debate whether maybe it might be better to question that potential at the public offering stage, but then people will point to Google and Facebook as success stories. How could you not invest in Snap?Once again we have a case in which Silicon Valley\u2019s overreliance on momentum creates an unrealistic proxy for valuation. Snap will reap billions as a result, while Twitter will struggle to salvage what it can from what was once a valuation of more than $40 billion. It is a story that will have real consequences.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

{"Headline": "Why Couldn\u2019t I Give My Child My Last Name?", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byTiesAs the mercury dipped below 30 degrees one night in my second trimester, my husband, Dave, and I ordered in Sichuan and started talking names. We wanted one that was classic, and to honor our families in some way. But we didn\u2019t want to saddle our wee one with the Old World names that started appearing just a few branches up each of our family trees. Little Moshe, Yehuda and Golda had as much chance as did a Moon Unit, Apple or North.We liked the sound of the full name, which we confirmed by yelling it across the room, pretending our future child was misbehaving at the playground. And we figured an unconventional name would be a small step toward challenging the patriarchy, which seemed both cool and important, just progressive enough for a couple whose idea of an offbeat Sunday night involves adding a dash of fish sauce to the marinade for our go-to roast chicken.A few years ago, I spent the summer reading my way through feminist thinkers \u2014 everyone from Gloria Steinem and Simone de Beauvoir to Sheryl Sandberg and Jessica Valenti \u2014 as research for an article I was writing about how I, a millennial, related to the feminist movement. I\u2019d never engaged with it because, frankly, and luckily, I\u2019d never felt disadvantaged because of my sex. I\u2019d studied what I wanted in college, held my own next to tattooed, knife-slinging men during my stint as a line cook, and worked under strong, powerful women who ran newsrooms and pushed me to succeed when I became a journalist.I said as much to one professor I phoned up for research. She told me to wait until I started a family. \u201cThen you\u2019ll experience gender disparity, then you\u2019ll become a true feminist, then you\u2019ll get it,\u201d she said.After my feminist reading binge, there was only one notable change in our household: I\u2019d run around pointing at things \u2014 a sock on the floor, an empty milk carton \u2014 and, within earshot of Dave, shriek \u201c50-50!\u201d Ms. Sandberg writes that to get a truly equal world, in the workplace and beyond, husbands need to shoulder as much of the housework (among other things) as wives, and her 50-50 has become a bit of a modern feminist catchphrase. Quantifying marital obligations is inherently problematic (Two points for doing the laundry! Fourteen for unclogging the toilet!), but it\u2019s a nice guidepost for parity. So I 50-50\u2019d my way to a slightly neater Dave, but that was about it.Now, on the cusp of motherhood, just as the professor had predicted, I found myself confronting what was undoubtedly a feminist decision.After the obligatory Google search, which brought up a few interesting but irrelevant facts (had Barry Manilow not taken his mother\u2019s last name, \u201cMandy\u201d could have hit the airwaves courtesy of one Barry Pincus), I turned to my friends, all liberal progressives. Every one was supportive, yet most brought up one or another hesitation, solidifying a nascent fear that this one choice would make my child a symbol, instead of just a little kid.\u201cI obviously don\u2019t think that Dave\u2019s legacy is any more important than yours,\u201d one responded in an email, \u201cjust that it\u2019s sort of a loaded subject matter and you have to be sure for your marriage\u2019s sake that you\u2019re on the same page.\u201d Yeek. Our marriage was on the line?\u201cDave is absolutely manly enough,\u201d another wrote, encouragingly. His masculinity was at stake, too?Some suggested that we hyphenate our names, a middle-of-the-road approach that was quickly batted down by one such hyphenated friend. She said not only that standardized tests and airline reservations would be hell, but also that we would just be kicking the decision down the line.\u201cWhat am I going to do, give my kid three last names, all hyphenated? A tri-hyphen?\u201d she asked.I learned of a hyphenated friend who married a hyphenated husband. Their solution? Create an entirely new surname for their kid. But they live in Berkeley.I\u2019d hoped that everyone\u2019s response would simply be, \u201cO.K., whatever.\u201d But it appeared we were still far, far from the uninterested shrug.As the snow melted and my wardrobe diminished to two pairs of stretchy pants and three oversize button-downs, we remained unsure, all the way until 45 minutes before our third family member arrived. I lay on the delivery bed crunching on ice cubes. For first names, we\u2019d settled on a girl\u2019s from my side of the family, and a boy\u2019s from his.\u201cIf it\u2019s a girl, we go with your last name,\u201d I said to Dave. \u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, mine.\u201d He agreed. One from each side. It seemed fair, equal, a shrug.Then baby Ella arrived, and our decision was made for us. The traditional result, but one made in an untraditional way. Maybe when she\u2019s old enough to be a mom, it\u2019ll be common to decide surnames with the flip of a coin, or rather, a Bitcoin algorithm. Or maybe, if we play by the same rules the second time, her little sibling will be a Brickman. It\u2019s one way of trying, ever so slightly, to hit 50-50, to make a world the original Moshes and Yehudas and Goldas surely wouldn\u2019t recognize, for all the right reasons.Sophie Brickman is the features editor at Saveur magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Predicts a Big Holiday Bounce After Its Biggest Rival, Samsung, Falters", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple predicts that strong sales of its new iPhones will soon pull the company out of a yearlong slump.And the misfortunes of its archrival, Samsung, probably deserve a bit of the credit.On Tuesday, Apple said it expects sales to start growing again in the upcoming holiday quarter, driven largely by consumer purchases of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which went on sale in September.\u201cThere\u2019s more demand we can supply right now,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said in an interview. Interest in the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple\u2019s largest model and the most direct rival to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7, is so intense that Apple said production could still lag demand even by December.If the company\u2019s forecast is accurate, it will mark a turnaround from what has been a disappointing year for the Silicon Valley giant. In April, Apple announced that sales in the first three calendar months of 2016 shrank for the first time in 13 years.The poor performance continued through the quarter that ended on Sept. 24, the company reported on Tuesday. For the most recent three-month period, Apple said, revenue fell 9 percent to $46.9 billion. Net income fell 19 percent to $9 billion.One bright spot for Apple was the accelerating growth of its services businesses \u2014 essentially its cut of iPhone app sales as well as subscriptions to Apple Music and other services such as cloud storage. Revenue from services was up 24 percent as the company squeezed more value from the billion or so Apple devices that it estimates are in active use.\u201cThe next big product is the App Store,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Research, who sees services as an underappreciated part of Apple\u2019s business.Mr. Maestri said that revenue from Apple Music, the company\u2019s streaming service, grew 22 percent in the quarter and more than offset the decline in music downloads from the iTunes store.Based primarily on the robust demand for the iPhone 7, Apple raised its financial projections for the quarter that will end in December, when crucial holiday sales occur. The company said it expects revenue of $76 billion to $78 billion, compared to $75.9 billion in the same quarter last year.China, a key market for Apple where sales have fallen sharply, appears to be stabilizing. In the September quarter, sales in greater China were about flat compared to the June quarter. Sales were still down 30 percent compared to the previous year, but Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said he was optimistic about an improvement.\u201cWe are very bullish on China,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be a new normal there, but the new normal is a good growth rate.\u201dApple shares were down about 2.6 percent in after-hours trading.While phones account for the majority of Apple\u2019s business, its Mac laptop and desktop personal computers remain significant contributors to the company\u2019s bottom line. On Thursday, Apple is expected to announce several major updates to its Mac lineup, including the first major overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop in four years.Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at the Jensen Quality Growth Fund, said that Apple\u2019s phones are gradually becoming commoditized, yielding lower profit margins. Services, which are far more profitable, will drive the company\u2019s future growth.\u201cApps and services have higher margins,\u201d said Mr. Walkush, whose mutual fund has been building its stake in Apple stock. \u201cIt makes it more annuity-like.\u201dMr. Cook got a bit prickly when asked about artificial intelligence technology found in devices made by competitors like Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google \u2019s Home. Those gadgets rely on amassing a large amount of information about users to deliver personalized information.He said Apple could deliver similar personalized services through its Siri technology without compromising privacy.\u201cIt\u2019s a false trade-off that people want you to believe, that you have to give up privacy to have A.I. to do something for you. We don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Mr. Cook said.As for new areas of focus for the company, he said Apple remains very interested in television content. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view,\u201d Mr. Cook said.Advertisement"}

My gimbal \u2014 an elaborate, selfie stick-like device that holds the phone steady while filming \u2014 went haywire, pulling the camera up then down. I wrestled to hold it steady, fumbling for the off switch. The border agent kept talking. The problem: We couldn\u2019t stop to fix it because we were live, broadcasting to thousands of viewers on Facebook.New forms of digital journalism brim with possibilities \u2014 telling stories in exciting, innovative ways, attracting new audiences, obtaining instant feedback. But they also involve an array of cables, batteries and equipment that, like my drunken gimbal, can malfunction at just the wrong moment. Sometimes I yearn for the days of a notepad and pen.I had come to Arizona, with the photographer Tomas Munita, to write about one of the campaign\u2019s totemic issues: Donald J. Trump\u2019s proposed wall. What did the people who live along the border with Mexico think of the idea? We flew in to Tucson, 60 miles from the border, rented a 4-wheel-drive Jeep and headed south, toward the Mexican border, with Google Maps as a guide.That was already a novelty: Renting a car is impossible or inadvisable in Libya and Syria, two of the Arab countries where I\u2019ve worked this year. Petrol (or gas, as Americans call it) is also strikingly cheap in Arizona: $30 for 15 gallons, or about one-third the price of what it costs in London, where I lived for a couple of years before moving to Cairo.We spent a week roving back and forth along a 120-mile stretch of border, under giant skies filled with dramatic columns of rolling clouds. Small towns with names like Apache, Rodeo and Tombstone echoed the Old West I had in my head. (The re-enactment of the shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone was entertaining but not as eventful as it had been one day last year when an actor, having accidentally loaded real bullets into his gun, shot and wounded another cast member during the show.)The Cochise County Fair in Douglas, with its glittering fairground and rodeo riders, presented a slice of amber-hued rural Americana that, until then, I had imagined only existed in the pages of National Geographic. In the animal stalls, children in cowboy hats cleaned and blow-dried their competition goats and cattle; vendors offered a glorious profusion of snacks like \u201cZach\u2019s Poppin Johnny Ice Cream,\u201d made using a 1927 John Deere hit-n-miss engine that pops and chugs as it turns two old-fashioned oak churns (delicious). Otherwise they sold items that I found funny (\u201cWarning: You are Entering a Red Neck Area,\u201d read one sign) or faintly disturbing (Confederate flags hung from a stall where a tattoo-wearing trader displayed his array of large daggers to a spellbound young boy).We crossed the border several times, parking the Jeep and traveling by foot. Getting into Mexico was easy \u2014 a simple security scan and a desultory document check and we were over. (Once, I didn\u2019t even have to show my passport.) Returning to America was another matter \u2014 a weaving journey through an elaborate, multimillion-dollar border post, replete with guards, cameras, scanners and dogs.The election was never far from the surface. One evening, returning to my room in the American Nogales, I found the maid had planted a copy of the Bible on top of the book I was reading: \u201cTrump Revealed.\u201d A political statement? If it was, others were more overt. An elderly Mexican-American woman declared herself a Trump enthusiast (\u201cViva el Donald Trump,\u201d read the post on her Facebook page). A hardy cowboy rancher said he had rooted for Bernie Sanders, the failed Democratic contender, in the primary elections.Some folks exhibited hints of the anti-media hostility that has grown across America as this divisive campaign has progressed. At the Cochise fair, I found a man wearing a \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d T-shirt at a gun-club stand. After a few minutes of terse conversation, the head of the club interjected, \u201cCome over here, we need you,\u201d and pulled the man away while glaring at me. The two men sat down together and pointedly turned their backs to me. Interview over.Accommodations varied. In Tucson we stayed at the historic Hotel Congress, where the notorious bank robber John Dillinger was captured in January 1934. One night in Douglas, a budget motel only had smoking rooms available: Imagine an air-conditioned ashtray with minimal comfort and a sign on the door that urged guests, \u201cFor Your Protection: When In Room Engage Deadbolt And Security Latch.\u201d Not particularly reassuring.Then there was what you might call the serendipity of the road: chance meetings with good people. In the border town of Naco, we bumped into David Loyd, a gracious and generous resident who offered food and a bed for the night. Mr. Loyd had run a ferry to a remote island in Washington State, on the border with Canada, before moving to southern Arizona three years ago. On the night we stayed with him, we fell asleep in his guest room to the mournful sound of howling coyotes on the plains outside.The complicated reality of life on the border \u2014 sweeping beauty alongside human tragedy \u2014 loomed close. A kindly rancher named Dan Bell took us to see two monuments near the border: a memorial dedicated to Alexander Kirpnick, a border patrol agent killed in the line of duty in 1998, and a cross that marked the spot where an anonymous migrant, trying to cross the border, had died.Sometimes, though, you miss the moment. We had just finished a Facebook Live session and put away the equipment when there was a skirmish behind us. A border agent hustled two illegal migrants, a man and a woman, into a van. They had been scooped up minutes earlier, soon after they vaulted the fence, the agent said. They would likely be back in Mexico by evening.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Somalis Living an American Dream in Kansas Glimpse a Nightmare", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byGARDEN CITY, Kan. \u2014 The newest pioneers in western Kansas arrive from Somalia and Myanmar, Mexico and Sudan: thousands of immigrants and refugees chasing work in the cattle yards and packing plants where pay starts at $16 an hour and little English is needed to saw through meat and bone.But then came a plot to attack all of that.\u201cI don\u2019t know why these people hate,\u201d Abdulkadir Mohamed, 68, a community leader in Garden City, said one recent afternoon. \u201cWe are not terrorists.\u201d\u201cWe are not ISIS,\u201d he added, referring to the Islamic State. \u201cWe come here for a better life.\u201dProsecutors say the three men held \u201cantigovernment, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs,\u201d and researchers say their arrest came as the number of anti-Muslim crimes in the United States is soaring.The arrests have unnerved the Somalis of Garden City, leaving many worried about their safety. People in this city of about 28,000 have held rallies and vigils in a show of unity, and the police have held meetings with Somali leaders. But not everyone feels comforted.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they hate us,\u201d said Abdirisaq Hassan, 36, who works at a meatpacking plant.Like many Republican-controlled legislatures, officials in Kansas have resisted efforts to resettle Syrian refugees in the state. Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, cited \u201cunacceptable\u201d safety risks in an executive order last year forbidding state agencies to aid in relocating Syrian refugees.In April, the governor withdrew Kansas entirely from the federal government\u2019s refugee resettlement program.After the arrests of the three men were announced on Oct. 14, Mr. Brownback said that \u201chate and violence\u201d had no place in the state.In Garden City, Mr. Mohamed said his instinct after he learned of the plot was to pack up and leave. Like many others here, he had fled unrest and extremist militants in Somalia. Mr. Mohamed\u2019s brother had been killed by the extremist group the Shabab, and his wife and children moved to Uganda. Many Somali refugees were resettled in Kansas in the mid-2000s.Mr. Mohamed said he had been one of the first Somalis to settle in Garden City, about seven years ago, crossing the plains in a caravan of minivans with other Somalis after their old meatpacking plant in Nebraska shut down.Somali residents spend Thanksgivings and Halloweens in the houses of lifelong Garden City families, and they welcome their non-Somali neighbors over for Muslim holidays.To Mr. Mohamed, this is home. But now, he says, he feels unsettled.\u201cLike a walking dead,\u201d he said, as he sipped a cup of sweet Kenyan tea at the African Shop, one of two Somali-run businesses in Garden City.The growth of the Somali community has further changed the face of a region that was already increasingly less white. Here in Finney County, white residents made up 70 percent of the population in 1990. Now, they represent 43 percent, according to census figures. In schools, 79 percent of children are nonwhite, and notices to parents are sent home in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Burmese.The federal investigation into the militia from western Kansas began in February and relied heavily on an undercover F.B.I. agent who met with at least one of the defendants, and on a paid informant who went to Crusaders meetings and sometimes recorded what was discussed there, investigators wrote in an affidavit.The three men charged in the case \u2014 Patrick Stein, Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright \u2014 were longtime Kansans who lived and worked about an hour\u2019s drive from Garden City. All are being held without bond.

They planned to pack four vehicles with explosives, leave them at the one-story apartments where many Somali and Burmese families live, and detonate them using a cellphone.After the men were arrested, the authorities said they found guns, nearly a metric ton of ammunition, possible bomb-making components and a copy of \u201cThe Anarchist Cookbook,\u201d which includes instructions on making explosives.\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about killing people and going to prison for life,\u201d Mr. Allen said during one meeting, according to the federal authorities. \u201cLess than 60 days, maybe 40 days until something major happens.\u201dLater, Mr. Stein added, \u201cWhen we go on operations, there\u2019s no leaving anyone behind, even if it\u2019s a 1-year-old; I\u2019m serious.\u201dAs laid out in the criminal complaint, the brown-brick apartments on Mary Street were a hated target to the three defendants, \u201cfull of goddamn cockroaches.\u201d But to the immigrant families living there, they are the ground floor in an American journey.Somali and Burmese children play soccer together in the parking lots.

For the past two weeks, since he arrived in Garden City, Abdishakur Mohamed Noor, 55, has been sleeping there under a borrowed blanket because he does not have the paperwork required to get a job at the plant.People here have tried to show unity since the news of the plot broke, holding vigils and standing together \u2014 white residents next to Somali women in colorful abayas \u2014 on the sidewalks with posters that praise their town and the local police.\u201cIt\u2019s like an attack against the whole of who we are,\u201d said Sister Janice Thome, a Roman Catholic nun who spends many of her days fielding phone calls from immigrant families looking for help paying the utilities or a dentist bill, or for a ride to the doctor\u2019s office in Kansas City, Mo., 370 miles away.But for some Somali residents, the arrests raised a chance to discuss the smaller ways they can feel unwelcome in their adoptive home.

It suggests steps like building on vacant urban land, building denser apartments around transit hubs, and making it easier for homeowners to build extra units like backyard cottages.Vacant lots in the state, most of them in San Francisco or Los Angeles, could accommodate some 225,000 homes and apartments, a report says.The math is simple: California added 544,000 households from 2009 to 2014, but only 467,000 net housing units, and that deficit is set to get worse. The state is on pace to add about a million new housing units at the current rate of construction, but by then the population will have grown by 3.6 million.All this explains why California ranks 49th of 50 (Utah is 50th) for the number of housing units per capita. And the result is that half of Californians can\u2019t afford the cost of housing in their markets.That might seem inconvenient and unfair to the volumes of young tech workers who make six-figure salaries and still can\u2019t afford their rent. But for the state\u2019s poorest residents, and even those in the working class, that burden means forgoing necessities like food and medicine.Of course, they\u2019ll have to prove it.\u201cWe intend to show to the world that this is a vehicle that is powered by nothing more than commercial grade solar cells, and it\u2019s going fast enough to get a ticket,\u201d he said.Even with nearly the entire upper surface of the 20-foot car draped in solar cells, it will run on just two kilowatts of power \u2014 roughly the amount needed for a hair dryer.To get up to highway speeds, the team created an ultra aerodynamic design with a carbon fiber body so light that the car could be lifted by two people.Graham Doig, an assistant professor at Cal Poly\u2019s Aerospace Engineering Department, said the students\u2019 effort amounted to \u201cbattling the laws of physics.\u201dThey\u2019ll know if they succeeded in June, when the record attempt is scheduled in the Mojave Desert.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Telescope to Seek Earthlike Planet in Alpha Centauri System", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byA scientific research consortium on Tuesday announced plans to build and launch a privately financed telescope the size of a small washing machine in hopes of finding an Earthlike planet in the Alpha Centauri system, one of our closest cosmic neighbors.To be built by the end of the decade, the telescope is the type of mission that NASA rarely undertakes, experts noted: tightly focused and cheap, leading to momentous discoveries \u2014 or possibly nothing at all.The two stars of the Alpha Centauri system are both similar to the sun, the closest such stars at 4.37 light-years away. The proposed telescope, with a mirror only about 20 inches across, would be able to make out Earth-size planets orbiting in the stars\u2019 so-called habitable zone, where temperatures are warm enough for liquid water to flow at the surface and, hypothetically, for life to thrive.NASA\u2019s Kepler mission has discovered more than 1,000 confirmed planets orbiting distant stars.But Proxima Centauri is much smaller and dimmer than our sun, and the planet, even if similar in size to Earth, would not be particularly Earthlike. It orbits much closer to the star, likely with one side perpetually in daylight and the other eternally dark. Because the planet is so close to its star, the proposed telescope would not be able to study it.So far, most exoplanets have been discovered indirectly, deduced by slight perturbations in the light traveling from a star \u2014 by a slight dimming when the exoplanet passes between its star and Earth, or by wobbles in the light\u2019s wavelengths caused by the gravitational pull of an unseen exoplanet.If astronomers could photograph a planet directly, they could start to look for specific wavelengths of light that serve as fingerprints of specific molecules. Detection of oxygen in the atmosphere would argue for photosynthesis and plants, for example.Dr. Morse said the proposed telescope, called Project Blue, would most likely cost $25 million to $50 million, perhaps one-third the cost of a NASA mission with similar goals. That is still a lot of money, and not easily raised.Crowdfunding through small individual donations might cover some of the early design work, he said, but \u201cwe do have to approach high-net-worth individuals and foundations.\u201d Participating institutions, like the SETI Institute and the University of Massachusetts Lowell, could also offer in-kind contributions to the project rather than cash.The idea of a telescope pointed at Alpha Centauri is not new. Ruslan Belikov, a scientist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., has been working for years as principal investigator on the Alpha Centauri Exoplanet Satellite, or ACESat, developing the technology needed to pick out planets in a binary star system.The ACESat project has not won NASA approval, however. Eduardo Bendek, ACESat\u2019s deputy principal investigator, estimated that there was a 15 percent chance that there are no planets in the habitable zones of the two Alpha Centauri stars. \u201cNASA is very averse to that risk,\u201d he said.To reduce the chances of discovering nothing, the ACESat team proposed a mission that would examine not just Alpha Centauri but also a few other nearby stars. But expanding the mission \u2014 plus other considerations to reduce risks \u2014 increased the price tag.Dr. Belikov and Dr. Bendek declined to provided specific figures, but said the total budget fit under the required $175 million cost cap when they submitted the proposal to NASA\u2019s Small Explorer astrophysics program in 2014.Instead, NASA selected three other missions for further study. ACESat remains unbuilt, and the next opportunity to submit a proposal is most likely in 2019, Dr. Belikov and Dr. Bendek said.\u201cI can\u2019t speak for NASA,\u201d Dr. Beikov said, \u201cbut speaking personally, I\u2019m excited about the possibility of doing space missions privately.\u201dSo far, privately financed space missions have met with limited success. Competitors in the Google Lunar X Prize, to send the first private spacecraft to the moon, have had trouble finding backers. Planetary Resources, a Seattle company aiming to mine asteroids, withdrew a plan for a crowdfunded space telescope, sending back contributions collected on Kickstarter.Another project, Lunar Mission One, intended to send a robotic lander to the moon\u2019s south pole, successfully raised about $1 million via Kickstarter, but probably needs more than 600 times as much to pull it off.BoldlyGo is also pursuing two more ambitious projects \u2014 a larger space telescope, and a spacecraft to collect samples from the Martian atmosphere and bring them back to Earth \u2014 that have not yet gotten off the ground.Dr. Morse, who once ran NASA\u2019s astrophysics division, agrees that Project Blue will not be easy, but says it is possible. For more than a century, he notes, astronomers have relied on the generosity of rich benefactors.\u201cAll we\u2019re doing is borrowing the model that ground-based astronomy has been using literally since the time of John Quincy Adams,\u201d Dr. Morse said. \u201cWe think that quest is worthy, and we\u2019re going to try to do it with private funding.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about plans to build and launch a privately financed telescope to look for an Earthlike planet in the Alpha Centauri system misstated the size of the mirror of the ACESat telescope proposed by scientists at the NASA Ames Research Center. It is 18 inches in diameter, not 59.Advertisement"}

Why? Two reasons. 1) The merchants pay more to the banks to accept their credit cards than they do to accept their debit cards, in general. 2) If you spend more than you have, then you start paying interest.

Now those winds are powering a wind farm whose grand promise and many problems are being closely followed across sub-Saharan Africa, where almost two-thirds of the population still has no access to electricity.It is what Kenya and other sub-Saharan countries need: abundant power that helps each nation meet its obligations under the Paris climate-change agreement, unleashes economic potential and lights dark homes. Yet the project also demonstrates the huge hurdles in undertaking large projects in a region of poor infrastructure, widespread corruption and weak financial markets. Since the project was proposed, Kenya has had a number of corruption scandals and a contested election that set off a wave of violence. In 2012 the World Bank decided not to support the project based on the argument that it would generate more power than Kenya needs. And local communities have filed a lawsuit, still pending resolution, to nullify the project\u2019s land titles.There\u2019s a lot riding on those desert winds. If they succeed in powering economic growth in Kenya, they will most likely motivate Kenya\u2019s neighbors and other sub-Saharan countries to invest in wind.

{"Headline": "If They Google You, Do You Win?", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byOpinionAre voters misleading pollsters? Are there hidden Donald Trump supporters who could throw the election his way?Over the past few years, we have both become interested in how data from the internet, particularly Google searches, might be used to predict events. People also tell Google things \u2014 a lot of things \u2014 that they may not admit to others. So can we use Google searches to predict whom voters will support in this election? It is not as simple as we\u2019d hoped.One indicator of support might be how frequently people search for a candidate. There is some evidence that if they search for you, they will vote for you. In primary elections, Google search volume for a candidate in a state has predicted electoral outcomes. It is also true that in each of the past three general elections, the candidate with the most Google searches \u2014 George W. Bush in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 \u2014 received the most votes.This time around, nationwide, for every Google search about Hillary Clinton, there are two for Mr. Trump. Does this mean that there is widespread support for Mr. Trump that is being missed by pollsters and will carry him to a commanding victory? Highly doubtful.Breaking down these searches by state yields a seemingly implausible electoral map. If Mr. Trump wins every state and has his biggest margins of victory in Vermont and California, we can all ignore polls and simply look at Google search volumes to predict future elections.The high search volume for Mr. Trump is more likely evidence that he elicits strong reactions, which is hardly news. Many who plan to vote for Mrs. Clinton are anxiously searching the web for information about Mr. Trump\u2019s chances.While voters occasionally tell Google exactly how they feel \u2014 searches like \u201cI love Trump\u201d or \u201cI hate Clinton\u201d \u2014 these searches are too rare to be used to predict electoral outcomes.One state that has a huge number of negative Trump searches is Alabama, a deeply red state that will almost certainly support Mr. Trump. We suspect that the high negative search rate may be driven by African-American voters, who may feel particular animosity toward Mr. Trump. But this group is not large enough to tip Alabama into the Democratic column.There are two indicators that may contain information about the election that polls could be missing.The first: Google searches related to information about voting. Every October of a presidential election year, hundreds of thousands of Americans enter terms like \u201chow to vote\u201d or \u201cwhere to vote.\u201d And the volume of these searches predicts where turnout will be high. This is valuable information since research suggests that more than half of nonvoters falsely tell pollsters they are going to vote.To obtain clues about the number and composition of likely voters, we can compare city-level demographics to city-level search volumes. The main insight from Google searches this year is that African-American turnout may be down in 2016. There are significantly fewer searches for voting information in cities with large black populations than there were in 2012 and 2008.This suggests that even though African-Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of Mr. Trump, they will turn out at lower rates to oppose him than they did to support President Obama. This could mean that Mr. Trump will do a bit better than expected in contested states with substantial black populations, like Ohio and Florida.Google searches for voting information can also be used to test one hypothesis for how Mr. Trump might win. David N. Wasserman, an elections analyst at The Cook Political Report, has found that there were 47 million eligible white voters without a college degree who did not vote in 2012.Might a significant number of these Americans be excited enough by Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy to vote in this election? Doubtful. According to Google searches, there is no increased interest in information about voting in cities with low levels of education.There is another indicator in Google searches that may contain meaningful information. A large percentage of election-related searches contain queries with both candidates\u2019 names. Some people search for \u201cTrump Clinton polls.\u201d Others look for highlights from the \u201cClinton Trump debate.\u201d In fact, 12 percent of search queries with \u201cTrump\u201d also include the word \u201cClinton.\u201d More than one-quarter of search queries with \u201cClinton\u201d also include the word \u201cTrump.\u201dWe have found that these seemingly neutral searches may actually give us some clues to which candidate a person supports.How? The order in which the candidates appear. Our research suggests that a person is significantly more likely to put the candidate they support first in a search that includes both candidates\u2019 names.In the previous three elections, the candidate who appeared first in more searches received the most votes. More interesting, the order the candidates were searched was predictive of which way a particular state would go.In short, we observed a strong, statistically significant relationship between the order in which the candidates appeared in Google searches in that state and the number of votes the candidate received in that state. This relationship has become stronger as Google search data has gotten richer.The order in which candidates are searched also seems to contain information that the polls can miss. In 2012, Nate Silver, the founder of the website FiveThirtyEight, accurately predicted the result in all 50 states. However, we found that in states that listed Mitt Romney before Mr. Obama in searches most frequently, Mr. Romney actually did better than Mr. Silver predicted. In states that most frequently listed Mr. Obama before Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama did better than Mr. Silver predicted.While further analysis is required, data about search order could prove a meaningful supplement to polling data. This indicator could contain information that polls miss because voters are either lying to themselves or uncomfortable revealing their true preferences to pollsters. Perhaps if they claimed that they were undecided in 2012, but were consistently searching for \u201cRomney Obama polls,\u201d \u201cRomney Obama debate\u201d and \u201cRomney Obama election,\u201d they were really planning to vote for Mr. Romney all along.So what does search order tell us about 2016? Well, again, we confront the problem of the unusual nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Nationwide, there are more searches that include \u201cTrump\u201d before \u201cClinton.\u201d This could be evidence that Mr. Trump is doing better than the polls project, although it seems likely that Mr. Trump is such a dominant and divisive figure in the American psyche that even some Clinton supporters think of this as the \u201cTrump-Clinton election.\u201dThe data is clearly not perfect. It is what economists call noisy data. But generally speaking, the states in which the highest percentage of searches put \u201cTrump\u201d first are those where Mr. Trump seems to be performing better. Those states in which \u201cTrump\u201d comes first in search queries least often are those that are most supportive of Mrs. Clinton.And, as in 2012, this indicator may have state-level information that polls are missing. If so, we would suspect that Mr. Trump might outperform his polls in Iowa and Nevada, for example.Mr. Trump is such an unusual candidate that he makes it difficult to interpret any data, but there are a couple of indicators that Mr. Trump may be doing better than polls suggest in some states. If you\u2019re a Clinton supporter in a swing state worried about the prospect of a Trump presidency, now is not the time to sit back and relax.Advertisement"}

Because of their importance in trade across the Sahara, she said, donkeys had \u201csuperhigh status.\u201dUnfortunately, even the most passionate defenders of donkeys recognize that the animal they love gets little respect in the wider world today.\u201cDonkeys are the least of the least,\u201d said Eric Davis, the veterinarian from the University of California, Davis, who started the symposium. He travels with other vets to provide free care to donkeys in many places where none is available. Donkeys are sometimes abused and, in the worst cases, slaughtered for gelatin and for meat.Fortunately, as the symposium made clear, the animals are not friendless. Their benefactors may not be large in number (conference attendance was 77), but they are as fierce in their loyalty as donkeys are in defense of their territories (more about donkey fierceness later). They are also devoted to debunking donkey myths.So if you try to lead a donkey over a shadow on the ground that looks a bit like the edge of a cliff, the donkey may balk.The donkey was quite sensibly avoiding a very threatening angel with a sword, who explained to Balaam after the fact that if it had not been for the animal\u2019s sagacity, Balaam himself would have died by the angel\u2019s sword.\u201cIt\u2019s so galling, when you become an eccentric donkey person,\u201d Dr. Marshall said.True, they are not the most exciting animals. Unlike their equine cousins, \u201cdonkeys have two speeds: slow and slower,\u201d the saying goes. But the gap in prestige between the elegant horse and the dumpy donkey is of human doing.African wild asses \u2014 of which there are perhaps 600 left in nature \u2014 are \u201cmagnificent wild animals,\u201d Dr. Marshall said, \u201creally elegant and fast and feisty as anything.\u201d And they are the animals from which the first donkeys were bred.The first horses, she said, \u201cwere short, stubby little things, sort of like a barrel on legs.\u201d People bred them to be long-legged racers and great jumpers, just as the lithe wild ass was bred to become a stubby little donkey.One nonscientific claim about donkeys is that they are lovable, and they are. I stood in a corral with Ben Hart while he spent half his time scratching the ears of one donkey that chased away 10 or so others who wanted to get in on the petting.Dr. Davis warned those at the conference that the future may hold more such horrors. Even though the number of donkeys is increasing, he said, global economic development might well mean that tractors, cars and trucks will become available to the poor who now depend on donkeys. What happens to donkeys then may be what happened to horses in developed countries as cars and trucks replaced them \u2014 widespread slaughter. If that happens, he added, donkey lovers might have to work to make their inevitable deaths as humane as possible.Dr. Davis spoke by telephone at 7 a.m. one recent morning, fresh from feeding the five donkeys that he and his wife keep. Asked why people who do not have or know donkeys should care about them, he said, \u201cMuch of human civilization was created because there were donkeys to move pastoralists and traders around the world.\u201d\u201cI think that we as a species owe something to donkeys.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s also visually beautiful, and boldly confident in its rejection of prestige-drama pacing and style.The new episodes pick up shortly after we left off, and present that same sense of impending menace \u2014 a sense we get through Daniel\u2019s skewed, often wrong perceptions of danger \u2014 overlaid on a fighting flicker of human dignity.\u2018Pure Genius,\u2019 10 p.m., CBS (New Series)TV could use a new, good doctor show. \u201cPure Genius\u201d is not that.

{"Headline": "MailChimp and the Un-Silicon Valley Way to Make It as a Start-Up", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtATLANTA \u2014 The typical start-up fairy tale goes something like this: You begin with young entrepreneurs from Stanford or Harvard who have come up with some novel idea for disrupting restaurants or dog walking or whatever else.After creating a prototype, the guys (they are almost always men) enter start-up boot camps like Y Combinator, recruit a group of early investors, and perhaps launch a Kickstarter with a slick video. If the initial plan succeeds, the founders go into heedless expansion mode, which usually means selling off huge chunks of their company in exchange for gobs of money from venture capitalists. Then, after a few years, if all goes according to plan, they hit the big time \u2014 an initial public offering and a chance to be the next face of the future.Well, sometimes. What\u2019s often left out of the start-up dream story is any mention that there\u2019s another way.In fact, it\u2019s possible to create a huge tech company without taking venture capital, and without spending far beyond your means. It\u2019s possible, in other words, to start a tech company that runs more like a normal business than a debt-fueled rocket ship careening out of control. Believe it or not, start-ups don\u2019t even have to be headquartered in San Francisco or Silicon Valley.Under the radar, slowly and steadily, and without ever taking a dime in outside funding or spending more than it earned, MailChimp has been building a behemoth. According to Ben Chestnut, MailChimp\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, the company recorded $280 million in revenue in 2015 and is on track to top $400 million in 2016. MailChimp has always been profitable, Mr. Chestnut said, though he declined to divulge exact margins. The company \u2014 which has repeatedly turned down overtures from venture capitalists and is wholly owned by Mr. Chestnut and his co-founder, Dan Kurzius \u2014 now employs about 550 people, and by next year it will be close to 700.As a private company, MailChimp has long kept its business metrics secret, but Mr. Chestnut wants to publicize its numbers now to show the road less traveled: If you want to run a successful tech company, you don\u2019t have to follow the path of \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d You can simply start a business, run it to serve your customers, and forget about outside investors and growth at any cost.There are downsides to this approach. MailChimp\u2019s path was circuitous, and it came without the glory of enormous funding rounds. But it is also suffused with a basic common sense.\u201cOne of the problems with raising money is it teaches you bad habits from the start,\u201d said Jason Fried, the co-founder of the software company Basecamp, who has written frequently on the perversions of the venture capital industry. \u201cIf you\u2019re an entrepreneur and you have a bunch of money in the bank, you get good at spending money.\u201dBut if companies are forced to generate revenue from the beginning, \u201cwhat you get really good at is making money,\u201d Mr. Fried said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a much better habit for a business to work on early on, to survive on their own rather than be dependent on money people.\u201dFor MailChimp, these lessons didn\u2019t have to be learned \u2014 they were simply a necessary part of running the business. \u201cThe whole point of this business is to prove to small businesses that you can do this, because we did it,\u201d Mr. Chestnut said.MailChimp is run out of two sprawling floors in the Ponce City Market, a massive complex in Atlanta\u2019s Old Fourth Ward neighborhood that was originally built as a Sears Roebuck warehouse. \u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s cool and vintage, but it\u2019s actually a neat reminder of disruption,\u201d Mr. Chestnut said. \u201cSears used to be the biggest thing, and then it went away.\u201dOn a recent visit, I found all the trappings of start-up life seen in countless offices in the Bay Area: Stylish d\u00e9cor, kitschy accents (there are paintings and sculptures of MailChimp\u2019s logo, a chimp named Freddie, all over), and zany conference room names. The walls of MailChimp\u2019s boardroom are covered from floor to ceiling in vintage skateboards, which Mr. Kurzius collects. Get it? It\u2019s a \u201cboard room.\u201dMailChimp wasn\u2019t always this fancy. Mr. Chestnut and Mr. Kurzius founded the company in 2000, at the crest of the dot-com bubble, after they had gotten laid off from corporate web design jobs. They used their small severance checks to start a firm they called the Rocket Science Group, which offered design consulting for large and small businesses in Atlanta.Late in 2000, some of those customers started asking for ways to reach their customers by email. Mr. Chestnut thought he could repurpose some old code he had used to create a failed online greeting card business. One of his old greeting cards featured a drawing of a chimp, so he thought he would call the new email service ChimpMail, but the domain name was taken. So he went with MailChimp.For years, the pair ran the email service as a side project to the main web design gig. Around 2006, they began to grow wary of web design; the business was growing, but not very quickly, and they weren\u2019t passionate about it.What Mr. Chestnut and Mr. Kurzius were passionate about was helping small businesses grow. They had both been raised in entrepreneurial families \u2014 Mr. Chestnut\u2019s mother ran a salon out of her kitchen, and Mr. Kurzius\u2019s father was a baker whose business was forced to close after Wonder Bread moved into town \u2014 and they thought that maligned as it was, email presented a low-cost marketing channel for companies on small budgets. In 2007, they stopped doing web design and focused exclusively on MailChimp.At the time, MailChimp faced a host of larger and better-capitalized rivals, including Constant Contact, which went public late in 2007. But Mr. Chestnut said MailChimp had a proximity to its customers that its competitors lacked. Because MailChimp was itself a small business, it understood what those businesses wanted out of their marketing tools. Its offerings were cheaper, it added features more quickly, and it allowed greater customizations to fit customers\u2019 needs.Though Mr. Chestnut insists that he isn\u2019t worried about the longevity of email \u2014 people have been predicting its death for years, and email just keeps getting more important \u2014 the company is also pushing into other channels, including social media. The next phase of MailChimp, he said, is to become a one-stop shop for the entirety of a small business\u2019s marketing needs.Its future is far from assured \u2014 new modes of communication like voice and text messaging could undermine email, and there is always the threat of some large platform like Facebook or Google building a rival to MailChimp. Still, to Mr. Chestnut, MailChimp\u2019s future is more secure if he and Mr. Kurzius control the company, rather than run it at the behest of outside investors.\u201cEvery time we sat down with potential investors, they never seemed to understand small business,\u201d Mr. Chestnut said. Venture capitalists always wanted MailChimp to serve \u201centerprise companies,\u201d large businesses with thousands of employees and, potentially, thousands to spend.\u201cEverybody we talked to said, \u2018You\u2019re sitting on a gold mine, and if you pivot to enterprise, you could be huge,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chestnut said. \u201cBut something in our gut always said that didn\u2019t feel right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Pixel Review: Assessing the New Smartphone", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe absence of a major competing Android device works out especially well for Google because the Pixel is, relatively speaking, mediocre. It is slower than Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung\u2019s smaller flagship phone. Photos shot with Pixel\u2019s camera don\u2019t look as good as the iPhone\u2019s. And Google\u2019s built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb.Google said that it had optimized Pixel to be speedy, with real-world applications that consumers could perceive, like making the touch screen feel very responsive. It also said that it would improve its virtual assistant over time and that photos taken with the Pixel look more natural.Here\u2019s what stood out in my tests of Pixel:Google\u2019s Still-Annoying AssistantAnd so it was with Google\u2019s supposedly new-and-improved virtual assistant, called Assistant, on the Pixel. The search giant says the difference with Assistant is that it is capable of \u201ctwo-way conversations.\u201d In plain English, what Google means is you can make requests to Assistant and ask follow-up questions, and Assistant might understand the context to respond appropriately.Google offers this example: You can ask, \u201cWhere is the Taj Mahal?\u201d and then ask, \u201cHow old is it?\u201dWhile that sounds compelling in theory, Assistant failed at responding fully to many requests made with natural language. When I asked, \u201cWhat time is \u2018Westworld\u2019 on TV?\u201d Assistant displayed a web search result containing the synopsis for the new sci-fi show. When I followed up with, \u201cSo what time is it on?\u201d Assistant told me the current time, which was 9:35 p.m.From there on, Assistant continued to hit foul balls. When I said, \u201cbook me a table nearby,\u201d Assistant would try to book a table only at a restaurant called Rich Table, and didn\u2019t list other options.On the plus side, Assistant can handle a conversation about the weather. When I asked for the weather and it said it was raining, I asked whether it would stop raining this week. \u201cRain is not expected this week in San Francisco,\u201d it said. Better.In its current state, attempting to accomplish complex tasks with Assistant on Pixel will waste more time than it saves.A Mediocre Camera Like pretty much every handset maker, Google proclaims Pixel\u2019s camera to be the best on the market. Its rear camera has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, similar to the iPhone 7\u2019s 12-megapixel sensor. So I took photos with the Pixel and compared them with shots taken with the iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7.All the cameras took clear, visually appealing photographs with rich details, but there were major differences in color, even without any filters applied. The photos taken with the Pixel looked colder \u2014 they appeared to exaggerate cyans and magentas. The ones taken with the iPhone looked more vivid, though they appeared to slightly bump up yellows to make photos look warmer. The color in pictures taken with the Samsung phone looked oversaturated and unnatural.I decided to let a blind jury weigh in. My partner, a professional photographer, took photos with each camera of a plant in a colorful vase in natural lighting. She labeled each photograph A, B and C, and I sent the photos out to 30 people and, without revealing which phone each letter corresponded with, asked them to vote for their favorite. (Before reading the results below, take a look and make your own vote.)Photo A was taken with the Samsung phone, photo B with Google\u2019s Pixel, and photo C with an iPhone 7. Out of 30 votes, 19 voted for the iPhone, eight voted for the Pixel, and three voted for the Samsung phone. People seemed to gravitate toward the warmer color profiles produced by the iPhone.Comparisons With the CompetitionBased on features alone, the Pixel is decent compared with Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7. Here are some highlights:\u25a0 What sets Pixel apart is its compatibility with Project Fi, Google\u2019s experimental wireless service. You pay at least $30 a month for a package that includes unlimited minutes and messages and 1 gigabyte of cellular data. You can pay $10 more for each extra gigabyte of data or get reimbursed for the cellular data you don\u2019t use.\u25a0 The Pixel\u2019s fingerprint sensor, for unlocking the phone, is annoyingly on the back of the device rather than on the face. So when you\u2019re on the go, you will probably be using two hands \u2014 one to hold the phone and the other to place your fingerprint on the back \u2014 to unlock the Pixel.\u25a0 In speed tests run with the mobile app Geekbench, the Pixel was about 20 percent slower than both the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7.\u25a0 The Pixel wasn\u2019t designed to be water-resistant though Google says it is resistant to water sprays. The Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 survived a dive into a pitcher of water.\u25a0 It\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel still has a headphone jack, which Apple eliminated from its iPhones this year (though it turns out the iPhone\u2019s omission of the jack was not a big deal).The Bottom LineLargely because Samsung, the king of Android phones, is in the penalty box, now is a good time to consider trying something new, be it a different phone service or a different operating system altogether.Using Pixel with Project Fi may also end up saving you money: If you picked, for example, a plan with two gigabytes of data, you\u2019d pay $40 a month for cellphone and data service that works all over the world. In contrast, Verizon charges $55 a month for a similar plan that doesn\u2019t include free international roaming.If you are uninterested in Project Fi and are not deeply invested in Google\u2019s ecosystem, there is another route: Try an iPhone. Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus outperformed the Pixel in every way in terms of hardware features.And so far, to my knowledge, Apple phones haven\u2019t blown up.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article rendered incorrectly the name of a Google product shown.

{"Headline": "Rolling Stone Stays Focused as Defamation Trial Is Set to Begin", "Date": "2016-10-16", "News": "Supported byWith his spiky gray hair and the top few buttons of his shirt undone, Jann S. Wenner looked every bit the aging but still vigorous lion of pop-culture media as he sat in his cavernous Manhattan office last week, editing by pen and paper a coffee-table book for Rolling Stone\u2019s 50th anniversary next year.Around the corner, in a much smaller office, was Mr. Wenner\u2019s 26-year-old son, Gus, who as head of digital is charged with leading the family business into the future.Together they are trying to steer the business, Wenner Media, through perhaps the strongest headwinds in its history, as the market for print magazines erodes, the company works to pay off debt and an $8 million defamation trial opens on Monday in a federal court in Virginia \u2014 the first of two lawsuits that Rolling Stone faces over a discredited 2014 article about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia.In this first case, Rolling Stone faces a University of Virginia associate dean who says she was smeared by the article; a second, filed in a Virginia state court by the fraternity that was portrayed as the setting for the alleged gang rape, seeks $25 million in damages and has not yet gone to trial. Legal experts say that even if Rolling Stone loses, it is unlikely to suffer the same fate as Gawker, and Jann Wenner, 70, said that his company \u2014 which also publishes US Weekly and Men\u2019s Journal \u2014 was well covered by insurance.\u201cOur journalistic reputation is shining,\u201d Mr. Wenner said in an interview.William McKeen, a journalism professor at Boston University who has written a biography of Thompson, called the failures of the Virginia story \u201cdevastating\u201d and said that the fallout from it \u201coffsets, maybe in this case, generations of good writing.\u201dIn some ways, the Virginia controversy could not have come at a worse time for Wenner Media. Like other magazine publishers, it has struggled to find new sources of income to make up for a fading print business, and gone through painful cost-cutting. Wenner\u2019s three magazines had $330 million in revenue for the year that ended in June, down from $354 million the year before, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service.Wenner, which is privately owned, also shoulders more than $14 million in debt payments each year for a loan that dates to 2006, when the company borrowed $300 million to buy back the 50 percent share in US Weekly that it had sold to Disney for $40 million just five years before. Analysts say that Wenner has been disciplined in paying down the loan \u2014 its obligation is now $59 million \u2014 but described the terms as aggressive, since lenders want to make their money back before the magazine business falls apart.\u201cSome people are 60 going on 70,\u201d said Janice Min, the chief creative officer of The Hollywood Reporter and a former editor of US Weekly. \u201cJann was 60 going on 40.\u201dGus Wenner\u2019s duties include broad oversight of online business and editorial content for all Wenner publications. In an interview, he described priorities like video, licensing and brand partnerships.\u201cMaybe some of it was intuitive,\u201d said the younger Mr. Wenner, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think you have to be a genius to look at where certain trends are going in the business.\u201dHis quick rise has drawn plenty of sniping in media circles about nepotism. But Mr. Wenner has also earned a grudging respect for his pursuit of new business deals, which have included a partnership with Google for Rolling Stone\u2019s cover archive. The site has also grown, with an average of 17 million unique visits so far this year, up about 90 percent from the same period in 2014, according to comScore. Rolling Stone says that 47 percent of its advertising revenue is now digital.\u201cTo his credit,\u201d Matt Mastrangelo, a former publisher of Rolling Stone, said of Gus, \u201che has been able to get Jann to understand that if the company is going to have a chance in this fractured, crazy media landscape, they have to go all-in on digital.\u201dWhen asked how he was able to make the changes, Gus Wenner said, \u201cI had a very clear line to my dad.\u201dThe company\u2019s most immediate concern is the lawsuit in Virginia, which was filed by Nicole P. Eramo, the associate dean. In court filings, her lawyers assert that Rolling Stone and the author of the article, Sabrina Rubin Erdely \u2014 also a defendant in the cases \u2014 were reckless in their reporting and editing, and that Ms. Erdely deliberately avoided following leads that could have disproved the story.Legal experts following the case said that neither side had a clear advantage. Rolling Stone faces a hometown jury and the fact that it has already disavowed the article. But since Ms. Eramo was deemed by the judge to be a public figure, she must meet a difficult standard of proving actual malice, meaning that Rolling Stone knew or must have known that its article was false before publication.\u201cThe Columbia Journalism School condemned Rolling Stone,\u201d Elizabeth M. Locke, a lawyer for Ms. Eramo, said in a statement, \u201cand we are confident that a jury will do so as well.\u201dJann and Gus Wenner declined to comment on the litigation. But just days before the trial was to begin, Gus Wenner sounded optimistic about the magazine\u2019s future.\u201cIt is certainly a transformational moment for the company, and it will not be easy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have made some important moves to set ourselves up for success, and I could not be more excited.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Quiet Menace of Kelly Reichardt\u2019s Feminist Westerns", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "FeatureThrough her spare, often uncomfortably observant movies, the filmmaker tells the stories of women moving through an uneasy world.Supported byThe scene would have played differently in one of Reichardt\u2019s films. Her moment of hesitation would have been barely perceptible; her lines would have been cut. The camera might have lingered sympathetically on the pockmarked face of one teenager before panning back to Reichardt\u2019s. Her reaction would have been inscrutable.Reichardt, who is 52, has made a career of silence and suggestion \u2014 of casting an attentive but unobtrusive gaze on people who can never quite seem to win. She is interested, she says, in characters \u201cwho don\u2019t have a net, who if you sneezed on them, their world would fall apart.\u201dLike her films, Reichardt is short and lean and soft-spoken. It is difficult not to feel brash in her company. You want to whisper, and whatever intimacy is established seems tenuous. The vibration of a cellphone is enough to break the spell. We met at the small cottage Reichardt rents for a few months each year in Portland, where she socializes with a small coterie of artists, including her occasional writing partner, the Oregon-based novelist Jon Raymond, and Todd Haynes, who has executive-produced five of her six feature films. Reichardt regularly shoots her films in this corner of the country, using the backdrop of Oregon\u2019s conifer forests, high deserts and shabby strip malls to portray lives led on society\u2019s outer rim. \u201cThe characters are just sort of an extension of the landscape they\u2019re in,\u201d Reichardt said, after we sat down to lunch at the kind of self-conscious cafe that would never appear in one of her movies. \u201cThey\u2019re a product of the places they\u2019re from and their troubles \u2014 their everyday troubles.\u201dWhether set on a cooperative farm (\u201cNight Moves,\u201d a 2013 eco-terrorism thriller) or in a desolate parking lot (\u201cWendy and Lucy,\u201d a recession-era character study), her films are all, in their own strange way, westerns. The shots are rife with the genre\u2019s archetypal motifs \u2014 horses, trains, buttes \u2014 and the quiet stories she tells, of lonesome, seminomadic searchers struggling to maintain dignity in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, fill the screen as forcefully as any film that John Wayne was ever in. Reichardt\u2019s protagonists tend not to be men, however, but emotionally inarticulate women, whose problems the supposedly civilizing force of frontier justice never proves strong enough to fix.While a lone man can be a hero \u2014 readily and right from the start \u2014 a lone woman is cause for concern. Despite their painterly settings and near-silent soundscapes, Reichardt\u2019s films are animated by a sustained unease. The viewer anticipates a threat that could but never quite does progress to a state of emergency. A car crash produces no injuries. A nocturnal encounter with intoxicated homeless men does not result in sexual violence. An old man gives every indication he could die at any moment but does not. The menace is durational and transforms the audience into participants in a kind of endurance art. It\u2019s the low-grade but unrelenting sense of hazard that is a woman\u2019s experience of merely moving through the world, an anxiety so quiet and constant it can be confused for nothing more than atmosphere.She dropped out of high school after 11th grade, worked in a clog shop for a while and a record store for a little longer and eventually caught a ride to Boston in the middle of winter. \u201cI had never seen snow before, and I was there in my little Miami clothes,\u201d Reichardt said. \u201cIn my mind it was a blizzard, but it was probably just snowing.\u201d She arrived at a friend\u2019s empty apartment, settled in and, as she recalls, \u201cwas sitting there pondering how my new life was going to go\u201d when she heard a knock at the door. \u201cThere were two people there,\u201d Reichardt says. \u201cNow I understand the get-up, but there they were in Salvation Army granny clothes and combat boots and he had his shaved head.\u201d She had never seen such people and couldn\u2019t even tell how old they were. \u201cThey were like, \u2018We live across the street and our freezer\u2019s broken and we have some hamburger meat in that fridge.\u2019 And I looked, and indeed there was hamburger meat in the fridge. And they said, \u2018So you want to come have spaghetti with us?\u2019\u2009\u201dThe dinner was Reichardt\u2019s first introduction to any sort of life outside the mainstream. She began sleeping on her neighbors\u2019 couches, attending their parties. She took night classes to get access to equipment, which she used to film their projects; the films, in turn, became her application to art school. After graduating from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, she moved to New York City and, after a few years, began writing her first feature film, \u201cRiver of Grass.\u201dReichardt once described \u201cRiver of Grass,\u201d which was met with positive if not career-catalyzing reviews, as \u201ca road movie without the road, a love story without the love and a crime story without the crime.\u201d It was released in 1994, a full 12 years before her next movie. She spent half that time couch-surfing, including a few months in Hollywood, trying and failing to get something made in a place that, as she realizes now, required skills like pitching and schmoozing that she didn\u2019t even knew existed. \u201cI came back to New York thinking: This is torturous. What do I even like about this?\u201d she said. \u201cThe answer, it turned out, was: I like holding my camera. I like shooting and thinking about frames.\u201dShe went back to making short Super 8 films, mostly shot outside. \u201cThey were really not good,\u201d she insists. Still, one made it to the Venice Film Festival. \u201cOf course my producer and I weren\u2019t invited to any of the parties,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we sat on the riverbank and watched these parties that were happening on boats. It really was an epiphany. I thought, This is exactly where I want to be: not at the party but on the bank of a river, with my friend, looking on at it.\u201dShe used $30,000 she inherited from a great-aunt to make \u201cOld Joy,\u201d a misanthropic buddy film shot on 16-millimeter and co-starring the indie-rock musician Will Oldham. Since then, Reichardt has worked continuously, releasing a new film every two or three years. For her, this pace is an act of self-preservation. \u201cI\u2019m not great with the production of real life \u2014 the car, the insurance, the dentist \u2014 all those things that seem to mount up if you don\u2019t have a project and become the meat of your day,\u201d she told me.Like the Dardenne brothers or the Italian Neo-Realists or a mud-encrusted Robert Altman on the set of \u201cMcCabe and Mrs. Miller,\u201d Reichardt is devoted to showing the texture of genuine hardship. She is preoccupied with the cruelty of inattention and the rote motions that make up a person\u2019s day. Where does someone who lives in a car brush her teeth each morning? What does someone working two jobs look like, move like at the end of the day, knowing she\u2019s about to get up and do it all again?Reichardt, as if in solidarity with her characters, is herself made uncomfortable by comfort. She embraces a grueling production process that mimics the precarious existences she shows on-screen. When critics and cinephiles lament the demise of low-budget filmmaking, they\u2019re almost always talking about projects that cost many times more than Reichardt\u2019s. \u201cCertain Women,\u201d which was made for around $2 million, is by far her most expensive film to date. Her 2006 movie, \u201cOld Joy,\u201d cost $100,000; \u201cWendy and Lucy,\u201d from 2008, $300,000.\u201cYou can romanticize it \u2014 and maybe it is adding something \u2014 but it also just means that I\u2019m not getting paid, and I\u2019m in my 50s,\u201d she jokes. Gus Van Sant likes to remind Reichardt that with more money come new problems. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d she acknowledges, \u201cbut I think I\u2019d like to try some of those other problems.\u201dOf her many inhospitable sets, the one for \u201cMeek\u2019s Cutoff,\u201d a re-enactment of an ill-fated Oregon Trail journey and Reichardt\u2019s only \u201ctrue\u201d western, was the most hostile. There were rattlesnakes and tornado-speed winds; it was 110 degrees during the day and 20 degrees at night. Actors came down with heatstroke and hypothermia. \u201cGoogle is not research,\u201d she said. \u201cResearch is a lived thing.\u201dReichardt elicits unparalleled performances in part by creating conditions under which actors cannot act. Frequent appearances by animals force improvisational gestures, as does bad weather on set, which is incorporated into scenes instead of avoided through expensive scheduling changes. It was well below freezing and gray when \u201cCertain Women\u201d began filming in Montana last spring, and by lunch the camera crew was in tears. Nobody but the actors and a limited crew were present \u2014 no studio executives, no onlookers. \u201cNo one really wants to sit out in 18-degree weather and see what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Reichardt explained. \u201cThey\u2019re hard places to get to by design, and it makes for an insular, private world.\u201d\u201cCertain Women\u201d (2016).With the state-of-the-art technology and all the parking lots hidden from sight, the grapevine-trellised campus looked like a wellness spa or the location of a rigorously hashtagged six-figure wedding. Guests can swim, ride bikes, drink proprietary wine and eat gourmet meals prepared with vegetables grown on the premises. She was grateful for it, but the entire setup agitated her. It was too nice.Reichardt was there to get through a few efficient days in the studio with Kent Sparling, a sound designer with whom she worked on \u201cNight Moves.\u201d The two had already clocked nearly 100 hours side by side in foam-padded rooms, and their rapport was one of affectionate bickering. Like everyone else who comes into contact with Reichardt, Sparling \u2014 who is known for being exacting about his work and whose credits include films as diverse as \u201cLost in Translation\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons Movie\u201d \u2014 seemed almost careless by comparison.The rural Montana that Reichardt captured on camera six months earlier now needed to sound as subtly correct as it looked. The bird calls were a source of unyielding tension. In an attempt to muffle out a line of dialogue spoken by a child, Sparling suggested inserting some chirps. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a little peeper bird,\u201d he offered, while scanning his list of audio files. Reichardt asked, \u201cDoes that exist in Montana?\u201d Sparling groaned. \u201cAre we really going there?\u201d Reichardt nodded. He played the clip and then said, \u201cI think the peeper\u2019s too quiet anyway.\u201d They went on like this: Sparling playing warblers, Reichardt looking up online the ones she liked to see if they were regionally and seasonally appropriate. A pheasant was proposed, as was a grouse. \u201cWe\u2019re near a river, so maybe there\u2019s a wood duck?\u201d Reichardt wondered aloud. Sparling played her a wood duck. The quack was boisterous, almost funny. Reichardt, perhaps the only person in the world who could find a bird call gauche, yelped. \u201cGod, no, not the duck!\u201dSparling, impatient, suggested a bird from Florida, and Reichardt laughed. \u201cWhat was the first conversation I ever had with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt was, \u2018Do you care about birds?\u2019 Wasn\u2019t that the first question I ever asked when I met you? I\u2019m pretty sure it was.\u201dSlowly, slowly throughout the morning they finessed their way through seconds of footage. Tinkering with the rumble of a truck engine, Reichardt instructed: \u201cLet\u2019s embrace it but not embellish it.\u201d While editing a conversation that takes place inside a car, she argued with Sparling about how best to retain both the dialogue and the sounds of the road. \u201cLet\u2019s get the air and the wind and the trees and the gravel and the tires and just forget about what they say,\u201d Sparling joked punishingly. \u201cYou want your unbuttered toast buttered!\u201d Reichardt smiled, and said, \u201cWell, yeah, a little bit.\u201dThey continued. Noises that Reichardt turned down or cut out included a single wind chime, a barely audible breeze, the rustling of a tent. The already-quiet scene grew quieter, stiller. At one point, the sound of a tarp wrinkling was inappropriately amplified. No moviegoer would notice it, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Despite initial adjustments, the whirring was still apparent. Reichardt asked Sparling to lower the levels again; he did, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Reichardt looked despondent. In a signal of forfeit, she sighed, shrugged and said, \u201cMaybe the world is just too loud.\u201dAlice Gregory is a columnist for The New York Times Book Review and a contributing editor at T, and has written for The New Yorker, Harper\u2019s and GQ.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Introduces the Pixel, Its Own Smartphone", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For all the bells and whistles of Google\u2019s new smartphone, the biggest point of emphasis is tucked away in small type on the back of the device: \u201cPhone by Google.\u201dToday, most of Google\u2019s smartphone software runs on devices manufactured by companies like Samsung, LG Electronics and Lenovo, with Google\u2019s presence often relegated to the background. But with its new Pixel smartphone, introduced Tuesday at a press event, Google is front and center and selling a phone that it created from the industrial design to the components.Google\u2019s new strategy of controlling both hardware and software for its devices puts the company more directly in competition with Apple and many of its own Android partners. It\u2019s a necessity, Google says, because of the advent of artificial intelligence.Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said devices with artificial intelligence \u2014 where computers can understand what people are saying and respond conversationally with the right information at the right moment \u2014 present a seminal moment in computing on par with the creation of the personal computer, the World Wide Web and smartphones.For Google, artificial intelligence takes form in the Google Assistant. Google demonstrated how the Assistant, through a series of questions, can be used to plan a night out \u2014 from finding out about upcoming concerts at a certain venue to booking a reservation at a restaurant or researching how long the drive from the restaurant to the show will take.\u201cThe goal is to build a personal Google for each and every individual,\u201d Mr. Pichai said.Pixel is the first smartphone with the Google Assistant built into the device. It was part of a new-product barrage including a Wi-Fi router, a virtual reality headset and a Chromecast device for streaming high-resolution video.The Echo\u2019s success informed an important part of Google\u2019s strategy: hardware products that provide a vessel to get the Google Assistant into the hands of consumers.Its competitors are taking a similar path with their A.I. technology. Amazon is now building Alexa into its other hardware products like Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top boxes. Apple is considering expanding the reach of its virtual assistant from the iPhone and iPad into the home with an Echo-like device.\u201cIf you really want to make a step-change difference, you really have to design the software and hardware together,\u201d said Rick Osterloh, who returned to Google in April to be its senior vice president of hardware. He was the president of Motorola when it was owned by Google and moved with the company when it was sold to Lenovo in 2014.Part of Mr. Osterloh\u2019s mandate is to make sense of Google\u2019s fragmented hardware efforts, which span a wide range of devices, from Chromebook computers to Wi-Fi routers. He said he planned to focus Google\u2019s hardware resources in areas that highlight the company\u2019s software, while also creating a unified look and feel to the devices.Creating a uniform experience, especially in the world of smartphones, has been a challenge for Google. Hardware manufacturers often modify Google\u2019s software to make what they sell a little different from that of their competitors.For the last six years, Google worked with other hardware manufacturers such as Samsung and LG Electronics to develop the Nexus line of smartphones. Those phones provided a showcase for the best of Google\u2019s software, but much of the design and production process was handled by the company\u2019s hardware partners.With Pixel, Mr. Osterloh said, \u201cwe wanted to build things as Google intended.\u201dBut becoming a hardware manufacturer is not easy. Google is now exposed to new risks associated with a hardware business, such as managing inventory, providing customer service and procuring components.With the Pixel, Google clearly has Apple\u2019s iPhone in its sights. During an onstage presentation, Mr. Osterloh said the Pixel doesn\u2019t have an \u201cunsightly camera bump\u201d \u2014 a reference to the protruding nub that sticks out from the iPhone\u2019s rear camera.In a commercial for the Pixel, Google also said its phone is all-new while noting that the Pixel comes with a \u201csatisfyingly not new\u201d headphone jack. Apple\u2019s latest iPhones come without a headphone jack, a design decision that has sparked furious debate in the technology news media.The Pixel, which is available for order, will come with a very iPhone-like price, starting at $649. Google said Google Home will sell for $129 and be available starting next month. The Pixel is available at Verizon and Best Buy stores. For people who want to use the phone with a different carrier, Google will sell the phone unlocked at its online store.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: The Steep Costs of Fighting Wildfires", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Wildfires in California will continue to burn, as they have year after year, and the conditions are there to make each year more devastating than the last. The official forecast for the months ahead call for above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation in the southern part of the state, a dangerous combination on land already castigated by drought.What isn\u2019t yet known is how, exactly, we\u2019re going to pay to fight these fires in the fiscal year that has just begun.Budgeting for wildfire suppression is a bit of an exercise in prediction, based on the average cost of fighting fires over the previous 10 years. In other words, the federal government sets aside a specific amount of money to fight fires before the start of the fiscal year \u2014 and, consequently, before a single fire has burned.The problem with that, he said, is that \u201cyou can\u2019t go back and undo the lack of preparation that wasn\u2019t done in prior years.\u201dCalifornia, with its expensive and long fire season, has borne the brunt of these cuts. Of the 20 million acres of forestland in the state, six million to nine million acres are at risk of catastrophic fires because the vegetation is too dense or because there are too many dead or dying trees \u2013 66 million of them in the Sierra Nevada alone, Jeanne Wade Evans, deputy regional forester, said during the call.For the fiscal year that ended last week, the Forest Service received a one-time infusion of $662 million \u2014 a \u201cBand-Aid solution,\u201d said Mr. Donovan, and one that is unlikely to happen again this year.The Obama administration has tried to change the way fire suppression is funded. Meanwhile, in Congress, several bills are vying to fix the problem, though there has been no agreement over how to get it done.Back then, she wrote recently, the city\u2019s downtown was mostly dormant.Forty-four years later, downtown Los Angeles has come alive with development, the publication has become a habit for thousands of readers, and Ms. Laris, 73, has run out of steam.\u201cI\u2019m getting cross-eyed,\u201d she said in an interview.Ms. Laris said she hoped to find an owner who could steer the free weekly, with a print run of about 40,000, through a time of rapid change in Los Angeles.\u201cI drive down the street and I literally can\u2019t even name all the places I see that are under construction,\u201d Ms. Laris said.The influx of high-rise condominiums and other developments has been driven in part by an intense need for housing, she said, but also by a shift in policy makers\u2019 thinking about the role of density in urban areas.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a suburban feel to an urban area,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for the future of cities.\u201dThe Downtown News hasn\u2019t named a selling price, but Ms. Laris said at least nine parties have made inquiries.As for Ms. Laris, she said she has no plans for herself yet. She once thought she would be at the newspaper forever.\u201cIt\u2019s like one of my children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C. Berkeley.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of a one-time cash infusion received by the Forest Service. It was $662 million, not $500 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Declaring \u2018That\u2019s Me,\u2019 and Empowering Latinas", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byRace/RelatedA few months ago, Sarai Gonzalez\u2019s proudest distinction was being a funny older sister. She hammed it up during dance parties in her family room in Green Brook, N.J. She wore studded pink high-tops and baked a mean cupcake.\u201cIt was like a flash,\u201d Sarai said.\u201cSoy Yo\u201d seemed to appear at precisely the right moment \u2014 a defiant, and adorable, rebuke to the anti-Latino rhetoric of the Trump campaign, and haters in general. \u201cDon\u2019t worry if they don\u2019t accept you,\u201d goes the song\u2019s chorus, in Spanish. \u201cIf they criticize you, just say, \u2018That\u2019s me.\u2019 \u201dThe video resonated particularly with Latinas. Rarely in American life, especially in an era of ugly debates over immigrants, had popular culture created a young, brown, working-class character so heroic, free of victimhood, full of straight-up dignity.Sarai made Latinas visible. Real Latinas. And they responded, in a chorus of \u201cyes, that\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that Latinos are part of American life, American space is Latino space,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Elena Cepeda, who studies Latino representations in popular culture and teaches at Williams College. \u201cRight now, that is a pretty transgressive statement.\u201dFor Sarai, the video became like a home movie forever on repeat. \u201cMy mom was always checking it,\u201d Sarai said. \u201cMy dad was playing it when he was washing clothes.\u201dIt all came together through a mix of accident and authenticity.Sarai\u2019s father, Juan Carlos Gonzalez, is from Costa Rica. Her mother, Diana Gonzalez, is from Peru. They came to the United States when they were about Sarai\u2019s age. Devout Catholics, they met in church. Mrs. Gonzalez is a computer analyst at a Newark hospital and Mr. Gonzalez left his job as a construction engineer to be a stay-at-home father. Sarai is the oldest of their three daughters, and as a child, \u201cshe would sing everywhere. \u2018Mother Goose,\u2019 \u201d Mrs. Gonzalez said. \u201cThe microphone, that was her best friend.\u201d And she was always self-assured. In her mostly pink bedroom, a hand-painted sign says, \u201cI am awesome!\u201dLast year, recognizing her charisma, Sarai\u2019s parents enrolled her in a program run by Actors, Models and Talent for Christ, or A.M.T.C., a Christian talent and modeling ministry. She traveled to Orlando, Fla., and was picked up by an agent in New York. But it was her father who saw the casting call for the video on an actors database.He didn\u2019t intend to make a political statement. He was inspired by the message of the song \u2014 \u201cabout being yourself,\u201d he said \u2014 and by a photo of his girlfriend from high school. \u201cShe had braces, red hair, this incredibly ugly track suit,\u201d he said. \u201cShe just had something.\u201dHe pictured \u201ca story about her walking down the street, just emitting this self-confidence that rubs off on the viewer.\u201dHe wanted to \u201cparaphrase a hip-hop video,\u201d so he headed to Brooklyn. (The video is shot in Williamsburg and Bushwick.) He held auditions over the summer that drew more than 100 young actors. \u201cWhen I saw Sarai,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen she was waiting, the look on her face was just priceless.\u201dIt was her first role, if you don\u2019t count playing one of \u201cThe Three Little Pigs\u201d in a school production.Mr. Kjelstrup had little trouble building out her character: short overalls, Crocs, big glasses and pigtail braids. That look, paired with Sarai\u2019s attitude, was contagious.Jillian B\u00e1ez, author of the forthcoming book \u201cConsuming Latinas: Latina Audiences and Citizenship,\u201d about how Latinas perceive media targeted toward them, said the response showed the therapeutic power of the video. \u201cI absolutely think it can be recuperative for Latina audiences who may not have seen themselves when they were little girls.\u201dThere have been startlingly few unconventional Latinas in popular culture. \u201cUgly Betty,\u201d adapted from the Colombian telenovela \u201cYo Soy Betty, La Fea,\u201d is virtually the only nerd; Google \u201cLatina girl nerds\u201d or \u201cHispanic girl nerds\u201d and the hits are for pornography.If Latinas are portrayed at all, said Isabel Molina-Guzm\u00e1n, author of \u201cDangerous Curves: Latina Bodies in the Media,\u201d \u201cthe expectation is that they are going to be sexual, they are going to be spectacle.\u201dSarai\u2019s character is empowered, without any of that baggage. She drives off two snickering white girls by playing a recorder to the track of Andean panpipes. She confronts older boys, busting out dance moves learned from watching clips of Will Smith on \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\u201dIf the video resonated most of all with Latinas, it may have been for this fluid blending of cultures, which came naturally to a little girl raised between them.\u201cWe would blast the music in our family room and my mom and dad would dance with me,\u201d Sarai said. \u201cIt was pretty funny.\u201dLately the family has a new ritual. At night, Sarai crawls into bed with her parents to look at the latest photos fans have posted.\u201cI always cry,\u201d her mother said. At Sarai\u2019s age, Mrs. Gonzalez and her sister, recently arrived to the country from Peru, had to work in the Georgia tobacco fields with their parents.\u201cI never saw myself on television,\u201d she said. \u201cI see myself finally on the big screen. And I don\u2019t have to be a size 2 or have perfect skin or a certain color hair,\u201d she added. \u201cI can be myself.\u201d\u201cThis little girl is in every Latina woman,\u201d said her husband.When her parents get emotional, Sarai tells them what to write. \u201cWow!! You look beautiful,\u201d she wrote to the barista in Texas, who had never fit in. \u201cSarai sends a hug.\u201dThen she sent some hearts. Pink ones.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Voters Increasingly Turning to Internet for Information, Survey Shows", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byVoters have stepped away from the television and are digesting the presidential and Senate races through the internet, a new poll of persuadable voters in five Senate battleground states shows.The survey, conducted by the Global Strategy Group, a Democratic firm, and Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican firm, showed that the information most influential to voters has migrated to social media, fact checkers and media websites, as people scale back their television-viewing habits.\u201cThese persuadable voters, where they\u2019re going to get their information is less TV, but really online,\u201d said Robert Blizzard, the Republican pollster who conducted the survey with a Democratic counterpart, Julie Hootkin.Television still plays a role in allowing candidates to introduce themselves to voters and \u201csetting the tone for the race,\u201d Mr. Blizzard said. But he said that an engaged online presence was increasingly the hallmark of persuadable voters.The study, commissioned by Google, surveyed 500 persuadable voters in New Hampshire, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania from Oct. 13 to Oct. 18.It found that 52 percent of those voters get their information from television, down eight percentage points since 2012. Some 73 percent of the voters own a smartphone, and 40 percent said they spend no time watching television at all during any particular week.\u201cIn terms of TV, the percentage of Americans who are cutting the cord is obviously growing by the day,\u201d Mr. Blizzard said.\u201cThe notion that campaigns are trying to reach these late deciders, and they\u2019re not getting their information from television, is significant,\u201d Ms. Hootkin said.Half of those voters surveyd have used the internet to fact-check things they have learned in the news media during the course of the campaign. Half have done the same to fact-check things that the candidates have said this cycle.Most telling was that 76 percent of the voters said they watched at least one of the presidential debates when they aired. But a third of those who watched were simultaneously engaged online, whether it was to check what was being said about the debate on Twitter or to see what fact checkers were saying about specific points.The takeaway for future campaigns is that candidates and their aides will need to increasingly tailor approaches to the internet for what were once staples of television.\u201cTelevision is not going to cut it alone,\u201d Mr. Blizzard said.Advertisement"}

Iger.As annual profit climbed from $3.4 billion in 2006 to an astounding $8.4 billion last year, Disney\u2019s share price shot up accordingly, from about $31 in 2006 to $122 in August 2015. But those high-flying days are starting to seem like a distant memory, at least on \u201cwhat have you done for me lately\u201d Wall Street.\u201cIt\u2019s been an incredibly frustrating stock,\u201d said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.So, where does this leave Mr. Iger? Awash in acquisition rumors.\u201cGiven Iger\u2019s interest in technology, Twitter\u2019s in-process repositioning as a mobile live video destination and Disney\u2019s need to shift its story away from the challenges facing ESPN, a Twitter acquisition has real strategic merits,\u201d Rich Greenfield, an analyst at the financial services firm BTIG, wrote in a blog post.Mr. Greenfield noted that Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, also sits on the Disney board: \u201cWe believe Dorsey wants to sell to a media company to power their over-the-top, mobile-video ambitions.\u201dAdding to the acquisition speculation is Mr. Iger\u2019s track record of going shopping about every three years \u2014 he\u2019s overdue by that measure \u2014 and his history of bold moves, Ms. Reif Cohen said.The problem: Unlike the reactions to deals with Pixar, Marvel or Lucasfilm \u2014 companies that were instantly lauded as perfect targets for Disney \u2014 any cheerleading for a Disney-Twitter tie-up was drowned out by sharply negative responses.\u201cTo buy Twitter would be the equivalent of throwing money out the door,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty for taking a look, but I\u2019d be shocked if Disney actually buys it.\u201d\u201cDisney needs to buy nothing,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Disney is incomplete at all.\u201dMr. Iger, who declined to comment for this article, does seem to have an itch to buy something.

A Ph.D. in math from Harvard, she\u2019s also worked as a Wall Street quant. Her knowledge of the power and risks of mathematical models, coupled with a gift for analogy, makes her one of the most valuable observers of the continuing weaponization of big data.Her central complaint is that of all the ways organizations use data, there is a pernicious subset \u2014 the W.M.D.s of the title \u2014 that are opaque, operate at enormous scale and can damage people\u2019s lives. Her first case study is the financial crisis of 2008, kicked off by mathematical models of mortgage payments that were precise, complex and disastrously wrong.Algorithms have these same effects in teacher evaluations, hiring practices, college admissions. Often, what an organization cares about \u2014 job performance, recidivism \u2014 can\u2019t be measured directly, so imperfect proxies are used. Credit scores, for example, stand in for employee worth.O\u2019Neil does offer some design principles for better algorithms, like adding feedback loops that adjust to past mistakes. But like many books that diagnose social risks, the section on solutions is weaker than the illustration of the problem. Understanding just how big the problem is, though, is critical, and O\u2019Neil does a masterly job explaining the pervasiveness and risks of the algorithms that regulate our lives.Milner offers an informative look at the Global Positioning System (GPS to you and me), describing its invention, its spread, and the effects of allowing anyone with a cheap device to find both location and route, anywhere on the planet.GPS is so obviously useful, and generally works so well, that it has gone from futuristic to boring in a historical eye blink. Milner wants to rescue GPS from its own commercial success; to marvel at the amazing work that went into creating it; and to inquire about its various implications, both good and bad.He approaches this topic first historically, then analytically. The book\u2019s first part discusses why wayfinding is hard, and how the American military came to operate a network of satellites to do just that, worldwide. But without a central figure or narrative to drive the history, this section ends up feeling diffuse.When Milner describes the practical effects of suddenly always knowing where you are, the book gains force. He covers an impressive array of uses, from criminal surveillance to beet farming. The discussion of \u201cDeath by GPS,\u201d where people blithely drive into terrible trouble because GPS says to, is gripping and horrifying. \u201cPinpoint\u201d excels when it makes clear that GPS is an engineering marvel, a global utility and a source of new threat all at once.In \u201cWasting Time on the Internet,\u201d Goldsmith denies that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing when that\u2019s clearly what we\u2019re doing. Goldsmith, who teaches at Penn and is MoMA\u2019s first poet laureate, emphasizes the connections and surprises inherent in seemingly aimless digital exploration.Goldsmith\u2019s premise is simple: \u201cOur devices might be changing us, but to say that they\u2019re dehumanizing us is simply wrong.\u201d Here Goldsmith relies most on personal observation. A man mocked for ignoring a stunning moonrise while texting his lover replies, \u201cI can see the moon anytime, but this is the only time I can be having this conversation.\u201d Goldsmith\u2019s \u00adsister-in-law takes away his nephew\u2019s phone, to make him experience real life, only to discover he can\u2019t make plans with friends, because she\u2019s taken away his phone.His other core theme is that just because the internet is unfamiliar, it is not on that account unprecedented. Goldsmith links contemporary work with past, blowing past the usual troika of McLuhan, Warhol and Borges to discuss C\u00e9zanne, Alberti and Dziga Vertov. Observations about information overload bring in Descartes as a witness. An analogy to the cloud of data we trail behind compares us to Pig-Pen. All of this is wonderful, if you like your connections eclectic and your narrative discursive. \u201cWasting Time on the Internet\u201d is as aleatory as a fall into the Wikipedia hole.Carr is the dean of technology skeptics, having risen to general public prominence with his 2008 essay \u201cIs Google Making Us Stupid?\u201d This is a new collection of pieces written over the last decade or so.

{"Headline": "Conundrum for Justices: Does a Design Patent Cover a Whole Smartphone?", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday seemed inclined to let Samsung have a fresh shot at arguing that it does not have to give up all of its profits for copying a part of the distinctive look of Apple\u2019s iPhone.\u201cIt seems to me that the design is applied to the exterior case of the phone,\u201d said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s not applied to all the chips and wires.\u201dIt followed, he said, that \u201cthere shouldn\u2019t be profits awarded based on the entire price of the phone.\u201dSeveral justices seemed to agree that the damages Samsung must pay may well be less than its total profits of about $400 million on several phones. They said the right award might be limited to profits attributable to the protected features, including the iPhone\u2019s rounded corners and grid of icons.But the justices seemed frustrated about how to articulate the right legal standard. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he did not know what jurors should be told in deciding how much companies that infringe design patents must pay.\u201cNeither side gives us an instruction to work with,\u201d he said.Justice Sonia Sotomayor echoed the point. \u201cHow do we announce the right test?\u201d she asked.Kathleen M. Sullivan, a lawyer for Samsung, said jurors could, for instance, hear expert testimony from accountants.Justice Kennedy responded that such evidence could not place a value on a \u201cstroke of genius\u201d like the design of the Volkswagen Beetle. That analogy came up throughout the argument, with some justices arguing that the car\u2019s design provided much of its value.Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. disagreed. \u201cI can\u2019t get over the thought that nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if it, you know, costs, I think, $1,800 when it was first sold in the United States? What if it cost $18,000? What if it got two miles per gallon? What if it broke down every 50 miles?\u201dJustice Stephen G. Breyer said jurors could be given examples. \u201cYou know, wallpaper, you get the whole thing,\u201d he said, referring to total profits. \u201cA Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don\u2019t get all the profit from the car.\u201dDesign patents are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court has not heard a design patent case in over a century.Ms. Sullivan, Samsung\u2019s lawyer, argued that design patents are poorly suited to complex devices with many features, adding that they can give rise to disproportionate penalties.\u201cA smartphone is smart,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work.\u201dDesign patents once covered household items like spoons and fireplace grates \u2014 whose design was central to the product \u2014 and a finding of infringement required the defendant to turn over all of its profits.The case before the Supreme Court is just one challenge faced by Samsung. The firm is killing its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after struggling to address reports that the device can overheat and catch fire because of a manufacturing flaw.The three design elements at issue in this case, Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, are, in Samsung\u2019s description, \u201ca particular black rectangular round-cornered front face\u201d; \u201ca substantially similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim\u201d; and \u201ca particular colorful grid of sixteen icons.\u201dThe court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that \u201can award of a defendant\u2019s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.\u201d But it added that \u201cthose are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.\u201d\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the court said.The design patent law says that infringers \u201cshall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit\u201d from the sale of \u201cany article of manufacture.\u201dAs the case reached the Supreme Court, the two sides and the Obama administration all focused on that last phrase, agreeing that the \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d at issue could be a component of the product rather than the entire product sold to consumers.\u201cThe parties, actually, and the government are fairly close,\u201d Justice Breyer remarked.But Ms. Sullivan said the appeals court had not allowed it to make its case on what was the \u201carticle of manufacture.\u201d Seth P. Waxman, a lawyer for Apple, responded that Samsung had litigated the case on the understanding that the entire phone was the relevant product and that it could not change its mind now.The justices did not seem inclined to adjudicate that last dispute. \u201cWe have a hard enough question trying to figure out what the standard is,\u201d Justice Breyer told Mr. Waxman. \u201cNow, why can\u2019t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your arguments and theirs, and work it out.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

But she and other officials noted the timing of its release as the university system is holding contract negotiations with the union.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised to see these kinds of things sort of planted, if you will, to affect the collective bargaining process,\u201d said George Kieffer, a university regent.Still, university officials have acknowledged that reports of hunger among parts of the campus population were troubling.A study out of Occidental College found that 45 percent of the university system\u2019s full-time clerical, administrative and support workers sometimes go hungry.Dr. Dreier strongly defended the U.C. study, calling the union\u2019s motives irrelevant to his team\u2019s findings.The Times reviewed a sample of the written accounts from the workers, which were kept anonymous. Even with wages that averaged a little under $23 an hour, well above the state minimum of $10, many said they skipped meals or visited food banks. One described eating mayonnaise packets. Many cited the soaring cost of housing around the campuses, in locations like Irvine, Santa Barbara and San Francisco.Joseph Meyer, 31, an administrative assistant at U.C. Berkeley, said in a follow-up phone interview that after squaring away his $1,150 in rent, he often chooses between eating meals and paying for his asthma medication. \u201cIt\u2019s just a struggle,\u201d he said.Both the university and union officials acknowledged that California\u2019s housing crisis is making life hard for workers across the public and private sectors.But that\u2019s no excuse, said Jason Rabinowitz, the secretary-treasurer of the clerical workers union.\u201cWe say that a great public institution should be leading on this question,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should part of the solution and not part of the problem.\u201dIn 1978, California voters passed Proposition 13, a ballot box revolt that lowered property taxes for millions of the state\u2019s homeowners.Decades later, what have been its consequences?California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

{"Headline": "Samsung Halts Galaxy Note 7 Production as Battery Problems Linger", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byIn 1995, furious over quality problems with one of his company\u2019s mobile phones, Lee Kun-hee, the chairman of Samsung and arguably the most famous businessman in South Korea, set a pile of 150,000 defective phones on fire outside a factory.The phone bonfire became a turning point for Samsung\u2019s two-decade rise from an electronics maker associated with inexpensive knockoffs to one considered a leader in product quality, design and sales. But to the company\u2019s critics, that employee motivational moment has also served as a wry historical foreshadowing of safety problems with one of Samsung\u2019s top-selling smartphones.The company has temporarily halted production of its Galaxy Note 7, a high-end answer to the latest iPhones from Apple, a person familiar with the decision said on Monday. In a statement, the company also asked retailers and telecommunication carriers to stop selling the phones until the problem is fixed, and said \u201cconsumers with either an original Galaxy Note 7 or replacement Galaxy Note 7 device should power down and stop using the device.\u201dThree of Australia\u2019s biggest telecom companies \u2014 Telstra, Optus and Vodafone Australia \u2014 said they had stopped shipping Galaxy Note 7 phones to customers after reports that the replacement model had caught fire in the United States.The company said it hoped to provide an update within a month. The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission praised Samsung\u2019s move and urged consumers to stop using the phone.The missteps by Samsung, the world\u2019s top seller of smartphones, have given a rare opportunity to competitors like Apple to close the gap with the South Korean giant as the holiday shopping season approaches.\u201cWe believe this incident has destroyed billions of dollars of Samsung brand value,\u201d said Laura Martin, a technology analyst with Needham & Company. \u201cThe consumer says, \u2018Which one blows up? I\u2019m just going to stay away from Samsung.\u2019\u201dThe Galaxy Note 7 featured a higher-capacity battery to help its increasingly sophisticated features, like an iris scanner for added security. It also supported fast wireless charging technologies. It was the most expensive phone offered by Samsung, putting it in direct competition with Apple\u2019s iPhone.\u201cDefinitely, Apple is the biggest beneficiary\u201d of Samsung\u2019s problems, said Linda Sui, a director at research firm Strategy Analytics.What\u2019s more, Google, the company whose Android software runs on nearly all of Samsung\u2019s smartphones, is now pushing harder to sell its own phones. Last week, Google unveiled the Pixel \u2014 the first smartphone that it designed and manufactured. At the same time, aggressive smartphone manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi are looking for ways to expand beyond their footholds in China to compete with Samsung all over the world.It is difficult to say what the impact of the phone problems will be on the company\u2019s overall sales. Before the recall, the research firm Strategy Analytics had estimated that Samsung would sell 15 million Note 7 units in 2016. But now, the firm is estimating that Samsung, with about $180 billion in annual revenue, could lose more than $10 billion from the ongoing troubles.Samsung\u2019s reputation is already taking a big hit online, according to an analysis by Spredfast, a social media marketing firm that helps businesses analyze chatter on Twitter and other social networks.Since the Note 7\u2019s problems began to receive widespread attention, negative Twitter messages about the device rose 450 percent compared to the previous five and a half weeks, the company said.\u201cWhile this is itself a huge problem for Samsung, we also found a steep 186 percent rise in negative sentiment about Samsung itself,\u201d Chris Kerns, Spredfast\u2019s vice president of research and insights said in a statement. \u201cDigging deeper, it\u2019s clear that this is not just an isolated issue with one product, but is, in fact, a full-blown brand crisis.\u201dLike many Asian companies, Samsung struggled for years to establish a strong reputation in the West. Shortly after Apple introduced the iPhone, Samsung went headlong into the smartphone market.Samsung had been gaining some ground in high-end smartphones with its latest Galaxy S phones, which have curved edges and offer a premium feel over the company\u2019s budget phones. When it released the Galaxy Note 7 in August \u2014 with its 5.7-inch screen and a price tag exceeding $800 \u2014 it was supposed to add to that momentum.The recurring problem has led industry experts to wonder whether the problem went beyond sloppy production and resulted from a faulty battery or software design.Technology companies are hardly immune to manufacturing issues. In 1994, Intel was forced to recall its flagship Pentium chip because of a mathematical mistake built into it. Dell recalled more than 4 million laptop computers in 2006 because of exploding lithium ion batteries produced by Sony. And companies like Fitibit and Microsoft have had manufacturing problems over the years.Companies with strong brands can withstand product quality problems. Over a two-year span starting in 2009, Toyota recalled about 9 million cars because of issues related to sudden, unintended acceleration. Its chief executive appeared before Congress, and Toyota paid a $1.2 billion fine to the Justice Department for concealing information about defects from consumers and government officials. In 2015, Toyota was the world\u2019s largest automaker.Samsung is counting on customers like Justin Brooke of Cooper City, Fla., whose family owns three Note 7 phones as well as Samsung televisions and tablets, to stay loyal to the brand.Mr. Brooke said he thinks the fire risk has been overblown. He loves the Note 7\u2019s big screen and pen feature, which he uses to critique websites for his advertising training business, DMBI Online. \u201cFor me as a business owner, it\u2019s the most productive phone on the market,\u201d he said.Still, he admitted to some apprehension. He said his family never charges the batteries on their phones to 100 percent to reduce the risk of overheating. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re in denial,\u201d he said.He said his father asked him for a phone recommendation on Sunday night, and he recommended another Samsung model, the S7, which has not been implicated in the fires, or a Google Pixel phone.Daisuke Wakabayashi and Vindu Goel reported from San Francisco.

At the same time, Hollywood\u2019s two biggest remaining content conglomerates, the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, indicated that they would fight the deal in Washington.\u201cA transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny,\u201d Zenia Mucha, a Disney spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday.A Fox spokeswoman, Julie Henderson, released a similar statement on Monday: \u201cA deal of this size and scope, and the impact it will have on consumers, should receive the highest level of regulatory scrutiny.\u201dHere is a look at where the AT&T deal leaves other prominent media companies and what some analysts think they might consider in response:The Walt Disney Company, with a market capitalization of $150 billion, is too big to be bought by anyone other than a Google or an Apple. And Disney, which has a singular corporate culture in Hollywood, has made it clear that it sees itself as the predator and not the prey when it comes to technology related deal making.\u201cOne of the key capabilities that Disney lacks as of today is the ability to build a scaled, direct-to-consumer business for its television and studio properties with the associated back end technology expertise,\u201d Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a research note on Monday.The country\u2019s largest cable and broadband operator, Comcast also owns the NBC broadcast network, a bundle of cable television networks including Bravo, USA and MSNBC, film and TV studios and theme parks. What more could Comcast need?Acquiring a wireless company would be particularly pressing, the analysts said, if AT&T introduced a new streaming service bundled with wireless data.The Murdochs have ownership control, and nobody thinks they would be sellers \u2014 especially since Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sons, James and Lachlan, were given the chance to run the family media company only last year.But the family may have already shown its hand, several analysts and bankers said. Over the long term, Fox thinks it needs to get bigger. That thinking comes from Fox\u2019s unsuccessful $80 billion takeover bid for Time Warner in 2014. If Fox offered that much before, could it make an even bigger offer for Time Warner now? (Ms. Henderson, the Fox spokeswoman, shot down that possibility on Monday.)On the company\u2019s last conference call, James Murdoch, Fox\u2019s chief executive, answered a question about potential acquisitions by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re quite happy with where we are today.\u201d He added that the company would be \u201cvery careful with our capital.\u201d Fox\u2019s recent strategy has involved eschewing trendy takeover targets like Vice Media in favor of reinvesting in channels like National Geographic.The question is whether the AT&T deal changes that stance. Fox could swing into buying mode, tucking in MSG Networks, with holdings in sports television, or even Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns rights to the James Bond franchise.On Monday, some analysts and media executives said that they expected the AT&T-Time Warner deal to accelerate those considerations. The AT&T-Time Warner deal underscores the old industry adage that content is king, they said. The agreement also highlighted the need for entertainment companies to band together so that they would have more heft in negotiations with the larger and larger cable, satellite and wireless companies.But while such a deal may be crucial for the survival of Viacom, which has struggled mightily, the same may not be true for CBS, which is in more of a position of strength. Any CBS-Viacom deal requires winning over Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, who has expressed doubt over the corporate marriage. The latest development may well give Mr. Moonves more bargaining power.Advertisement"}

Or did she develop the idea over time, nurturing it like a seed, with great care and effort?Kristen Elmore, a developmental and social psychologist at Cornell University and lead author of the study, saw metaphors about ideas everywhere. She saw light bulbs on bulletin boards at schools and in student essays about inventions. Less frequently, young people were exposed to metaphors that describe nurturing ideas like seedlings.Dr. Elmore and her colleague, Myra Luna-Lucero, a researcher at Columbia Teachers College, set out to study whether these metaphors carry unexplored implications. In a series of three experiments, more than 700 adult men and women, mostly in their 30s, were exposed to a variety of male and female inventors whose ideas were described as emerging like light bulbs or nurtured seedlings.They found that people tend to rate discoveries that came about \u201clike a light bulb\u201d as more exceptional than those that are \u201cnurtured like seeds.\u201d But not when the inventor was a woman.

{"Headline": "The Price of Australia\u2019s Real Estate Boom", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 One hundred twenty-five years ago, the suburb of Balmain, which juts into Sydney Harbor, represented the aspirations of a young Australia: a society that wanted to be free of the class structure of its mother nation, Britain, with a safety net that would make it one of the most egalitarian countries on earth.Today, Balmain epitomizes the unexpected conclusion of that political and economic project: a nation where rampant property prices have made society appear richer while leaving it worse off.Australia is entering the third decade of a real estate boom that has altered the national psyche. Over the past 30 years, housing prices have risen 7.25 percent a year, leaving the country with some of the most expensive real estate in the world. In the third quarter of this year, real estate prices in major cities rose 11.2 percent on an annualized basis, dashing some experts\u2019 predictions that they were starting to taper.Not even in San Francisco, the most expensive metropolitan area in the United States, have prices grown so fast. Prices there have risen about 6.5 percent a year since 1986, and that\u2019s in a city at the center of the global tech industry.Deregulation of the financial markets in the 1980s and 1990s made credit more available, leading Australians to borrow more for housing, which drove up prices. The market has surged ever since; it even avoided a crash during the Great Recession. Good middle-class family houses in the most popular Sydney suburbs are hard to find for less than $1.5 million.In Sydney, the epicenter of the boom, few suburbs have changed as much as Balmain, where a group of trade unionists in 1891 agreed to form a political organization that was a forerunner to the Australian Labor Party.In the late 1890s, Balmain was home to the country\u2019s biggest industrial employer, a shipyard that built and refitted the boats that carried wool to the rest of the world. There was also a coal mine and a soap factory providing hundreds of jobs for the working class. The workers rented wooden cottages with corrugated-iron roofs and walked to their jobs. Social life was centered on the suburb\u2019s many pubs and churches.The rising property values of the last 30 years extinguished economic diversity in Balmain, which is now filled with Sydney\u2019s elite: lawyers, doctors and bankers who built or bought spectacular houses with views over one of the world\u2019s great harbors. The old power station may be converted into offices for Google.Fergus Fricke purchased a house in Balmain in 1974 for about $30,000, which was about twice his annual salary. It is now worth about $1.9 million, 31 times his annual pension.He\u2019s rich, but dispirited. Mr. Fricke\u2019s property wealth provides him with no extra emotional or material comfort. He would prefer to live in a more egalitarian community \u2014 the kind of society that once defined Australian identity. \u201cIt\u2019s a wealthy population,\u201d said Mr. Fricke, 75, a former engineering professor. \u201cA working-class person can\u2019t afford even the rents in Balmain.\u201dFeeling prosperous because of their unexpected jump in wealth, landowning Australians have become politically complacent. The great social movements centered on inequality \u2014 workers\u2019 rights, the place of women in society and the treatment of indigenous peoples \u2014 that influenced Australian politics in the 1970s and 1980s have faded.Australia\u2019s broad welfare system and high taxes ensure that those who don\u2019t own homes have decent medical care and access to state-run schools and colleges. Few homeless people are visible on the streets. Following and predicting interest rates have become the national pastime.Elderly women, who are more likely to rent because lower wages meant they couldn\u2019t save as much as men throughout their lives, were paying their landlords first and utilities second and buying food last. \u201cThey were eating slices of white bread with all they could find on the last few days before pension day,\u201d Mr. Phibbs said to me this month. \u201cThat\u2019s depressing in a rich society.\u201dYet Australia\u2019s establishment celebrates high house prices as a symbol of national prosperity and economic success. A Labor Party proposal during the general election this year for a modest trim in generous tax breaks for property investors was assailed by the governing center-right coalition.The policy gave Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull one of his most effective attacks of the campaign \u2014 a line that reached deep into the new Australian psyche. \u201cThe changes Labor is proposing will devalue every home in Australia,\u201d he said.The rich and powerful have benefited most from the property boom and tax breaks that elevate prices. That includes the prime minister, a former Goldman Sachs partner, and his wife, Lucy Turnbull, a former lord mayor of Sydney, who stand at the apex of Australia\u2019s property market.They\u2019ve chosen to live in their harborside mansion rather than move to the smaller official government residence in a slightly less exclusive suburb.A.

Created with the agency Droga5, the campaign includes three videos featuring Mr. Corden interviewing innovators in the restaurant, transportation and lodging fields. The series is called \u201cReserve What\u2019s Next.\u201dJPMorgan Chase introduced the credit card in August. Demand for the card \u2014 which has a $450 annual fee and offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus, as well as triple points for dining and travel purchases worldwide \u2014 was so great that Chase received tens of thousands of applications within the first few days.

They clearly like experiences more than stuff. They clearly want to make their own decisions about everything, including travel.

The third video will feature someone from the lodging industry.Ms. Lemkau said Mr. Corden was given \u201cgeneral guidelines\u201d for his conversations with the innovators. \u201cThe whole reason we chose him was because he would be hilariously entertaining unscripted,\u201d she said.All videos will carry the card\u2019s tagline: \u201cTravel\u2019s changing. Carry the only card designed to stay ahead.\u201dDan Coates, president of YPulse, a youth marketing research firm, said Chase was \u201cgetting a lot of things really right\u201d with the campaign.\u201cThe focus on experience is really important for millennials, post the Great Recession,\u201d Mr. Coates said. \u201cIn the \u201990s, conspicuous consumption via luxury products was acceptable, but with the rise of the Great Recession, millennials developed a case of affluence guilt. Showing off what you own has been replaced by sharing what you do, since sharing experiences is much more egalitarian.\u201dTravel in particular \u201cis the most attainable experience for millennials,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we ask them what they\u2019re saving money for, travel is at the top of their list every time.\u201dMr. Coates praised the documentary style of the new Chase campaign, noting that its behind-the-scenes approach appeals to millennials, who \u201clove to geek out over things, digging into the process behind the product.\u201dHe warned, however, that the card might encourage users to accelerate spending to earn more rewards, thus potentially increasing the debt load of a generation already struggling with student debt.For his part, Mr. Corden said he was thrilled to use the card.\u201cObviously, travel has just always been a huge part of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t come as a shock to tell you that eating has been a huge part of my life.

{"Headline": "Can Humans Go From Unintended Global Warming to Climate By Design?", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "In pondering the plausibility or desirability of such a tool, it might be useful to start with a thought experiment:So far, humanity\u2019s main climate intervention, through emissions of vast amounts of greenhouse gases, has been an unintended consequence of pursuing the most convenient energy choice \u2014 fossil fuels.With all of this in mind, it could be argued that the momentum driving global warming is simply speeding the journey toward an inevitable juncture when we\u00c2\u00a0will start\u00c2\u00a0engineering the climate.Welcome to the geoengineering\u00c2\u00a0debate.I have long supported investing in research on this possible response to global warming but questioned its real-world prospects. I still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine a scenario in which a single actor would initiate some sun-blocking initiative or, in contrast, a global consensus could be reached on its deployment (unless things get truly unhinged on the up side).Here\u2019s the tweet that started this discussion back in February:.@Revkin talks very long run with Pierrehumbert: https://t.co/5zPnQFijEd Does geoengineering change that picture? https://t.co/QBZgzGu6qKHere\u2019s the first part of Morton\u2019s provocation and a link to the rest:I agree with the authors that taking a view measured in millennia is an appropriate, and underappreciated, part of assessing the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and the need for climate action; I also agree with their conclusion (and starting point) that a zero-net-emissions human world is a desirable target. And it is inspiring to see such progress being made in the detail with which models of ice sheet dynamics and other forms of change can be applied to the moderately far future.But I have a problem with the way in which, while discussing some plausible\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aif far from inevitable\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aforms of technological change, the authors choose to ignore others. They repeatedly describe change on the timescales they are looking at as \u00e2\u0080\u009cirreversible\u00e2\u0080\u009d. There is a potent sense in which this is true: once a change has happened it cannot be made not to have happened; once they have risen, neither carbon-dioxide concentrations nor sea levels can be made not to have risen. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what most people mean by \u00e2\u0080\u009cirreversible\u00e2\u0080\u009d: the term normally means pretty straightforwardly \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reversed\u00e2\u0080\u009d. And at a couple of points in their paper the authors make it clear that that is indeed the sense in which they mean it.Specifically, they say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe implication is that, in the absence of efficient, large-scale capture and storage of airborne carbon (emphasis mine), carbon emissions that have already occurred or will occur in the near future result in a commitment to climate change that will be irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia and longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Which is to say: in the absence of technologies to reverse this, it is irreversible.Well yes. And in the absence of a reverse gear, a car is irreversible, too. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why cars have reverse gears.That may read as a flippant trivialization. But I think the authors of the Nature Climate Change paper trivialize the issue, too; they just do it more subtly, through neglect. The sentence I just quoted implies pretty strongly that, in the presence of efficient (or for that matter inefficient) large-scale capture and storage of airborne carbon, carbon emissions that have already occurred or will occur in the near future might not result in a commitment to climate change that is irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia and longer. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite an important statement. But it receives almost no follow-up at all in the subsequent six pages. A paper that makes use of the concept of the Anthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aa concept predicated on the idea that human activity is a dominant factor in the state of the earth system\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008adoes not spend any time at all looking at what humans might try to do, or be able to do, about the problems it discusses over the periods it imagines.I know that there are not yet any negative emissions technologies up to the task. But the possibility of such things is under active discussion. Indeed negative emissions are already being incorporated into the sort of integrated assessment models that inform discussion like those of COP 21 in Paris. Those scenarios typically demonstrate a lack of specificity about the costs and potentially enormous impacts of such technologies, which makes their ready and convenient acceptance of a currently hypothetical capability disturbing. But to ignore the potential capability completely does not redress that problem.\u00a0FollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snap Is Said to Pick Bankers for an I.P.O.", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The newest generation of technology darlings has signaled that it is about to come of age: Snapchat, the messaging service beloved by teenagers, is preparing to step out into the public markets.The company \u2014 born only five years ago \u2014 may end up ushering in a wave of huge tech initial public offerings at a time when Wall Street has seen few such big deals.Snapchat\u2019s parent, recently renamed Snap Inc., has hired the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, essentially firing a starting gun for a potential stock sale as soon as the first quarter of next year, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.Should Snap follow through on its plans, it would be the most prominent debut by the latest batch of \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 those private companies valued at more than $1 billion. Its class also includes Uber, the enormous ride-hailing service, and Airbnb, the home-rental start-up.Many of those companies are already awash in cash they have raised privately from mutual funds, venture capital firms and hedge funds, money that once needed to be raised on the public stock markets. But an initial offering would represent a new level of status and legitimacy, placing them on the same level as Google and Facebook.A wave of unicorns hitting the public markets would help end what has been one of the bleakest times for tech initial offerings \u2014 and I.P.O.s in general \u2014 in some time. No tech companies went public in the first three months of this year, a drought that had happened only three times since the early 1990s.Over all, just 84 companies have gone public so far this year in the United States, according to data from Renaissance Capital, down nearly 42 percent from last year.Among the problems that had bedeviled the market for new stocks was the ease with which tech companies like Uber have found cash from private investors, removing the need to go public anytime soon. The venture-backed companies that have gone public over the last 12 months have largely been smaller, lesser-known names like the communications service Twilio or the business software maker Atlassian.And public market investors like mutual funds have pushed back against the prices that start-ups have demanded, often leading to fewer of the sky-high stock debuts that Twitter and others enjoyed.But as the markets have stabilized, start-ups and their backers have again resumed discussions about splashy market debuts.\u201cIn the last three months, a number of companies have started saying that it\u2019s not all bad to be public,\u201d Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a mature company with more than $50 million in revenue, an I.P.O. is very much on your mind now.\u201dThe prospect of a huge offering has had banks racing to seize a piece of it for some time. Beyond Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, Snap has also engaged a bevy of other banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Company, Barclays and Credit Suisse \u2014 to help manage its stock sale, one of the people briefed on the matter added.At the heart of the frenzy is Snap, born in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011. The company is known for its mobile storytelling and messaging app, which lets users watch videos and send photos and messages to friends. The company also makes sunglasses called Spectacles that are equipped with a video camera.Currently, Snap would be able to file its public offering documents confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission because the company now generates less than $1 billion in annual revenue.The company may ultimately decide not to file for an offering. Yet Snap may be in a better position to go public before some other highly valued private companies because it has comparatively few regulatory concerns that would be listed as risk factors in a prospectus.Uber and Airbnb, for example, are fighting legal battles in numerous cities around the country and the world. Even though all of these battles will most likely be resolved, a long list of outstanding litigation and regulatory uncertainties could create an additional hurdle for investors.And unlike those two companies, Snap isn\u2019t based in Silicon Valley itself but in Venice, Calif., spearheading a nascent tech community in the Los Angeles area.Snap\u2019s app Snapchat was an early hit with young users who liked the fact that their messages and photos disappeared. The company was criticized for making it easier to send inappropriate photos with fewer consequences. Yet the ephemeral nature of the platform also made it seem like a more authentic way of communicating. Snapchat was an online facsimile of a casual conversation while platforms like Facebook and Instagram were the equivalent of a permanent record.Snap eventually added in tools that let users tell stories about their days and augment their selfies with stickers and masks, which the company calls filters and lenses. It also introduced channels for professionally created content from media companies like CNN and Cosmopolitan magazine.As users continued to flock to the app, a year ago Snap began to monetize its growing audience by allowing advertisers to sponsor filters and lenses and run video ads between stories produced by media companies or made up of user photos and videos.Advertisers have been keen to reach the Snapchat app\u2019s audience, which now includes 41 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 and 150 million daily users. At the moment, Snapchat is the trendiest, newest thing and advertisers want to be associated with it, Chad Stoller, executive vice president and global innovation director of IPG Mediabrands, said in an earlier interview.Snap has continued to build out content on Snapchat, the app has increasingly drawn comparisons to traditional television and is seen as an internet company that could someday draw ad dollars away from TV.This year, Snapchat is expected to generate nearly $367 million in ad revenue worldwide, according to data from the research firm eMarketer; and that figure is expected to rise to nearly $1 billion next year.For now, nearly all of Snapchat\u2019s revenue comes from the United States, according to eMarketer, but other markets should account for about a quarter of Snap\u2019s revenue by 2018.Yet for all of the service\u2019s phenomenal growth, Snapchat\u2019s parent must still demonstrate to potentially skittish stock market investors that it has a path to profitability if its offering is to soar, analysts say.\u201cInvestors aren\u2019t willing to buy growth at all costs,\u201d Kathleen Smith, a co-founder of Renaissance Capital, said.Advertisement"}

And it may take a long time to go away.With all these complaints, only Apple seems ensnared in a traditional argument with regulators.

But that\u2019s probably not why the regulators are preoccupied with Americans.It\u2019s the nature of big online businesses to seek as much data as possible, and often engage with consumers in such a way that the users share a lot about themselves in the name of fun (Facebook) and professional advantage (LinkedIn).Creating effective methods for searching for information, for using smartphones or for building applications seems to enable companies to acquire dominance more rapidly than ever. Some of that may be because of noncompetitive behavior, but it is also because of the strong network effects that benefit these companies. It\u2019s cheap and easy to distribute software online, and if people love your product, they will share and publicize it for you.Software developers using these applications may choose among other cloud providers, but having so many popular tools in A.W.S. gives it an edge; it is also known and trusted.It\u2019s a strong model.

No, not the election: What to wear for Halloween.Some cities have banned or strongly discouraged clown outfits, while costume sellers have faced protests from Native Americans, Muslim Americans and other groups about anything that mimics traditional ethnic or religious dress.The fall ritual of dress-up has particularly haunted American universities, where past problems have led to annual warnings about costume choices.A recent visit to an Upper West Side outpost of Ricky\u2019s, the costume superstore chain in New York City, was like taking a field trip through the cultural markers of our unsettled times.The storefront window was festooned with the sign \u201cMaking Halloween Great Again!\u201d Inside were heaps of rubbery Donald J.

He recalled people who dressed as priests and altar boys during the height of the Catholic Church\u2019s abuse scandals.\u201cThe whole idea of pushing boundaries or crossing lines is that there always is a line, but different people will cross it at different places,\u201d he said.Campuses tend to be at the forefront of Halloween controversies.

{"Headline": "The Pentagon\u2019s \u2018Terminator Conundrum\u2019: Robots That Could Kill on Their Own", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "The United States has put artificial intelligence at the center of its defense strategy, with weapons that can identify targets and make decisions.Supported byCAMP EDWARDS, Mass. \u2014 The small drone, with its six whirring rotors, swept past the replica of a Middle Eastern village and closed in on a mosque-like structure, its camera scanning for targets.No humans were remotely piloting the drone, which was nothing more than a machine that could be bought on Amazon. But armed with advanced artificial intelligence software, it had been transformed into a robot that could find and identify the half-dozen men carrying replicas of AK-47s around the village and pretending to be insurgents.As the drone descended slightly, a purple rectangle flickered on a video feed that was being relayed to engineers monitoring the test. The drone had locked onto a man obscured in the shadows, a display of hunting prowess that offered an eerie preview of how the Pentagon plans to transform warfare.Almost unnoticed outside defense circles, the Pentagon has put artificial intelligence at the center of its strategy to maintain the United States\u2019 position as the world\u2019s dominant military power. It is spending billions of dollars to develop what it calls autonomous and semiautonomous weapons and to build an arsenal stocked with the kind of weaponry that until now has existed only in Hollywood movies and science fiction, raising alarm among scientists and activists concerned by the implications of a robot arms race.\u201cIf Stanley Kubrick directed \u2018Dr. Strangelove\u2019 again, it would be about the issue of autonomous weapons,\u201d said Michael Schrage, a research fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management.Defense officials say the weapons are needed for the United States to maintain its military edge over China, Russia and other rivals, who are also pouring money into similar research (as are allies, such as Britain and Israel). The Pentagon\u2019s latest budget outlined $18 billion to be spent over three years on technologies that included those needed for autonomous weapons.\u201cChina and Russia are developing battle networks that are as good as our own. They can see as far as ours can see; they can throw guided munitions as far as we can,\u201d said Robert O. Work, the deputy defense secretary, who has been a driving force for the development of autonomous weapons. \u201cWhat we want to do is just make sure that we would be able to win as quickly as we have been able to do in the past.\u201dJust as the Industrial Revolution spurred the creation of powerful and destructive machines like airplanes and tanks that diminished the role of individual soldiers, artificial intelligence technology is enabling the Pentagon to reorder the places of man and machine on the battlefield the same way it is transforming ordinary life with computers that can see, hear and speak and cars that can drive themselves.The new weapons would offer speed and precision unmatched by any human while reducing the number \u2014 and cost \u2014 of soldiers and pilots exposed to potential death and dismemberment in battle. The challenge for the Pentagon is to ensure that the weapons are reliable partners for humans and not potential threats to them.At the core of the strategic shift envisioned by the Pentagon is a concept that officials call centaur warfighting. Named for the half-man and half-horse in Greek mythology, the strategy emphasizes human control and autonomous weapons as ways to augment and magnify the creativity and problem-solving skills of soldiers, pilots and sailors, not replace them.The weapons, in the Pentagon\u2019s vision, would be less like the Terminator and more like the comic-book superhero Iron Man, Mr. Work said in an interview.\u201cThere\u2019s so much fear out there about killer robots and Skynet,\u201d the murderous artificial intelligence network of the \u201cTerminator\u201d movies, Mr. Work said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we envision it at all.\u201dWhen it comes to decisions over life and death, \u201cthere will always be a man in the loop,\u201d he said.\u201cAutonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow,\u201d the letter said.The debate within the military is no longer about whether to build autonomous weapons but how much independence to give them. Gen. Paul J. Selva of the Air Force, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said recently that the United States was about a decade away from having the technology to build a fully independent robot that could decide on its own whom and when to kill, though it had no intention of building one.Other countries were not far behind, and it was very likely that someone would eventually try to unleash \u201csomething like a Terminator,\u201d General Selva said, invoking what seems to be a common reference in any discussion on autonomous weapons.Yet American officials are only just beginning to contend with the implications of weapons that could someday operate independently, beyond the control of their developers. Inside the Pentagon, the quandary is known as the Terminator conundrum, and there is no consensus about whether the United States should seek international treaties to try to ban the creation of those weapons, or build its own to match those its enemies might create.For now, though, the current state of the art is decidedly less frightening. Exhibit A: the small, unarmed drone tested this summer on Cape Cod.It could not turn itself on and just fly off. It had to be told by humans where to go and what to look for. But once aloft, it decided on its own how to execute its orders.The software powering the drone has been in development for about a year, and it was far from flawless during the day of trials. In one pass over the mosque, the drone struggled to decide whether a minaret was an architectural feature or an armed man, living up to its namesake, Bender, the bumbling robot in the animated television series \u201cFuturama.\u201dAt other moments, though, the drone showed a spooky ability to discern soldier from civilian, and to fluidly shift course and move in on objects it could not quickly identify.The project is run by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as Darpa, which is developing the software needed for machines that could work with small units of soldiers or Marines as scouts or in other roles.Unlike the drones currently used by the military, all of which require someone at a remote control, \u201cthis one doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Maj. Christopher Orlowski of the Army, a program manager at Darpa. \u201cIt works with you. It\u2019s like having another head in the fight.\u201dIt could also easily be armed. The tricky part is developing machines whose behavior is predictable enough that they can be safely deployed, yet flexible enough that they can handle fluid situations. Once that is mastered, telling it whom or what to shoot is easy; weapons programmed to hit only certain kinds of targets already exist.Yet the behavioral technology, if successfully developed, is unlikely to remain solely in American hands. Technologies developed at Darpa do not typically remain secret, and many are now ubiquitous, powering everything from self-driving cars to the internet.Since the 1950s, United States military strategy has been based on overwhelming technological advantages. A superior nuclear arsenal provided the American edge in the early days of the Cold War, and guided munitions \u2014 the so-called smart bombs of the late 20th century \u2014 did the same in the conflict\u2019s final decade.Those advantages have now evaporated, and of all the new technologies that have emerged in recent decades, such as genomics or miniaturization, \u201cthe one thing that has the widest application to the widest number of D.O.D. missions is artificial intelligence and autonomy,\u201d Mr. Work said.Today\u2019s software has its limits, though. Computers spot patterns far faster than any human can. But the ability to handle uncertainty and unpredictability remain uniquely human virtues, for now.Bringing the two complementary skill sets together is the Pentagon\u2019s goal with centaur warfighting.Mr. Work, 63, first proposed the concept when he led a Washington think tank, the Center for a New American Security. His inspiration, he said, was not found in typical sources of military strategy \u2014 Sun Tzu or Clausewitz, for instance \u2014 but in the work of Tyler Cowen, a blogger and economist at George Mason University.In his 2013 book, \u201cAverage Is Over,\u201d Mr. Cowen briefly mentioned how two average human chess players, working with three regular computers, were able to beat both human chess champions and chess-playing supercomputers.It was a revelation for Mr. Work. You could \u201cuse the tactical ingenuity of the computer to improve the strategic ingenuity of the human,\u201d he said.Mr. Work believes a lesson learned in chess can be applied to the battlefield, and he envisions a military supercharged by artificial intelligence. Brilliant computers would transform ordinary commanders into master tacticians. American soldiers would effectively become superhuman, fighting alongside \u2014 or even inside \u2014 robots.Of the $18 billion the Pentagon is spending on new technologies, $3 billion has been set aside specifically for \u201chuman-machine combat teaming\u201d over the next five years. It is a relatively small sum by Pentagon standards \u2014 its annual budget is more than $500 billion \u2014 but still a significant bet on technologies and a strategic concept that have yet to be proved in battle.At the same time, Pentagon officials say that the United States is unlikely to gain an absolute technological advantage over its competitors.\u201cA lot of the A.I. and autonomy is happening in the commercial world, so all sorts of competitors are going to be able to use it in ways that surprise us,\u201d Mr. Work said.The American advantage, he said, will ultimately come from a mix of technological prowess and the critical thinking and decision-making powers that the United States military prioritizes. The American military delegates significant decisions down its chain of command, in contrast to the more centralized Chinese and Russian armed forces, though that is changing.\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that we have an advantage as we start the competition,\u201d Mr. Work said. \u201cBut how it goes over time, we\u2019re not going to make any assumptions.\u201dExperts outside the Pentagon are far less convinced that the United States will be able to maintain its dominance by using artificial intelligence. The defense industry no longer drives research the way it did during the Cold War, and the Pentagon does not have a monopoly on the cutting-edge machine-learning technologies coming from start-ups in Silicon Valley, and in Europe and Asia.Unlike the technologies and material needed for nuclear weapons or guided missiles, artificial intelligence as powerful as what the Pentagon seeks to harness is already deeply woven into everyday life. Military technology is often years behind what can be picked up at Best Buy.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, American defense contractors can be really cutting edge on some things and really behind the curve on others,\u201d said Maj. Brian Healy, 38, an F-35 pilot. The F-35, America\u2019s newest and most technologically advanced fighter jet, is equipped with a voice command system that is good for changing channels on the radio, and not much else.\u201cIt would be great to get Apple or Google on board with some of the software development,\u201d he added.Beyond the practical concerns, the pairing of increasingly capable automation with weapons has prompted an intensifying debate among legal scholars and ethicists. The questions are numerous, and the answers contentious: Can a machine be trusted with lethal force? Who is at fault if a robot attacks a hospital or a school? Is being killed by a machine a greater violation of human dignity than if the fatal blow is delivered by a human?A Pentagon directive says that autonomous weapons must employ \u201cappropriate levels of human judgment.\u201d Scientists and human rights experts say the standard is far too broad and have urged that such weapons be subject to \u201cmeaningful human control.\u201dBut would any standard hold up if the United States was faced with an adversary of near or equal might that was using fully autonomous weapons? Peter Singer, a specialist on the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, suggested there was an instructive parallel in the history of submarine warfare.Like autonomous weapons, submarines jumped from the pages of science fiction to reality. During World War I, Germany\u2019s use of submarines to sink civilian ships without first ensuring the safety of the crew and passengers was seen as barbaric. The practice quickly became known as unrestricted submarine warfare, and it helped draw the United States into the war.After the war, the United States helped negotiate an international treaty that sought to ban unrestricted submarine warfare.Then came the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. That day, it took just six hours for the United States military to disregard decades of legal and ethical norms and order unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan. American submarines went on to devastate Japan\u2019s civilian merchant fleet during World War II, in a campaign that was later acknowledged to be tantamount to a war crime.\u201cThe point is, what happens once submarines are no longer a new technology, and we\u2019re losing?\u201d Mr. Singer said. He added: \u201cThink about robots, things we say we wouldn\u2019t do now, in a different kind of war.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Brought Silicon Valley to Washington", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyThis October, the White House opened its doors to a few thousand people for South by South Lawn, a daylong event described as a \u201cfestival of ideas, art and action.\u201d Both the event and its name were a nod to South by Southwest, the annual technology-and-music festival held in Austin, Tex., where Barack and Michelle Obama showed up as surprise keynote speakers earlier this year. The story goes that they were so impressed by their experiences, they decided to host their own microrendition before leaving office. Attendees at the White House version \u2014 the types of people who describe themselves in Twitter bios as \u201ccreator\u201d or \u201cinnovator\u201d \u2014 were told to dress casually, in clothes suitable for a picnic. The D.J. Beverly Bond, of Black Girls Rock, blasted Public Enemy\u2019s anthem \u201cFight the Power\u201d and Parliament\u2019s \u201cFlash Light\u201d across the lawn, which was studded with coffee carts, Lego sculptures and virtual-reality stations. Enormous stages erected for the occasion housed a rotating cast of musical guests and speakers throughout the afternoon. As the sun began to set, volunteers handed out plaid blankets so people could stretch out on the ground.The event felt like the swan song of the first president who seemed to get it \u2014 \u201cit\u201d being the value of start-up culture. A friend in attendance that day told me that she thought Obama wanted us to feel \u201csome ownership, that tech doesn\u2019t have to be far away or out of our lives.\u201d He wants to leave behind a \u201cnation of makers,\u201d she said. Megan Rose Dickey, who covered the event for TechCrunch, wrote that it left her \u201coptimistic that maybe our country can change and learn to do the right thing.\u201dIn many ways, Obama is America\u2019s first truly digital president. His 2008 campaign relied heavily on social media to lift him out of obscurity. Those efforts were in part led by a founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who believed in the Illinois senator\u2019s campaign so much that he left the start-up to join Obama\u2019s strategy team. After he was elected, he created a trifecta of executive positions in his administration modeled on corporate best practices: chief technology officer, chief data scientist, chief performance officer. He sat for question-and-answer sessions on Reddit, released playlists of his favorite songs on Spotify and used Twitter frequently, even once making dad jokes with Bill Clinton. He stoked deep and meaningful connections with scores of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg.Obama routinely pushed policy that pleased the tech-savvy, including his successful effort to keep broadband suppliers from giving preferential treatment to bigger web companies over individuals. Even his tech-specific fumbles seem unlikely to mar his permanent record: The rocky debut of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace that cost more than $600 million to build and crashed almost immediately after it went live, was later brushed off as a technical difficulty. And his administration\u2019s pressure on Silicon Valley companies to aid its cybersecurity efforts hasn\u2019t seemed to dampen their enthusiasm for him. Obama used his ties to the tech sector to foster diplomacy: Last year, he took Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, with him to Cuba as an economic endorsement of the revolutionary powers of start-ups to change the world.South by South Lawn presented an image of America as a start-up and technology as a small-batch industry, full of dreamers and inventors. I was invited to moderate a panel, \u201cHow Do We Fix Real Problems With Technology?\u201d As much as I enjoyed our conversation, the premise felt flawed. \u201cFixing\u201d problems with technology often just creates more problems, largely because technology is never developed in a neutral way: It embodies the values and biases of the people who create it. Crime-predicting software, celebrated when it was introduced in police departments around the country, turned out to reinforce discriminatory policing. Facebook was recently accused of suppressing conservative news from its trending topics. (The company denied a bias, but announced plans to train employees to neutralize political, racial, gender and age biases that could influence what it shows its user base.) Several studies have found that Airbnb has worsened the housing crises in some cities where it operates. In January, a report from the World Bank declared that tech companies were widening income inequality and wealth disparities, not improving them.For better or for worse, the last eight years have been defined less by the rise of small tech companies than by the expansion of Big Tech. We\u2019ve seen the second Silicon Valley boom, with companies valued in the billions, including Facebook, Uber, Snapchat, Palantir and Dropbox. Established technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have expanded their reach and influence throughout the world. And while many countries have pushed back against that spread, our government has essentially left them alone. (In August, for instance, WhatsApp announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook, its parent company, and its suite of products \u2014 news that gave some Americans pause but caused German regulators to intervene on behalf on their citizens.)As Obama's presidency winds down, Silicon Valley and Washington seem to be getting closer. Just a few days after South by South Lawn, The Washington Post reported that Facebook was quietly talking to White House officials about rolling out a controversial app called Free Basics. On the surface, Free Basics sounds fantastic: It promises free mobile internet for those who can\u2019t afford expensive data plans. But only Facebook and Facebook-approved services would be available through the app, and the app can collect data on those who sign up, both to increase the company\u2019s user numbers and maintain the growth needed to impress shareholders. The same service sparked outrage when Facebook tried to introduce it in India last year; officials believed it would create an unfair marketplace and the potential for discriminatory practices. Fusion recently reported that Twitter, Facebook and Instagram gave a company called Geofeedia access to information that helped law-enforcement agencies monitor and target minority activists. The close ties between our government and tech companies have led to changes that Farhad Manjoo, the New York Times technology columnist, told me \u201cwill have big effects for a long time, and we\u2019ll say they started under Obama.\u201dNone of this was mentioned at South by South Lawn. Instead, speakers heralded the power of the tech community. John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights leader, gave a rousing talk that implored listeners to \u201cget in trouble. Good trouble. Get in the way and make some noise.\u201d Clay Dumas, chief of staff for the Office of Digital Strategy at the White House, told me in an email that the event could be considered part of a legacy to inspire social change and activism through technology. \u201cIn his final months in office,\u201d he wrote, \u201cPresident Obama wants to empower the generation of people that helped launch his candidacy and whose efforts carried him into office.\u201dI left the event as the gorgeous afternoon unfurled into a balmy evening, still unsure what to make of it. But a few days later, during a speech at Carnegie Mellon, Obama seemed to reckon with his feelings about the potential \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the tech world. The White House can\u2019t be as freewheeling as a start-up, he said, because \u201cby definition, democracy is messy. And part of government\u2019s job is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with.\u201d But he added that he didn\u2019t want people to become \u201cdiscouraged and say, \u2018I\u2019m just not going to deal with government.\u2019\u2009\u201d Obama was the first American president to see technology as an engine to improve lives and accelerate society more quickly than any government body could. That lesson was apparent on the lawn. While I still don\u2019t believe that technology is a panacea for society\u2019s problems, I will always appreciate the first president who tried to bring what's best about Silicon Valley to Washington, even if some of the bad came with it.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Driving Truck\u2019s First Mission: A 120-Mile Beer Run", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The futurists of Silicon Valley may not have seen this one coming: The first commercial delivery made by a self-driving truck was 2,000 cases of Budweiser beer.In recent years, Uber has predicted a future in which you can ride in a self-driving car that will take you where you want to go, no driver necessary. But the idea that commercial trucking could be done by robot is a relatively new idea \u2014 and a potentially controversial one, given the possibility that robots could one day replace human drivers.\u201cWe think this technology is inching closer to commercial availability,\u201d Lior Ron, co-founder of Otto, said in an interview.In August, Uber acquired Otto, a San Francisco start-up run by a number of veterans of Google\u2019s long-running autonomous vehicle research.Though largely symbolic, the beer delivery marks the first commercial partnership for Otto, which was founded less than a year ago. Terms of the deal between Otto and Anheuser-Busch InBev, which owns the Budweiser brand, were not disclosed.\u201cWe\u2019ve tested with trailers, of course, but there\u2019s nothing like actually doing the real thing, end to end,\u201d Mr. Ron said.The delivery was indicative of Uber\u2019s larger ambitions to become an enormous transportation network, one in which the company is responsible for moving anything, like people, hot meals or cases of beer, around the globe, at all hours and as efficiently as possible. Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has said he envisions a future in which transportation will occur in different ways, using both manned and unmanned vehicles.A good part of that total came from top brands that rely heavily on the trucking industry to transport their goods. Anheuser-Busch, for example, delivers more than a million truckloads of beer domestically every year.\u201cWe view self-driving trucks as the future, and we want to be a part of that,\u201d said James Sembrot, senior director of logistics strategy at Anheuser-Busch. Though the delivery went smoothly, the two companies did not indicate whether there would be any further deals.For this initial delivery, Otto\u2019s truck departed Anheuser-Busch\u2019s facility in Loveland, Colo., in the early morning before reaching the interstate in Fort Collins. The truck drove through Denver \u2014 alongside regular passenger car traffic \u2014 and navigated to its destination in Colorado Springs without incident.Otto said a trained driver was in the cabin of the truck at all times to monitor the vehicle\u2019s progress and take over if necessary. At no point was the driver required to intervene, the company said.Future expansion of the pilot program will allow Otto to test for more types of road and weather conditions, a major factor in autonomous vehicle route plotting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: A Shift in the Child Sex Trafficking Trade", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Welcome to California Today.Is there such a thing as a child prostitute?Campaigners have for years tried to erase the phrase from the law, arguing that if a juvenile cannot legally consent to sex with an adult, neither can she willingly sell her body.She is a victim of rape, they say, not a prostitute.Last week, the movement won perhaps its biggest victory as Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that bans law enforcement from arresting minors involved in the sex trade, except when their safety may be at risk.Instead, they will be treated as victims, and directed toward social services.The governor also signed a law that allows adult victims to have charges against them dropped if they can show they were coerced into selling sex.Together, the measures represent a shift in prosecutions away from children and young women and toward the pimps and criminal enterprises running the industry.The police and outreach groups say sex trafficking in California has grown rapidly in recent years \u2014 concentrated mostly in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco \u2014 as websites like Backpage and Craigslist have made transactions simpler than ever.\u201cBut the reality of street prostitution today is that minors and young women are being sexually exploited out of some type of duress, fear or some type of coercion,\u201d she said.Ms. Biddle, of Saving Innocence, cited a case in North Hollywood that involved a girl, 13, who was caught with a 47-year-old man. She was handcuffed and charged with prostitution; he got a citation, Ms. Biddle said.\u201cNow, we\u2019re able to view these children correctly under the law,\u201d she added, \u201cas victims.\u201dAfter 67 seasons behind the microphone, Mr. Scully signed off by telling the fans, \u201cI have said enough for a lifetime, and for the last time, I wish you all a very pleasant good afternoon.\u201dAs Scully heads into retirement, admirers in recent days and weeks have offered tributes to his legacy.Check out a short selection.For the people of Los Angeles, he is not merely the announcer of baseball games, he is the soundtrack of our lives, the dignified and graceful accompaniment of endless sandy summers, a daily harmonic reminder of the Southern California dream.Although he uses language fluently and precisely, he is not a poet.

{"Headline": "Review: David Salle\u2019s \u2018How to See,\u2019 a Painter\u2019s Guide to Looking at and Discussing Art", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byBooks of The TimesThe painter David Salle, in his new book \u201cHow to See: Looking, Talking and Thinking About Art,\u201d goes bravely in search of happiness, too. His quarry is aesthetic bliss. He stalks it through museums and galleries on both coasts as if he were David Attenborough tracking a curious swan.Mr. Salle\u2019s mission in \u201cHow to See\u201d is to seize art back from the sort of critics who treat each painting \u201cas a position paper, with the artist cast as a kind of philosopher manqu\u00e9.\u201d Mr. Salle is more interested in talking about nuts and bolts, about what makes contemporary paintings tick.\u201cTheory abounds, but concrete visual perception is at a low ebb,\u201d he maintains. \u201cIn my view, intentionality is not just overrated; it puts the cart so far out in front that the horse, sensing futility, gives up and lies down in the street.\u201d Nobody ever loved a painting, he says, for its ideas.Mr. Salle gets no points for originality of insight. About every art form there are those who\u2019ve memorably argued for shaking off critical yokes. (\u201cRead at whim! Read at whim!\u201d the poet Randall Jarrell used to thunder.) The committed gallerygoer long ago learned to sift through competing opinions and seek delight where he or she could find it.But \u201cHow to See\u201d is lovely to read, mostly, because Mr. Salle can actually write. In the mid-1970s, when he first arrived in Manhattan, he sold art criticism to various publications to pay the rent. He has good feelers and a sensitive, sunny style.He sends you racing to the internet to look up the work of painters he speaks so engagingly about. You will use Google because the small art reproductions in this book are in black and white; they\u2019re murky and unsatisfying.He slowly builds a case for her work, noting among other things her singular subject matter. \u201cPaintings of people sneezing, yawning, being poked in the eye, shaving their pubic hair, or vomiting \u2014 as far as I know, none of these has been the subject of a painting before.\u201dMr. Salle also happens to be enormously, and unpredictably, literate. He\u2019s as likely to quote the humor writer Veronica Geng as the choreographer George Balanchine, and as likely to drop a reference to \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d as to the French filmmaker Claude Chabrol. He\u2019s a witty writer who appreciates the wit of others.His range of reading takes you places other art writers have not. Speaking about today\u2019s young fiction writers, for example, he notes how \u201cthe parodists, inventors, miniaturists, and tinkerers are now coming into prominence, taking over from the arid metafictionists.\u201dThat\u2019s as useful a critical observation as I have read this year.Many of the essays in \u201cHow to See\u201d appeared originally in Town & Country, Artforum, The Paris Review and other publications. Mr. Salle is open about how he frequently writes about his friends and collaborators.

At other times you wish for a bit more bite in his observations, bite he is rarely willing to deliver about his companions. You wish he were more in touch with his inner troglodyte.This book has other small defects. He goes to the well too often for references to the same things. The movie critic Manny Farber\u2019s notion of \u201ctermite art\u201d is cited, for example, in four separate essays.He doesn\u2019t often argue out his opinions, and once in a while his critical discourse veers close to meaninglessness. When he speaks of how the sculptor Vito Acconci wishes to \u201cinterrogate the broader culture\u201d in his work \u2014 as hoary an art-criticism clich\u00e9 as exists \u2014 you may begin to interrogate your GPS device for a road out of here.But he grounds that same essay not just in canny observations about Mr. Acconci\u2019s work but in a story about how, as a student in 1974, he helped Mr. Acconci make a video.For the video, Mr. Acconci tied a string around his penis. About his own participation, Mr. Salle writes, \u201cI would yank the string on cue, giving the impression that the penis was a kind of Beckettian character in an absurdist drama; it would jerk itself upright to deliver a line or two before collapsing back again just out of frame.\u201dAbout Mr. Acconci\u2019s talking member, he says, \u201cIt had a lot of grievances to air.\u201dMr. Salle\u2019s writing in \u201cHow to See\u201d puts me in mind of Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s poems.

He noticed sunlight on his friend\u2019s face and had a brainstorm: Had anyone ever taken head shots in the back of a truck before?

McAtee II, said in an interview. \u201cOur job is informing consumers what a good development this is for them.\u201dBut navigating this transaction will be a test of just how much influence AT&T has in Washington these days, especially as it tries to persuade antitrust officials at the United States Department of Justice, who will be crucial in approving the deal. The task may be particularly tricky as AT&T\u2019s lobbying team undergoes a transition after losing its longtime leader, James W. Cicconi, a former aide to President George H. W. Bush.Issues that led to the collapse of those deals seem even more prevalent now, as the nation closes out a presidential campaign that has featured candidates from both parties \u2014 most notably Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders \u2014 promising to challenge corporate power.The alarms over AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner stem from mounting frustration over high prices and the lack of competition in the telecom industry, with most Americans limited to one or two providers of broadband services. Regulators are set to focus on AT&T\u2019s powerful control over broadband and television customers since it is the nation\u2019s second-largest wireless company, after Verizon, and biggest paid television provider since its recent acquisition of DirecTV.Time Warner\u2019s marquee content from its HBO and CNN channels and movies from Warner Bros. will lead regulators to also scrutinize whether the creation of a multi-tentacled juggernaut could suppress competition in the technology, media and telecommunications industries. One way the combined company might do that, for example, is by offering unlimited streaming of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to its wireless customers or making it harder for competing streaming video services and television programs to reach AT&T subscribers.Lawmakers have already vowed a tough review of the deal, regardless of the lobbying full-court press they know will be playing out on Capitol Hill.\u201cWe are seeing increasing consolidation, especially scary consolidation, between the content side of the media and the internet provider side,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.The panel could hold a hearing on the proposal \u2014 with sworn testimony from AT&T executives \u2014 as soon as next month. \u201cWe have a duty to examine this deal,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.The merger sets up a monthslong battle in Washington with consumer advocates, smaller telecom and cable companies, and some tech companies preparing their own assault against the deal.\u201cThe American people want more competition, not less,\u201d said Chip Pickering, chief executive of Incompas, a lobbying group that represents internet companies including Netflix and Google. \u201cMegamergers are leaving them with higher prices and less choice.\u201dInstead, Mr. Ben-Zvi said, AT&T needs to be more specific and authentic to be more effective. The company must confront head-on any questions about the impact its deal would have on its competitors, for example, and make sure regulators and lawmakers understand that, with such rapid change in the tech sector, it has no choice but to pursue a deal like this.\u201cIncumbent telecommunications companies like AT&T are deeply threatened by the emergence of Silicon Valley giants that are poised to take over this space,\u201d said Mr. Ben-Zvi, who is not working on the AT&T-Time Warner deal. \u201cCompanies like Amazon, Google, Netflix \u2014 those are now some of AT&T\u2019s rivals, not just companies like Verizon.\u201dAT&T would not discuss details of its lobbying strategy, including whether it would employ tactics similar to those in previous mergers. \u201cWe are early in the process,\u201d Mr. McAtee, the AT&T general counsel, said.Mr. McAtee will help lead AT&T\u2019s merger efforts in Washington, along with Robert W. Quinn Jr., a policy insider in charge of lobbying who has been at the company for three decades.Both are new to being in charge. AT&T\u2019s storied lobbying operations were long led by Mr. Cicconi, who retired last month. Mr. Cicconi in the past worked closely with Wayne Watts, who served for decades at AT&T, including as general counsel, and retired last year.Together, Mr. Cicconi and Mr. Watts shepherded more than a half-dozen blockbuster mergers in the last two decades.The company is offering some clues about how it will position the deal. Unlike a \u201chorizontal\u201d merger, which unites competing companies in the same line of business, this transaction would not reduce the number of options for consumers, AT&T executives have said.AT&T also said it would not withhold Time Warner shows from competitors. It plans to create an advertising-based video business for mobile devices, similar to the ad business of the web giants Google and Facebook.The biggest advantage AT&T may have is the likelihood that the deal may face little scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, the regulatory agency that typically gets involved if there are transfers of telecom or broadcast licenses. If Time Warner divests the one Atlanta broadcast station it owns, that would make the F.C.C.\u2019s jurisdiction moot. The merger would be reviewed under a new administration, potentially with new antitrust officials picked by the next president.Even so, it will not be easy. Michael J. Copps, a Democrat and former commissioner for the F.C.C., said that he was preparing, with consumer groups, to battle an AT&T lobbying surge.AT&T \u201chas a huge lobbying budget and the sharpest lawyers money can buy to get this deal approved,\u201d Mr. Copps said.Advertisement"}

And the stakes for both sides are getting higher.\u201cFor the European Commission, it\u2019s a case of Russian roulette,\u201d said Christian Bergqvist, an associate professor of competition law at the University of Copenhagen. \u201cIf they lose or merely settle the case, they will look weak. They have to be seen as doing something to stop Google.\u201dThe latest twist in this episode is expected to begin on Thursday, when Google officially starts responding to European charges that it has hamstrung competitors and limited consumer choice.The separate but closely linked rebuttals to European claims are expected to be submitted to competition authorities in Brussels in quick succession over the next few weeks.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.While each response will be couched in legalese, Google\u2019s main argument is that its business practices do not fall afoul of the region\u2019s tough antitrust rules and that competitors can freely offer their own rival digital services to Europe\u2019s more than 500 million consumers.Not surprisingly, the company\u2019s detractors \u2014 small European start-ups, some local politicians and American heavy hitters like Oracle \u2014 do not agree.\u201cGoogle has taken its best shot, but the European Commission has decided that it\u2019s still on the right track,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, a group representing the Google rivals that have filed complaints against the company\u2019s perceived dominance.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense. But that\u2019s what other previously dominant companies thought, too,\u201d he added.Whatever happens, Google\u2019s battle in Europe will not end overnight.European officials must first review the company\u2019s rebuttals, and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017, at the earliest.If found to have breached the region\u2019s rules, Google faces fines totaling up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28-member bloc. While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible, the company is likely to appeal any European ruling, further lengthening the process.Yet it is this death-by-a-thousand-cuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google.Google may face tougher competition in the smartphone world if Europe forces the company to open up Android to rivals, a possibility if the search giant loses its antitrust case in the region.\u201cNo matter what happens, antitrust is part of the picture for Google for many more years,\u201d said Ioannis Lianos, a professor of global competition law and public policy at University College London. \u201cEven if Google wins, the fact that they are spending resources on this will affect their commercial thinking.\u201dThe search giant has become a boogeyman for many in Europe.

Podesta, to lead a review of the digital revolution, its potential and its perils. When Mr. Podesta presented his findings five months later, he called the internet\u2019s onslaught of big data \u201ca historic driver of progress.\u201d But two short years later, as chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, Mr. Podesta would also become one of the internet\u2019s most notable victims.On Thursday, private security researchers said they had concluded that Mr. Podesta was hacked by Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, the GRU, after it tricked him into clicking on a fake Google login page last March, inadvertently handing over his digital credentials.For months, the hackers mined Mr. Podesta\u2019s inbox for his most sensitive and potentially embarrassing correspondence, much of which has been posted on the WikiLeaks website. Additions to the collection on Thursday included three short email exchanges between Mr. Podesta and Mr. Obama himself in the days leading up to his election in 2008.Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails were first published by WikiLeaks earlier this month. The release came just days after James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security publicly blamed Russian officials for cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee, in what they described as an effort to influence the American presidential election.To date, no government officials have offered evidence that the same Russian hackers behind the D.N.C. cyberattacks were also behind the hack of Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails, but an investigation by the private security researchers determined that they were the same.Threat researchers at Dell SecureWorks, an Atlanta-based security firm, had been tracking the Russian intelligence group for more than a year. In June, they reported that they had uncovered a critical tool in the Russian spy campaign. SecureWorks researchers found that the Russian hackers were using a popular link shortening service, called Bitly, to shorten malicious links they used to send targets fake Google login pages to bait them into submitting their email credentials.The hackers made a critical error by leaving some of their Bitly accounts public, making it possible for SecureWorks to trace 9,000 of their links to nearly 4,000 Gmail accounts targeted between October 2015 and May 2016 with fake Google login pages and security alerts designed to trick users into turning over their passwords.Among the list of targets were more than 100 email addresses associated with Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, including Mr. Podesta\u2019s. By June, 20 staff members for the campaign had clicked on the short links sent by Russian spies. In June, SecureWorks disclosed that among those whose email accounts had been targeted were staff members who advised Mrs. Clinton on policy and managed her travel, communications and campaign finances.\u201cThe new public data confirming the Russians are behind the hack of John Podesta\u2019s email is a big deal,\u201d Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior policy adviser, said Thursday. \u201cThere is no longer any doubt that Putin is trying to help Donald Trump by weaponizing WikiLeaks.\u201dThe new release of Mr. Podesta\u2019s email exchange with Mr. Obama from 2008 made clear that Mr. Obama\u2019s team was confident he would win.In one of the emails, Mr. Podesta wrote Mr. Obama a lengthy memo in the evening on Election Day recommending that he not accept an invitation from President George W. Bush to attend an emergency meeting of the Group of 20 leaders.\u201cAttendance alongside President Bush will create an extremely awkward situation,\u201d the memo said. \u201cIf you attempt to dissociate yourself from his positions, you will be subject to criticism for projecting a divided United States to the rest of the world. But if you adopt a more reserved posture, you will be associated not only with his policies, but also with his very tenuous global standing.\u201dThe White House did not respond to questions about the email.An article on Friday about suspected email hacking by Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service misstated the name of one organization that first disclosed that a presidential counselor, John D.

The goal is to enhance the visitor\u2019s experience while keeping the artwork front and center. Here are some examples.Visitors download the app, which sets off audio content when they stand near a piece of art. They may hear fictional characters talking with one another about the artwork or perhaps about something unrelated. The idea is to mimic what patrons experience when overhearing the conversations of strangers.In an audio tour of \u201cGerman to Me,\u201d for example, an exhibition of postwar German art, patrons hear a young German-American interviewing her mother and grandmother about their experiences growing up after World War II.Other guided tours include one with the actors Kumail Nanjiani and Martin Starr from the HBO comedy \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d who are unabashedly confused by much of the art.\u201cThey ask the curator: \u2018What is this?

What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes.com.You\u2019re probably not the only one applying for that job.That might seem obvious, but too many cover letters are written in a robotic style that leave little impression on hiring managers who are sifting through vast piles of applications, according to career counselors. The cover letter is your chance \u2014 most likely your only one \u2014 to stand out from many other candidates who have similar r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Don\u2019t botch it. Despite the high stakes, a lot of job-seekers treat the cover letter like a formality, putting little thought and few personal flourishes into it.\u201cA cover letter can make the difference between two equally qualified candidates,\u201d said John O\u2019Neill, the assistant dean of career education for Stanford University.While every industry and hiring manager is different, here are some tricks to increase your chances of scoring an interview.You could easily Google \u201ccover letter template\u201d to get some ideas on how to write it. Don\u2019t.\u201cYou need to think about your audience,\u201d said Kristen Fitzpatrick, the managing director of career and professional development at Harvard Business School. \u201cWho\u2019s reading it? How do you capture their attention enough so they move you from one pile to another?\u201dThis is your time to show your communication skills and your personality. You must make the case that the other 99 percent of applicants don\u2019t have what you have. Following a template, or otherwise putting little effort into making your letter stand out, suggests you\u2019re just another applicant.Focus on the organization you\u2019re writing to and the job description of the open position. If you nail your cover letter, the hiring manager will end up reading your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 anyway, so don\u2019t waste precious space duplicating it by going down the list of where you\u2019ve worked.\u201cIt\u2019s to complement your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, not repeat it,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cCover letters where you\u2019re just rewriting the content of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 aren\u2019t effective.\u201dInstead, you could list some specific examples of projects you\u2019ve worked on, and explain what you learned from them and how that knowledge would apply to the open position. Or you could offer some new ideas, showing from the start that you understand the company\u2019s goals and would bring creativity.Read your letter again, and zap any clich\u00e9s or platitudes that don\u2019t say something meaningful about you, the position or the company.As an example: Don\u2019t say you\u2019re a \u201chard worker.\u201d Everyone says that, and it would be easy to lie about if you weren\u2019t, making it a meaningless sentiment to include. It merely takes up space that could be better spent on something that actually sets you apart from the other candidates.\u201cIt\u2019s not even worth saying,\u201d Ms. Fitzpatrick said. \u201cYou\u2019ll show you\u2019re a hard worker by going above and beyond in writing a letter.\u201dThis requires going past the first page of Google results.You could go to a library to sift through professional databases that might have more information, or get coffee with someone who works at the company you\u2019re applying to. Show a familiarity with recent projects, acquisitions and public statements. It doesn\u2019t have to be a lot, but a few sentences to show you\u2019ve put time into it could go a long way.If you\u2019re not preparing for something as crucial as a cover letter, why would they trust you would prepare for an important meeting?A lot of applicants spend too much time talking about why they love the company, Ms. Fitzpatrick said.\u201cHow many letters does Apple read that say, \u2018I couldn\u2019t live without my iPhone\u2019? Probably a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you want to show you are unique and you\u2019ve done your research.\u201dYou do want to make it clear that you respect the company and explain why you\u2019re interested, but the focus should be on what you can do for them.\u201cYou want to avoid too many \u2018I\u2019 statements \u2014 \u2018I know this,\u2019 \u2018I did this,\u2019 \u2018I can do X, Y or Z\u2019 \u2014 because that\u2019s too much about what you\u2019re going to get out of this opportunity,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said.The company isn\u2019t posting a job for charity, or to improve your life; they\u2019re trying to fill a position they consider essential.

What\u2019s new, in addition to a brighter cover, is the scoring system.After more than 37 years, the original format for rating restaurants, based on a scale of 1 to 30 as devised by the founders, Tim and Nina Zagat, is gone. In its place are rankings that go from 1.0 to 5.0, with decimals. The change was made, said a spokeswoman for the survey, now owned by Google, because the Zagat audience preferred a simpler system.In the 2017 guide, Le Bernardin, which has received the top rating for food every year since 2010 (that\u2019s what is not news), gets a 4.9 out of 5.0 instead of a 29 out of a possible 30. Le Bernardin also came in tops for service. Best for d\u00e9cor was Asiate.Also significant this year are a few newcomers that did not waste time rising to the top in their categories: Kingsley held the No. 1 spot for American restaurants, Indian Accent for Indian, and Llama Inn for South American.Along with restaurant rankings, the survey includes questions about dining habits, likes and dislikes. Among respondents, 41 percent said they approved of eliminating tipping.This year, there will also be a pop-up Zagat restaurant stand, called Tiny Cafe, where miniature portions of some signature dishes from restaurants like Los Tacos No. 1, Pizza Loves Emily and Jacques Torres will be served free. The cafe will be at the corner of Astor Place and Cooper Square from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday through Saturday.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s witty and sexy, too. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever before read a love scene that begins with a woman crying out, \u201cDouble me, gammon me.\u201dBut this novel quickly bends, like one of Uri Geller\u2019s spoons, into stranger territory. Bruno, it happens, has psychic gifts; he can sometimes read minds. He\u2019s been handed a death sentence. After he has a seizure during a high-stakes match, he learns he has an enormous and inoperable crablike tumor pressing on his face from the inside of his skull.His very countenance is under duress. And as Mr. Lethem put it in his novel \u201cYou Don\u2019t Love Me Yet\u201d (2007), \u201cYou can\u2019t be deep without a surface.\u201dBruno returns to the Bay Area, where he grew up and vowed never to return, to undergo experimental surgery by a hippie doctor who plays Jimi Hendrix songs in the operating theater. The doctor dismantles Bruno\u2019s eye sockets and opens the bones of his face, as if they were a door on a hinge, and spends hours sucking out the tumor.The operation is a success, even if Bruno winds up looking, as one of his antagonists puts it, \u201clike Frankenstein and his own monster, all stitched together.\u201d Yet the operation has stolen something from him; a crucial element of his Bruno-hood has been crimped. This book will become an antic meditation on personality, and on masks, which Bruno begins to wear.It\u2019s when the novel returns to the Bay Area that it fully becomes a Jonathan Lethem production. That is, the author begins to pour many of his abiding concerns into it: radical politics, underground art, an interest in literary genre (here a loose-leaf tea blend of detective fiction and science fiction), misplaced memories, a missing mother.We meet the usual array of characters with quirky Pynchonian surnames, ones you expect might be \u2014 but are not \u2014 anagrams: Garris Plybon, Madchen Abplanalp, Tira Harpaz. Among the book\u2019s central characters are an anarchist burger flipper, a German dominatrix and a widely loathed Berkeley businessman who seems to be a mixture of Crazy Eddie, the electronics kingpin, and Maurice Conchis, the wealthy intellectual who plays mind games on the young protagonist of John Fowles\u2019s 1965 novel, \u201cThe Magus.\u201d\u201cA Gambler\u2019s Anatomy\u201d is a fluky novel, not among Mr. Lethem\u2019s very best. Its themes are underdeveloped, and it moves in zigs and zags, like a squirrel in headlights.This novel is a tragicomedy; it plays at its best like a \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d episode filmed by the Coen brothers. At its worst, nothing is at stake \u2014 the characters are breezy ciphers.Yet Mr. Lethem has intense gifts; nothing he writes is a waste of time. He lived for many years in the Bay Area as a young man; he was frequently employed as a clerk in Berkeley\u2019s used bookstores. He has a fine sense of this place. Here is Bruno, heading into a city he has not seen in decades:\u201cSan Francisco was a futuristic cartoon of the dozy, cozy city he recalled. The new place was alien, slick as Abu Dhabi in its top layer, with Bluetooth and Google Glass cyborgs strolling beneath glass towers. The underside was as gritty as Mumbai, with no one on the N-Judah streetcar except untouchables, Walker Evans photographs retouched with murky color.\u201dThe prose in \u201cA Gambler\u2019s Anatomy\u201d is nearly always this good, and Mr. Lethem has a touching sense of the lives of obsessive misfits. They\u2019re his tribe.In Bruno he has given us a knight errant, a casually chivalrous wanderer in search of his place on earth. He\u2019s always under someone\u2019s thumb, indebted in ways he can\u2019t begin to understand. He tends to feel that he is the victim of \u201csome obscure sting operation.\u201d He\u2019s no longer sure what freedom consists of.The great thriller writer John D. MacDonald declared, in one of his Travis McGee novels, \u201cIf any two people could ever really get inside each other\u2019s head, it would scare the pee out of both of them.\u201dBruno has scanned the contents of other people\u2019s heads.

{"Headline": "What to See in New York Galleries This Week", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byThe title of that piece is not innocently poetic; it\u2019s also a slang term for a type of group sex. And confusions over sexual identity, first stirred up in childhood, along with adult-imposed gender branding meant to suppress such feelings, are recurrent themes in Mr. LeDray\u2019s art. A tiny tweed suit carries an emphatic embroidered label: \u201cMister Man.\u201d A rugged-looking mini-overcoat bursts open to reveal, like a kind of sartorial subconscious, a cornucopia of high-color dresses and ties.HOLLAND COTTERThat Lillian Schwartz is having her first New York solo gallery show at the age of 89 and that one of her works is on the cover of Artforum magazine this month says more about the art world than it does about Ms. Schwartz. A member of the group Experiments in Art and Technology and an artist embedded for three decades at Bell Labs, Ms. Schwartz has long been known as a digital innovator. This show, with works made from 1968 to 2013, expands that to the gallery realm.Despite her use of image-editing software, microfilm plotters and light pens, Ms. Schwartz\u2019s work is grounded in traditional techniques. The drawings on graph paper here echo other artists\u2019 longstanding application of the grid as a structuring device, but Ms. Schwartz\u2019s drawings were used as actual schematics for computer programming. A terrific, roughly hourlong reel of 12 films and videos shows Ms. Schwartz\u2019s debt to abstract painting, and a book written with her son, Laurens, \u201cThe Computer Artist\u2019s Handbook\u201d (1992), makes references to van Gogh, Vermeer and Picasso.The works here have distinctly 20th-century hallmarks. Films and videos are filled with flashes and explosions that resemble warfare \u2014 and, of course, video games. Ms. Schwartz, who spent time in Japan after World War II, has described seeing marks made by incinerated bodies on the walls of Hiroshima after World War II, and these shadow forms and their terrible provenance are suggested in her work. More connections \u2014 historical, aesthetic, technological \u2014 will surely be revealed as her work finally reaches a larger audience.MARTHA SCHWENDENERFritz Lang\u2019s movie \u201cScarlet Street\u201d (1945) is about a na\u00efve Sunday painter\u2019s murderous encounter with a mercenary streetwalker. It also works as an art-world allegory, an almost comically melodramatic indictment of everyone involved \u2014 deluded artist, reptilian dealer and callous public alike. For a small group show at Lucien Terras, 10 artists were asked to make new work inspired by this vortex of recrimination.But Ander Mikalson chose the cheerfully futile psychoanalytic route, numbering and labeling her varieties of discomfort as 50 gouache and pastel drawings of the movie\u2019s passing shadows, as if for some study of emptiness endlessly deferred.WILL HEINRICHHere, Mr. Feldmann has brought together several genres of painting \u2014 seascapes, portraits and female nudes \u2014 either bought at auction or, in the case of an Ingres bather, newly commissioned as a copy, and suspended the canvases by wires from the ceiling. The pleasure is in seeing paintings in gilded frames floating in space, like an analogue version of a Google search, with its multiple images and erratic results, as well as copies of famous paintings nestled alongside lesser-known works.On the walls are a series of landscape paintings hung together so that their horizons create an unbroken line; a copy of Titian\u2019s \u201cVenus of Urbino\u201d (1538) repainted with bikini suntan lines; and old-master-type portraits of children with red clown noses. Some of the jokes are rimshot one-liners that don\u2019t carry much weight. But over all, the show is sympathetic with Bo Bardi\u2019s radical design, which suggested that pictures are made and remade in the process of displaying them \u2014 sometimes with the help of artists who are simultaneously respectful and irreverent of art history.MARTHA SCHWENDENERAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taking the Temperature Inside the (Feverish) Cloud", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Autumn is a good time to see what is happening next in the $3 trillion business technology market. In particular, it\u2019s a good time to check out what\u2019s new in corporate paranoia.This time of year, San Francisco\u2019s streets are blocked off so companies like Oracle and Salesforce can bring in thousands of customers for several days of presentations, coffee and performances by Milli Vanilli-era pop stars. In the next few days, Salesforce expects to host 171,000 people, enough that even seedy hotels in the Tenderloin neighborhood cost $600 a night.At conferences here, or in Atlanta, where last week Microsoft gathered 23,000 people, companies state their visions on the current and future state of tech.These talks are, as they say, buzzword compliant, with the companies praising their capabilities in cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. They are renting computers in remote data centers over the internet and using the tremendous amounts of data we are now collecting from computers, phones and sensors to analyze and predict how to make and sell more stuff.The best part of these talks isn\u2019t viewing the technology; it\u2019s listening to each sponsoring company brag about how much better it is than its competitors. Each presents number-rich charts to prove it.Who a company names as its enemy and how it measures its relative greatness says a lot about how the company sees its own strengths and the overall stakes in the competition for the world\u2019s computing.For Oracle\u2019s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, who used to slam Microsoft or Salesforce at these events, the main antagonist is now Amazon, which has led the migration of business technology to internet-based cloud computing.\u201cAmazon\u2019s lead is over,\u201d Mr. Ellison told his audience in September. \u201cWe\u2019re aggressively moving.\u201d Using select data, he described Oracle as better in speed, security and, most important, price. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to pay less, you can\u2019t place the order,\u201d he said.For Microsoft, which has spent tens of billions of dollars building its global cloud computing system, the most important factor is not money; rather, the company is focused on size, resources and its track record.\u201cThe only comparison to our depth and breadth is Google,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview after his Atlanta keynote.Also on Thursday, Google held a coming-out event for its corporate computing effort, called Google Cloud, with a Google-level array of dizzying statistics about its scale and size. The company has had 339 product releases since January, and it has 10,000 engineers working on corporate computing.The company even showed a photograph of its undersea cable to Japan, which is 9,000 kilometers long and capable of sending 60 terabytes of information a second (one terabyte is roughly the size of 500 hours of video).Alphabet, the parent company of Google Cloud, has a capital expenditure of $9.9 billion a year, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google Cloud\u2019s senior vice president. Almost all of that consists of various forms of computing infrastructure. \u201cThat is just shy of Amazon and Microsoft put together,\u201d he said.Mr. H\u00f6lzle said data that would take Amazon eight hours to sift could take six minutes on Google. In one case, analysis on Google was 29 times as fast as on Amazon Web Services, he said.The velocity itself is the crucial metric, Mr. H\u00f6lzle said in a separate interview, and he said it would decimate most of today\u2019s contenders.\u201cThis is like Android versus the iPhone in 2008,\u201d he said, evoking a comparison with Apple. \u201cThere were older phones, the BlackBerry. Android managed to be relevant even though the first versions weren\u2019t great. It wasn\u2019t that it was free, or it had maps \u2014 it was the velocity that it changed.\u201dThe sole exception to industry enemy-naming is Amazon. At last year\u2019s meeting it cited a couple of specific products from IBM and Oracle. But with revenue expected to hit $11 billion this year, it is the undisputed cloud leader. For Amazon, naming anyone else would be like anointing them.But what fun is competition when you have nothing to beat? Amazon\u2019s designated foe is all of the past, and the 95 percent of old-style corporate computing it still has to take to the cloud. The IBM and Oracle products it named were from that old world.\u201cIn the next five years, we\u2019ll see the vast majority of enterprises doing what our forward-looking enterprise customers are doing now,\u201d said Ariel Kelman, the vice president of worldwide marketing at Amazon Web Services. He named Intuit and Netflix among these pioneers.Since Amazon owns the transformation, it figures, the enemy is a failure to transform.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking for a Choice of Voices in A.I. Technology", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byJason Mars is an African-American professor of computer science who also runs a tech start-up. When his company\u2019s artificially intelligent smartphone app talks, he said, it sounds \u201clike a helpful, young Caucasian female.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of pressure to conform to the prejudices of the world\u201d when you are trying to make a consumer hit, he said. \u201cIt would be interesting to have a black guy talk, but we don\u2019t want to create friction, either. First we need to sell products.\u201dMr. Mars\u2019s start-up is part of a growing high-tech field called conversational computing. This technology is being popularized by programs like the Siri system in Apple\u2019s iPhone, and Alexa, which is built into the Echo, Amazon\u2019s artificially intelligent home computing device.Conversational computing is holding a mirror to many of society\u2019s biggest preconceptions around race and gender. Listening and talking are the new input and output devices of computers. But they have social and emotional dimensions never seen with keyboards and screens.Do we, for example, associate the stereotypical voice of an English butler \u2014 think of Jarvis the computer in \u201cIron Man\u201d \u2014 with a helpful and intelligent person? And why do so many people want to hear a voice that sounds like it came from a younger woman with no discernible accent?Choosing a voice has implications for design, branding or interacting with machines. A voice can change or harden how we see each other. Where commerce is concerned, that creates a problem: Is it better to succeed by complying with a stereotype, or risk failure in the market by going against type?For many, the answer is initially clear. Microsoft\u2019s artificially intelligent voice system is Cortana, for example, and it was originally the voice of a female character in the video game \u201cHalo.\u201d\u201cIn our research for Cortana, both men and women prefer a woman, younger, for their personal assistant, by a country mile,\u201d said Derek Connell, senior vice president for search at Microsoft. In other words, a secretary \u2014 a job that is traditionally seen as female.Last week, Google introduced a number of voice-based products, including Google Home, its version of Echo. All of them use Google Assistant, which also speaks in tones associated with a young, educated woman.Google Assistant \u201cis a millennial librarian who understands cultural cues, and can wink at things,\u201d said Ryan Germick, who leads the personality efforts in building Google Assistant. \u201cProducts aren\u2019t about rational design decisions. They are about psychology and how people feel.\u201dThe company has had internal debates about whether to respond differently on questions to the computer about suicide, Mr. Connell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve leaned to providing information about suicide prevention everywhere,\u201d he said, as opposed to offering no advice at all.But sometimes, if you want people to figure out quickly that they are talking to a machine, it can be better to have a man\u2019s voice. For example, IBM\u2019s Watson, when it talks to Bob Dylan in television commercials, has a male voice. When Ashok Goel, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, adapted Watson to have a female voice as an informal experiment in how people relate to conversational machines, his students couldn\u2019t tell it was a computer.But Watson\u2019s maleness is the exception. Amazon\u2019s A.I. technology is another in the comforting female voice camp.\u201cAlexa was always an assistant, and female,\u201d said Peng Shao, who worked at Amazon on the Echo and is now at a Seattle start-up, building another speech-based A.I. system. Amazon would not comment on its product.Gender is just the starting point. Can your A.I. technology understand accents? And can it respond in a way that feels less robotic and at least mimics some sort of human empathy?\u201cYou need a persona,\u201d Mr. Shao said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional thing \u2014 people would get red, even get violent, if it didn\u2019t understand them. When it did understand them, it felt like magic. They sleep next to them. This is heading for hospitals, senior care, a lot of sensitive places.\u201dCapital One developed a banking app on Alexa, and found it had to dial down the computer\u2019s formality to make people comfortable talking about their finances with a computer.\u201cMoney is inextricably linked to emotion, enabling and preventing things in your life,\u201d said Stephanie Hay, the head of content strategy, culture and A.I. design at Capital One. At first the app said, \u201cHello,\u201d but that seemed too tense. \u201c\u2018Hi, there\u2019 worked better,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend, hanging out with me in the kitchen. I need her to be reliable and approachable, but not invasive.\u201dWe don\u2019t just need that computerized voice to meet our expectations, said Justine Cassell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. We need computers to relate to us and put us at ease when performing a task. \u201cWe have to know that the other is enough like us that it will run our program correctly,\u201d she said.That need seems to start young. Ms. Cassell has designed an avatar of indeterminate race and gender for 5-year-olds. \u201cThe girls think it\u2019s a girl, and the boys think it\u2019s a boy,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren of color think it\u2019s of color, Caucasians think it\u2019s Caucasian.\u201dAnother system she built spoke in what she termed \u201cvernacular\u201d to African-American children, achieving better results in teaching scientific concepts than when the computer spoke in standard English.When tutoring the children in a class presentation, however, \u201cwe wanted it to practice with them in \u2018proper English.\u2019 Standard American English is still the code of power, so we needed to develop an agent that would train them in code switching,\u201d she said.And, of course, there are regional issues to consider when creating a robotic voice. For Cortana, Microsoft has had to tweak things like accents, as well as languages, and the jokes Cortana tells for different countries.If a French driver goes into Germany using driving directions voiced by Nuance Communications, the computer will mispronounce the name of a German town with a French accent. The idea is to keep the driver confident by sustaining the illusion that the computer is French.Local accents can be found in various versions of Apple\u2019s Siri. It\u2019s possible to localize the accent on an iPhone for the United States (\u201cSamantha,\u201d on to the phone\u2019s settings), Australia (\u201cKaren\u201d), Ireland (\u201cMoira\u201d), South Africa (\u201cTessa\u201d), and Britain (\u201cDaniel.\u201d) Apple could not say whether the English tradition of male butlers influenced its British choice.Mr. Mars\u2019s company, called Clinc, makes personal financial smartphone software that answers questions like \u201chow much can I spend on a computer?\u201d It relies on a similar Google-created female voice.He is hoping for enough success that he can eventually test and counter stereotypes with unexpected A.I. voices. \u201cYou need to be at a certain size before you can address these questions,\u201d said Mr. Mars, who teaches at the University of Michigan.But maybe not too big. \u201cI think consumers will eventually be open to exploring different voices and types,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies, they\u2019ll probably stay conservative about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump and Hillary Clinton. They do not suit back up in their gladiatorial armor until next Sunday.This one is between their running mates, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. Voters may be forgiven for barely knowing of it, or allotting it little space on their mental hard drives, because of the incendiary flashes tossed into the race daily from the top of the tickets, especially by Mr. Trump.The meeting of Mr. Pence, a Republican, and Mr. Kaine, a Democrat, two pensive and little-known nominees, might be the least anticipated vice-presidential debate in 40 years.\u201cYou\u2019re essentially following Ali-Frazier a few days later with a nationally televised book club,\u201d said Tucker Martin, a Republican strategist in Richmond, Va., about an hour from the campus of Longwood University, where the vice-presidential debate will take place.There are several reasons for the lack of excitement, which could rival previous low-interest debates like Al Gore versus Jack Kemp in 1996. That one drew the fewest television viewers, 26.6 million, of any matchup since the first vice-presidential debate in 1976.Neither of this year\u2019s vice-presidential candidates was a national figure at the time he was selected, unlike many past nominees. Neither has set off a media feeding frenzy like previous nominees such as Geraldine A. Ferraro, the first woman on a major party ticket, in 1984 or Sarah Palin, who became a lightning rod for critics in 2008.Mr. Pence and Mr. Kaine are both white men in their late 50s, with solid governing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, but little reputation beyond their home states. They were safe choices picked in part because they would not detract from the top of the ticket.\u201cI am boring,\u201d Mr. Kaine said shortly before being selected. Mr. Pence introduced himself at the Republican National Convention \u201cto those of you who don\u2019t know me, which is most of you.\u201dMr. Trump represents a merger of presidential politics and reality show.\u201cTrump has so elevated the interest in any kind of political theater that a debate that doesn\u2019t have a Trump-like figure by comparison becomes incredibly less entertaining, sadly,\u201d said Dan Senor, a senior adviser to Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin in 2012, when Mr. Ryan was Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate.On social media, voters have compared the looming debate to watching \u201cpaint dry\u201d and \u201c90 minutes of Kaine and Pence quizzing each other on dad-rock trivia.\u201dSome strategists have said the debate should draw much more attention because Mr. Pence and Mr. Kaine are the understudies for candidates who, if elected, would be the oldest president ever to take office (Mr. Trump) or the second oldest (Mrs. Clinton).\u201cThey\u2019re relatively unknown because they\u2019re more policy wonks,\u201d said Kyle C. Kopko, a co-author of \u201cThe VP Advantage,\u201d a book published this year on the electoral influence of running mates.The epic clash between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, whom voters on both sides view in near millenarian terms, has diverted attention from the vice-presidential candidates.\u201cTrump and Clinton are both polarizing figures,\u201d said Joel K. Goldstein, a scholar of the vice presidency at St. Louis University School of Law. \u201cThe feeling that this debate may not be viewed as the return of Elvis isn\u2019t necessarily a reflection on the vice-presidential candidates or the office.\u201d20 PhotosIt is in that circuslike atmosphere that the vice-presidential candidates will compete for voters\u2019 attention.\u201cKaine-Pence will most likely produce a very substantive and policy-driven debate, so it\u2019s a real shame there isn\u2019t more interest,\u201d Mr. Martin, the Republican strategist, said. \u201cBut, hey, once you\u2019ve reduced a presidential campaign to just another reality TV show, you reap what you sow.\u201dMr. Pence, who is likely to find himself defending Mr. Trump\u2019s derogatory comments about women, would be assuming the role of previous nominees who had to make up for stumbles by their running mates in an earlier debate.In 2012, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. launched a fierce attack on the Republican candidate, Mr. Ryan, to calm Democrats who were in near-panic mode over President Obama\u2019s poor performance in an earlier debate with Mr. Romney. That was also the job of Vice President George Bush in 1984 after President Reagan had a bad first debate against Walter F. Mondale.Mr. Pence will be called on to have \u201ca calming presence on the panic many people have about the idea of Trump as president,\u201d Mr. Senor said.Neither vice-presidential nominee, each of whom has governed a large state, should have to spend much time assuring viewers of his executive qualifications, as Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana had to do on the Republican ticket in 1988.The 2008 debate between Ms. Palin and Mr. Biden was the most watched ever, seen by nearly 70 million viewers, more than for any of the presidential debates that year. Still, in the immediate aftermath, the Democratic ticket gained only two percentage points, and the Republicans lost one.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of one of the boxers in the iconic \u201cFight of the Century\u201d match in 1971.

The idea that \u201cwe intend to harm Hillary Clinton, or I intend to harm Hillary Clinton, or I don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton, all those are false,\u201d Mr. Assange said.Mr. Assange laughed when he was asked whether he felt any personal affinity for her Republican rival, Donald J.

What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes.com.Moving to a new city may be a logical step when the ink on your diploma dries. You may be following a job lead, taking the next step with your significant other or simply seeking adventure. But it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll move for a friend.\u201cFriendship is viewed as discretionary,\u201d said Irene S. Levine, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and a friendship expert. \u201cIt takes a lesser priority in people\u2019s minds than work or family.\u201dEven so, professional life and personal life are often intertwined. \u201cFriendships make you a better worker, lover and partner,\u201d Dr. Levine said.Maintaining faraway friendships can seem just as daunting as starting fresh in a new place. But there are plenty of ways to cope with the challenges of distance \u2014 and even use them to your benefit.\u201cWe have more tools at our fingertips than ever to stay in touch,\u201d said Max Marder, 27, who moved to Gaziantep, Turkey, just over two years ago to pursue an internship with a Syrian civil society organization. He had just earned his master\u2019s degree from the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and was seeking full-time employment.\u201cIt was a race to find a job before I was overstaying my visa,\u201d he said.Despite the stress of settling into a new country and looking for work, Mr. Marder\u2019s relationship with his best friend, Sam Jinishian, remained close. In fact, the seven-hour time difference between Gaziantep and New York worked in their favor; Ms. Jinishian was often on Google Chat at work around the same time Mr. Marder was wrapping up his day at home.Will Lefferts, 25, who is pursuing a master\u2019s in communication at Sciences Po in Paris, has also found that living in a different time zone has its social advantages.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m in that weird place of my life where a lot of my close friends are in graduate school as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have work responsibilities in the same way, so we can talk.\u201dThat\u2019s true for Mr. Lefferts\u2019s friends on the East Coast, at least. \u201cThe six-hour difference isn\u2019t that big, but the West Coast is a nightmare,\u201d he said.When friends\u2019 schedules don\u2019t line up quite so serendipitously, setting call dates can ensure more regular communication.When people are trying to talk across time zones, some methods may work better than others. Mr. Marder said he keeps in closest contact with his friends who have the messaging app WhatsApp or use iMessage to text.Alexa Wybraniec, 22, studied at Sciences Po during her junior year at Rutgers University, before she had an iPhone. With that constraint, she found herself using Facebook as her primary means of contacting people. Her best friend, a Facebook abstainer, joined the network for the year just to keep in touch.\u201cThe biggest game-changer for me was when I got my first iPhone,\u201d said Ms. Wybraniec, who moved back to Paris after graduation. \u201cIMessage changed everything.\u201d The price of connection, though, was distraction: Before she switched phones, she said, she \u201cwasn\u2019t Snapchatting the whole city.\u201dThough disappearing messages are the bread and butter of Snapchat, some of the app\u2019s functions may allow a more lasting connection.Mr. Marder has a friend in New York whom he called \u201cthe king of Snapchat stories\u201d \u2014 photos and videos that users broadcast to all of their friends, rather than just a handful. \u201cHe\u2019s very skilled at tracing these narratives,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll go to a friend\u2019s wedding and interview people, or document the antics of birthday parties.\u201d The unedited, often funny footage helps Mr. Marder feel connected to his friends back home.Janan Dave, 24, who recently moved to Bangalore, India, to pursue a 10-month fellowship in public health, felt the same way about the app. \u201cWhen my internet\u2019s strong enough to look at people\u2019s Snap stories, that actually kind of helps me feel like I know what\u2019s going on in people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said.\u201cYou need to find new ways to relate to each other that are satisfying,\u201d Dr. Levine said. \u201cA friendship can\u2019t just exist on the past.\u201d\u201cI have a pact with a group of friends: If we\u2019re ever in the same country, and if it\u2019s at all reasonable, we have to try for it,\u201d Mr. Lefferts said. Last summer one of his friends got married in Michigan, and everyone in the group made it to the party. Soon they\u2019ll unite again, for Mr. Lefferts\u2019s Halloween party in Paris.Shriya Samavai and Clare Drummond have been friends since they were toddlers. When they graduated from high school in 2011, Ms. Samavai moved to New York from Indiana to study at Columbia University, while Ms. Drummond stayed in their home state to attend Purdue University. It was the first time the 23-year-old best friends had to consider what it might be like to live apart. As longtime collaborators \u2014 on photo shoots, illustrations and songs \u2014 they believed art could be the answer to their long-distance problem.\u201cAfter I moved, we started sending each other stuff in the mail,\u201d Ms. Samavai said. \u201cWe\u2019d make art and scan it by email. Then we started writing these songs for each other.\u201dIn addition to keeping their creative partnership alive, Ms. Samavai and Ms. Drummond have used distance as an excuse to visit each other often and travel to new places together.\u201cWe\u2019re always discussing, \u2018When\u2019s the next time you can take off, and where do you want to go?\u2019\u201d Ms. Samavai said.In their absence, Ms. Brashares said, it\u2019s essential to create new situations in which friendship might thrive, whether it\u2019s starting a book club, going on vacation together or sharing a pair of jeans, as the characters in her \u201cSisterhood of the Traveling Pants\u201d series do.\u201cAs I get older, I\u2019m more and more convinced of the importance of the concrete,\u201d Ms. Brashares said. When she was writing the \u201cSisterhood\u201d series, she was looking for a physical representation of her characters\u2019 relationships that honored the past while continuing to change in the present. The jeans were a perfect fit.When Ms. Wybraniec first left for Paris, she packed reminders of her two closest friends: sketches that her friend Nora drew in high school, and a necklace her friend Natasha made that bears a rock pendant from a mountain in their hometown. They provided her with \u201csomething physical and tangible to hold onto from home.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t want something matching, but we wanted two things that kind of completed each other,\u201d Ms. Samavai said.She and Ms. Drummond first considered inking themselves with a watering can and a houseplant, respectively, then revised the vision in favor of a bergamot plant and a teapot filled with Earl Grey, a drink they often shared at each other\u2019s houses growing up.\u201cWhen we stand side by side, you see the teapot pour into the plant,\u201d Ms. Samavai said of the tattoos, which Ms. Drummond drew. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but Earl Grey has been a central force in our friendship.\u201dAnyone who has recently uprooted is likely to be \u201cconsumed with the challenges of finding their place in a new community,\u201d Dr. Levine said. They could be living alone, or with strangers. There may be a job lined up, or there may be stress over a seemingly endless search for work. Even simple things like figuring out where to buy groceries can be difficult.The mundanity of moving shouldn\u2019t be a barrier to bonding. Dr. Levine recommended that rather than withholding the details of a transition from friends, you should \u201cmake them part of the journey with you.\u201d\u201cI keep Sam pretty in the loop about even the most banal things in my life,\u201d Mr. Marder said.But living near the Turkey-Syria border has meant that some of his conversations with friends revolve around more pressing issues, like his safety. When Gaziantep was bombed in August 2016, he was \u201cmarked safe\u201d on Facebook.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know it had happened until I started getting messages from people in America about it,\u201d he said.Mr. Lefferts had a similar experience in Paris during the November 2015 attacks.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything had happened until after my mom texted me asking if I was O.K.,\u201d he said. In the days that followed, he received concerned messages from Facebook friends, some of whom he had not spoken to in a long time.\u201cI really appreciated it,\u201d he said.Friends \u201ccan be a life preserver or a buoy in your next environment,\u201d Dr. Levine said. With a strong foundation and the right tools, it\u2019s possible to live apart, support each other and grow together.Want more? You might also like:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Expect Free High-Speed Internet for Poorer Americans to Pay Off Later", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There is an axiom in technology: New products typically go to wealthy customers first, before prices eventually fall to reach the masses.With broadband now classified like a utility, telecom and tech companies, including Sprint, Comcast and Facebook, are increasingly working to make high-speed internet accessible to every American, not just a luxury. The companies are among those that have set their sights on bringing free or cheap high-speed internet service to low-income and rural populations in the United States, spurred by philanthropy and, for some, the hope of turning Americans who are not online today into full-paying customers in the future.Those goals were on display Tuesday, when Sprint announced that it planned to give one million low-income high school students a free device and a free high-speed data plan until graduation. Facebook is also working to bring to the United States a service known as Free Basics, which gives people free access to certain websites, including Facebook. Comcast recently loosened requirements for its low-cost broadband service, expanding it to anyone in public housing.\u201cThe private sector has as much responsibility as the public sector to make devices and broadband available to millions of young Americans,\u201d said Broderick Johnson, President Obama\u2019s cabinet secretary and chairman of a White House task force that worked with Sprint on its new program.Free and low-cost broadband programs have been around for a while, with Comcast rolling out one called Internet Essentials in 2011, Google offering free broadband in public housing, and Dell and Microsoft providing free or discounted devices to schools. But the new initiatives could reach much larger populations and are directed toward specific digital divide problems, such as the struggle for children without broadband at home to complete their homework.Yet while telecom and web companies cite altruism as propelling free or low-cost broadband programs, what is often left unsaid are the benefits the services bring to the companies. It\u2019s part of a textbook business strategy known as \u201closs leader,\u201d when a company provides discounted or free goods to get customers to buy more once they are in the store.The strategy is increasingly important for the telecom industry, where growth has slowed and new broadband customers are harder to find.Some of the companies acknowledged the business strategy involved in providing low-income products. But Sprint\u2019s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, said the priority had been to work on a problem that telecom firms are best positioned to help solve. \u201cThe internet is one of the few things that doesn\u2019t discriminate, but the one thing that does discriminate is who can get online and who can\u2019t,\u201d he said.Sprint, the fourth-largest mobile carrier in the United States, typically charges customers about $60 a month for high-speed internet service. In the last six months, Mr. Claure, who emigrated from Bolivia as a college student, has made the digital divide an issue within the firm and assembled tech and nonprofit partners around the effort.The mobile carrier is particularly focused on bridging the \u201chomework gap\u201d that exists for students without broadband, which Mr. Claure said particularly hurts low-income African-American and Hispanic children. \u201cBeing a Hispanic C.E.O., this bothers me,\u201d he said.The program will be rolled out in seven to 10 cities, including Kansas City, Mo., early next year, before becoming more widely available in the 2017-18 school year. Nonprofits including My Brother\u2019s Keeper Alliance and EveryoneOn will recruit students for the nine-year program, and Sprint will use its stores and customer service representatives to sign up and serve the students.The new program\u2019s cost to Sprint is minimal because it doesn\u2019t require additional network upgrades; instead, it would be the equivalent of adding more cars to a highway, the company said. And there is social value for Sprint in doing this.\u201cPeople will look at Sprint as a good guy,\u201d Mr. Claure said. \u201cBrands that create social value by making a meaningful difference in people\u2019s lives are in a stronger position to attract new customers.\u201dDavid L. Cohen, senior executive vice president of Comcast, said in a statement, \u201cThe purpose of the program is not to convert Internet Essentials customers into paying customers.\u201dFacebook did not offer a timeline for a rollout of Free Basics in the United States.\u201cWhile we have nothing to announce, Facebook\u2019s mission is to connect the world, and we\u2019re always exploring ways to do that, including in the United States,\u201d the company said in a statement.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Seeking Ownership of Both the Information and the Superhighway", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byMediatorOn the face of it, there is something Strangelovian about the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner.Like a lot of news consumers, I\u2019ve been struggling to get my head around this deal, which would give AT&T control of the Warner Bros. movie studio and cable networks including CNN, HBO and TBS. It would be gargantuan, carrying an $85 billion price tag. And it would further concentrate media ownership into a few powerful hands, playing to fears of a big corporate media takeover of the wild and woolly web, which has been so central to this year\u2019s great political upheaval. But it\u2019s all very fuzzy.What is it about this proposed merger that has both the left and the right, on the presidential trail and on Capitol Hill, so suspicious of it, if not downright opposed? Are the stakes really so high and the potential damage so great?\u201cI think you\u2019re being alarmist,\u201d he told me.\u201cThis is AT&T, which owns DirecTV, so that\u2019s a large pay-TV provider,\u201d Mr. Franken said. \u201cAlso, they\u2019re the second biggest in mobile broadband. And they\u2019re trying to buy this content company, Time Warner, which has Warner Bros. and all this very desirable TV content.\u201cWhen the company that controls the pipes, so to speak, owns this very, very large content provider, it can cause a whole bunch of different horribles for consumers,\u201d he said.First and foremost, Mr. Franken said, there\u2019s the dual threat of less choice and higher prices.On paper at least, AT&T could hoard some of its most popular movies or channels, making them more readily available to DirecTV, to promote DirecTV subscriptions, while pushing competitors off DirecTV or into the deep wilderness of the DirecTV channel guide. Or, Mr. Franken said, the new company could charge competitors like Comcast and Cox more for its most popular channels, price increases that would no doubt be passed on to the consumer.Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the Time Warner chief executive, dismissed those fears when we spoke Friday, saying that they don\u2019t jibe with the company\u2019s business imperatives: to offer the most channels for the best price, and to have its own channels as widely distributed as possible.AT&T and Time Warner executives say they are prepared to abide by the conditions government regulators are certain to impose, including prohibitions against using the new company\u2019s power to discriminate against rivals.But Mr. Franken said he was doubtful about the effectiveness of such restrictions, calling them \u201cvery hard to enforce.\u201dHe pointed to the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger of a few years ago, in which Comcast promised Washington regulators that it would not punish rival networks on its cable systems.Then again, the old, familiar cable guide is yesterday\u2019s battlefield, as video content moves to streaming services on your smartphone, tablet or television.And, in that new media sphere, with about 131 million wireless subscribers, AT&T would presumably again have incentive to favor its own programming over that of its competitors, by making it download faster \u2014 on a national scale.But I asked him whether AT&T\u2019s involvement in the suit didn\u2019t indicate that the company would create an internet class system if it won in court, especially should its takeover of Time Warner win approval.The lawsuit, he said, was related to what AT&T viewed as government overreach, not the provisions prohibiting tiered internet service. \u201cWe have always stood behind the core principles of net neutrality,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not creating fast lanes and slow lanes.\u201dThe company says DirecTV is formally paying AT&T for its customers\u2019 use charges upfront, so the customers never see them. Other streaming services, it says, are welcome to make similar deals. (The Federal Communications Commission is looking into whether such arrangements should be considered a violation of net neutrality rules.)It\u2019s really dense stuff played out in complicated minutiae. But that\u2019s where the future of the internet, and therefore, the free flow of information, is going to be decided.Mr. Bewkes says if the public takes a look at the facts, it will see that the deal will not harm internet freedom. If anything, he argues, it will add a powerful new competitor to the Silicon Valley behemoths Facebook and Google, which appear to be swallowing the online advertising market whole.But he acknowledged the deal is up against an overwhelming public sense that \u201cthe big tower of government or the corporation is bad and it\u2019s not serving me.\u201dDonald J. Trump has said outright he would block the merger, and Hillary Clinton has said the merger raises \u201cconcerns.\u201dThis deal, however, will be decided long after the campaign is over. As Mr. Franken pointed out, the fight against the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger took some 14 months.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Is a Shot in the Dark", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAT&T is a telecom company that offers wireless service in a saturated market, while Time Warner is a content company whose primary assets, networks like CNN and HBO, face tougher times in a cord-cutting world. This merger is presented as a solution \u2014 a bigger company with more options will inherently be better suited to weather the enormous changes now shattering the TV business. Together, they\u2019ll have more leverage and can build new stuff faster.If all this sounds a bit speculative, that\u2019s because it is. What this deal actually symbolizes is that the future of television is increasingly going to be built on lots of bold, possibly speculative experiments.For instance, it does not make sense for Time Warner to offer most of its content exclusively to AT&T\u2019s customers. Not only would that destroy its profitability (Comcast\u2019s customers pay a lot for CNN and HBO, so why would Time Warner want to kill that business?), but it would also be out of step with the future. The notion of content tied to specific distribution lines is exactly what consumers are moving away from when they choose services like Netflix over cable bundles.We are witnessing the emergence of a new order in the TV business. In five or 10 years\u2019 time, that order may become clear. There\u2019s a good chance it will involve some current players \u2014 Comcast, Disney and a merged AT&T and Time Warner will all play a role in the entertainment business of tomorrow. But these behemoths\u2019 size and influence will almost certainly be diminished by new tech-powered players, whose pocketbooks and ambitions seem limitless \u2014 companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and possibly Twitter and Snap.So among the questions now plaguing the industry: Do people still want to pay for TV, and if so, how much? Do people want to watch live stuff, or scripted stuff, or do they instead want to watch whatever is on their Facebook feed? Which kind of company is the most valuable player in the future of the entertainment business?That is where all the experimenting comes in. William Goldman, the screenwriter, once said that in Hollywood, \u201cnobody knows anything.\u201d This applies well to the entertainment business of today, and the AT&T and Time Warner deal is perhaps the watershed example: Every move is a guess, and if you are lucky, an educated one.\u201cI think we\u2019re all trying to figure this out \u2014 how technology and the consumer is going to change, and who are the winners and losers in this future,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, who studies the telecommunications industry at the research firm BTIG.The best argument for the deal, Mr. Piecyk said, is that it diversifies AT&T\u2019s offerings \u2014 now a single company combines content and distribution, rather than just one or the other. When you face an uncertain future, diversity isn\u2019t a bad weapon. If it turns out that in the future, content becomes more valuable than distribution, the new AT&T will have that; if the opposite happens, it\u2019s covered there, too.In conference calls with reporters and investors over the weekend, Randall Stephenson and Jeffrey Bewkes, the chairmen and chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner, added another dimension to this argument: Bigger, they said, is faster.The future of TV, they argued, will depend on a lot of new ideas that are tested and deployed very quickly. These might include new business models for paying for shows, new ways to distribute and market that content, and new technologies and industrywide standards to make sure it all works.Fragmentation led to delays, and delays contribute to consumer dissatisfaction \u2014 but in a world in which Time Warner and AT&T worked together, new products would come along faster, which would in turn push new ideas from competitors, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cThis appears to be about empire sustenance rather than economic efficiency,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at the Pivotal Research Group.Craig Moffett, of MoffettNathanson, was blunter: \u201cAT&T faces the twin pressures of a huge debt load and huge dividend that consumes the vast majority of their cash,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIt is clear that they had to do SOMETHING.\u201dBig media mergers are always risky. They rarely work out. But it\u2019s striking how much more things are uncertain today than in the past. So even if AT&T and Time Warner together do not make much obvious sense, well, it\u2019s something.Advertisement"}

The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs erred in weighing all r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, including unsolicited applications from sites like Craigslist, as if they were from people with the relatively demanding skills required at a place like Palantir, the company argued.The filing also said that Palantir had hired outside experts who reviewed its practices and found no discrimination, and noted that several members of its senior leadership, as well as hiring managers, were themselves Asian.Palantir, based in Palo Alto, Calif., specializes in sophisticated pattern-finding software, and counted the federal government among its first customers. Originally specializing in matters like profiling terrorist organizations and tracing money laundering, the company has since built practices in areas like selling distressed mortgages and maximizing retail sales of candy.The Labor Department sued Palantir in late September after what both sides characterized as years of private negotiations to settle the case. The department asked that, should its suit succeed, the government cancel all its contracts with Palantir.As a federal contractor, the company is obligated to have a place on its applications for people to indicate their race, which is most likely how the government determined the number of Asians applying for work at Palantir.Diversity and discrimination issues have dogged many Silicon Valley companies in recent years, though usually in cases involving gender, Latinos or African-Americans. In disclosures over the last two years, companies like Google and Facebook have displayed work forces made up disproportionately of white men.An earlier version of this article misstated when a government audit was initiated.

{"Headline": "Individualized Ads on TV Could Be One Result of AT&T-Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byViewers, with new subscription options, could enjoy fewer interruptions and see ads for \u201cthe products you\u2019re interested in, not the ones you don\u2019t need to see,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. National advertisers would presumably pay more to reach them and have an alternative to spending on Google and Facebook.Targeted advertising has become commonplace on streaming services like Hulu or platforms like YouTube, where, for example, women in their 20s may see ads for birth control, pregnancy tests or certain movie trailers. Advertisers hope things could potentially move even beyond that on TV, with people seeing ads based on, for instance, their location or individual interests, much like what happens on the internet. Still, skepticism over whether the AT&T-Time Warner merger will normalize the practice for traditional TV is rife within the ad industry.\u201cAs to the question of whether this is a new route for advertising and another opportunity for targeted addressable TV advertising, the answer is it\u2019s going to take a significant period of time,\u201d said Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising giant WPP, pointing to the risks around regulation and combining the two companies. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but implementing it is not going to be easy.\u201dTailored advertising is a generally accepted part of the internet experience \u2014 consumers see it daily on Facebook or through banner ads, where it has become common for a specific shirt or bag placed in an online shopping cart to haunt a person for weeks, even after it has been purchased. But traditional TV has largely continued to advertise in broad swaths, showing ads to demographics like 18- to 49-year-old men.\u201cThe reality of it is, we\u2019re moving into a world where consumers are turning against advertising,\u201d Mr. Tobaccowala said.Stephen B. Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, speaking on Comcast\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday, said that the TV group has been working to developing advanced advertising products but that the process was difficult.\u201cBut it\u2019s clear what advertisers want,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to combine the data intensity of internet advertising with the clear value and ability to change peoples\u2019 perceptions that you get with a television ad.\u201dOthers see great potential for advertising in the merger, which would marry AT&T\u2019s more than 100 million subscribers across its wireless, broadband and DirecTV properties, with Time Warner\u2019s offerings, which include CNN, TBS, Cartoon Network, the website Bleacher Report, HBO and Warner Bros. Pictures. On Tuesday at WSJD, a technology conference organized by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Stephenson said that, starting next month, the company would offer a 100-channel internet-based premium television service that would cost $35 a month and allow people to watch video on their mobile phones and other devices.Rob Norman, chief digital officer of WPP\u2019s GroupM, a major media investment group, said the success of targeted advertising would hinge on cost. He offered the example of a home improvement business advertising grass seed in places like Arizona and Montana, which have significantly different climates. That advertising could be further tailored for whether viewers lived in a condominium versus a suburban home with a lawn, he said.\u201cIf you believe in a future where the very, very fine targeting of households or individuals with specific messaging makes economic sense to do at scale, what this merger does is enable that by making more audience available to target in that way,\u201d Mr. Norman said. \u201cThe question will be: What is the premium for addressability for that level of targeting that the advertiser is willing to pay?\u201dThe biggest change is that television \u201chas evolved to being more fluid and digital-like,\u201d as it appears on devices like phones and tablets and streams through accessories like Roku and Apple TV, Mr. Hanlon said.\u201cThis is clearly one of the significant envisioned benefits of this tie-up, which is the next generation of video advertising in a much more robust, targetable and data-rich manner,\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the realm of digital advertising has been a dress rehearsal for the medium of television, which is now essentially getting ready for its full-fledged digital transformation.\u201dDave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads, said a combined AT&T and Time Warner could narrow the average price gap between cable ads and more expensive digital video ads by establishing a uniquely \u201chigh degree of coordination\u201d between a distributor, programmer and sales systems for digital and traditional video.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a magic silver bullet, but I do think a combination like this is going to accelerate better, more data-driven TV ads,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. Outside of targeting, he said, that could also mean frequency capping, so that people do not see the same ads over and over again, better retargeting and improved measurement.Mr. Sorrell predicted, \u201cAll of this is going to happen, but it\u2019s a question of how long it\u2019s going to take.\u201dAT&T AdWorks, the company\u2019s advertising division, said it did not use its mobile location and other mobile data for products out of that unit. The company declined to say whether that would change.Mr. Stephenson said in Monday\u2019s call that the combined company planned to use \u201crobust viewership insights\u201d from its television, mobile and broadband subscribers to advise what content it created, tailored to where and when certain demographics watched. Those insights will also \u201cexpand the market for addressable advertising,\u201d he said, describing it as \u201cfar more effective and more valuable both to the advertisers and to our customer.\u201dJeffrey Chester, the executive director for the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group, said the deal made it clear that the \u201cinitial era of big data driven television is here.\u201d\u201cThe people who benefit here aside from AT&T shareholders are the big brands and advertisers across the country that are going to have a more effective vehicle for continually targeting consumers with interactive advertising and services,\u201d he said. \u201cTelevision, instead of the boob tube, is going to be \u2018I know you\u2019 tube.\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Bol\u00edvar Symphony Opens Carnegie Season", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookCan music do anything when there\u2019s nothing to be done?The Bol\u00edvars are the latest iteration of what was once the marquee youth orchestra of El Sistema, the publicly financed Venezuelan arts education monolith that has been praised for helping raise thousands of children out of poverty. For all the good El Sistema does, its closeness to the government has made many wonder whether it and the Bol\u00edvars are inextricable from \u2014 or even function as a kind of propaganda mission for \u2014 a regime that has dragged its people to disaster. And concertgoers might even ask how they should approach listening to this orchestra at this particular fraught moment.Thursday\u2019s performance did not feature a group quite fit to stand in that exalted company: This was a feel-good, sound-good-not-great concert. The Bol\u00edvars may no longer be a youth orchestra, but they play with the fervent blandness of child prodigies. This was colorful music \u2014 Ravel\u2019s \u201cLa Valse,\u201d Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d and a closing assortment of dance-themed bonbons, some more tightly executed than others \u2014 that here often lacked color. (And why is the roster so overwhelmingly male?)But the musicians were visibly having the time of their lives. You would not know \u2014 sitting among the gown- and tuxedo-clad crowd \u2014 that these artists\u2019 home country is grievously suffering. In brief remarks from the stage that focused on his and the players\u2019 love of, and joy in, music, Mr. Dudamel dropped an oblique reference to \u201cthe troubling times we are living in,\u201d and that was that.But is that enough? It is a question that has dogged Mr. Dudamel\u2019s career. The smiling international face of El Sistema, he has come under criticism for remaining a largely silent (and therefore acquiescent) beneficiary of government support.There are no easy answers, either for Mr. Dudamel or for us, to these kinds of ethical quandaries. And this is hardly the first time we\u2019ve had to check our moral compasses as classical listeners. Mr. Dudamel has strained to remain above the partisan fray. But what are we to make of the more overt, unapologetic political activity of the Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a very public booster for Vladimir V. Putin, who was advocating anti-gay laws and squeezing any political dissent as he remains a crucial ally of Mr. Gergiev\u2019s Mariinsky Theater?When Soviet artists toured America during the Cold War, were they thawing a conflict, or were they whitewashing human-rights violations? Even if a repressive government is far different from a powerful individual, many have objected to the policy positions and political actions of the industrialist David H. Koch. Should these people\u2019s feelings about Mr. Koch affect their enjoyment of New York City Ballet, which performs at the David H. Koch Theater?But there is no disentangling the performance of classical music from a state of political affairs that many object to. If we want art \u2014 and we should \u2014 we need to realize that purity in this regard is impossible.So I don\u2019t think it makes sense, for example, to boycott City Ballet to avoid the Koch Theater. But neither should its name be ignored. If you want to cheer the Bol\u00edvars\u2019 signature spirited rendition of \u201cMambo,\u201d from \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d I would say that it is your responsibility also to learn about \u2014 and in some way keep in mind as they play \u2014 the situation facing their countrymen.When you go to the symphony, study the list of donors in the playbill and Google their professional activities. If these days we insist on knowing the farm our restaurant chicken comes from, why shouldn\u2019t we know the doings of the private-equity firms supporting our orchestras?The key for contemporary listeners is to keep not just our ears open, but also our eyes. There is no such thing as apolitical culture \u2014 Ravel\u2019s \u201cLa Valse,\u201d for one thing, lurches like the nauseating World War I hangover that it is. And there should be no such thing as apolitical culture consumers.\u201cIn El Sistema\u2019s orchestras,\u201d Mr. Dudamel wrote last year, \u201cthe son of an opposition leader and the daughter of a government minister may sit next to each other creating beautiful music.

{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Fate: Marc Benioff of Salesforce Addresses Acquisition Talk", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com, showed up onstage on Wednesday afternoon at his biggest customer event of the year to talk up his business technology company\u2019s products and strategy.But what was arguably the higher-stakes meeting was held later that day. At the plush St. Regis San Francisco Hotel, Mr. Benioff presided over a gathering with Wall Street analysts and investors. His aim: to assuage their concerns about his plan to buy Twitter, the struggling social media company.\u201cWe look at a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Benioff told the room, without directly mentioning Twitter. \u201cThe number we acquire is very few.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cit gives us ideas\u201d to look at companies.At first glance, the two companies could not be more different. Twitter is where celebrities, politicians and countless other individuals broadcast their thoughts in 140-character messages. Salesforce, on the other hand, makes online software for salespeople and marketers.Yet Twitter would fit into a vision that Mr. Benioff has had for Salesforce, which he founded in 1999, as a company that can help enterprises with all of their customer needs. Twitter, in Mr. Benioff\u2019s eyes, is already a powerful customer service tool that airlines, restaurants, banks and many other companies use to field consumer complaints and requests. Companies can also use what people post on Twitter to glean consumer habits.\u201cThis is a huge messaging and communications service,\u201d Mr. Benioff, who turned 52 last month, said on Wednesday in an interview on his way to the St. Regis. He added, \u201cI use mergers and acquisition activity to think about the market.\u201dMr. Benioff faces a battery of challenges in buying Twitter. Skeptical investors have pushed Salesforce stock down about 5 percent since news broke that the company was considering bidding for the social media company. Behind the scenes, investors have been grousing about a potential purchase. Any deal would very likely be Salesforce\u2019s largest, with Twitter valued at about $14 billion. Salesforce, which is unprofitable, has a market capitalization of about $48 billion.Twitter investors appear dubious, too. The company\u2019s stock dropped more than 20 percent on Thursday as speculation about other suitors seemed to dissipate.\u201cThis would be a disaster,\u201d said Joel Fishbein, managing director at BTIG, a financial services firm. \u201cBenioff is a visionary, but this could blow up. Engineers could leave Salesforce, and it would send the stock down 30 or 40 percent.\u201dMr. Benioff acknowledged that Salesforce would face difficulties in taking over Twitter, given that Salesforce sells software to businesses while Twitter is a consumer technology company. The chief executive, who is an activist in areas like gay rights and gender equality, also said he was troubled by the amount of hate speech on Twitter.But it is not unusual for Mr. Benioff to go against the grain. A San Francisco native, he worked at Oracle, the business software company, for years before founding Salesforce as an online software firm in 1999, when online software was still unproven.\u201cMarc wants to be well thought of, to feel like he\u2019s doing things the right way,\u201d said Adam Bosworth, a Salesforce executive who left in August to work at Amazon. Mr. Bosworth recalled once disagreeing with Mr. Benioff on a management issue and sending him an email with the subject line, \u201cYou are not being a mensch.\u201d\u201cIt was the fastest response I ever got from him,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said.Much of the data that Salesforce is gaining through acquisitions can help power artificial intelligence, which Mr. Benioff says will soon be everywhere. \u201cWe\u2019ve bought about a dozen A.I. companies, built whole new teams,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Without LinkedIn, Mr. Benioff turned his sights to Twitter, which has been trying to figure out how to rev up its growth.Mr. Benioff, who is himself a power user of Twitter, said on Wednesday that while it was essential that Salesforce be in A.I., there was more to Twitter than that.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge customer-service platform,\u201d used by companies like Dell, Apple and Bank of America, he said in the interview on the way to the St. Regis. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reason to buy it, but it\u2019s a reason to look at it. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m buying it, but I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not buying it.\u201dLater, at the investor meeting where analysts shied from mentioning the name Twitter, Mr. Benioff tried to explain where he was coming from. \u201cI see things in a different kind of way,\u201d he told them. \u201cI hope someday to sit down and say how I think about that which shall not be named.\u201dEventually, though, Mr. Benioff could not resist a more direct reference to Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey. \u201cI wish Jack well with his company,\u201d Mr. Benioff said at the end of the investor meeting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Move Over, Rats. New York Is Planning an Underground Park.", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byVerdant oases have been squeezed into every corner of New York City, tucked between towering skyscrapers, carved from former military posts and abandoned railroad tracks, and even laid on top of landfills.But it is still not enough. So now the latest frontier in the quest to carve out more parkland is the city\u2019s subterranean level \u2014 home to subways, sewage lines and rats.Plans are underway to build what its supporters say would be the world\u2019s first underground park.An abandoned trolley terminal near the Williamsburg Bridge on the Lower East Side of Manhattan would be transformed into a green space built by a nonprofit group that has spent years experimenting with solar technology. The group proposes to illuminate the underground space with sunlight collected by high-tech panels above ground and reflected down through a series of pipes.Alicia Glen, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said the Lowline would create more public space in one of the city\u2019s most densely populated neighborhoods and could serve as a model for other cities. The underground park proposal has already attracted the attention of city officials, urban planners and developers as far as London, Moscow, Paris and Seoul, South Korea.Besides, as Ms. Glen acknowledged, \u201cit\u2019s not exactly the hottest property in New York City.\u201d When the city called for proposals for the site, it received only one: the Lowline. \u201cTo be honest, most people don\u2019t think of the underground as a super happy place to be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does take a level of imagination and optimism.\u201dBut others winced at the possibility of encountering stale air or worse \u2014 rats and other vermin \u2014 down below. Robin Malcom, 47, a construction worker who said she got enough of the underground world just riding the subway, added that she would feel confined and isolated, especially if there were another terrorist attack in the city. \u201cI\u2019m going to need my parks to be above ground,\u201d she said.Dan Barasch, the executive director of the Lowline, said the park would have a ventilation system in addition to the garden to freshen the air, and full-time security on site. The park would be kept clean and well maintained, he said, and garbage would be removed swiftly to prevent rodent infestations.The Lowline has won the support of the local community board and some advocates. But Victor Papa, president of Two Bridges Neighborhood Council, a community development and housing organization on the Lower East Side, said he remained skeptical, though he was willing to give it a chance.Mr. Papa, 71, said he did not want the park to become a magnet solely for celebrities and wealthy patrons with no stake in the community. In return for using public land, he said, the park should offer free science programs and other activities for local children, many of whom are from low-income and immigrant families. (Mr. Barasch says there are plans to do so.) \u201cPublic property is for the common good,\u201d Mr. Papa said.The Lowline, which would cost $80 million to build, still faces significant hurdles, and would not open until 2021 at the earliest. The New York City Economic Development Corporation, which oversees the city-owned site, has given the Underground Development Foundation until July to submit a detailed design and raise at least $10 million, among other things. City officials have yet to commit any money to the project.The park would resurrect part of the Williamsburg Bridge railway terminal, which served as a hub for trolley cars for more than four decades before it closed in 1948. On the lower level of the terminal, passengers waited to board cars that came off the bridge and turned around on U-shaped tracks to go back over.After trolley service was discontinued \u2014 and the tracks over the bridge were replaced with car lanes \u2014 the underground level of the terminal was largely forgotten by the public until James Ramsey, an architectural designer, heard about the space and began poking around. Mr. Ramsey, 39, envisioned filling it with light to bring it back to life. Through friends, he met Mr. Barasch, a former marketing manager for Google.At that time, in 2009, the High Line, a freight railroad line converted to a park, had just opened on the west side of Manhattan. As the two talked about creating an underground park, people started calling it \u201cthe Lowline.\u201d The name stuck.To show what it could look like, they set out to raise $100,000 on Kickstarter to pay for a one-month exhibit in 2012. They received more than $150,000. They converted a dark warehouse into a park, with a Japanese maple tree growing on top of a mossy hill. More than 11,000 people visited.Last year, a second Kickstarter campaign raised $225,000 for a demonstration lab on Essex Street a few blocks from the underground terminal. Along with a South Korean company, SunPortal, they installed a system for redirecting sunlight that they have described as \u201cremote skylights.\u201d A tracking mirror installed on the roof of their building follows the sun across the sky, reflecting its rays into a curved optical lens resembling a giant periscope. The light is concentrated and reflected down through pipes to three apertures in the ceiling of the lab. A 30-foot-wide \u201csolar canopy\u201d made of aluminum panels distributes the light below. For cloudy days, there is a backup LED light system.The centerpiece of the lab is a lush garden with 3,000 plants, representing more than 60 species. Ferns, mosses and mushrooms have thrived along with tomatoes, onions and garlic. Mint started taking over and had to be pruned daily (workers added it to their sandwiches). Strawberries grew ripe enough to eat. Not all survived, though. Hop plants died and a coffee plant grew so spindly it was removed.Mr. Ramsey\u2019s favorite is a scrappy green ash tree that was found growing between two bricks on the rooftop in June and relocated below. Now standing two feet tall, it sits in the center of the garden. \u201cThis guy\u2019s a survivor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real New Yorker right here.\u201dMore than 80,000 people have visited the demonstration lab, including the mayor of Seoul. Touching the plants is allowed. Lingering is encouraged. Yoga and meditation classes are held there, along with scavenger hunts for children. An after-school program has taught science and math lessons to 2,000 middle school students.Mr. Barasch said the lab had shown that people were ready for an underground park.\u201cIt\u2019s a daily struggle in New York to get a little space, a little room, a little nature,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople go crazy for a tree or a bench on their block. Every square inch is so precious in this city.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Broadband Providers Will Need Permission to Collect Private Data", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byBy a 3-to-2 vote, the Federal Communications Commission clearly took the side of consumers. The new rules require broadband providers to obtain permission from subscribers to gather and give out data on their web browsing, app use, location and financial information. Currently, broadband providers can track users unless those individuals tell them to stop.It was the first time the F.C.C. has passed such online protections. The agency made privacy rules for phones and cable television in the past, but high-speed internet providers, including AT&T and Verizon Communications, were not held to any privacy restrictions, even though those behemoth companies have arguably one of the most expansive views of the habits of web users.Privacy groups applauded the new rules, which they said brought the United States more in line with European nations that have moved aggressively to protect their citizens\u2019 online privacy.\u201cFor the first time, the public will be guaranteed that when they use broadband to connect to the internet, whether on a mobile device or personal computer, they will have the ability to decide whether and how much of their information can be gathered,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy.The outcry from industries that depend on online user data was also swift. Cable lobbying groups called the rules a result of \u201cregulatory opportunism,\u201d while the Association of National Advertisers labeled the regulations \u201cunprecedented, misguided, counterproductive, and potentially extremely harmful.\u201dEven with the new rules, online privacy remains tricky. Many people have been lackadaisical about what information they give up online when they register for websites or digital services. The convenience of free services like maps also appeals to people, even though they give companies access to personal information. And some people unknowingly forgo their privacy when allowing apps or other services to track their location or follow their browsing across websites.The F.C.C. rules also have their limits. Online ad juggernauts, including Google, Facebook and other web companies, are not subject to the new regulations. The F.C.C. does not have jurisdiction over web companies. Those companies are instead required to follow general consumer protection rules enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. That means Google does not have to explicitly ask people permission first to gather web browsing habits, for example.AT&T, Verizon and Comcast will also still be able to gather consumers\u2019 digital data, though not as easily as before. The F.C.C. rules apply only to their broadband businesses. That would mean data from the habits of AT&T\u2019s wireless and home broadband customers would be subject to the regulations, but not data about AT&T\u2019s DirecTV users or users of the HBO Now app, which would come with the merger with Time Warner, for example.The companies also have other ways to collect information about people, including the purchase of data from brokers.AT&T, which has criticized the privacy regulations for internet service providers, would not comment on how the rules would affect its proposed purchase of Time Warner. But it emphasized the benefits of ads that allow for free and cheaper web services.\u201cAt the end of the day, consumers desire services which shift costs away from them and toward advertisers,\u201d said Robert W. Quinn Jr., AT&T\u2019s senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs. \u201cWe will look at the specifics of today\u2019s action, but it would appear on its face to inhibit that shift of lower costs for consumers by imposing a different set of rules on\u201d internet service providers.Comcast said that the rules were not needed and that the F.C.C. did not prove that broadband providers were hurting consumers.For over two decades, internet service providers \u201cand all other internet companies have operated under the F.T.C.\u2019s privacy regime and, during that time, the internet thrived; consumer privacy was protected,\u201d said David L. Cohen, Comcast\u2019s senior executive vice president.Major broadband providers will have about one year to make the changes required by the new rules; the companies must notify users of their new privacy options in ways like email or dialogue boxes on websites. After the rules are in effect, broadband providers will immediately stop collecting what the F.C.C. deems sensitive data, including Social Security numbers and health data, unless a customer gives permission.Even some web companies protested the proposed rules. Google said in comments filed to the F.C.C. this month that the regulations should not include web browsing, because that does not necessarily include sensitive personal information.\u201cConsumers benefit from responsible online advertising, individualized content, and product improvements based on browsing information,\u201d wrote Austin Schlick, Google\u2019s director of communications law.In the end, the objections had little effect on the F.C.C.\u201cHopefully, this is the end of what has been the race to the bottom for online privacy, and hopefully the beginning of a race to the top,\u201d said Harold Feld, senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit public interest group.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google, Lagging Amazon, Races Across the Threshold Into the Home", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Amazon introduced its Echo device in late 2014, Google executives were caught off guard. For years, they had predicted the creation of a virtual assistant that would answer questions or help accomplish tasks, and they focused on building that capability into smartphones and tablets.Amazon took a different approach and created the Echo, a device with the sole purpose of showcasing the company\u2019s artificially intelligent assistant software, called Alexa. Since then, the Echo has become a surprise hit, vaulting Amazon ahead of Google in a race to build technology that interacts as humans do. Users can ask Alexa to play music, dim the lights or call for a ride.For Google, whose name is synonymous with finding answers on the internet, Amazon\u2019s success with Alexa exposed a vulnerability. Google, along with its parent company, Alphabet, has invested heavily to solve the technology world\u2019s toughest problems, but it often trails competitors in turning those advancements into products and businesses.On Tuesday, Google is expected to finally unveil its answer to the Echo, alongside new smartphones and tablets. The Google Home device, which looks a little like an air freshener, is expected to go on sale later this month.Google Home is powered by what Google calls the Assistant, which uses artificial intelligence to understand what users are saying and respond conversationally with the best answers. Google introduced a messaging app last month that incorporates the Assistant, and the company plans to add the feature to its latest smartphones and tablets.Given the newness of the market for artificially intelligent home gadgets, Google has plenty of time to close the gap. The company believes it can win over consumers with a smarter digital assistant that builds on its stronghold in search and years of research in artificial intelligence.But the fact that Google was outmaneuvered by Amazon \u2014 not Apple, which builds its own digital assistant technology, called Siri, into its mobile products \u2014 has caused head-scratching throughout the technology industry. Amazon has a notoriously uneven track record in making hardware, with some hits, like the Kindle e-reader, and spectacular whiffs, like the Fire Phone.\u201cAmazon is the accidental winner here,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business at New York University. \u201cAmazon got there first, which is superimpressive, and it has been a huge hit.\u201dGoogle is a leader in natural language processing \u2014 the ability to turn spoken words into terms that computers can digest \u2014 and its search engine is the starting point for how most people get answers on the internet. In fact, the company says 20 percent of Google searches on mobile phones are done by voice.So why didn\u2019t Google create an Echo-like device before Amazon?In part, Google was hindered by a balkanized structure that prevented different groups within the company from working together, according to four current and former employees.Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., had a large team working on voice search but its focus was on an app for smartphones. The company had a separate team working on the Android operating system, which runs on smartphones, tablets and internet-connected home devices, and they were building virtual assistant technology into mobile devices.Google bought Nest Labs, a manufacturer of internet-connected thermostats and smoke detectors, for $3.2 billion in 2014 as an entree into the home. But the unit seldom collaborated with the rest of the company. And other Google hardware divisions responsible for building smartphones, tablets, Chromebook computers, Wi-Fi routers and Chromecast devices to stream video were focused on updating products.A competitor for the Echo, it seems, fell through the cracks.This is not the first time Amazon has jumped ahead of Google, despite the search company\u2019s considerable technological edge.From its inception, Google has devoted enormous resources to operating efficient data centers to power its many services. But it was Amazon that identified an opportunity in renting out its technology infrastructure to companies in need of computing power, storage and data analysis. That business, called Amazon Web Services, is now on pace to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year, while Google is playing catch-up.A lack of focus can at times compound these issues. Google encourages its employees to spend 20 percent of their time pursuing new ideas beyond their usual responsibilities. Products like Gmail emerged from this policy, but it also fosters a mind-set that, according to one former employee, leads Google to chase too many ideas.\u201cPart of the problem is that it has a scattershot approach to things,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. When pursuing new ideas, he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t always make big bets strategically.\u201dGoogle has spent seven years working on self-driving cars, for example, and it is still not clear how the company plans to cash in on its work. By contrast, Uber, which started as a company around the time that Google started work on autonomous vehicles, is already testing self-driving cars to pick up customers in Pittsburgh.Despite its many successes, Google has a spotty history of creating devices. In 2012, Google introduced an internet-connected speaker called the Nexus Q. The vision was for the device to plug into a home entertainment system for streaming music or video, a sort of hybrid of an Apple TV and a Sonos speaker. But Google killed the product before it even started shipping it to consumers.Also in 2012, Google bought the phone manufacturer Motorola for $12.5 billion. The next year, it introduced the Moto X, the first smartphone equipped with a listening chip so users could bring the phone to life by uttering the words \u201cO.K. Google.\u201d It has pushed this feature into the latest phones running its Android operating system. Apple\u2019s more recent iPhones and iPads have a similar feature, activated by the words \u201cHey Siri.\u201dBut what makes the Amazon Echo stand out is a technology called a far-field microphone that can make out someone\u2019s voice from across a room, even when there is background clatter. And the Echo is always in position to listen for the so-called wake word \u2014 Alexa \u2014 whereas phones are often tucked away in pockets and bags. According to a former employee, Google has tinkered with far-field audio, but its focus was on the car, not a home device.Amazon invested in artificial intelligence and speech technologies in the years before unveiling Echo, but its most crucial asset was its strength in the cloud computing market, which it dominates with Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S.The vast majority of Echo\u2019s intelligence is contained in A.W.S., and most of the apps that developers have built for Alexa run on the cloud service. \u201cThe most important architectural vision is that it\u2019s all in the cloud,\u201d Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices and services, said in an interview this year.Amazon says tens of thousands of developers are creating skills for Alexa, more than 3,000 of which have been released so far. And thousands of developers are working to incorporate Alexa\u2019s voice capabilities into their hardware products. Last month, GE Appliances announced an Alexa app that lets people preheat a connected oven with voice commands.Chris Herbert, chief executive of a start-up called TrackR that makes wireless beacons for finding misplaced keys and wallets, recently released an app for Alexa that allows people to find their items with voice commands.Mr. Herbert said he had looked at the voice offerings from both Google and Apple, but neither company yet offered the same range of capabilities as Amazon, because they viewed it as an add-on feature to phones as opposed to a stand-alone computer.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling to me,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Salesforce Shareholders Besiege Possible Twitter Deal", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The investor pressure began building on Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, two weeks ago.The investors made their concerns known to Mr. Benioff. In emails and other communications, the shareholders told the chief executive and Salesforce\u2019s investor relations team that they disapproved of a tie-up with Twitter.The effort was led by Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund firm that is Salesforce\u2019s largest shareholder, with about 14 percent of the company. At least one Fidelity portfolio manager emailed Salesforce about the deal being a bad idea, according to people briefed on the correspondence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the communications were private. Other Salesforce investors, including hedge funds, said they would sell the company\u2019s stock, according to two people with knowledge of the communications.\u201cI read all of your notes, you probably know that,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cI also read your emails. And as I digest all of that information, this is actually the No. 1 thing that has been on my mind. In some cases we have been unusually surprised and we have had to do a reset.\u201dThe pushback offers a window into how big investors can exert pressure on would-be deals behind the scenes. Salesforce is particularly vulnerable to what its large institutional investors think because the unprofitable online software company relies heavily on its stock to make acquisitions and pay employee compensation. As a result, the company needs to keep investors happy for its share price to continue going up.Salesforce declined to comment, as did a representative from Fidelity.It is unclear whether or not Mr. Benioff will continue to pursue Twitter. One person involved in the negotiations said that, for now, Salesforce\u2019s shareholders have halted a potential deal.For Twitter, that would mean that its options have narrowed. The social media company had been talking to potential buyers, as well as considering divestitures and layoffs to focus its business. But companies including Google, Apple and Disney are not interested in buying Twitter, people at those companies said, and Salesforce appeared to be one of the last interested parties.Even though Salesforce is a 17-year-old company, in some ways Mr. Benioff still runs it like a start-up, making promises of boundless growth and equity riches for all employees.If shareholders were to sell and drive down the value of Salesforce stock, that would hurt Mr. Benioff\u2019s deal-making capabilities. Salesforce needs to aggressively acquire companies to keep its revenue growing as its core business, customer-management software, slows, said Mark Moerdler, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.The recent investor pushback puts Mr. Benioff, who has long been a shareholder darling, in an unfamiliar position. Salesforce shares have zoomed higher since pricing at $11 in its initial public offering to around $71 now, as investors clamored to own a piece of one of the first companies to successfully convince big enterprises to rent out software that is stored in the cloud, rather than own it and run it themselves.But after the Twitter news broke, investors pushed the stock down by as much as 8 percent over the next 10 days.On Wednesday, during Mr. Benioff\u2019s investor meeting where he sometimes gazed upon his own image projected on an enormous screen above the crowd, he bristled at times over the shareholder reaction.\u201cWell, what about this one deal right here!\u201d Mr. Benioff said, using a shrill and mocking voice to imitate one shareholder email. \u201cI mean the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails are so extreme I am like, Jesus, do they really think that we would do a deal at that level?\u201dMr. Benioff emphasized that he is a careful deal maker who is sensitive to what any acquisition might mean for Salesforce\u2019s shareholders, which include large, influential institutions like T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Sands Capital Management and Harbor Funds. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in running the company like a lone wolf,\u201d he said, pointing to his board members who sat in the front row.But he still left the door open, ever so slightly, for future acquisitions. \u201cWe believe innovation happens not just in Salesforce, but in other companies,\u201d he said.Katie Benner reported from San Francisco and Leslie Picker from New York.

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Third Debate", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byWALLACE: Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I\u2019m Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.WALLACE: This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.WALLACE: No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Let\u2019s get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court.You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.WALLACE: Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? And secondly, what\u2019s your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the founders\u2019 words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first. You have two minutes.CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have?And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women\u2019s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country\u2019s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.That\u2019s how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That\u2019s the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. Where do you want to see the court take the country? And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?TRUMP: Well, first of all, it\u2019s great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. Our country is so, so \u2014 it\u2019s just so imperative that we have the right justices.Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don\u2019t think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it\u2019s absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint \u2014 and I\u2019ve named 20 of them \u2014 the justices that I\u2019m going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they\u2019re people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that\u2019s very, very important.I don\u2019t think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It\u2019s all about the Constitution of \u2014 of \u2014 and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.WALLACE: We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, \u201cThe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.\u201d And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What\u2019s wrong with that?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country.But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t mean that I want people who shouldn\u2019t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There\u2019s other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn\u2019t accept that reasonable regulation, but they\u2019ve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people\u2019s lives and defending the Second Amendment.WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton\u2019s answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms? TRUMP: Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly \u2014 and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.WALLACE: Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?CLINTON: Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.But there\u2019s no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there\u2019s an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.And, you know, look, I understand that Donald\u2019s been strongly supported by the NRA. The gun lobby\u2019s on his side. They\u2019re running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we\u2019re going to protect and defend the Second Amendment. But we\u2019re going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?TRUMP: Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am \u2014 I don\u2019t know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I\u2019m very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA. And it\u2019s the earliest endorsement they\u2019ve ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I\u2019m very honored by all of that.We are going to appoint justices \u2014 this is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.WALLACE: Well, let\u2019s pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that\u2019s the issue of abortion.TRUMP: Right.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes \u2014 in fact, states \u2014 a woman\u2019s right to abortion?TRUMP: Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.WALLACE: But I\u2019m asking you specifically. Would you like to...TRUMP: If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.WALLACE: But what I\u2019m asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn \u2014 you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?TRUMP: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that\u2019s really what\u2019s going to be \u2014 that will happen. And that\u2019ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it\u2019s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what\u2019s happening right now in America.So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.Donald has said he\u2019s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women\u2019s rights to make their own health care decisions.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton... CLINTON: And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.WALLACE: I\u2019m going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why?CLINTON: Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.TRUMP: Well, I think it\u2019s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.Now, you can say that that\u2019s OK and Hillary can say that that\u2019s OK. But it\u2019s not OK with me, because based on what she\u2019s saying, and based on where she\u2019s going, and where she\u2019s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that\u2019s not acceptable.CLINTON: Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.You know, I\u2019ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I\u2019ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.WALLACE: All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...TRUMP: And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that.WALLACE: All right. Let\u2019s move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you\u2019re going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders.In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of \u2014 I mean, these are unbelievable people that I\u2019ve gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They\u2019re coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border.Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border \u2014 as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what\u2019s going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders.I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have \u2014 it\u2019s with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama. All of the problems \u2014 the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It\u2019s just pouring and destroying their youth. It\u2019s poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We are \u2014 right now, we\u2019re getting the drugs, they\u2019re getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute \u2014 we cannot give amnesty.Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones \u2014 we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We\u2019re going to get them out; we\u2019re going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we\u2019ll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we\u2019re going to get them out.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?CLINTON: Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.And you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t want to rip families apart. I don\u2019t want to be sending parents away from children. I don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here\u2019s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\u2019s an idea that would rip our country apart.I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they\u2019re most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\u2019t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\u2019re not paying for that wall.So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.WALLACE: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I want to follow up...TRUMP: Chris, I think it\u2019s...WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It\u2019s a disaster.Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn\u2019t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.WALLACE: Well, let me \u2014 wait, wait, sir, let me...TRUMP: We are a country of laws. We either have \u2014 and by the way...WALLACE: Now, wait. I\u2019d like to hear from...TRUMP: Well \u2014 well, but she said one thing.WALLACE: I\u2019d like to hear \u2014 I\u2019d like to hear from Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: I voted for border security, and there are...TRUMP: And the wall.CLINTON: There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can\u2019t exploit them and undercut Americans\u2019 wages.And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: \u201cYou complain, I\u2019ll get you deported.\u201dI want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.WALLACE: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They\u2019ve been deported. She doesn\u2019t want to say that, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happened, and that\u2019s what happened big league.As far as moving these people out and moving \u2014 we either have a country or we don\u2019t. We\u2019re a country of laws. We either have a border or we don\u2019t.Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it\u2019s very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They\u2019re on line. They\u2019re waiting. We\u2019re going to speed up the process, big league, because it\u2019s very inefficient. But they\u2019re on line and they\u2019re waiting to become citizens.Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.WALLACE: I want to...TRUMP: But what she doesn\u2019t say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to...CLINTON: We will not have open borders. That is...WALLACE: Well, let me \u2014 Secretary...CLINTON: That is a rank mischaracterization.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: We will have secure borders, but we\u2019ll also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, excuse me. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: ... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we\u2019ve learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote. \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.\u201d So that\u2019s the question...TRUMP: Thank you.WALLACE: That\u2019s the question. Please quiet, everybody. Is that your dream, open borders? CLINTON: Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what\u2019s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.CLINTON: So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past? Those are the questions we need answered. We\u2019ve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.WALLACE: Well?TRUMP: That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?WALLACE: Hold on \u2014 hold on, wait. Hold on, folks. Because we \u2014 this is going to end up getting out of control. Let\u2019s try to keep it quiet so \u2014 for the candidates and for the American people.TRUMP: So just to finish on the borders...WALLACE: Yes?TRUMP: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from.And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won\u2019t even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.Now we can talk about Putin. I don\u2019t know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I\u2019ll tell you what: We\u2019re in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads \u2014 1,800, by the way \u2014 where they expanded and we didn\u2019t, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she\u2019s playing chicken. Look, Putin...WALLACE: Wait, but...TRUMP: ... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.CLINTON: Well, that\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet as president of the United States.TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.CLINTON: And it\u2019s pretty clear...TRUMP: You\u2019re the puppet!CLINTON: It\u2019s pretty clear you won\u2019t admit...TRUMP: No, you\u2019re the puppet.CLINTON: ... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We\u2019ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17 \u2014 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: And I think it\u2019s time you take a stand...TRUMP: She has no idea whether it\u2019s Russia, China, or anybody else.CLINTON: I am not quoting myself.TRUMP: She has no idea.CLINTON: I am quoting 17...TRUMP: Hillary, you have no idea.CLINTON: ... 17 intelligence \u2014 do you doubt 17 military and civilian...TRUMP: And our country has no idea.CLINTON: ... agencies.TRUMP: Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.CLINTON: Well, he\u2019d rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: She doesn\u2019t like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He\u2019s outsmarted her every step of the way.WALLACE: I do get to ask some questions.TRUMP: Yes, that\u2019s fine.WALLACE: And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don\u2019t know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?TRUMP: By Russia or anybody else.WALLACE: You condemn their interference?TRUMP: Of course I condemn. Of course I \u2014 I don\u2019t know Putin. I have no idea.WALLACE: I\u2019m not asking \u2014 I\u2019m asking do you condemn?TRUMP: I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn\u2019t be so bad.Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it\u2019s Syria, you name it. Missiles. Take a look at the \u201cstart up\u201d that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can\u2019t believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads, and we can\u2019t. The Russians can\u2019t believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin.And all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They\u2019ve taken over. We\u2019ve spent $6 trillion. They\u2019ve taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen in any government whatsoever.WALLACE: We\u2019re a long way away from immigration, but I\u2019m going to let you finish this topic. You got about 45 seconds.TRUMP: And she always will be.CLINTON: I \u2014 I find it ironic that he\u2019s raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He\u2019s...Reporters for The New York Times fact-checked the statements made by Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump during Wednesday\u2019s presidential debate.TRUMP: Wrong. CLINTON: ... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don\u2019t we use them, which I think is terrifying.But here\u2019s the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There\u2019s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that\u2019s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.TRUMP: I have 200 generals...WALLACE: Very quickly.TRUMP: ... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the \u2014 we\u2019re defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century.All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places. We cannot continue to afford \u2014 she took that as saying nuclear weapons.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: Look, she\u2019s been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie.CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m just quoting you when you were asked...TRUMP: There\u2019s no quote. You\u2019re not going to find a quote from me.CLINTON: ... about a potential nuclear \u2014 nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks. That kind...TRUMP: And defend yourselves.CLINTON: ... of language \u2014 well...TRUMP: And defend yourselves. I didn\u2019t say nuclear. And defend yourself.CLINTON: The United States has kept the peace \u2014 the United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to be able to keep the peace.WALLACE: We\u2019re going to \u2014 no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: We\u2019re going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent\u2019s plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.I want us to do more to help small business. That\u2019s where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not \u2014 who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\u2019s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.And we\u2019re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\u2019re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.WALLACE: Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton\u2019s?TRUMP: Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I\u2019m a big proponent. We\u2019re going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public\u2019s going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan.TRUMP: But I\u2019d like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I\u2019m \u2014 not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren\u2019t they paying?She immediately \u2014 when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren\u2019t the NATO questioned \u2014 why aren\u2019t they paying? Because they weren\u2019t paying.Since I did this \u2014 this was a year ago \u2014 all of a sudden, they\u2019re paying. And I\u2019ve been given a lot \u2014 a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they\u2019re starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We\u2019re protecting people, they have to pay up. And I\u2019m a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up.She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it\u2019s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama\u2019s regime, we\u2019ve doubled our national debt. We\u2019re up to $20 trillion.So my plan \u2014 we\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to have a lot of free trade. We\u2019re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back.I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can\u2019t make a great deal \u2014 then we\u2019re going to terminate NAFTA and we\u2019re going to create new deals. We\u2019re going to have trade, but we\u2019re going \u2014 we\u2019re going to terminate it, we\u2019re going to make a great trade deal.And if we can\u2019t, we\u2019re going to do it \u2014 we\u2019re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We\u2019re going to cut business taxes massively. They\u2019re going to start hiring people. We\u2019re going to bring the $2.5 trillion... WALLACE: Time, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: ... that\u2019s offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...WALLACE: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: ... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.CLINTON: Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...TRUMP: You can\u2019t.CLINTON: ... the fact is, he\u2019s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we\u2019ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I\u2019m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That\u2019s the kind of approach that will work.WALLACE: Secretary...CLINTON: Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we\u2019ve tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.TRUMP: Correct.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn\u2019t get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus. So is your plan basically more \u2014 even more of the Obama stimulus?CLINTON: Well, it\u2019s a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I\u2019ve never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession.So now we\u2019ve dug ourselves out of it, we\u2019re standing, but we\u2019re not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work.That\u2019s why what I have put forward doesn\u2019t add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We\u2019re beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We\u2019ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that\u2019s what I believe I will be able to do.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don\u2019t add up, that your idea, and you\u2019ve talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...TRUMP: Over a 10-year period.WALLACE: ... growth is unrealistic. And they say \u2014 you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that\u2019s unrealistic, as well. Your response, sir?TRUMP: So I just left some high representatives of India. They\u2019re growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number.We are growing \u2014 our last report came out \u2014 and it\u2019s right around the 1 percent level. And I think it\u2019s going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad.Look, our country is stagnant. We\u2019ve lost our jobs. We\u2019ve lost our businesses. We\u2019re not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.I\u2019ve visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I\u2019ve gotten to know so many \u2014 I\u2019ve developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what\u2019s happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what\u2019s happened to these people in these communities.Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn\u2019t really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that\u2019s ever been signed by our country.Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn\u2019t call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored.WALLACE: I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...TRUMP: And that will be as bad as NAFTA. WALLACE: ... which is Obamacare. But go ahead, briefly.CLINTON: Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn\u2019t meet my test. I\u2019ve had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I\u2019m against it now. I\u2019ll be against it after the election. I\u2019ll be against it when I\u2019m president.There\u2019s only one of us on this stage who\u2019s actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that\u2019s Donald. He\u2019s shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.But he mentioned China. And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I\u2019ve stood up against it as secretary of state.Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.WALLACE: Mr. Trump?CLINTON: That\u2019s the kind of approach that is just not going to work.TRUMP: Well, let me just say \u2014 let me just say.CLINTON: We\u2019re going to pull the country together. We\u2019re going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we\u2019re going to enforce those agreements, and we\u2019re going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton? Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Let me ask a simple question. She\u2019s been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn\u2019t you do it over the last 15, 20 years?Here\u2019s how we analyzed in real time the last presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.CLINTON: No, I voted.TRUMP: You were very much involved \u2014 excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it\u2019s bad experience, because what you\u2019ve done has turned out badly.For 30 years, you\u2019ve been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I \u2014 make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn\u2019t mind.The problem is, you talk, but you don\u2019t get anything done, Hillary. You don\u2019t. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen. They don\u2019t know. It\u2019s gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me.CLINTON: Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it\u2019s been debunked numerous times.CLINTON: But I think it\u2019s really an important issue. He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women\u2019s rights are human rights. He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.TRUMP: Give me a break.CLINTON: And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d So I\u2019m happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I\u2019ve done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I\u2019ll let the American people make that decision.TRUMP: Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It\u2019s a $1 million loan. But I built a phenomenal company.And if we could run our country the way I\u2019ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it.And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria. Take a look at the migration. Take a look at Libya. Take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when \u2014 we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. And now I listen how she\u2019s going to get rid of ISIS. She\u2019s going to get rid of nobody.WALLACE: All right. We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States. Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you\u2019d never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up \u2014 you deny this \u2014 why would they all make up these stories?Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse. Mr. Trump, you go first.TRUMP: Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people \u2014 I don\u2019t know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She\u2019s the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people \u2014 they paid them $1,500, and they\u2019re on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.I would say the only way \u2014 because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn\u2019t even apologize to my wife, who\u2019s sitting right here, because I didn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t know any of these \u2014 I didn\u2019t see these women.These women \u2014 the woman on the plane, the \u2014 I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it\u2019s her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they\u2019re telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.And I\u2019ll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn\u2019t, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally \u2014 it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction.CLINTON: Well...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that\u2019s exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.TRUMP: I did not say that. I did not say that.CLINTON: In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes \u2014 sir, her two minutes. Her two minutes.TRUMP: I did not say that.WALLACE: It\u2019s her two minutes.CLINTON: He went on to say, \u201cLook at her. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d About another woman, he said, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be my first choice.\u201d He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her \u201cdisgusting,\u201d as he has called a number of women during this campaign.Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That\u2019s who Donald is.I think it\u2019s really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don\u2019t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.America is great, because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody.(LAUGHTER)Nobody has more respect...WALLACE: Please, everybody.TRUMP: And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn\u2019t fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.What happened to the FBI, I don\u2019t know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. She\u2019s lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He\u2019s going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general. And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States? That\u2019s really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it\u2019s not just about women. He never apologizes or says he\u2019s sorry for anything.So we know what he has said and what he\u2019s done to women. But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion. He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers \u201cpeople who aren\u2019t captured.\u201d He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn\u2019t be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.So it\u2019s not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is.And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what\u2019s at stake in this election. It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.TRUMP: So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. It\u2019s on tape.WALLACE: During the last...TRUMP: The other things are false, but honestly, I\u2019d love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I\u2019d love to talk about other things...WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: ... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.WALLACE: In this bucket about fitness to be president, there\u2019s been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I\u2019d like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have.Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you. Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee? And why isn\u2019t what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn\u2019t it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?CLINTON: Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country\u2019s interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that\u2019s been proven.But I am happy, in fact I\u2019m thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does. You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate \u2014 I know I don\u2019t have the time to do that.But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that\u2019s about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment. In partnership with the American Health Association...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: ... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is \u2014 this is an open discussion.CLINTON: Well, it is an open discussion. And you...WALLACE: And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?CLINTON: Well, but there is no \u2014 but there is no evidence \u2014 but there is...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I think that it\u2019s been very well...WALLACE: Let\u2019s ask Mr. Trump.CLINTON: There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...TRUMP: It\u2019s been very well studied.CLINTON: ... and the high rankings...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Please let me Mr. Trump speak.TRUMP: ... and it\u2019s a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.WALLACE: Please let Mr. Trump speak.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: It\u2019s a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women\u2019s rights? So these are people that push gays off business \u2014 off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.So I\u2019d like to ask you right now, why don\u2019t you give back the money that you\u2019ve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don\u2019t you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture.Because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what\u2019s happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent \u2014 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. I\u2019m very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I\u2019d be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we\u2019re going to keep working to help Haiti...WALLACE: All right.CLINTON: ... because it\u2019s an important part of the American experience.TRUMP: They don\u2019t want you to help them anymore.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I\u2019d like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent \u2014 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don\u2019t get anything. I don\u2019t buy boats. I don\u2019t buy planes. What happens \u2014 the money goes to them.WALLACE: Wasn\u2019t some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?TRUMP: No, it was \u2014 we put up the American flag. And that\u2019s it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.WALLACE: Right. But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...TRUMP: There was. There was. And, by the way...WALLACE: ... instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.TRUMP: ... the money \u2014 the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses \u2014 the money that you\u2019re talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.WALLACE: I want to get into one...CLINTON: But, of course, there\u2019s no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn\u2019t released his tax returns. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can\u2019t prove it. You can look at our tax returns. We\u2019ve got them all out there.But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris. You know, half of all immigrants \u2014 undocumented immigrants in our country \u2014 actually pay federal income tax. So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire. I find that just astonishing.WALLACE: I want...TRUMP: So let me just tell you very quickly, we\u2019re entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors \u2014 just about all of them \u2014 I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...WALLACE: We...TRUMP: Let me just explain.WALLACE: But, no, we heard this...TRUMP: Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, we \u2014 OK.TRUMP: You know what she should have done?WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...TRUMP: And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...TRUMP: ... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.CLINTON: Well, you know...TRUMP: You should have changed the law. But you won\u2019t change the law, because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...CLINTON: Made with Chinese steel.TRUMP: But I will tell you, I sat there...(LAUGHTER)... I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you\u2019re going to protect them. And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: If you don\u2019t like what I did, you should have changed the laws.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you \u2014 his words \u2014 \u201cwill absolutely accept the result of this election.\u201d Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing. I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely \u2014 sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?TRUMP: I will look at it at the time. I\u2019m not looking at anything now. I\u2019ll look at it at the time.What I\u2019ve seen \u2014 what I\u2019ve seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don\u2019t even care. It\u2019s so dishonest. And they\u2019ve poisoned the mind of the voters.But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they\u2019re going to see through it. We\u2019ll find out on November 8th. But I think they\u2019re going to see through it.WALLACE: But, sir, there\u2019s...TRUMP: If you look \u2014 excuse me, Chris \u2014 if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote \u2014 millions, this isn\u2019t coming from me \u2014 this is coming from Pew Report and other places \u2014 millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn\u2019t be registered to vote.So let me just give you one other thing. So I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people \u2014 tell you one other thing. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. It\u2019s crooked \u2014 she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run.And just in that respect, I say it\u2019s rigged, because she should never...WALLACE: But...TRUMP: Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.WALLACE: But, sir, there is a tradition in this country \u2014 in fact, one of the prides of this country \u2014 is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you\u2019re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you\u2019re not prepared now to commit to that principle?TRUMP: What I\u2019m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I\u2019ll keep you in suspense. OK?CLINTON: Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that\u2019s horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus. He lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn\u2019t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.TRUMP: Should have gotten it.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: This is \u2014 this is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s also really troubling.WALLACE: OK.CLINTON: So that is not the way our democracy works. We\u2019ve been around for 240 years. We\u2019ve had free and fair elections. We\u2019ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. You know, President Obama said the other day when you\u2019re whining before the game is even finished...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Hold on. Hold on, folks. Hold on, folks.CLINTON: ... it just shows you\u2019re not up to doing the job. And let\u2019s \u2014 you know, let\u2019s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating \u2014 he\u2019s talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.TRUMP: I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it\u2019s disgraceful. I think it\u2019s a disgrace.WALLACE: All right.TRUMP: I think we\u2019ve never had a situation so bad in this country.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Hold on, folks. This doesn\u2019t do any good for anyone. Let\u2019s please continue the debate, and let\u2019s move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after? And that\u2019s something that whichever of you ends up \u2014 whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn\u2019t come back or isn\u2019t replaced by something even worse? Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.CLINTON: Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground. But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is in our interest, and I don\u2019t think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.The goal here is to take back Mosul. It\u2019s going to be a hard fight. I\u2019ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real \u2014 a really successful military operation. But we know we\u2019ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That\u2019s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don\u2019t let terrorists buy weapons. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun.And I\u2019m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will \u2014 would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?TRUMP: Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we\u2019re fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they\u2019re going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we\u2019re going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about \u2014 how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They\u2019ve all left.The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we\u2019re now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we\u2019re going in to get it.But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she\u2019s running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That\u2019s why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they\u2019re going in.But who\u2019s going to get Mosul, really? We\u2019ll take Mosul eventually. But the way \u2014 if you look at what\u2019s happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought.But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they\u2019re smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid \u2014 the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that\u2019s going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they\u2019ve wanted to do forever, but we\u2019ve made it so easy for them.So we\u2019re now going to take Mosul. And do you know who\u2019s going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they\u2019re making \u2014 I mean, they are outsmarting \u2014 look, you\u2019re not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.WALLACE: Sir, your two minutes are up.TRUMP: The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.CLINTON: Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn\u2019t support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I\u2019ve said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... a very clear fact that...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... before the invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it. Google \u201cDonald Trump Iraq.\u201d And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.But what\u2019s really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and \u2014 just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership.But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. They\u2019ve been digging underground. They\u2019ve been prepared to defend. It\u2019s going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.This is what we have to do. I\u2019m just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that\u2019s how Donald thinks. You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.TRUMP: Chris, we don\u2019t gain anything.CLINTON: He has all the conspiracy theories...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, it\u2019s...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq. We don\u2019t gain anything.CLINTON: This conspiracy theory, which he\u2019s been spewing out for quite some time.TRUMP: If they did it by surprise...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it\u2019s an open discussion.CLINTON: He says...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: We could have gained if they did it by surprise.WALLACE: Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak.CLINTON: ... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.TRUMP: No, you are the one that\u2019s unfit. You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out \u2014 John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. He said some beauties. And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do.And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we\u2019re going in, and all of the people that we really wanted \u2014 the leaders \u2014 they\u2019re all gone. If you think that was good, then you do. Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both.CLINTON: Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he\u2019s supporting for president. And he has said...TRUMP: Which is a big mistake.CLINTON: ... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he\u2019s right.WALLACE: Let\u2019s turn to Aleppo. Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo. And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there \u2014 in fact, there are... TRUMP: It\u2019s a catastrophe. I mean...WALLACE: It\u2019s a catastrophe, but there...TRUMP: ... it\u2019s a mess.WALLACE: There are a quarter of...TRUMP: Have you seen it? Have you seen it?WALLACE: Sir...TRUMP: Have you seen what\u2019s happening to Aleppo?WALLACE: Sir, if I may finish my question...TRUMP: OK, so it hasn\u2019t fallen. Take a look at it.WALLACE: Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.TRUMP: That\u2019s right. And they are being slaughtered...WALLACE: Yes.TRUMP: ... because of bad decisions.WALLACE: If I may just finish here, and you also said that \u2014 that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who\u2019ve been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?TRUMP: Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It\u2019s a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the \u2014 from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what\u2019s happened.And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what\u2019s happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she\u2019s going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He \u2014 he aligned with Russia.He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.Now they have \u2014 he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don\u2019t want ISIS, but they have other things, because we\u2019re backing \u2014 we\u2019re backing rebels. We don\u2019t know who the rebels are. We\u2019re giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don\u2019t know who the rebels are. And when and if \u2014 and it\u2019s not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with \u2014 as bad as Assad is, and he\u2019s a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.If she did nothing, we\u2019d be in much better shape. And this is what\u2019s caused the great migration, where she\u2019s taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases \u2014 not probably, who are definitely...WALLACE: Let me...TRUMP: ... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see \u2014 this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, you have talked about \u2014 and in the last debate and again today \u2014 that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it\u2019s going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you\u2019re going to get into a war \u2014 his words \u2014 with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone \u2014 first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?CLINTON: Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I\u2019m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.We\u2019ve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He\u2019s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let\u2019s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we\u2019ve got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.WALLACE: Folks, I want to get into our final segment.TRUMP: But I just have to...WALLACE: Real quick.TRUMP: It\u2019s so ridiculous what she \u2014 she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they\u2019re in 32 countries.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: We should have \u2014 wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don\u2019t want the cease-fire anymore.We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn\u2019t there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way \u2014 and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton \u2014 no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent. That\u2019s the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first.TRUMP: Well, I say they\u2019re wrong, because I\u2019m going to create tremendous jobs. And we\u2019re bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we\u2019re bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don\u2019t have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we\u2019re taking back jobs. We\u2019re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don\u2019t make our product anymore. It\u2019s very sad. But I\u2019m going to create a \u2014 the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We\u2019ve given it up. We\u2019ve become very, very sloppy.We\u2019ve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don\u2019t use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don\u2019t use those people. Those are the people \u2014 these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gave \u2014 they made a campaign contribution and they\u2019re dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people.But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they\u2019ll make a lot of money. And we\u2019ll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, \u201cYou know, before you and President Obama were there,\u201d I think it\u2019s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, \u201cYou know, I alone can fix it,\u201d as he said on the convention stage.But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I\u2019m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it\u2019s one of the issues we\u2019ve got to come to grips with.So when I talk about how we\u2019re going to pay for education, how we\u2019re going to invest in infrastructure, how we\u2019re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I\u2019ve made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We\u2019ll have what economists call middle-out growth. We\u2019ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That\u2019s where growth will come from. That\u2019s why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family.And I think that\u2019s the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. And we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...TRUMP: Yeah, yeah, we\u2019ve heard \u2014 we\u2019ve heard this before, Hillary.CLINTON: I started off with \u2014 my dad was a small-business man.TRUMP: We\u2019ve heard this before.CLINTON: And I think it \u2014 you know, it\u2019s a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.WALLACE: Time.TRUMP: Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond?WALLACE: Well, no, sir, because we\u2019re running out of time...TRUMP: Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I\u2019ve been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: And frankly, now we\u2019re going to do it right.WALLACE: All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal \u2014 a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare\u2019s going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is \u2014 and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?TRUMP: I\u2019m cutting taxes. We\u2019re going to grow the economy. It\u2019s going to grow at a record rate of growth.WALLACE: That\u2019s not going to help in the entitlements.TRUMP: No, it\u2019s going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It\u2019s destroying our country. It\u2019s destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year \u201917, it is a disaster. If we don\u2019t repeal and replace \u2014 now, it\u2019s probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. It\u2019s \u2014 the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year they\u2019re going to go up over 100 percent.And I\u2019m really glad that the premiums have started \u2014 at least the people see what\u2019s happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can\u2019t get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.WALLACE: And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain \u2014 will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?CLINTON: Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That\u2019s part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald\u2019s, assuming he can\u2019t figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...TRUMP: Such a nasty woman.CLINTON: ... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.And I\u2019ll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after...TRUMP: Your husband disagrees with you.CLINTON: ... the long-term health care drivers. We\u2019ve got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.WALLACE: This is \u2014 this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you\u2019re going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven\u2019t prepared closing statements.So I\u2019d like you each to take \u2014 and we\u2019re going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary Clinton, it\u2019s your turn to go first.CLINTON: Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I\u2019m reaching out to all Americans \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, and independents \u2014 because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.You know, I\u2019ve been privileged to see the presidency up close. And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life\u2019s work.That\u2019s what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.Mr. Trump?TRUMP: She\u2019s raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn\u2019t work that way.But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It\u2019s called \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d We\u2019re going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don\u2019t take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. That can\u2019t happen.Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.All she\u2019s done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we\u2019ll see you in four years. We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you get when you get her.WALLACE: Thank you both.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton \u2014 hold on just a moment, folks. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.That brings to an end this year\u2019s debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you.While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. Thank you, and good night.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fashion Tech Giant Makes a Commitment to London", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byOn the RunwayLONDON \u2014 In the last two decades, London has forged a reputation as the technology capital of Europe and as a global capital of the fashion technology sector \u2014 a competitor to New York and Silicon Valley, where creative, commercial and digital talent thrives in a single cosmopolitan place. Some of the biggest names in the fashion industry, especially in e-commerce \u2014 such as Asos, Farfetch, Lyst and Yoox Net-a-Porter \u2014 have headquarters in the British capital.And while the fashion community has stayed relatively silent on the subject, there is little doubt that businesses have been mulling their options as European capitals on the Continent position themselves as worthy alternatives. Venture capital investments in Britain plummeted 40 percent in the second quarter this year compared with the first quarter, as uncertainty before the vote held investors back, according to data published this week by CB Insights.Although a majority of London\u2019s technology headquarters are in the east of the city, Alex Alexander, chief information officer of Yoox Net-a-Porter, said the company wished to stay in the west to be close to its other operational base, above the Westfield shopping center. Other big names in the local creative sphere said to be setting up offices in the White City development include the fashion label Stella McCartney and the Royal College of Art.\u201cWe were keen to show our commitment to the U.K.,\u201d Mr. Alexander said by telephone from New York, \u201cand felt that bringing all of our technology talent into a single hub was an important step in terms of bringing our five-year plan, which is based on outpacing our competition on mobile, to fruition.\u201dHe brushed off suggestions that London\u2019s reputation had been tarnished by the country\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.\u201cWe continue to have real confidence in London, regardless of the decision to leave the E.U., and see this investment as an opportunity to reaffirm that,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any side effects in terms of talent being drawn here. We are expecting to see a steady flow continue and think the city will remain a world-leading tech hub.\u201dFashion companies are not alone in doubling down on the British capital. Facebook and Google, among other American tech giants, also have plans to expand their London operations, investing in development and sales teams to fuel their European activities.Predictably, signs of major technology and fashion companies taking steps to expand its presence in London was met with open arms.\u201cI am delighted that there will be yet more new tech jobs coming to the capital,\u201d said Rajesh Agrawal, London\u2019s deputy mayor for business and enterprise. \u201cThis highlights once again that London is open for business, new investment and global talent.\u201dFor now, the signs for Britain are encouraging. Of Europe\u2019s technology unicorns \u2014 private companies with a valuation of more than $1 billion \u2014 almost 40 percent are based in the country. Nearly a third of all European venture capital funding comes to Britain.But it is still early. There is no certainty that Europeans working in Britain will be forced to leave once the withdrawal from the bloc is final, and a report by Balderton Capital shows that while engineers in Berlin or Paris earned on average almost 18 percent less than their London counterparts do, the devaluation of the pound was fast closing that gap.Whether entrepreneurs looking to start the next billion-dollar fashion technology business might favor Berlin, Dublin or Stockholm \u2014 which have established technology sectors and benefit from the European Union\u2019s free flow of labor \u2014 remains to be seen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byIn the 1990s, art found a new medium. Anarchic and unconstrained, the World Wide Web attracted an oddball collection of people ready to do almost anything and call it art. Often their work looked weird and amateurish, with pixelated graphics, tinny chiptune music and garish colors. But what it lacked aesthetically it made up for in conviction.In Australia, four women who styled themselves VNS Matrix posted a \u201cCyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century,\u201d followed by a vagina-framed poster in which they joyously proclaimed themselves \u201csaboteurs of big daddy mainframe.\u201d In Moscow, a young woman named Olia Lialina created \u201cMy Boyfriend Came Back From the War,\u201d a forking narrative, poignant and oblique, that combined text with grainy black-and-white imagery. An anonymous woman in Amsterdam, eventually identified as Martine Neddam, built a brightly colored site that purported to be the home page of a 13-year-old named Mouchette, after the girl in the 1967 Robert Bresson film who finds a life of torment and abuse too much to bear.In addition to salvaging the past, the aim is to tell the story of Internet-based art in an online gallery that serves much the same narrative function as the galleries in the Museum of Modern Art. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of amnesia about the history these things have,\u201d Michael Connor, Rhizome\u2019s artistic director, said as he sat in the New Museum\u2019s ground-floor cafe. \u201cThis is an opportunity to really be rigorous.\u201dBroadly speaking, the story Rhizome is telling can be divided into two parts, with the dot-com collapse of 2000-1 as the inflection point. The post-bubble side looks relatively familiar, facilitated as it is by high-speed, always-on connections and characterized by rapid commercialization and the emergence of social media and streaming video platforms like Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005) and Tumblr (2007).But before the bubble in internet stocks burst, before Google took over and Netscape collapsed and Apple was resurrected from near-death, the web was \u201can entirely new world,\u201d as Mr. Arcangel, 38, put it in a telephone interview from his home in Norway. \u201cSometimes it was not even clear what you were looking at \u2014 was it an artwork or a web server that was broken?\u201d Even so, he knew something exciting was happening.Net Art\u2019s political posture was characteristic of the feverish, techno-utopian excitement shared by netheads in general. \u201cThere was this radical idea that the internet was going to change the way art is made and shared,\u201d said Lauren Cornell, who was Rhizome\u2019s executive director from 2005 to 2012 and who has since moved to the New Museum as a curator and associate director of technology initiatives. \u201cThat it might even do away with traditional institutions and gatekeepers\u201d \u2014 that is, museums and curators.Preserving this work is not just a matter of uploading old computer files. \u201cThe files don\u2019t mean anything without the browser,\u201d Mr. Connor, 38, said. \u201cAnd the browser doesn\u2019t mean anything without the computer\u201d it runs on. Yet browsers from 15 or 20 years ago won\u2019t work on today\u2019s computers, and computers from that era are hard to come by and even harder to keep working.Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome\u2019s preservation director, has been working with the University of Freiburg in Germany to develop a sophisticated software framework that emulates outdated computing environments on current machines.\u201cVVEBCAM\u201d was provocative, and it got a strong response. \u201cPeople were really nasty,\u201d she said, \u201cand my policy was always to respond in a way that was equal to or greater than the comments they made.\u201d Rhizome intends to embed the video in a reconstructed YouTube player, but there\u2019s no way to recreate the reaction the video provoked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you were taking screen shots,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.\u201dWhich could be said for Net Art itself. \u201cNet Art is not over,\u201d Mr. Tribe said, \u201cbut it is over as an avant-garde art movement.\u201d In its place is art posted to the internet not by art world renegades but by professionals for whom the internet is one medium among many \u2014 people like Ms. Cortright or Mr. Trecartin, whose deliriously disjointed videos are equally at home on YouTube and at the Saatchi Gallery in London.The term that\u2019s being used is Post-Internet Art \u2014 not \u201cpost\u201d in the sense that the internet is over, but that it\u2019s ubiquitous. In the post-internet era, the internet is simply assumed.\u201cIt\u2019s different, now that everybody\u2019s online,\u201d said Ms. Cortright, 30. \u201cEven 10 years ago, it was not as much a part of people\u2019s lives as it is today.\u201d She considers it \u201cadmirable\u201d that Rhizome has committed itself to preserving artifacts from a past that\u2019s so recent and yet so distant, \u201cOtherwise, they really would be lost.\u201dAnd yet, she added, \u201cyou can\u2019t be too attached to something that\u2019s completely fleeting. I don\u2019t know. It just happens.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here are five guidelines to follow if you want more money to spend on presents this winter.If you\u2019re in that group that has procrastinating in its blood, you still have some time before things really get out of hand.\u201cThe prices start off pretty high, because people tend to have limited flexibility when it comes to Thanksgiving,\u201d Mr. Surry said. \u201cBut they stay flat up until probably three weeks out, when they start to ramp up, and in the last 10 days they really spike.\u201dSticking with the holiday theme, Mr. Surry said Halloween is a good marker for when you should have your Thanksgiving travel plans sorted out.Thanksgiving week is also a good guidepost for when to have your Christmas travel plans settled, though Hopper said booking in early October will give you the best rates. Skyscanner predicts that, based on its 2015 data, booking Thanksgiving week could offer savings of 6.41 percent compared with rates available after.Most people would love not to travel on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving just to avoid the crowds, but it\u2019s also one of the most expensive days to fly, along with the Saturday before and the Sunday after, Mr. Surry said.According to CheapAir.com, the Friday after Thanksgiving is not just good for retailers. Along with the following Tuesday, it\u2019s the cheapest return day. Hopper said flying on any day that week but Wednesday will be about 20 percent cheaper.If you\u2019re just looking to get away, the more options you consider, the better rate you may find.\u201cI think people have a lot more flexibility when it comes to when they\u2019re going to travel and where they\u2019re going to travel,\u201d Mr. Surry said of Christmastime travel. \u201cYou know you\u2019re all not necessarily going home for that holiday.\u201dAccording to Hopper, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Eve are the cheapest days to fly for the winter holidays. Departing on Tuesday, Dec. 20, and returning Thursday, Jan. 5, is the next best bet. Flexibility will also put Cyber Monday into play. Hopper said great deals were spotted last year in the week following Thanksgiving, \u201cif you\u2019re willing to travel at sort of strange times,\u201d Mr. Surry added.Unless you\u2019re really spontaneous, and don\u2019t really want to see your family, there\u2019s no good reason to gamble on last-minute bargains.\u201cParticularly around the holidays, there\u2019s such an increase in demand that you\u2019re much less likely to find a bargain, unless you have complete flexibility on where you\u2019re going to go,\u201d Mr. Surry said.Expedia.com analysis of 2015 data from September through November confirmed that airfare for Thanksgiving week was at its peak within six days of departure (an average of $390).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo Said to Have Aided U.S. Email Surveillance by Adapting Spam Filter", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byA system intended to scan emails for child pornography and spam helped Yahoo satisfy a secret court order requiring it to search for messages containing a computer \u201csignature\u201d tied to the communications of a state-sponsored terrorist organization, several people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Two government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Justice Department obtained an individualized order from a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court last year. Yahoo was barred from disclosing the matter.To comply, Yahoo customized an existing scanning system for all incoming email traffic, which also looks for malware, according to one of the officials and to a third person familiar with Yahoo\u2019s response, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.With some modifications, the system stored and made available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation a copy of any messages it found that contained the digital signature. The collection is no longer taking place, those two people said.The order was unusual because it involved the systematic scanning of all Yahoo users\u2019 emails rather than individual accounts; several other tech companies said they had not encountered such a demand.News of the order has opened a new chapter in a public debate over the trade-offs between security needs and privacy rights that has cast a spotlight on the sometimes cooperative, sometimes antagonistic relationship between Silicon Valley companies and the United States government.By contrast, Yahoo cooperated with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order, although the technical burden on the company appears to have been significantly lighter than the one the F.B.I. placed on Apple.The two government officials familiar with the matter said the digital signature Yahoo was ordered to look for last year was individually approved in an order issued by a judge, who was persuaded that there was probable cause to believe that it was uniquely used by a foreign power.Investigators had learned that agents of the foreign terrorist organization were communicating using Yahoo\u2019s email service and with a method that involved a \u201chighly unique\u201d identifier or signature, but the investigators did not know which specific email accounts those agents were using, the officials said.The Reuters article reported that in response to a \u201cbroad demand\u201d from the government, Yahoo had \u201csecretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers\u2019 incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials.\u201dAccording to the government officials, Yahoo was served with an individualized court order to look only for code uniquely used by the foreign terrorist organization. Two sources, including one of the officials, portrayed it as adapting the scanning systems that it already had in place to comply with that order rather than building a brand-new capability. The other official did not comment on the technology. The officials did not name the terrorist organization.Asked on Wednesday about the information obtained by The New York Times, Suzanne Philion, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said the company had nothing further to say. Earlier in the day, the company said in a statement that the Reuters article was \u201cmisleading.\u201d\u201cWe narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure,\u201d the Yahoo statement said. \u201cThe mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems.\u201dRichard Kolko, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, declined in a statement to discuss specific foreign intelligence collection techniques, but referred to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.\u201cUnder FISA, activity is narrowly focused on specific foreign intelligence targets and does not involve bulk collection or use generic key words or phrases,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States only uses signals intelligence for national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary people.\u201dThere is no engineering limitation preventing technology companies from using their spam and child pornography filtering systems to search email traffic for other sorts of digital signatures, said Hany Farid, chairman of the computer science department at Dartmouth, who helped develop the child pornography scanning system with Microsoft.But the use of that technology to carry out an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to search for a digital signature used by a foreign power is rare, and one of the officials portrayed it as innovative.\u201cThis is another example of how the government is pushing secretly novel or innovative interpretations of surveillance law\u201d to conduct wiretapping in broader ways than the public realizes, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society.The government has not released any intelligence court opinion explaining how the judge interpreted FISA to authorize such surveillance. Although Congress in June 2015 enacted a law that required the government to make public novel and significant rulings by the court, the order to Yahoo appears to have predated that legislation, the USA Freedom Act, by several months.Yahoo has an inconsistent record with meeting government data demands. In 2007, the company settled a lawsuit related to allegations that it helped the Chinese government crack down on journalists by passing along their Yahoo emails.But that year, the firm fought a legal battle, then secret, before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, challenging a mandate that it turn over, without a warrant, emails from user accounts the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency said belonged to noncitizens abroad who had been targeted for surveillance.Yahoo was not able to clarify details of the Reuters article on Tuesday because orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are secret by law, and an increasing number of other government requests come with gag orders that prohibit tech companies from even acknowledging they exist.Dozens of other companies have filed briefs in support of Microsoft. In its brief, Apple said it had received about 590 gag orders, of unlimited or indefinite durations, in the first eight months of 2016.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Follow Charlie Savage and Nicole Perlroth on Twitter @charlie_savage and @nicoleperlroth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should We See Everything a Cop Sees?", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "FeatureBody cameras have been promoted as a solution to police misconduct. But the strange two-year saga of Seattle shows just how complicated total transparency can be.Supported byO\u2019Toole\u2019s eighth-floor conference room, which has views of City Hall and Elliott Bay and the snow-capped Olympic Mountains, was packed with top police and city officials. All eyes were on a lawyer from the city attorney\u2019s office named Mary Perry. A former naval officer in her 60s, Perry was small and soft-spoken and favored pearls, and she was the city\u2019s unrivaled expert in the seemingly mundane intricacies of the state\u2019s Public Records Act. She was briefing the room on the potential fallout from a landmark case she had just argued and lost before the Washington State Supreme Court. The case stemmed from a series of public-records requests by a reporter for the local television station KOMO, Tracy Vedder, who began filing them after the same high-profile incidents that would lead to the consent decree. She asked for user manuals to the department\u2019s new system of in-car dashboard cameras, then for lists of dashcam recordings, then for some of the recordings themselves. After the department denied every one of them, Vedder sued it for violating the Public Records Act.The act, which dates to 1972, when governments ran on paper and our modern torrent of electronic data was unimaginable, is one of the strongest in the country. Washington State agencies cannot deny requests for records because the requester is anonymous or the request is too broad, nor can they deny requests simply in order to protect an individual\u2019s privacy; instead, agencies must redact only the details deemed sensitive under state code \u2014 for example, some addresses, sometimes the face of a minor \u2014 and disclose the rest. Before the court, Perry had argued that a different law, the state\u2019s Privacy Act, which allows departments to withhold recordings until related criminal or civil cases are resolved, should take precedent and the Seattle Police should be allowed to broadly deny Vedder\u2019s requests until the relevant statute of limitations ran out. The court disagreed.As Perry now told Wagers and the officials gathered in the chief\u2019s conference room, Seattle and other departments across the state were operating in a new reality. Only in cases under actual, pending litigation could the police withhold video footage from the people. This presented several problems. The first was logistical and financial: Seattle Police were sitting on more than 1.5 million individual dashcam and surveillance videos, or about 300,000 hours and 350 terabytes total. Before releasing any footage, someone in the department had to review and redact it in accordance with the specific privacy exemptions the state code did have. The process was manual, a painstaking, frame-by-frame ordeal. By one estimate, 169 people would have to work for a year just to fulfill the department\u2019s existing video requests, and the department added 2,000 new video clips daily. Perry feared that the new flood of data, especially but not exclusively video, could bankrupt Seattle if someone requested it all. \u201cIt\u2019s like being on the Titanic,\u201d she later told me, \u201cand you\u2019ve got a teaspoon to bail.\u201dThe second problem was privacy. Dashcam videos were already a concern, but Seattle had also been considering using body cameras. In fact, the Police Department was now preparing a small pilot program involving a dozen officers from a single precinct to test the hardware. Any footage that bodycams gathered, Perry warned, would also be subject to the Public Records Act. The department would have even more video to manage and release, but most worrisome was how fundamentally different, and more intrusive, this video would be. Unlike dashcams, bodycams, which are attached to an officer\u2019s uniform or purpose-built glasses, can go into homes and hotel rooms. Unlike dashcams, their default view during an arrest, or during a simple conversation with a victim or witness or informant, is an intimate close-up. Many people think of body cameras as a tool for police accountability, but the primary subject of their surveillance isn\u2019t the police \u2014 it\u2019s the public.\u201cI believe in open government, I really do,\u201d Perry told me, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think people have really wrapped their heads around all the implications.\u201d If the bodycam pilot was deemed a success, and the city expanded the program to the rest of its 850 front-line officers, all of them now walking surveillance cameras, what then?Wagers left the meeting stunned. \u201cI like to think I can walk into a room, take a complex problem and break it down into its component parts,\u201d he says. \u201cThis meeting, I walked out thinking: Wow, this is complicated. This is messy.\u201dClemans lived with his parents in a small, suburban house south of Seattle, sleeping in a bedroom decorated with a picture of the Space Shuttle and a free calendar from a local Chinese buffet. His bed was a mattress on the floor, and his electronic devices \u2014 computers, radios, keyboards \u2014 dominated the room. Clemans, who has sandy blond hair and wide blue eyes and walks with the stooped gait of someone who spends a lot of time in front of a computer, taught himself to code HTML at age 8. Home-schooled as a teenager to escape bullying, he was editing web pages for a hospital, where a friend from his parents\u2019 church worked, by 14. He taught himself basic JavaScript and CSS, and he learned the programming language Python after he showed up at a mathematics lab at the University of Washington and offered to volunteer in exchange for high-school credit. \u201cI just went there,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m very impulsive, and I don\u2019t like rules.\u201dDay 1 of his record attempt was a fluke. He was in the vicinity of the Space Needle and bored, so he took the elevator to the top. Something about being able to see the whole city at once captivated him. The next day, Clemans bought a $50 season pass. He learned of the previous record \u2014 60 consecutive days \u2014 and vowed to beat it. He came daily by bus and foot, an hourlong commute, often arriving early and staying late into the night.The Space Needle blooms out of the grounds of the 1962 World\u2019s Fair, a site north of downtown that is now known as Seattle Center. It is 605 feet tall. You enter through a plaza choked with Korean tourists and Andean flute musicians and Marine marching bands, then shuffle up a ramp to the east, above the gift shop and not far from a lineup of idling tour buses. Before handing over your ticket, you are asked to pose for a photo, then board one of three external elevators. When the elevator starts its ascent and the city comes into view, the people inside either fall silent or gasp out loud.From the observation deck, you can see mountains in four directions, water in two and, just to the south, a forest of skyscrapers. You also see a tangle of cranes; a city increasingly built by the likes of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates is booming. There are parks, markets, hidden gardens, tiny houses, tiny cars. Bulk carriers glide into port. Seaplanes land and take off. Helicopters float by. The lights of the radio towers on adjacent Queen Anne Hill, a seeming stone\u2019s throw away, blink on and off. Inside, a giant digital wall displays a shifting collage of visitor selfies, along with tourists\u2019 names and cities of origins. A joystick controls a high-definition camera mounted somewhere on the tower, allowing anyone to pan and zoom in on the unsuspecting people below, like a drone operator.The Space Needle became Clemans\u2019s office and his sanctuary. He brought his laptop, stuffing it into his backpack along with a toothbrush and toothpaste and self-help and business books, and got online with a wireless card. He exercised by walking laps around the outer deck. He offered to take tourists\u2019 photos, posed with them and answered their questions. He wrote code and blog entries. He stared at the city. It made sense from up there. It had patterns. Even its famously chaotic traffic had a predictable ebb and flow.\u201cThe sun is shining!\u201d reads one blog entry. \u201cI can see Rainier. People are happy. It doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d When he claimed the record on Day 61, he appeared on the evening news. He said he would keep going for a full year, then announced on his blog that he would go for even longer \u2014 1,825 days in a row. He began wearing a black jacket emblazoned with the words \u201cRecord Holder\u201d in block letters and spending more of his time talking to tourists, meeting people from all over the world. \u201cIt was an enjoyable eight-hour visit,\u201d he wrote in another entry. \u201cI finished reading \u2018Personal MBA\u2019 and memorized the five parts of a business and the 12 ways to create value.\u201dSome days he wrote about his attempts to stick to a routine. Others he dreamed up fanciful lists. \u201cWhen I own the Space Needle in 2034,\u201d he wrote on Day 107, \u201cI will do the following twenty things.\u201d One: \u201cI will sell tickets for $200 to the very top ... for $600 you can also hang off the side.\u201d Two: \u201cEach day the Space Needle will fly a flag. Most days the flag will be the photo of a random lucky guest.\u201d Four: \u201cFor $500 you and your spouse can sleep in an elevator.\u201d Sixteen: \u201cI will pay French Spider Man Alain Robert $10 million to climb a leg of the Space Needle once every day for a year.\u201d Eighteen: \u201cI will give the security bag checkers X-ray vision glasses.\u201d Nineteen: \u201cI will personally lead a walking tour for people struggling with suicidal thoughts.\u201d\u201cThis post is for me,\u201d reads the next day\u2019s entry. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to meet my goals like reading and writing computer code four hours a day. However, I\u2019m really good at meeting this one particular goal, going to the Space Needle every day. I\u2019ve been able to do so for 108 days straight for one simple reason: Going to the Space Needle everyday is more important than anything else. I have to do it. So when I\u2019m trying to achieve a goal, I just have to remember it\u2019s more important than anything else.\u201dAfter almost 160 days, Clemans had an altercation with a Space Needle employee. Before he could get on the elevator, she asked him to pose for a photo in the booth at the top of the ramp, just like the tourists. He had been asked to do it a hundred times. It was senseless, and it enraged him. \u201cI blew up at her,\u201d he says. Just like that, the world-record holder was banned from the Space Needle for life.Adrift, he disappeared from public view. He worked on code, dabbled in robotics and considered a career as a paramedic. He was pulled over for reckless driving and hired a lawyer known for his successful dashcam requests and, he claims, the video didn\u2019t entirely match the police report, so the court reduced the charges. He met a woman on OKCupid, getting her attention by suggesting that they go build sand castles together.One day in September 2014, Clemans was with his girlfriend when he read on his laptop that KOMO had prevailed over Seattle in the state\u2019s Supreme Court in June: Police video had to be released on demand. The Justice Department had just started its investigation of Ferguson, but Clemans\u2019s concerns were closer to home. KOMO posted only snippets. \u201cI was just mad that they were getting all this video but not making it all available,\u201d he recalls. He turned to his girlfriend and told her, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do police data as a hobby.\u201dSome police departments started sending videos immediately, some proposed installment plans and some announced they were delaying their bodycam programs. In Poulsbo, a town of 9,500 people across the Puget Sound from Seattle, the mayor desperately emailed her local state legislator and asked him to do something about the cameras and the Public Records Act.Unlike its smaller counterparts, the Seattle department did not give its unknown nemesis any footage. Clemans responded by programming a bot. It scraped the department\u2019s website for new case numbers, then automatically requested the corresponding police reports, firing off emails 10 times a day. The more the authorities denied him, the more his appetite grew. He asked the University of Washington for all its records dating back to \u201cthe formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.\u201d He filed requests with another 60 state agencies, demanding every email they had ever sent \u2014 600 million messages in all, according to a state estimate. The Department of Agriculture informed Clemans it would need 132 years to complete the job.Wagers decided to try a different approach. At Rutgers, he had been schooled in the reformist ideals of community policing. Like the longtime New York City police commissioner William J. Bratton \u2014 whose work when he led the Los Angeles Police Department was the subject of Wagers\u2019s Ph.D. dissertation and who, as it happened, was Chief O\u2019Toole\u2019s boss when he led the Massachusetts Metropolitan District Commission Police \u2014 Wagers liked to quote Sir Robert Peel, the founder of London\u2019s bobbies, who in the early 19th century established an Anglo-Saxon tradition of policing distinct from the militaristic us-versus-them Continental model. Peel taught that good policing was about building and holding public trust. \u201cIt\u2019s about engagement,\u201d Wagers told me. \u201cWe respond. We engage. It sounds kind of trite, but it\u2019s a different way of thinking.\u201d His new plan for dealing with Clemans, he says, \u201cwas like any other response to the community: We engage.\u201dOn Twitter, Wagers followed @PoliceVideo, an account that then belonged to the still-anonymous requester. The next day, the account tweeted at Wagers, asking him why the department was giving PowerPoint presentations to city leaders about the coming bodycam pilot program but not sharing the slides with the public. \u201cScrew it,\u201d @PoliceVideo tweeted when Wagers was too slow to respond. \u201cPutting in the request now. Wish you guys would just publish this stuff.\u201dBut Wagers offered to \u201cdo you one better,\u201d and he tweeted a phone number. \u201cHere\u2019s my cell,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI give it out to everyone. Call me & happy to answer questions.\u201d It was 6:57 p.m. One minute later, Wagers\u2019s phone rang. It was Clemans. He still didn\u2019t give his real name \u2014 he had been overwhelmed by media interest in his transparency fight \u2014 but readily accepted when Wagers invited him to lunch.The next day, Clemans met Wagers and Mary Perry at Police Headquarters. They ordered a pizza. Perry tried to explain that it was technically impossible for the department to release all its archived video anytime soon. Clemans countered with an idea he had. He called it \u201coverredaction.\u201d If the system was paralyzed by the need for frame-by-frame redactions, he wondered, why not automatically redact everything? That is, instead of jockeying with requesters, painstakingly reviewing each video, blurring out the protected parts and burning the results onto DVD after DVD, the department could just use software to lightly blur everything, then proactively publish each blurred video online. Push, not pull. Viewers would be able to make out enough to know if footage merited a specific records request and a more precise manual redaction, and they would presumably ask for only the segments they thought they needed; and no longer would the department be buried under its own video. He agreed to drop his mass requests if the department would try it out.In fact, Clemans said, he had stayed up all night writing a very rough version of the overredaction code and printed it out. He showed them what he had done.The cameras that Seattle planned to use in its pilot program \u2014 which would be worn on patrol by a dozen officers in its East Precinct, their video uploaded to a server at the end of every shift \u2014 were from two local companies: Vievu, which was founded by a former Seattle SWAT officer, Steve Ward, in 2007, and its main rival, Axon, a division of Taser that is responsible for the reliable spike in the parent company\u2019s stock after major police shootings. Together the two companies dominate a market that analysts believe will soon be worth a billion dollars a year, with much of the value coming from software and storage. Both Vievu and Axon offered bundles that paired their cameras with editing programs that ran in the cloud, processing them on computers maintained by Amazon Web Services or Microsoft\u2019s Azure, which are also Seattle-area companies.But neither bundle came cheap. The millions of dollars that major police departments were beginning to spend on bodycam contracts were millions they weren\u2019t spending on better training or new officers, and neither company had come close to perfecting automated redaction, without which Seattle Police would simply be collecting more footage without any better way to share it with requesters. Seattle needed an end-to-end software fix, Wagers realized, and Seattle was also a city full of programmers. So the day before the pilot program started, he also tried another experiment: With help from Clemans, he held the department\u2019s first-ever hackathon.The overflow crowd of 80 people was \u201cstraight out of central casting,\u201d Wagers says. \u201cSkinny jeans. Hoodies. People who had sued the department. People I know I\u2019d seen on the protest line the previous week.\u201d Clemans demonstrated his overredaction program: the world as if filmed through a beer glass, fuzzy but familiar, in which it was still possible (too possible, some worried) to tell who was tall and who was short and who was male and who was female and who was black and who was white and who was running and who was chasing. It was well received, and several programmers in the room offered to help Clemans improve the algorithm. But Clemans, volunteering his time and his skills, would be the linchpin. The pilot would run for six months, and if it went well, 12 officers would soon become 850.The next day, on Dec. 20, as TV stations aired reports on the department\u2019s innovative approach to transparency, the bodycam pilot began. Clemans and the department soon developed a rhythm: Some of the videos coming in from the East Precinct were saved to U.S.B. sticks, and Clemans, unpaid and on food stamps at the time, came downtown by bus to pick them up. He processed them on his bedroom computer, tweaking the overredaction program as he went, trying to code in the right balance of concealment and transparency.I watched more than a dozen hours of the video. There were no shootings. Most of it was routine police work, which may be why it was so disturbing to see online. In one set of videos that Clemans posted, a well-dressed white mother of two is pulled over late on a Friday night. She is composed until she fails a sobriety test. Then she pleads for a chance to call the babysitter \u2014 according to Facebook, where I found her because the video also revealed her name, she has a young daughter and younger son \u2014 before breaking down in loud screams and sobs in the back of a patrol car.Elsewhere in the state, also on YouTube, a body camera captures the inside of a woman\u2019s home as she explains how her accused stalker has been ignoring a restraining order. A father pleads with two officers to check in on his adult daughter, who he says has intellectual disabilities and has become involved with a man he believes is dangerous. Two college roommates accuse each other of theft and intimidation in their living room. A white woman apparently overdosing on meth, who cries out that she\u2019s pregnant, is restrained and given medical attention. A middle-aged black man opens his apartment door for a group of officers who inform him that he has been screaming all night. Slurring his words, he admits he\u2019s suffering from PTSD and that he has a history of heroin use. He refuses to let them take him to the hospital. He refuses even when an officer reminds him that he has been screaming like this off and on for a month. But now you can hear the fear in his voice. \u201cAm I screaming right now?\u201d he wonders.One of the first bodycam videos that Clemans uploaded shows a young black woman sitting on a bed in a hotel room. The officer wearing the camera is a disembodied voice but for a fleeting glimpse of his face and torso in a mirror. His manner is professional and sympathetic, and he says he doesn\u2019t want to arrest her. \u201cWill I be charged?\u201d she asks. \u201cLet\u2019s get to that later,\u201d he says. He asks her if she would be willing to talk to a counselor. \u201cSo you can get some other kind of job so you don\u2019t have to do this anymore, O.K.?\u201d he says. \u201cOur ultimate goal is that there is no prostitution, O.K.?\u201dHe begins filling out a form \u2014 Escort Face Sheet \u2014 on a clipboard. She answers every question, sharing the intimate details of her life. She tells him about her relationship with her boyfriend, her clashes with her strict father, her time as a runaway, her drift from strip clubs to Backpage.com escort ads, her few regular johns. She claims she\u2019s new to this work. She explains that she charges per hour or half-hour. She has a dog, she says. She can rely on her parents in times of need, she says. She gives him their street address. She gives him her full name. She shares her private email address and phone number. She shares all this with the camera too.When the interview is done, she asks about it. Is the image clear? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear, yeah,\u201d the officer says, but \u201cif the press wanted it, we can redact faces \u2014 can blur out the faces and whatnot.\u201d Body cameras are new to his city, and he doesn\u2019t know that what he just told her isn\u2019t entirely true. A lawyer will decide that the video is in no part exempt from the Public Records Act, and the officer will later be shocked to see it on YouTube. He will try and fail to have it taken down. The woman in the video is easy to find in her other internet life. She\u2019s on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, where she chats with friends and posts images of dresses and animals and nail polish. You can visit her parents\u2019 house on Google Street View.Body cameras can be knocked loose when the police rush a suspect, as the world learned in July when Alton Sterling was killed in Baton Rouge, La. Officers can likewise forget or claim to forget to turn the cameras on in time to record an incident in full, as protesters saw after they forced the police to release the inconclusive, partial bodycam footage of Keith Lamont Scott\u2019s shooting in Charlotte, N.C. But for slow-moving scenes like this one, in the hotel room with the young woman who seems to trust the officer with her privacy, the technology works almost too well. Bryce Newell, an information-science researcher now at Tilburg University in the Netherlands who did his fieldwork in Washington, interviewing Clemans and Wagers and riding along with officers as they tested their new bodycams, gave a clever name to the problem they posed in a society demanding transparency: \u201ccollateral visibility.\u201dOne of the first people revealed to the public by Clemans\u2019s transparency quest was Clemans himself. His mass records requests had drawn the interest of local reporters, who started filing requests of their own to the Police Department, seeking his identity. After they got his phone number, Clemans pre-emptively outed himself, embracing the role of tech seer. He published a letter in January 2015 explaining his mission on the website of the Seattle Privacy Coalition. \u201cI pushed the envelope,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso we as a society can once and for all address accurately recording of the truth, who should have access to the truth and what we are to do with the truth.\u201d He told the local news site Crosscut that the Public Records Act did need to be amended. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change until it becomes a massive problem,\u201d he said. He told Seattle Weekly that his experience with police videos had convinced him that certain things shouldn\u2019t be made public. He left the footage on YouTube precisely to make that point. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are going to deal with this until they have an emotional reaction,\u201d he said.Wagers stood before the crowd, about a hundred people in all, and gave a brief technical overview of the pilot program. Then an officer from East Precinct demonstrated how the bodycam worked, briefly filming the crowd as he did so. After that, one commissioner, David Keenan, a local lawyer, asked a group of waiting panelists to state, one after the other, when, exactly, the cameras should be on, and to answer a simple question about the evidence they create: Why do we want it? That is, whom does it serve? \u201cShould it only be used if there\u2019s an accusation against a police officer?\u201d he asked. \u201cShould it be used by criminal investigators and by defendants and by prosecutors?\u201dThe growing national welter of contradictory state laws and department policies signals that there is no settled answer. Some allow officers to view it before writing their reports. (That was the central issue earlier this month in Portland, Ore., that caused protesters to storm its City Hall, where police officers met them with bursts of pepper spray.) Some do not. Some treat all bodycam videos as public records; some limit their release. Some mandate a quick deletion of police video; some have no requirements to delete it at all. Some restrict the use of facial recognition software; most allow it. A technology meant for one purpose, once unleashed, is soon used for many others.One commissioner, Jay Hollingsworth of the Mohegan tribe, the chairman of the John T. Williams Organizing Committee, named for a hard-of-hearing Native American whose 2010 shooting was partly captured on dashcam, answered Keenan\u2019s \u201cwhen\u201d question simply: Bodycams should always be on. To his right, another commissioner, Jennifer Shaw, the deputy director of the A.C.L.U. of Washington, said that she agreed in theory but that her organization supported the cameras only if they were used exclusively for police accountability. Next, Ron Smith, a detective who then headed the Seattle Police Officers\u2019 Guild, said that he was also in favor of bodycams because he believed they would exonerate officers from complaints. But the cameras went into homes and on lunch and bathroom breaks, and officers absolutely had to be able to switch them on and off.At the end of the table were two activists, Marissa Johnson and Dan Bash. Johnson later became nationally known for leaping onstage at a Bernie Sanders rally, claiming the candidate\u2019s microphone and telling him he needed to do more to acknowledge the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThis conversation about bodycams is a complete and utter farce,\u201d she said. Forget the policy details. She did not consent to being recorded at all. She did not trust the police to do the right thing with the footage. Most of all, she did not trust prosecutors to use it to prosecute officers. \u201cWhy do I need a home video of my abuse that\u2019s going to be filmed by my oppressor?\u201d she asked.An uncomfortable silence filled the room. Then Hollingsworth announced that the other panelists had made him change his mind, leaving the two employees of the Police Department, Wagers and Smith, two white men, the only people onstage who clearly supported bodycams. The mood became tense, and members of the crowd interrupted the next speaker and soon assumed control of the room, taking turns denouncing police brutality and glaring at Smith, who was eventually escorted to his car by another officer.Three weeks later, the commission, the voice of the people, called for Seattle to delay full deployment of bodycams until the state law could be rewritten. \u201cThis is a new technology,\u201d the commission said in a news release, \u201cwhich may have unintended consequences.\u201dIn an essay published shortly after the White House announced its $75 million in bodycam funding in 2014, two authors of the study, Barak Ariel and Alex Sutherland, hypothesized that it was not cameras alone that drove the positive results; it was the fact that before every interaction with a citizen, officers in the trial were required to announce that they were recording. There may have been a \u201cself-awareness effect\u201d: Both parties were reminded at the moment of contact that they were under surveillance and that they should behave accordingly. One question was whether the effect would hold up if officers did not announce the cameras\u2019 presence. Another was whether it would hold up when the cameras lost their novelty.Ariel and Sutherland also worried about anyone basing decisions on a single study, which, no matter how rigorous, could well be a fluke, \u201cthe statistical equivalent of \u2018luck,\u2019\u2009\u201d they wrote. The Rialto sample was small. The notable drop in citizen complaints, for instance, was from 28 in the yearlong period before the study to 3 while it was underway. At least 40 reasonably scientific studies have followed Rialto, but many, according to a recent survey carried out by George Mason University, have yet to be published.Rialto suggests a drop in the use of force. A study from Arizona suggests a drop in arrests but a rise in citations. A separate Arizona study, along with one from London, suggests a rise in arrests. When Temple University researchers recently sifted through a Washington Post database of 986 deadly shootings of civilians by police in 2015, they found that when officers wore body cameras, civilians were 3.64 percent more likely to die. The increase was more pronounced, 3.75 percent, in the deaths of African-Americans and Hispanics and a barely measurable 0.67 percent in the deaths of Caucasians and Asians. They hypothesized that a different kind of self-awareness was at work: Officers, aware of their bodycams and more certain their use of deadly force would be seen as justified, were less likely to hesitate.After Rialto, Ariel and Sutherland set out to replicate their influential study on a much larger scale, collaborating with eight large and small police departments covering two million citizens in the United States and Britain. Their resulting analysis of 2.2 million officer hours, published this May, seems to validate their concerns that Rialto offered an incomplete picture. It found that police use of force actually went up by an astonishing 71 percent when officers could turn their cameras on and off at will and went down (by 37 percent) only when they recorded nearly every interaction with the public from start to finish. A second analysis of the same data, published late last month, supports Rialto\u2019s finding that citizen complaints drop significantly, almost to zero, when bodycams are present, while underscoring the authors\u2019 warning that more research is needed to understand how and why and under what conditions. \u201cIt may be that in some places it\u2019s a bad idea to use body-worn cameras,\u201d Ariel said in announcing the May results, \u201cand the only way you can find that out is to keep doing these tests in different kinds of places.\u201dThe videos didn\u2019t shake the local opposition to bodycams, and they didn\u2019t meet the standards of the state Public Records Act \u2014 if asked, Seattle would have to provide more precisely redacted versions \u2014 but they met a national need for positive news about the police. The YouTube channel was featured on the \u201cToday Show,\u201d and the department\u2019s innovation was the subject of coverage, some skeptical and some not, by The Guardian, Vice News, \u201cMarketplace,\u201d \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d and The New York Times. The tech press couldn\u2019t get enough. One well-reported article in the online publication Backchannel called Clemans \u201cthe body-cam hacker who schooled the police.\u201dWagers began receiving calls and email from departments around the country. The future of policing, he saw, was now more than ever reliant on what technology the police could afford to buy from companies like those that built modern Seattle. He pledged that Clemans\u2019s code, once completed, would be open-source and freely shared so that smaller agencies, which didn\u2019t have the staff to handle video-records requests, let alone the money for bundled bodycam contracts, could stay on the cutting edge. In one overredaction test, the department processed 2,400 videos in three hours on rented Amazon Web Services computers in the cloud, a task that would have gummed up the public-disclosure unit of the Seattle Police for weeks had the files been redacted manually. The computer rental cost the department $1.20 \u2014 40 cents an hour \u2014 Wagers marveled. To meet the demands of the Public Records Act, all Clemans needed to do was get his algorithm to redact only faces and other private details, rather than the full frame.Clemans was now an employee: The department had offered him a six-month contract at $22.60 an hour. But when the pilot program ended in July, and the question of whether to expand it loomed, he still had not perfected his code. He was trying to solve a problem, mostly by himself, that teams of professional engineers at Taser and its rivals have yet to fully crack. Distracted, he noticed other inefficiencies at Police Headquarters and he felt increasingly compelled to fix them. After visiting the understaffed 911 center, then in the news for its slow response times, he came up with a new idea: a program that automatically highlighted the most pressing calls, allowing dispatchers to be more efficient. But the captain in charge of the 911 center didn\u2019t welcome his intrusion, and he belittled the idea at a tense late-August meeting brokered by their superiors. Clemans, by his own admission, \u201cgot really mad.\u201d He swore at the captain. He yelled until he had to be escorted from the building. And just like that, in an echo of his Space Needle blowup, he was exiled from headquarters. He made a threat on his way out: \u201cI\u2019m going to P.D.R.\u201d \u2014 public-disclosure request \u2014 \u201cthe [expletive] out of you,\u201d he shouted.In September 2015, when Seattle won a $600,000 Justice Department grant to expand the bodycam program to the rest of the police force, which the mayor pledged to more than match, Clemans wasn\u2019t there to help celebrate. He was working remotely, back in his bedroom or hunched over a laptop at the Starbucks he now frequented on the 40th floor of Columbia Center, the tallest building in town, where the views were stunning and free.Days after the grant announcement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch came to Seattle to declare it a national model for police reform. The federal monitor overseeing the consent decree, who had previously lauded the overredaction experiment when calling for rapid deployment of bodycams, now praised the department\u2019s systematic approach to investigating any use of force \u2014 a significant change from the cursory reporting of the past. Wagers, meanwhile, was helping Chief O\u2019Toole to select his replacement. He had by then been in Seattle and away from his wife and children for more than a year.On Oct. 29, 2015, a week after Wagers announced he was leaving the department, Clemans texted in his own resignation. He no longer believed the department could ever truly be transparent on its own, he told me. His time inside the department, far from co-opting him, had weaponized him after his blowup with the 911 captain: He knew even better which records to request. He wrote a new bot capable of sending the department up to 10,000 requests in 24 hours. He asked for 911 records, \u201ctables & columns of all databases,\u201d all front-facing dashcam video from 2014 and \u201call computer codes written by Tim Clemans.\u201d Over the next few days, he piled on, requesting \u201call roll-call notes,\u201d text records from the department\u2019s license-plate scanners, the source codes of key department software and \u201call Outlook calendars of supervisors, managers & command staff.\u201d He also started building a website where he would publish it all, which he called the People\u2019s NSA. He expanded his demands to include every public record in every format \u2014 paper, tape or digital \u2014 the City of Seattle had. He soon asked 39 neighboring cities for the same. By the end of 2015, according to a study on public-records requests he obtained via a public-records request, Clemans had filed 2,272 requests to the Seattle Police Department alone, making him again its No. 1 antagonist. One day at her office, Mary Perry showed me a printout of the latest ones, five pages long. \u201cWe\u2019re being crippled,\u201d she said. Wagers was on his way home, Clemans was making more demands than ever and she was back where she started.Searching for blurred video of a crime down your block may someday be as easy as searching for a restaurant on Google Maps. But a new state law making footage harder to request in bulk \u2014 the Tim Clemans Act, his friends called it \u2014 had just gone into effect thanks to the efforts of Poulsbo, the small town that had contacted its state representative. Clemans had also been studying YouTube\u2019s privacy policy, and he would soon decide to remove the videos he posted there from public view.

{"Headline": "Telecoms\u2019 Ambitions on Targeted Ads Seen Curbed by F.C.C.\u2019s New Privacy Rules", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byIn recent years, companies like Verizon and AT&T have made no secret of their ambitions to build online advertising businesses that can take on the behemoths of Silicon Valley.\u201cThe challenge for Verizon and AT&T is that both companies have made big acquisitions that hinge largely on their ability to monetize advertising inventory more effectively, and the way they plan to do that is by targeting it better,\u201d said Craig Moffett, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cIf their hands are tied by the new F.C.C. rules, then that\u2019s a very, very big deal.\u201dCurrently, broadband providers can track users unless individuals specifically ask them to stop. The F.C.C. decision, set to take effect in about a year for major providers, has been hotly contested, in part because the rules apply only to internet service providers, or I.S.P.\u2019s. They do not extend to online ad juggernauts like Google and Facebook \u2014 web companies that the F.C.C. does not regulate \u2014 which has spurred complaints of a double standard.Companies like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T are only a small portion of the targeted-ad industry, but are seen as having great potential because of their broad view of online habits. Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C., has contended, however, that while consumers may choose not to go on Facebook or use Google, they need I.S.P.s to get access to the internet, a view in line with the agency\u2019s classification of broadband providers as utilitylike services.Innovation in the advertising industry is currently centered on understanding consumer behavior across devices to better place, track and measure ads, said David Cohen, president of North America at Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm.\u201cGetting a single view of you or me as I go from PC to tablet to mobile to television \u2014 that\u2019s a real hot area in the marketing space,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThe ones who have the best visibility into that today are the big walled gardens, and that\u2019s primarily Google and Facebook.\u201dVerizon has been trying within the last six months to leverage some nonpersonally identifiable information for improved targeting across AOL\u2019s properties, which include MapQuest, The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, according to Mr. Cohen.\u201cOn paper, what they\u2019re telling the ad community is they will be able to use Verizon data to inform our ability to buy across devices,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThis will impede that.\u201dStill, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a death knell for the advertising or marketing industry, as we have other ways around to get similar kinds of data.\u201dVerizon said it already sought permission from its broadband customers for certain data, like browsing and location history.\u201cWe believe that the standards the F.C.C. announced on Thursday are consistent with Verizon\u2019s longstanding privacy practices,\u201d said Karen Zacharia, Verizon\u2019s chief privacy officer.Critics of the ruling include broadband provider advocates, advertising trade groups and some web firms. Christopher Yoo, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania who spoke to the F.C.C. about the technical implications of the rules, said in an interview that he told the agency \u201cthe most expansive interpretation would cause the internet to break.\u201d\u201cRight now, it\u2019s limited to the I.S.P.s, but what it will do is open up the issue of whether the rest of the digital universe and mobile universe should remain on the current model,\u201d said Dick O\u2019Brien, executive vice president of government relations at the American Association of Advertising Agencies, a trade group.The move could be challenged in court. Companies can sue to overturn the privacy regulation, though AT&T, Comcast and Verizon said they were still reviewing the details of the rules and did not say whether they would pursue a legal challenge.\u201cAt the end of the day, consumers desire services that shift costs away from them and towards advertisers,\u201d AT&T said in a statement. \u201cAlthough the F.C.C.\u2019s decision inhibits the ability of I.S.P.s (and I.S.P.s alone) to bring those services to consumers, we anticipated the F.C.C.\u2019s decision and continue to expect that targeted advertising will be a growth area for us.\u201dComcast declined to comment.The effect on consumers is not yet clear. Carriers could charge more for blocking data collection, though the F.C.C. said it would monitor \u201cpay for privacy\u201d offers. Mr. O\u2019Brien warned that consumers could be bombarded with annoying \u201copt-in\u201d requests from I.S.P.s. Mr. Yoo said the complexity created within companies, where Yahoo may not be able to share certain information with Verizon, will stifle innovation.The decision has had the unusual effect of casting major telecommunications companies as victims in a world dominated by Silicon Valley firms. AT&T and Verizon, for example, each make more than $100 billion in revenue a year, while Comcast\u2019s annual sales top $70 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prepaid Debit Cards Users Will Get New Federal Protections", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byPrepaid debit cards are a financial lifeline for many people, but a risky one. They lack many of the basic consumer protections that credit cards and bank debit cards are required to offer. That will change next year, with a raft of new federal rules intended to clamp down on a product that has been growing rapidly despite concerns about high fees, poor disclosures and weak protections for customers when something goes wrong.\u201cThe rules bring prepaid cards out of the shadows, with protections that in many ways are stronger than those for traditional bank accounts,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, the associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, which lobbied for the new rules. For instance, she said, the rules require clear fee disclosures and limits on overdraft fees \u2014 protections she would like to see extended to bank accounts.Prepaid card issuers will also have to offer liability protection on par with the coverage that applies to credit cards. If a customer\u2019s prepaid card is lost or stolen and the cardholder notifies the provider within two days of discovering the loss, responsibility for unauthorized charges will generally be capped at $50.In late 2014, the agency released a draft of the rules. The final version, released this week, covers a broad swath of products, including government cards used for Social Security payments and other benefits, payroll cards and funds stored in mobile apps like PayPal and Google Wallet.One of the most controversial provisions in the new rules relates to the credit lines some providers offer on their cards, which kick in when a customer\u2019s balance dips below zero. Those fees can take customers by surprise and become a debt trap, critics say.The rules require prepaid card merchants to evaluate a customer\u2019s ability to repay before issuing them a credit line, and impose a 30-day waiting period before companies can offer a credit line on a new card account.In response to the new rules, the trade group said in a statement, \u201cWhile we are still analyzing the lengthy final rule to determine its full impact, it is already clear that the C.F.P.B. has dismissed many of our serious concerns and moved forward with a rule that will harm the very consumers it aims to protect.\u201dBy contrast, consumer advocates praised the changes as vital protections for cardholders.\u201cResearch shows many consumers turn to prepaid cards to control spending and to avoid overdraft fees,\u201d said Nick Bourke, the director of consumer finance at the Pew Charitable Trusts.But the new regulations do not directly address one of the biggest hardships for prepaid card customers: the cascade of financial problems that system failures can set off.The rules do not detail remedies and penalties for such incidents, but they give regulators more leeway to hold companies accountable.\u201cNo amount of rule making can create a force field around providers\u2019 systems and products to categorically prevent this from happening in the future,\u201d said Kristine Andreassen, a lawyer with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Advertisement"}

Near the end, teachers stepped onto the stage to deliver speeches.\u201cGirls, I hope you will focus on finding your life partners,\u201d said the Chinese-language teacher, with the same stern air as when she urged us to succeed on the college entrance exam. \u201cMarriage cannot be delayed,\u201d the biology teacher said. The physical education teacher offered to set up single alumnae with eligible bachelors at her husband\u2019s company.At the dinner afterward, the conversation at my table turned to career changes. A friend surprised everyone by announcing that she would move to Shenzhen, a southern city, to look for a new job. Marveling at her courage but concerned about her decision, another classmate asked if she was aware of the \u201ccomplications\u201d faced by a childless woman seeking employment in her late 20s.My female classmates and I, beneficiaries of China\u2019s economic boom, are cruising along exciting professional paths. Yet the country\u2019s shifting social conditions carry more complex implications for our lives than first meets the eye. Social changes that have given urban Chinese women new liberties and ambitions often impede our freedom in other ways, erasing policies and ideologies that had helped diminish gender differences.What are the barriers or opportunities you\u2019ve experienced?Decisions about having children can serve as leverage for women in domestic bargaining. This power is amplified by the government\u2019s recent move to scrap the one-child policy and allow all couples to have two children. And sometimes women resort to extraordinary measures to share in homeownership.Two years ago, the elderly couple who lived next door with their son and daughter-in-law unexpectedly traded their spacious apartment for two humbler dwellings. I later learned that the young woman had been refusing to conceive until her husband\u2019s parents gave her a home of her own.But the overall impact of these social changes on women\u2019s work-family choices is distressing.Housework and child-rearing have always fallen on women\u2019s shoulders, even during the Mao era, when women were held up by the government as men\u2019s equals. Their responsibilities increased in the reform period, beginning in early 1980s, as the state rolled back child care support and the middle class began to invest in early-childhood education. In the meantime, women also began to pursue careers of their choosing, and to compete with men under the new rules of the market economy.While many mothers, like my own, managed to juggle their domestic duties and professional tasks with remarkable grace, the demands on women without significant spousal support or social policy protection create an impossible balancing act.\u201cRaising two children in Beijing would definitely cost me my job,\u201d a friend who works in marketing at Google in Beijing confessed to me, explaining why she would not take advantage of the end of the one-child policy.Also daunting is the widespread pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. \u201cA woman used to have an easy time finding a job after she had given birth once,\u201d said a classmate at my high school reunion. \u201cNow employers have reasons to worry twice.\u201dBut the decree merely reflected what was already taking place. Married couples care for their elderly parents in most urban families, studies show, with the bulk of the responsibilities falling on women. Wives are often expected to care for their own parents as well as their husbands\u2019.A few days ago, a female acquaintance who works in a state publishing house told me, matter-of-factly, that she had rejected a well-qualified female job applicant for an editor position because the woman, being single at 36, clearly \u201chas severe personality flaws\u201d or \u201cpsychological issues.\u201dIn 2013, a 23-year-old female college graduate from Beijing filed a lawsuit against a tutoring firm for turning down her job application. The company rejected her, she explained to the news media, because it said that the post of executive assistant required a man, someone who could carry out physical tasks such as refilling the bottle on a water dispenser.\u201cFinally someone is standing up to protest,\u201d said the woman\u2019s lawyer.Helen Gao is a social policy analyst at a research company.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Surfing Under the Northern Lights", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "There\u2019s a thriving surf scene in Norway\u2019s Lofoten Islands, where the waves are cold and the air is colder.Supported byUNSTAD, Norway \u2014 This was all new to Tim Matley, a thin and boyishly blond Australian, who found himself above the Arctic Circle for the first time in this remote village with as many surf shops (two) as sheep farms.His usual itinerary was six months of surfing in Australia, then six months in Indonesia. If the waves were high, that was great, as long as the temperature was higher. He had never before worn a hood, gloves and boots in a competition. In fact, he had seldom worn a wet suit.\u201cI like to feel my toes in the wax,\u201d Matley, 34, said. \u201cIn boots, I can\u2019t feel anything.\u201dThe valley at his back rose to a mountainous amphitheater. A crescent bay opened before him, its exposed, rocky points known for catching North Atlantic swells the way a net catches fish.\u201cIt\u2019s unreal how many people surf in conditions like this,\u201d Matley said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, but it\u2019s so cold. At least I got to see my first northern lights. That was good.\u201dAdvances in the design of wet suits, which are made from neoprene, a synthetic rubber, have pushed surfing far beyond the summery, \u201cGidget,\u201d \u201cSurf City\u201d culture of midcentury Hollywood and pop music.Since the 1990s, and especially in the last decade, enhanced insulation in the suits has opened some of the most frigid reaches of the world \u2014 Alaska, Antarctica, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden \u2014 to surfers seeking isolated adventures, craggy nature and uncrowded and unexplored waves.\u201cEveryone has done the tropics,\u201d said Timothy Latte, 25, a Swede who won the 2015 Lofoten Masters. \u201cCold-water surfing is the new black.\u201dToday\u2019s wet suits, which often cost $200 to $500 but can run to $1,000, are warm, light and flexible. Some come with battery-powered heat. All provide far more reliable protection from the cold than early, improvised gear fashioned from wool sweaters coated in oil; rain jackets and pants taped at the wrists, waist and ankles; dishwashing gloves; bathing caps; and generous slatherings of petroleum jelly.Satellite images provided by Google Earth and Google Maps have also brought a sense of discovery to places more reachable by bush plane, boat, helicopter and snowmobile than dune buggy.At the same time, residents of some remote locales have begun wrestling with the complicated balance of welcoming larger numbers of surfers while keeping pristine settings safe and unspoiled.Unstad, population 15, is among the Lofoten Islands, an archipelago that juts like an arthritic finger from Norway\u2019s west coast into the Atlantic Ocean, more than 100 miles above the Arctic Circle.With consistent waves and the rugged beauty of mountains that drop into the sea, the village is relatively easy to reach by car, ferry or plane. And despite Matley\u2019s protestations, it is warmed somewhat by the Gulf Stream.While the water temperature can dip into the 30s during winter, when snow powders the mountains and daylight is a smudgy twilight, the surf averages about 45 degrees Fahrenheit and can climb to the mid-50s during summer.During the Lofoten Masters on Oct. 7 and 8, the air temperature reached 45 and the bay reached 50. Coming out of the water seemed far chillier than being in the water.The 28 male and eight female competitors were mostly semiprofessionals from Norway, Sweden, Brazil, Australia, South Africa, Russia and France. Most were living in Norway or working seasonal jobs or following a boyfriend or girlfriend. They rented surf shop cabins, drove pop-top campers or slept in tents under the northern lights, drawn by the tranquillity and splendor and muscle of the surroundings.\u201cWhen you first see the mountains and the valley and the power of the waves, it\u2019s intimidating,\u201d said Thiago Martins, 40, a Brazilian who played college and professional soccer in the United States and surfs when he is not teaching special-needs children or coaching a semipro Norwegian team.\u201cThe first time I was here, my heart was pounding,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt small, scared. But you also connect with nature, and it embraces you.\u201dIn autumn in Unstad, when the valley flames with the gold of birch trees against the red of the houses, there are often more sheep than people on the beach. The waves rumble like subway cars, foaming on white sand and rounded rocks that, from a distance, resemble a colony of seals.\u201cSheep poo is a good sign,\u201d said Manuel Palacios, 26, of Spain, a judge for the Lofoten Masters. \u201cIt means there is not a big hotel in the middle of the beach.\u201dAnd yet more and more people are coming to surf in the midnight sun of summer and to camp and to hike mountain trails with breathtaking views. There have been accidents. In September, a man from Finland was trapped in a rip current, fell from his kayak and drowned.Where there was once only a handful of people surfing on a summer day, locals said, there might be 50 or more now, not many for Hawaii, maybe, but a crowd for Unstad. There are no public toilets on the beach and only limited parking.\u201cLike any activity, when you have too many people crammed together, you can feel like you\u2019re in jail,\u201d said Kristian Breivik, 46, who owns the Lofoten Surfsenter in Unstad and has surfed here since 1988.\u201cBut everybody is welcome,\u201d Breivik said. \u201cI\u2019m a businessman. You can\u2019t stop tourism. I\u2019m proud to be from this place. But we have a huge responsibility for keeping it natural and beautiful and providing for basic needs.\u201dTorstein Krogh, 68, a community leader who was born in Unstad, said the surfers \u2014 yearly estimates range from 2,000 to 5,000 or more \u2014 were generally welcomed. But, he added, \u201cwe should be prepared for them\u201d with bathrooms, more spacious parking and electrical hookups for campers.A tourism tax is being considered to upgrade facilities in Lofoten. Yet some locals in Unstad, an insular place with a mostly older population, clearly need convincing that more surfing is better, as evidenced by a homemade \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign near the beach during the Lofoten Masters.\u201cOld people don\u2019t want change,\u201d Krogh said. \u201cThey are dinosaurs. But the No. 1 law of nature is change.\u201dAmong the first surfers at Unstad were two Norwegians named Thor Frantzen and Hans Egil Krane, who arrived with teenage possibility in 1963. Krane, now 70, had been to Australia on a cargo ship. A dockworkers\u2019 strike extended his stay in Sydney for two months, and he witnessed something at Bondi Beach that he had never seen: surfing.Having tried it, Krane returned home and excitedly told Frantzen: \u201cMen are standing on boards. There are a lot of nice beaches in Norway. Why can\u2019t we do it here?\u201dThey were young and hardy, with careers ahead as commercial divers. There was no place to buy surfboards in Norway, so the two began to make their own from what they described as rigid foam wrapped in newspapers and coated with a shell of polyester resin and fiberglass.Two of their early boards still exist. One looks more like a kayak than a surfboard. It is thick and yellow, and some jokingly call it the banana board. Frantzen\u2019s grandson can still ride it. The other board is more professional and familiar in its retro design, white with blue and black stripes, modeled from the cover of the Beach Boys\u2019 1962 album, \u201cSurfin\u2019 Safari.\u201dWith no wet suits, Frantzen and his friend began surfing in bathing suits. Ten or 15 minutes in the water, and they had to escape the cold. Later, they wore wool sweaters under stiff, rubbery diving suits. If there were other surfers in Norway, they did not know of them.\u201cPeople looked at us like we were from another planet,\u201d said Frantzen, 67.To be honest, Krane said, the boards were probably more effective atop the car than atop the waves.\u201cIt was an easy way to meet the girls,\u201d he said.When Frantzen\u2019s daughter, Marion, began surfing Unstad in 1991, she said that residents were \u201chorrified\u201d and warned her: \u201cDon\u2019t go to the beach. It\u2019s going to be dangerous.\u201dAfter her parents opened a camping business and began to rent surfboards in 2003, Marion Frantzen said, even her father came to consider it a waste of money. Marion, 45, and her husband, Tommy Olsen, 47, bought the business, expanded it and renamed it Unstad Arctic Surf. They provide cabins, a restaurant, surf gear and lessons, and they organize the annual Lofoten Masters.In 2013, they secured a corporate sponsor, gathered a field of 105 surfers and gave out $10,000 in prize money. But the couple were \u201ca little over our heads,\u201d Olsen said, then joked, \u201cWe\u2019re still struggling with anxiety attacks.\u201dNow, the tournament is more casual, focused as much on the social aspect of surfing as the competitive side. At Unstad Arctic Surf, the decorative vibe is decidedly hang-loose and tropical, with Polynesian carvings on the walls, a souvenir Waikiki license plate and a ukulele in a stairway and a mannequin wearing a grass skirt and coconut bra in the dining room.The competitors in the Lofoten Masters wore wet suits that Thor Frantzen and Krane, Unstad\u2019s surfing pioneers, could never have imagined: thin coatings of titanium designed to trap and reflect body heat; inner linings said to transform body heat into infrared energy that enhanced warmth and blood flow; and high-tech seams that restricted cold water from flushing through the suit with waterproof tape, glue, liquid urethane welds and a clever technique called blind stitching.Most competitors wore what are called 6/5/4 or 5/4/3 wet suits, a reference to the thickness of the neoprene in millimeters. The suits are thicker in the torso and thinner and more flexible at the extremities to ease movement of the arms and legs.\u201cWhen we started, the suits were so dense we were like Sumo wrestlers wearing armor,\u201d said Breivik, the surf shop owner.Some surfers and industry experts question whether science lives up to marketing with the latest wet suit innovations. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely no empirical peer review that goes on,\u201d said Matthew Miller, 47, a lawyer and the chief executive of True Wetsuits, a company based in California that manufactures surf wear for Unstad Arctic Surf.Yet no one is seeking a nostalgic return to the days when hands grew crabbed and numb from surfing and then struggled to open a car door with a key.Describing his youth, Miller said with a laugh, \u201cYou do not know pain until you are huddled around, hoping someone can get their fingers warm enough to open the lock and you\u2019re starting to cry because it hurts so bad.\u201dAt the Lofoten Masters, there was no need to jump into a car to get warm. Olsen, the chief organizer, towed a portable sauna to the beach, affixed with a sign on the door: \u201cPlease Do Not Be Naked.\u201d A candy and ice cream stand from the surf school was converted to a judging tower. Hot dogs, hamburgers and lamb stew were cooked on a grill.Olsen served as the tournament marshal, livestream commentator and exuberant public address announcer, even mimicking the sound of a horn to signal the end of each heat. In a playful reference to the American presidential election, he wore a hat that read, \u201cMake Longboarding Great Again.\u201dOn the first day of competition, a slight onshore wind blew perpendicular to the beach. Head-high waves formed quickly and then collapsed. The surfers took it in stride. Most had been in far more challenging conditions.In 2013, Markus Wegge, 28, traveled with his two brothers to Bear Island, about 250 miles north of Norway\u2019s mainland in the Barents Sea, to make a documentary about food waste. For two months, the brothers lived in a teepee-like tent, using driftwood for heat and eating food that had been discarded by supermarkets and the military or scavenged by Dumpster diving.After duck-diving two or three times beneath the waves in 28-degree water, Wegge said: \u201cYour brain freezes. It starts on top and moves to the side of your ears. Like a vise. Your chin gets stiff. We tried to whistle but we couldn\u2019t. But it was fun to surf someplace that\u2019s never been surfed.\u201dOn the second day of the Lofoten Masters, the waves were smaller but more defined and accommodating for tricks. Aanestad, 29, the Norwegian champion and an architect, won the women\u2019s competition. She was one of the few surfers, perhaps the only one, at the contest who owned a heated vest.Wet suits heated by batteries were introduced by Rip Curl, an Australian company, in 2007 and were tested in Unstad. The suits, often worn as vests beneath a full wet suit, have been described as electric blankets for the water, designed to heat the core so that blood will continue to flow toward the extremities. But some surfers expressed concern about the cost, the battery life and an intrusion of too much technology.\u201cIt\u2019s a little like cheating; you are supposed to be a little cold,\u201d Aanestad said good-naturedly. \u201cBut I feel less pain in my back. And my feet go numb before the battery wears down.\u201dHer vest, though, was made for men. Because so few women surf in Norway, Aanestad said, surf shop owners are reluctant to carry the latest in thermal gear for them, including suits with attached hoods, afraid of losing money.\u201cIt\u2019s a little disappointing,\u201d Aanestad said.The men\u2019s final featured three former champions. One was Latte, the Swede. Another was Gil Ferreira, 30, of Brazil, a four-time winner who said he learned to surf as a boy using a container for carrying coconuts that he sold on the beach.On his first trip to Unstad seven years ago, he tried surfing without gloves and boots. \u201cMy legs felt like stumps,\u201d Ferreira said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand on the board.\u201dAnother previous winner, Shannon Ainslie, 32, of South Africa, surfed with power and a certain fearlessness that had been frighteningly hard-earned.\u201cMaybe that\u2019s another reason why I came here,\u201d said Ainslie, who works at the Lofoten Surfsenter. \u201cTo stay away from sharks.\u201dIn the final, though, no one matched the speed, flow and commitment of Matley, the Australian who made for an improbable champion.Beforehand, he stood outside the sauna, wanting to spend a few minutes inside but worried that he would get too hot. He wore a thinner suit than most competitors. And he felt that his front foot gripped his board too tightly in neoprene boots.But in the final, Matley was a model of ambition, power and control, assured technically and stylistically with his snap turns, weightless-seeming floaters along the lips of waves and a 360-degree maneuver called an air reverse.\u201cHe knows how to rip a wave!\u201d Olsen shouted into the public address system.Afterward, Matley shivered as he was announced the winner and sprayed with champagne.\u201cHe\u2019s never been so cold in his life,\u201d Aanestad, his girlfriend, said with a laugh.The next day, Matley was returning to Australia. He did not plan to wear a wet suit for nearly a year. \u201cI should burn it,\u201d he joked.That would not be an option for anyone who continued to surf in Unstad.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Virtual Gathering of Feminist Artists", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byThe Art of CollectingLONDON \u2014 The phrase \u201cartists collective\u201d conjures a mental picture of people sharing materials and studio space to work on their creative projects.The word \u201cbunny\u201d sounds soft, cute and harmless.But challenging old modes is precisely what Bunny Collective is about. Founded in 2013 by Samantha Conlon, then an art-school student in Cork, Ireland, the group is making a name for itself with its collaborative working style, its focus on women\u2019s issues, and its outreach to local communities.\u201cThe Bunny Collective is at the forefront of Internet-based art collectives, where young emerging female artists come together and support each other,\u201d the Norwegian artist Lotte Karlsen, the founder of the feminist art collective Alexandra Arts, wrote in an email. \u201cThey are unique in the sense that they are an art collective that manages to function successfully, despite being spread all across the globe.\u201dThe members of Bunny Collective range in age from 20 to 30 and live in Ireland, Britain and the United States. Most of their exchanges are through Facebook, Skype and Google Docs.Working in cyberspace \u201cis very natural,\u201d Ms. Conlon said during an interview over Skype. \u201cIt was always seamless because it was part of everyone\u2019s practice anyway, part of an everyday thing, so it never felt like anything that held us back.\u201dFeminism is central to much of the collective\u2019s work. Last year, 10 of the artists from Bunny Collective, along with members of Finland\u2019s Areole Collective, participated in a well-received show at Helsinki\u2019s Aalto University. The exhibition, \u201cSugar,\u201d examined female identity through the prism of gender, body image and stereotypes.Coming off a successful artist residency last spring in Manchester, England, where a number of members met each other for the first time, the group will be starting an online magazine this winter. The theme for the inaugural issue will be the 20th century political theorist Hannah Arendt\u2019s ideas on labor.The idea of starting a global collective came to Ms. Conlon while she was on an exchange program from Cork at Finland\u2019s Tampere University of Applied Sciences in 2013. She got to know members of the Areole Collective who were also studying there.\u201cI was looking at all the collectives online and a lot of them were based in North America,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that is was pretty unrealistic to meet up with these people and collaborate with them in real life.\u201dSo she and two art school friends, Louise Adelaide McKeown and Aoife O\u2019Dwyer, put together an informational pack on what they hoped to achieve as a collective, and put it out on Tumblr along with an open call for applications.They also invited female artists working online who they thought might fit well with the group\u2019s cyberspace model and interest in feminism.The name Bunny Collective is ironic. \u201cIt was a cute name, and we knew we were going to subvert that,\u201d Ms. Conlon said.The Manchester residency was in some ways a pivotal moment for the group, bringing together many of the threads that now form their core focus.The 10 members who participated in the residency also made it a priority to interact with the local community. They held workshops with a local teenage girls\u2019 group on photography and producing webzines and hosted a talk with Sarah Gavron, director of the film \u201cSuffragette.\u201dKathryn O\u2019Regan, a feminist art historian who serves as the collective\u2019s curator and chief writer, said that the exciting thing about the residency was taking the ideas of feminism and art into the community.\u201cThere is a lot of interest in feminism and art with the feminist angles but it is often one-dimensional, tied to the body,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Regan said. \u201cThe residency for Bunny Collective brought it home: what a collective can do, that it should be something that can help the community and people can learn from it.\u201dOver the last three years the collective\u2019s members have also learned how to manage their own community democratically to work collaboratively on projects.Discussions of new work start with a theme and \u201cpeople throwing out ideas\u201d via Skype, Facebook or group emails, Ms. O\u2019Dwyer said. \u201cVery rarely do we come up against disagreements because we have similar interests.\u201dMembers then sit down, virtually, with Ms. O\u2019Regan, who helps to develop the structure of a project.\u201cYou do not have to be in the same place at the same time to have a similar outlook,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Regan said. \u201cProbably a lot of artists are reading the same things on the internet, they are aware of the same artists. Without having to meet in person, the ethos and the aesthetic can be quite similar.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Anti-Helicopter Parent\u2019s Plea: Let Kids Play!", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "FeatureA Silicon Valley dad decided to test his theories about parenting by turning his yard into a playground where children can take physical risks without supervision. Not all of his neighbors were thrilled.Supported byMy kids were in a prekindergarten program with Leo, the youngest of the three Lanza boys. I had heard a lot about Mike\u2019s house, a few miles from our own, but that Friday-afternoon pizza party, a year and a half ago, was the first time I had gone there.Mike is a deep believer in the idea that \u201ckids have to find their own balance of power.\u201d He wants his boys to create their own society governed by its own rules. He consciously transformed his family\u2019s house into a kid hangout, spreading the word that local children were welcome to play in the yard anytime, even when the family wasn\u2019t home. Discontented with the expensive, highly structured summer camps typical of the area, Mike started one of his own: Camp Yale, named after his street, where the kids make their own games and get to roam the neighborhood.\u201cThink about your own 10 best memories of childhood, and chances are most of them involve free play outdoors,\u201d Mike is fond of saying. \u201cHow many of them took place with a grown-up around? I remember that when the grown-ups came over, we stopped playing and waited for them to go away. But moms nowadays never go away.\u201dIn Mike\u2019s worldview, boys today (his focus is on boys) are being deprived of masculine experiences by overprotective moms, who are allowed to dominate passive dads. Central to Mike\u2019s philosophy is the importance of physical danger: of encouraging boys to take risks and play rough and tumble and get \u2014 or inflict \u2014 a scrape or two. Central to what he calls mom philosophy (which could just be described as contemporary parenting philosophy) is just the opposite: to play safe, play nice and not hurt other kids or yourself. Most moms are not inclined to leave their children\u2019s safety up to chance. I certainly am not.Mike had invited me to drop the kids off \u2014 not to hover. But I could see Leo brandishing a long rubber tube, as if he were about to whack my son, who looked worried. Beneath the pleasantries, it was clear that Mike thought I was putting my son at risk of turning into what used to be called a sissy \u2014 a concept whose demise he regrets. And I was of the opinion that Mike was putting his son at risk of being a bully, a label Mike thinks is now used to pathologize normal, healthy, boyish aggression.Mike came out to the yard, his wineglass in one hand and a piece of cheese in another. His wife, Perla Ni, a lawyer who directs a nonprofit, was working late. Where Mike has a loud, large and boisterous presence (a neighbor once compared him to a Labrador retriever, happily trampling everyone\u2019s shrubbery), Perla is quiet, petite, deliberate and self-contained. The only child of Chinese immigrants, she wants her sons to have considerably more fun than she had.\u201cUh, can you keep an eye on them?\u201d I asked Mike, reluctantly gathering my stuff to leave. \u201cThe society of 5-year-olds is fragile and may fall into savagery!\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he replied affably. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in that Rousseau theory \u2014 what\u2019s it called?\u201dHis smile told me he wanted me to leave already.Despite having achieved a higher socioeconomic status for his family than he had as a kid, Mike felt his sons were at risk of having a worse childhood. Growing up in a middle-class Italian-American family in the 1960s and \u201970s, Mike rated school as boring-to-O.K., whereas after-school play time with the gang was awesome.Like many places, Silicon Valley is sports-crazy, with kids participating in year-round travel clubs and working with private coaches. But Mike feels that organized team sports fail to teach the critical life skills that he and his friends learned in pickup games they had to referee themselves. They were forced to resolve their own disputes, because if they didn\u2019t, the game would end. Their focus was not on winning and losing, as when adults are in charge, he says, but simply on keeping the game going.Mike recalls how his gang was often short of a quorum for games. There were two other boys their age, but one was deaf and the other, he says, was \u201cwhatever the P.C. way to describe what used to be called \u2018mentally retarded.\u2019\u2009\u201d Since they didn\u2019t want to \u201cstoop all the way to girls,\u201d he says, giving me a smile, they found ways to change the rules to accommodate the two boys with special needs in their game \u2014 \u201cnot because a grown-up forced\u201d them to be inclusive, Mike says, but because they were motivated to be.Then, when Mike was in seventh grade, his family moved to a better house in an upscale development nearby, and the fun ended. Though the new house wasn\u2019t far from the old one \u2014 all Mike would have had to do was walk up the hill to play with his old friends \u2014 he instead spent his afternoons watching TV, drinking Coke and munching on saltines. He didn\u2019t blame his parents; it was bad luck \u2014 an unpredictable anomaly \u2014 that the new development wasn\u2019t a playborhood. But today it would simply be the norm. Playborhoods have all but disappeared.He analyzed the problem like an entrepreneur, by thinking of children as consumers and seeing their time as a scarce resource. Playing outside has to compete with screen time. (A typical 2-to-10-year-old child spends at least a couple of hours a day on screens; tweens spend more than four.) Parents who limit screen time, as local families often do, tend to compensate by piling on extracurricular activities and tutors.Even if a boy wanted to play outside, Mike explains, with whom would he play? At any given hour, there might be a 30 percent chance that some kid was playing outside. But the so-called network effect, in which children influence one another\u2019s behavior, means that 30 percent might as well be zero, because it is low enough that no boy can count on it and so will default to his screen \u2014 causing the percentage to drop lower. That is, kids don\u2019t play outside because other kids don\u2019t play outside. Playing outside becomes like Betamax \u2014 it\u2019s just obsolete. But in the case of a playborhood, the vicious circle transforms into a virtuous one: When there\u2019s always another kid to play with, most kids want to play.As part of Mike\u2019s quest for a playborhood, he began doing research and visiting neighborhoods in different parts of the country that he thought might fit his vision. The first place he visited was N Street in Davis, Calif., a cluster of around 20 houses that share land and hold regular dinners together. Children wander around freely, crossing backyards and playing in the collective spaces: Ping-Pong table, pizza oven and community garden. Mike told me the story of Lucy, a toddler adopted from China by a single mom who lived on N Street. When Lucy was 3, her mother died of cancer. But before she died, her mother gave every house a refrigerator magnet with a picture of Lucy on it. While the founders of N Street formally adopted Lucy, the entire community supported her. Mike pointed out that the childhood Lucy was having on N Street may be akin to one she might have enjoyed in a village in rural China, but it was extraordinary in suburban America. Lucy could wander around fearlessly, knowing she had 19 other houses where she could walk right in and expect a snack.Mike spent some time in the Lyman Place neighborhood in the Bronx, where grandmothers and other residents organized to watch the streets \u2014 so dangerous that children were afraid to play outside \u2014 and block them off in the summer to create a neighborhood camp, staffed by local teenagers and volunteers. Mike also found his way to Share-It Square in Southeast Portland, Ore., a random intersection that became a community when a local architect mobilized neighbors to convert a condemned house on one corner into a \u201cKids\u2019 Klubhouse\u201d: a funky open-air structure that features a couch, a message board, a book-exchange box, a solar-powered tea station and toys.Mike was aware of limits to the analogies. Those playborhoods were in lower- and middle-class communities; he and Perla had settled on a house in the Allied Arts area of Menlo Park, where the median home price is $2 million. (And the houses in neighboring North Palo Alto and Atherton cost even more.) Mike found himself up against the fact that in America, the ethos of wealth and the ethos of community are often in conflict: Part of what the wealthy feel they are buying is privacy and the ability to be choosy about whom they socialize with. Mike was determined that his kids would not only know their neighbors but would also see them, every day.Mike also made another simple-but-radical move: In a neighborhood in which front yards are for admiration only, Mike installed a picnic table, close to the sidewalk, where he and his family often sat, so that people walking by would have to talk to them. Mike put a white board on the fence and started projecting videos and slide shows onto it, in hope of luring neighborhood children. And it worked: Dogs stop to drink at a fountain made from a large, flat millstone in the shape of a hockey puck, children wander over to the play river and people pause to read the quotes on the mosaics he had an artist design. One is from the children\u2019s book \u201cThe Big Orange Splot\u201d: \u201cOur street is us and we are it. Our street is where we like to be, and it looks like all our dreams.\u201dMike has influenced our family as well. My kids and I made friends on our block by playing a game from Camp Yale in which we asked neighbors to contribute one ingredient to what turned out to be an apple-pear-blueberry-strawberry cobbler; when it was baked, we brought each\u200b \u200b\u200bof them a piece. My daughter liked the game so much, she recently asked to make her birthday cake that way. Then, when our next-door neighbors generously passed along their trampoline, I spread the word that other children were welcome to play in our yard anytime. Sometimes visitors will be surprised when my children aren\u2019t home and they hear shrieks of laughter coming from our yard, as neighborhood kids bounce and squirt water guns they filled in our fountain, and I feel grateful to Mike for his vision.Local parents often talk about the rash of suicides among Palo Alto high school students in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty clear to me since I moved here eight years ago that kids are just not happy here,\u201d Mike says, and \u201cthe suicides are just the extreme examples of the broader problem.\u201d He believes \u201cthe poor quality of children\u2019s lives around here\u201d stems from their lack of autonomy. Basic developmental psychology posits that if children develop a fundamental sense that they (not their parents) are masters of their own destiny, they will be successful adults, and that without that belief they will flounder: It\u2019s easy to want to rid yourself of a life that doesn\u2019t feel truly your own.Research suggests that students with controlling \u201chelicopter\u201d parents are less flexible and more vulnerable, anxious and self-conscious, as well as more likely to be medicated for anxiety or depression. Similarly, children whose time is highly structured \u2014 crammed with lessons and adult-supervised activities \u2014 may have more difficulty developing their own \u201cexecutive function\u201d capabilities, the ability to devise their own plans and carry them out. Conversely, the more time children spend in free play, the better they develop these capabilities.Mike says he often feels alienated when he\u2019s talking to other parents. The common currency of conversation \u2014 rather than sports, politics or weather \u2014 is the achievements of your children. \u201cI have exactly nothing to say in these conversations,\u201d Mike says. \u201cAm I going to brag my kids are jumping on their trampoline, or went to the store by themselves? Parents don\u2019t measure themselves according to their kids\u2019 independence, as they used to, but according to accomplishments. To me, that\u2019s part of how I judge myself.\u201dReactions to Mike in the neighborhood are mixed. When the Lanzas first moved in, Mike had the idea that the neighbors on both sides should take down the fences between their yards to facilitate play. But unlike on N Street, none of them agreed. Mike complained to me that a neighbor asked Marco to stop climbing into her yard to see her son, even though her son wanted to see Marco. Many neighbors disapprove of boys playing pickup games in the streets and of the younger kids biking alone. Leo was allowed to ride around the neighborhood on his own when he was 5, and two years ago, when Nico was in first grade, he was allowed to bike a mile and a half to school alone.Mike believes his children have grown by taking risks. \u201cMarco is naturally physically cautious, and now he is working on a back flip onto the trampoline,\u201d Mike tells me. \u201cI\u2019m proud of that. He\u2019s worked his way up. Other kids learn to take risks at our house.\u201dIn the spring of last year, Mike installed 10-foot ladders in each of his sons\u2019 bedrooms so they could climb through a hole in their ceilings into the finished attic. Perla was not enthusiastic. (\u201cShe\u2019s not into the man-cave stuff,\u201d Mike says.) She was worried they would fall. And indeed, once, when Leo was playing in the attic, he tumbled down the hatch and hit his head. \u201cTo me, it was a bump on the head, which is a normal part of being a kid,\u201d Mike said. But Perla saw it as a head injury and took him to the hospital for a scan. \u201cHe was fine,\u201d Mike said, rolling his eyes.Mike tells me that people sometimes ask him if he is afraid of lawsuits in the event of an injury on his property. He would never let fear of being sued dictate how he lives his life, he says.What about second-degree manslaughter, I asked: an accident enabled by negligence, if, say, another child \u2014 or even one of his own \u2014 broke his neck leaping from the playhouse onto the trampoline. (Unenclosed trampolines are a staple of personal-injury law; an estimated 85,000 children under 14 were hurt on trampolines last year.) Does he ever worry about that?He flashed me a look, then snorted with laughter.As part of Gray\u2019s research, he accompanied Mike to meet the kids at school. Mike biked home with the younger kids while Gray and I biked after Marco and a friend as they rode their skateboards to the park. They amused themselves en route by doing tricks on strangers\u2019 stoops. At the park, they wobbled down steep cement curves with older and more skilled skaters as dusk set in.\u201cAll mammals engage in dangerous play,\u201d Gray told me. \u201cDangerous play is how kids learn how to titrate fear. Not everyone has to learn quadratic equations\u201d \u2014 which, he points out, most people forget the minute they leave school anyway \u2014 \u201cbut at some point in our lives, we will all be in stressful situations and we need to be able to keep our cool. Sometimes there are accidents,\u201d he added, \u201ckid goats fall off cliffs while playing, or whatever, but they\u2019re rare. If the instinct wasn\u2019t of evolutionary benefit, the behavior would have been rooted out.\u201d\u201cWell, mother goats don\u2019t die of heartbreak the way we do,\u201d I said peevishly.He conceded that among humans, mothers in many societies have a tendency to worry. \u201cBut there were no helicopter hunter-and-gatherer moms!\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cKids were with their moms until they were 4, and then they were on their own with the other kids, practicing through play the intricate skills they need to survive: finding their way through the jungle, making weapons and identifying food sources.\u201dI still recall the visceral shock I felt after I picked my kids up at the Lanzas\u2019 house at the end of the pizza party, having left them alone for all of an hour and a half. On the way home, Kieran announced that he and Leo had climbed out on the roof together \u2014 twice, in fact, once at the party and once at a previous play date.\u201cThe roof? The Lanzas\u2019 roof? Is there a railing? Were you with a grown-up?\u201dThe Lanzas have multistory house, with a sloped top and a narrow, flat area perhaps 25 feet off the ground. If you tumbled off the back, you\u2019d land on the grass or perhaps on the stone patio. Falling from either side, you would be impaled on the fence or fall into the neighbor\u2019s yard. From the front you\u2019d hit the concrete driveway, car, picnic table or fountain.\u201cWe climbed up through a window in the attic!\u201d Kieran said with a mixture of pride and wonder. \u201cWith no grown-up!\u201dI was so certain it was a tall tale that I was embarrassed to ask Mike when I saw him at school drop-off.\u201cI\u2019m sorry you were uncomfortable with it,\u201d he replied flatly, as we stood outside preschool. \u201cBut as you know, I don\u2019t worry about things like that.\u201dPerla was more equivocal, and last spring, when she invited us to play at the house, she assured me that the hatch to the roof \u2014 a skylight that opens \u2014 had been closed. In June we went to the Lanzas\u2019 for an all-day party celebrating Leo\u2019s seventh birthday in the morning and Marco\u2019s 12th in the afternoon. At one point I went looking for Kieran and wandered up to the attic. Kieran wasn\u2019t there, but I found a cluster of small boys in the process of climbing down from the roof through the open hatch. The youngest seemed to be about 4. They looked at me as if I were about to scold them.I already knew Mike\u2019s perspective. \u201cWhat are the chances of falling off the roof?\u201d he argued vociferously when we tried previously to hash it out. Have I ever known anyone who has fallen off a roof? Anyway, he said, it\u2019s not as if he doesn\u2019t give his kids any limits: They are not allowed to play ball or tag up there.At the end of the party, I decided I should check out the roof. I found Kieran, and we climbed out of the attic and stepped onto the roof. I spent the first few seconds evaluating the chance that someone would survive the drop (remote), but then I succumbed to the heady feeling of power of looking down on the world. It was like being in the spire of a castle in a children\u2019s book: the quilt of houses, yards and streets, dotted with green lawns and light blue swimming pools \u2014 the neighborhood transformed into a picture of itself, like the maps on Mike\u2019s walls. Down below I saw the play river, the fountain and the mosaics in the driveway and, in the street, the kids kicking a ball, forcing cars to make way for them. I saw the animation in the boys\u2019 slender bodies: the power of making the grown-up world momentarily bend around them.I held Kieran\u2019s hand tightly and decided never to play there again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revelation Surrounding Novelist Elena Ferrante Exposes Cultural Differences", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byIn the United States and Britain, the investigation into Ms. Ferrante\u2019s true identity has been viewed by a vocal contingent through the lens of gender. Critics have accused the journalist who conducted it and the publications where his findings appeared of sexism. But in continental Europe, the criticisms have focused on invasion of privacy issues.Ms. Ferrante\u2019s series of four Neapolitan novels, which traces the complex friendship of two women against the backdrop of Italian postwar history, came out in Italian and English from 2012 to 2015 and has resonated deeply with readers, especially women. There are 2.6 million copies in print in English, and the books have been published in 40 countries.In a report published simultaneously on Oct. 2 on The New York Review of Books website, as well as in French, German and Italian publications, Claudio Gatti, an investigative reporter for the Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, said financial and real estate records led him to conclude that Anita Raja, a recently retired public librarian, literary translator and consultant at Ms. Ferrante\u2019s Rome-based publishing house, Edizioni E/O, was actually Ms. Ferrante. Particularly convincing for him: Payments from the publishing house to Ms. Raja rose sharply in 2014 and 2015, when the Neapolitan novels became international best sellers.In France, revealing Ms. Ferrante\u2019s identity was generally seen as rude, not sexist.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit as if a GoPro camera had been installed in Salinger\u2019s garden at his house in Cornish, New Hampshire, to show us the recluse while he watered his geraniums,\u201d the French daily Lib\u00e9ration wrote of that reclusive novelist. In France, where two of the four Neapolitan novels have been released since last year and became best sellers, people are strong believers in the idea of a \u201cjardin secret\u201d (a secret garden), or private lives.\u201cIt would be interesting if it were somebody very well known who was hiding behind Elena Ferrante, but if it\u2019s an unknown person like Anita Raja, so what?\u201d said Florence Noiville, the editor of foreign fiction for Le Monde des Livres, the book supplement of the French daily Le Monde.(Ms. Noiville said that Mr. Gatti had approached Le Monde with his report, but editors there declined to publish it. The New York Times also declined to publish the report, which would have involved coordinating with multiple journalistic partners.)The responses were also about privacy in Italy, where Ms. Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels, although best sellers, have had a mixed critical reception, and where Ms. Raja\u2019s name has been mentioned for years as possibly being behind Ms. Ferrante.\u201cI am already nostalgic for the unnamed Elena Ferrante,\u201d the commentator Michele Serra wrote in La Repubblica.\u201cThe response to Gatti\u2019s report was more heated in the States, where feminist media is mainstream and developed, celebrity narratives are politicized to a fever pitch in order to excuse our obsession with them, and the clamor of the election has served as a constant, excruciating reminder of the persistence of sexism \u2014 that even the worst man is allowed to do a thousand things that a decent woman can\u2019t,\u201d she wrote in an email.Sarah Churchwell, a literature professor at the School of Advanced Study at the University of London, said the question of whether women were held to a double standard was \u201cvery live\u201d in Anglo-American culture. \u201cIt\u2019s on people\u2019s minds, for very good reason, and they\u2019re primed to interpret hostile actions against women in gendered terms,\u201d she said in an email.\u201cThe question is whether a man would have been treated to the same malice, and for myself I think that\u2019s an open question,\u201d she added.In an interview, Mr. Gatti said he was an investigative journalist, not a misogynist, and had wanted to solve one of the biggest literary mysteries in the world. \u201cIt turned out that she was a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have easily turned out that it was a man.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a critic who, in New York Magazine, defended Claudio Gatti\u2019s reporting.

But in Tokyo, where I moved with my family in August to take up the post of bureau chief, the disruption has been far more extensive.After all, it\u2019s not just one dinner or one weekend that needs to bend to my work: It\u2019s my loved ones\u2019 whole lives. My husband quit a senior position in New York as a technology consultant to city government, and my children, 12 and 10, left behind schools and soccer teams and beloved friends.We are adjusting to our new life in tandem. While relying on the two excellent researchers and translators in the bureau, Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno, I am working with a private tutor to improve my intermediate Japanese. My husband discovered a language class at a recreational center in our neighborhood, and my children are studying Japanese at their international school. It is thrilling to see how eager they are to show off their new vocabulary after years of resisting my efforts to teach them.At work, I am adapting to new customs, including the practice of bowing and immediately proffering a business card when meeting someone for the first time, and the need to fax formal interview requests. One organization recently demanded that we send a request by snail mail.On his new soccer team, my son is also learning Japanese rituals. After every game, the team bows in gratitude to the field, and each player individually thanks the coach. To help my son understand his coach\u2019s commands, my husband printed out a list of soccer terms and their Japanese equivalents. When he typed into Google Translate the word \u201cmatanuki\u201d \u2014 the Japanese word for a maneuver known in English as a \u201cnutmeg,\u201d in which one player knocks the ball between the legs of another \u2014 it came up with \u201ccrotch punching.\u201d Father and son relished that one for days.After a particularly busy week in which I was rarely home before bedtime, my son spoke the phrase dreaded by working parents the world over: \u201cHow come we never see you?\u201dThroughout our time here, I know there will be more such moments. But there is no question that the family adventure will make relocation a good trade-off.I knew we had made the right decision when my daughter came home from school her first week, having met some classmates who, like her, are new to Tokyo. Several of them have already lived abroad in other places like Hong Kong and Singapore. \u201cI think that would be kind of cool to move around,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere do you think we\u2019ll go next?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Working It", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byWordplayWEDNESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Sometimes a puzzle just hits your sweet spot.My personal solving sweet spot is when there are plenty of entries that you know and can fill in with confidence, with just enough tug from the theme and some tricky clues to make the solve especially satisfying. Add to that a smattering of entries that make you smile and a theme that is very clever, and you\u2019ve got a really nice Wednesday puzzle by Tom Pepper.We\u2019re going PRO- today by parsing some common words a bit differently. Puzzle constructors have a unique talent for looking at words and phrases and seeing them in unusual ways. For example, raise your hands if you\u2019ve ever looked at the word PROVOCATION, read it as \u201cPRO VOCATION,\u201d and thought that it would make a dandy revealer for a theme about professions.But Mr. Pepper noticed it, and he was able to put together a really fun set of common words that turn out to be VOCATIONs if you place PRO- in front of them:The only thing that would have made this set absolutely perfect is if Mr. Pepper could have found a vocation at 57A that was singular like the rest of the theme entries (or made another entry plural as well), but it\u2019s a very entertaining theme, so I\u2019ll give that a pass.\u25a0 3D: EVONNE Goolagong overcame deep prejudice to become one of the world\u2019s leading women\u2019s tennis players in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition to admiring her greatly for that feat, I am also frustrated because I can never remember how she spells her first name.\u25a0 7D: Remember, when you see a clue with the word \u201cending,\u201d as in \u201cWaltz ending?\u201d you\u2019re looking for the last letter in the other word, which in this case would be ZEE.\u25a0 22D: POTATO hash, get it? I filled in the cross-referenced clue, \u201cFeature of a 22-Down\u201d (for EYE) before getting to this clue and wondered in horror what kind of grisly hash we were making.\u25a0 35D: This wins Clue of the Day, in my opinion. MOSES had \u201ca major part in the Bible\u201d when he parted the Red Sea.I like words that can be parsed in a way that has a completely different meaning. I had a similar puzzle a few years ago about neckwear: PROPER TIES, CASUAL TIES and so on. My original submission for this puzzle was a 15x16 grid that led off with PRO VISIONARY and ended with PRO VOCATIONS. That version had 4 nice long non-theme downs, fewer three-letter words, and placed the title entry at the end where I liked it.Unfortunately, PROVISIONARY doesn\u2019t Google very well compared with \u201cprovisional,\u201d so Will and Joel asked if I could replace that theme answer. PRO TESTER was the best I could find. However, that meant placing the singular PRO VOCATION in the center of the new 15x15 grid, losing the long downs and forcing the two Utah-shaped black blocks on the left and right. In the end, it comes down to trade-offs, and the stronger theme answers make the revised version a better puzzle than the original grid that arguably had more interesting non-theme material.My favorite clue \u2014 35D\u2019s \u201cPerson who had a major part in the Bible?\u201d \u2014 is the work of the editorial crew, whose efforts greatly improved the puzzle, as always. Thanks, Will and Joel \u2014 that made me smile! I hope the puzzle brings a smile or two to everyone else as well!That it did, Mr. Pepper.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A More Money-Conscious Alphabet Emerges", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google turned 18 years old in September and there are signs that as it gets older it is learning to be responsible with its money.A year ago, Google reorganized to create Alphabet, a holding company housing the search giant and a growing list of fledgling businesses, ranging from Nest, a home electronics maker, to a life sciences outfit called Verily.By making Google one of Alphabet\u2019s subsidiaries \u2014 albeit the one responsible for most of its revenue \u2014 it put pressure on the company\u2019s \u201cother bets\u201d to prove that they can stand on their own financial feet.Another big change has been more gradual: Search on mobile phones surpassed desktop queries last year and the company said that mobile web searches were now the driving force behind revenue growth.The potential impact of Alphabet\u2019s newfound discipline was also on display earlier this week when the company said it would curb expansion of Google Fiber into new cities and reduce staff in the unit responsible for the work.Google\u2019s plan to build a high-speed, fiber-optic network resulted in years of costly investments to dig up roads and lay cable and it has started considering cheaper alternatives, including wireless and fiber partnerships.Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said such decisions were natural for high-risk, high-reward initiatives.\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way and that some efforts will be more successful than others,\u201d Ms. Porat said in a call with analysts.She warned, however, that investors should take a long-term view when it comes to gauging progress with the \u201cother bets\u201d businesses because costs and revenue can vary significantly from quarter to quarter.James Dix, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said since Alphabet\u2019s \u201cother bets\u201d businesses are so small compared to the core Google business, the most meaningful impact of pausing expansion plans on Google Fiber is that it reinforces a viewpoint supported by investors that the company is now exercising financial discipline.While keeping a closer eye on dollars and cents, Alphabet\u2019s new approach may be coming at a cost. Along with the job cuts and scaled-back expansion plans, Craig Barratt, the chief executive of Access, the Alphabet unit housing Google Fiber, said he was stepping down from the company, noting that it was the \u201cright juncture\u201d to do so.Google has lost other Alphabet unit executives, like Nest\u2019s chief executive, Tony Fadell, who left the company in June under increasing pressure to prove that the home devices unit could deliver profitable results on its own.Alphabet\u2019s overall revenue in the quarter rose 20 percent to $22.45 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations. Net income was $5.06 billion, up from $3.98 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share after excluding certain items were $9.06, or 44 cents more than analysts\u2019 estimates.Alphabet shares were up about 1.4 percent in after-hours trading.There may be another Alphabet company coming soon. Astro Teller, the Alphabet executive in charge of the company\u2019s research lab, called X, said at a Wall Street Journal technology conference on Wednesday that its self-driving car was on the verge of being spun out of X into a stand-alone company responsible for generating its own revenue.But one thing that has not changed is that Google remains the dominant force of the internet. It has seven services with more than a billion users each, including search, YouTube and Gmail.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Time Warner\u2019s Non-Mogul Mogul Who Foretold Its Worth", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byJeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, made a big bet in the summer of 2014 when he rejected an $80 billion takeover bid by 21st Century Fox, controlled by Rupert Murdoch.Mr. Bewkes had promised shareholders that Time Warner would create more value on its own than any proposal Fox was positioned to offer. Privately, Mr. Bewkes was telling colleagues and investors that Time Warner was likely to land a much more lucrative deal if it were put on the market a couple of years later. Among the potential bidders, Time Warner reasoned, were deep-pocketed technology companies like Apple and Google \u2014 and even, possibly, AT&T, which was tied up with a different deal at the time.Over the next two years, it was not clear that Mr. Bewkes had played his cards right. Fears of cord-cutting, ratings declines and a weak advertising market stoked panic across the industry over the future of traditional media in a digital world. And while Time Warner introduced several efforts to transform the company, such as a stand-alone streaming service for HBO, questions persisted about whether the company would have the resources to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon.As it turns out, Mr. Bewkes\u2019s bet paid off. In a big way.On Saturday night, AT&T announced that it had agreed to buy Time Warner for about $85.4 billion, or $107.50 a share in cash and stock \u2014 about a 35 percent premium to where Time Warner\u2019s stock was trading before reports of the merger talks, and well above the $85 a share Fox was offering.AT&T and Time Warner promised to \u201clead the next wave of innovation\u201d as the worlds of media, communications and technology collide.\u201cFor Time Warner shareholders, the price is exceptional,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.And for Mr. Bewkes, the deal has sealed his legacy as a behind-the-scenes non-mogul media mogul.In an industry populated by larger-than-life executives like Mr. Murdoch and Sumner Redstone, whose activities have sometimes provided fodder for the gossip pages, Mr. Bewkes carved out a reputation as a personable numbers guy with a sense of humor and a low public profile. Mr. Bewkes lifted the company\u2019s stock price, slowly but surely, by disposing of assets, eventually making his company the most attractive takeover target in the media market.\u201cHe is not an executive that is cut from the old-school media mogul cloth,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Nomura. \u201cHis legacy is very much that he did so well for shareholders, whereas another type of media executive, a personality like a Sumner Redstone, would want to continue to preside and reign over this powerful media empire.\u201dIn an interview on Sunday, Mr. Bewkes deferred a question on how he thought about the AT&T-Time Warner deal in the context of his own legacy as a media executive.\u201cI don\u2019t think of it as my legacy,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cI think of it as the great institution of Time Warner, which has had a mission in this world since Henry Luce invented the magazine in 1923 and actually invented talking pictures in the years since.\u201dMr. Bewkes, 64, has worked at Time Warner for more than three decades. He became the chief executive of the premium TV network HBO in 1995, where he helped raise the network\u2019s profile by pushing for more original programming. His purview expanded in 2002, when he was named chairman of the company\u2019s networks and entertainment division. And in 2008, Mr. Bewkes succeeded Richard Parsons in the chief executive\u2019s suite.At the time, the company was still reeling from its disastrous dot-com merger with AOL. Time Warner shares traded as low as $14. Mr. Bewkes whittled the company down, unloading Time Warner Cable, then AOL, then its Time Inc. magazine division. What remained was a focused and well-respected television and film company that owned HBO; Warner Bros. film and television studios; and cable networks including CNN, TNT, Turner Sports and TBS.\u201cThat gave us the best choice of whether we wanted to consolidate another company into ours, or it made us the most valuable company if we wanted to consolidate with someone else, which is what we have now come to,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said.But Mr. Bewkes was not ready to exercise those options in the summer of 2014, when Fox appeared with its takeover offer. He said that he had never doubted the decision, in large part because Time Warner management considered the deal to be worth much less than it initially seemed.On the day that the Fox deal was announced, the transaction was worth about $80 billion. But that deal was heavily tilted toward Fox stock, which has lost about a third of its value since then. In addition, the transaction required taking out a substantial loan to cover the cash portion, and Time Warner would have assumed part of that debt.As a result, Time Warner estimates that the Fox deal would be valued at about $70 per share today. The AT&T bid represents about a 60 percent premium over the Fox offer.\u201cWe knew all that,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cThat is why we didn\u2019t consider it.\u201dIt was a different story in August, when Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, visited Mr. Bewkes at Time Warner\u2019s headquarters in New York. The two executives discussed their views for the future of content and distribution amid the rise of streaming services that are blurring lines among the media, communication and technology industries. Their visions aligned, and a deal quickly fell into place.\u201cWe see a convergence,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cIt is not just creating content but introducing it to you as a viewer, wherever you go.\u201dAs an example, Mr. Bewkes pointed to more vigorous CNN offerings on mobile and better search and recommendation tools to discover HBO programming, whether a person is watching on a mobile phone, tablet or television set.Mr. Bewkes acknowledged that on its own, the media industry has been slow to put in effect new technologies that allow people to watch the programming they want to watch \u2014 when and how they want to watch it.\u201cLook at how slow some of these companies have been to put these innovations in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do things like that if we are together.\u201dOn Sunday, AT&T insisted that it would not try to influence its new assets in either the entertainment or news segments.\u201cOur intent is to operate Time Warner as it operates today, with autonomy in its divisions, including the world-class creative talent and journalists that make Time Warner a leader in entertainment and news,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said in a statement.\u201cCNN is an American symbol of independent journalism and First Amendment free speech,\u201d he added. \u201cMy board and I are clear \u2014 CNN will remain completely independent from an editorial perspective.\u201dAT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner is expected to face intense regulatory pressure, and if it is approved, the companies do not expect it to close until late 2017. Mr. Bewkes, whose contract with Time Warner runs through 2020, is planning to stay with the company through a yet-to-be-determined transition period.Analysts said that they expected many other Time Warner executives to continue in their roles, because AT&T is a telecom company with little experience in programming. That was yet another contrast to the Murdoch offer.\u201cAny offer that was made to Time Warner was prefaced with the notion that the key up-and-coming leadership within Time Warner would not be jettisoned,\u201d Mr. DiClemente said. \u201cThat tone, in general, is a little different than the Murdoch tone, which was perceived as the expectation that they would be working for Rupert, James and Lachlan Murdoch.\u201d\u201cCulturally, this is more of a reason why this fits,\u201d he added.Mr. Bewkes put it more bluntly. \u201cThis fell into place,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it is kind of obvious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Walls Here: Between Tijuana and San Diego, an Art Ethos Thrives", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 Marcos Ram\u00edrez, the ebullient artist known as ERRE, recently drove from San Diego to his workshop studio in Tijuana in a black Chevy Suburban riddled with bullet holes. The vehicle had a starring role in \u201cLa Suburban Negra,\u201d or \u201cThe Black Suburban,\u201d his 2012 installation and video about the drug trade, in which he plays a drug lord, a hit man and a cop.\u201cThe police, the bad guys, the C.I.A., the soccer moms \u2014 everybody with authority has a black Suburban,\u201d he explained as he barreled down Interstate 5 toward the border, making a slight detour for a strawberry ice cream cone.For young men growing up in Tijuana, as Mr. Ram\u00edrez did, the three characters he portrays in \u201cThe Black Suburban\u201d are potential life choices. He eventually opted for a fourth path: as a Conceptual artist whose work grapples with \u201cthe frictions produced by human interactions\u201d in the dual worlds on either side of the United States border with Mexico.Even amid calls by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, for building a wall at that border, the art scene in the San Diego-Tijuana megalopolis has assumed a consciously and exuberantly binational ethos.The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, a mere 17 miles from the Western Hemisphere\u2019s busiest land border crossing, has been at the forefront of collecting and exhibiting the work of Tijuana-based artists. The museum\u2019s leadership views the proximity to the border as a \u201csweet spot\u201d that helps lure younger audiences, said Hugh M. Davies, the museum\u2019s director.Mr. Ram\u00edrez, an internationally recognized artist whose work has appeared at the Whitney Biennial, made headlines in 1997 by installing a 33-foot-high two-headed Trojan horse in the fume-choked highway median on the American side of the border crossing. He is a ringleader of an increasingly visible fraternity of artists \u2014 Mr. Davies calls them \u201cthe straddlers\u201d \u2014 who ricochet back and forth across \u201cla linea,\u201d as the border is colloquially known.To reach his studio in the Colonia Libertad section, where he grew up, Mr. Ram\u00edrez leaves the relatively somnolent streets of downtown San Diego for a city of 1.3 million, where it\u2019s not uncommon to encounter fire jugglers, Michael Jackson impersonators or teetering clowns on stilts at traffic stops.Resonantly, perhaps, Mr. Ram\u00edrez has received a commission from the United States General Services Administration to create a work for the expanded Port of Entry in San Ysidro, Calif., the busiest border crossing.Their pilgrimage began in Brookings, Ore., where the two artists, accompanied by a filmmaker, Jos\u00e9 Inerzia, traipsed through sand and fog to plant the first obelisk on a windswept beach. For the Mexican-born Mr. Ram\u00edrez, the treaty that severed Mexico from over half its territorial lands represented a wound. \u201cIt was a wound with no scar,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo we acknowledged the loss by making a scar for the wound\u201d \u2014 with the location of each obelisk mapped on Google Earth.Mr. Taylor was game for the project after spending seven years photographing the 276 cast-iron and stone monuments, now lonely, that defined the present-day border before the fence was built. Many are in desolate wilderness areas that required Indiana Jones-style derring-do to locate. \u201cWe talk about the border as this monolithic phenomenon,\u201d he observed. \u201cBut it\u2019s a series of places with unique identities.\u201dIn a nondescript Tijuana building painted with a red heart, the 44-year-old artist Alida Cervantes explores the stratification of Mexican society. On a recent morning, her studio brimmed with paintings of voluptuous women in classical attire, inspired by glittery Oaxacan folk ceramics.Ms. Cervantes, who was born into affluence in Tijuana, grew up with the notion that it \u201cwas just dust, gas stations and prostitutes, and not a real cultural place,\u201d she said. Now her hometown fortifies her.She lives in San Diego but commutes daily to Tijuana. She views the border as a metaphor for \u201ccollisions, for things that aren\u2019t meant to be together put together.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m addicted to both worlds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a boyfriend on the side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "IBM Is Counting on Its Bet on Watson, and Paying Big Money for It", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byWatson, can you grow into a multibillion-dollar business and become the engine of IBM\u2019s resurgence?IBM is betting its future that the answer is yes. Its campaign to commercialize Watson, the company\u2019s version of artificial intelligence technology, stands out, even during the current A.I. frenzy in the tech industry.Yet industry experts question how quickly IBM can build a business around Watson. \u201cIBM has pursued big, bespoke moonshot initiatives that can take years and are extremely expensive,\u201d said Tom Austin, a research fellow at Gartner. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re swimming upstream with that.\u201dAdapting Watson technology to industries like health care and manufacturing, IBM insists, was always going to be a long-term commitment \u2014 and one that began shortly after Watson beat human champions on the quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d in 2011.But the years of investment and applied-science projects, IBM executives say, are increasingly turning into moneymaking opportunities in sizable markets.\u201cThis is the broad commercialization of Watson in oncology,\u201d said John E. Kelly, a senior vice president who oversees IBM\u2019s research labs and the Watson business.The new genomics service, IBM executives say, is one step in the company\u2019s march to build a so-called ecosystem of corporate partners and software developers that use Watson technology.For a programmer, Watson can provide code that allows a start-up\u2019s software to read and interpret legal documents more easily, for example. For a big company, Watson can provide not just software but also IBM consultants helping a retailer, for example, use the technology to customize marketing and improve customer service.The artificial intelligence marketplace, analysts agree, is primed to grow rapidly. A.I. is also the new arena of high-stakes competition in computing, fueled by big data and innovations in software algorithms.The market \u2014 defined as A.I.-related hardware, software and services \u2014 will surge from $8 billion this year to $47 billion by 2020, predicts IDC, a research firm.Today, the A.I. business, experts say, resembles the internet in the mid-1990s: a thing on its own that eventually will be built into all kinds of products and services. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re headed \u2014 A.I. everywhere,\u201d said Frank Gens, IDC\u2019s chief analyst.All the major technology companies are investing aggressively in A.I. software, including companies beyond IBM like Salesforce, SAP and Oracle that focus on business customers.But consumer internet companies with large cloud computing businesses, analysts say, are most likely to build the equivalent of operating systems for A.I. \u2014 the so-called platforms on which most developers write applications. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are the front-runners.IBM may have a chance to join that group. By 2020, IDC predicts, 60 percent of the A.I. applications will run on the platform of four companies: Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM.IBM needs A.I.-fueled growth more than the others. When the company reports its third-quarter financial results on Monday, analysts expect the recent pattern to continue; its new businesses like Watson, data analytics and cloud computing are growing but not fast enough to outpace the erosion in its traditional hardware, software and services lines. Revenue has declined for 17 consecutive quarters.IBM does not report financial results for Watson separately. But the securities research arm of the Swiss bank UBS estimates that Watson may generate $500 million in revenue this year and could grow rapidly in the years ahead, possibly hitting nearly $6 billion by 2020 and almost $17 billion by 2022.IBM has acquired industry expertise and proprietary data sources, in addition to supplying A.I. platform tools and technology. \u201cIBM has taken a very different approach from Google, Amazon and Microsoft,\u201d said Judith Hurwitz, an independent analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s leveraging data and the knowledge of experts.\u201dIBM first focused on health care, and that business now accounts for two-thirds of the Watson unit\u2019s employment. Three years ago, IBM experts began working with leading medical centers. And it has spent more than $4 billion buying a handful of companies with vast stores of medical data like billing records, patient histories, and X-ray and M.R.I. images. \u201cA.I. machines are only as smart as the data you give them,\u201d Mr. Kelly noted.Watson\u2019s core strength, dating back to the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d competition, is its ability to read and interpret words, known as natural-language processing. Once trained, Watson can digest thousands of documents in minutes.At the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Watson was tested on 1,000 cancer diagnoses made by human experts. In 99 percent of them, Watson recommended the same treatment as the oncologists.In 30 percent of the cases, Watson also found a treatment option the human doctors missed. Some treatments were based on research papers that the doctors had not read \u2014 more than 160,000 cancer research papers are published a year. Other treatment options might have surfaced in a new clinical trial the oncologists had not yet seen announced on the web.But Watson read it all. \u201cHumans enabled by A.I. is the way to go with genomics,\u201d said Dr. Norman E. Sharpless, head of the school\u2019s cancer center.The byline for an article on Monday about IBM\u2019s efforts to commercialize Watson, its artificial intelligence technology, was omitted.

{"Headline": "Extremist Imam Tests F.B.I. and the Limits of the Law", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "Supported byThat is not all. An affidavit filed in federal court by the F.B.I. says that Imam Bengharsa, 59, supplied $1,300 in June 2015 to a Detroit man who used it to expand his arsenal of firearms and grenades. The man, Sebastian Gregerson, 29, a Muslim convert who sometimes calls himself Abdurrahaman Bin Mikaayl, was arrested in late July and indicted on explosives charges.Nearly a year ago, in fact, the F.B.I. said in a court filing \u2014 accidentally and temporarily made public in an online database \u2014 that agents suspected the two men were plotting terrorism. \u201cBased on the totality of the aforementioned information and evidence, there is reason to believe that Bengharsa and Gregerson are engaged in discussions and preparations for some violent act on behalf of\u201d the Islamic State, an agent wrote.Yet Imam Bengharsa has not been arrested or charged. It appears that the authorities do not have clear evidence that he has broken the law. His inflammatory statements are protected by the First Amendment, and agents appear to have no proof that he knew Mr. Gregerson planned to buy illegal explosives. In his checkbook, next to the notation for the $1,300 check, Imam Bengharsa wrote \u201czakat,\u201d or charity, the documents show.The case poses in a striking way the dilemma for the F.B.I. in deciding when constitutionally protected speech crosses into inciting violence or conspiring to commit a terrorist act.In testimony before Congress this week, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the challenge for F.B.I. agents was determining when someone has crossed the line from speech to criminal activity. \u201cIt\u2019s even protected speech to say I\u2019m a fan of the Islamic State so-called,\u201d Mr. Comey said.When the suspect is a cleric, like Imam Bengharsa, the matter is especially delicate.The documents say he transferred money three times to an unnamed person in Yemen.Investigators are also exploring contacts between Imam Bengharsa and other people suspected of extremism or terrorism. One is Yusuf Wehelie, 25, a Virginia man arrested in July and charged with weapons possession, which would be illegal because he has a previous felony conviction for burglary.Mr. Wehelie first came to public attention in 2010, when he and his brother, Yahya Wehelie, both American citizens, were temporarily detained in Cairo and prevented by the F.B.I. from flying home. American officials said such delays were sometimes necessary to assess whether a person posed a security threat. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on American-Islamic Relations protested that the rights of such travelers were being violated.At Yusuf Wehelie\u2019s detention hearing in July, the authorities said he had told undercover agents that he supported the Islamic State and that if he couldn\u2019t join it overseas, he would attack a military recruiting center, possibly using explosives. (Mr. Wehelie\u2019s lawyer, Nina Ginsberg, said that in later recorded conversations, he disavowed those statements and later stopped replying to the undercover agents.)In Baltimore, another young man named Maalik Alim Jones was arrested late last year and charged with joining a terrorist group in Africa. Imam Bengharsa had preached on occasion at a Baltimore mosque Mr. Jones attended, but it is not clear that they knew each other.The F.B.I. has been closely watching the imam for months, law enforcement officials say. A spokesman for the bureau declined to comment.The authorities are concerned that Imam Bengharsa, who claims an impressive list of scholarly credentials, may be spreading the Islamic State message that violence can be justified against perceived enemies of the faith. In view of the payment to Mr. Gregerson, they also fear he may be financing other supporters of the Islamic State. The F.B.I. has said in court that he is under investigation for conspiring and providing material support to the Islamic State.Imam Bengharsa did not reply to emails, phone messages or a note left at his townhouse in Clarksburg, Md., a town equidistant from Baltimore and Washington.He denied that he supported the Islamic State but said: \u201cIt might appear that way. I am an advocate of the United States and the West getting the hell out of the Middle East and the Muslim world.\u201dHe added a question: \u201cIf this was the case, why haven\u2019t they come to arrest me?\u201dImam Bengharsa, who was born in Libya, moved to the United States at age 10, according to a biography he posted online. He claims to have received a degree from Al Azhar University in Cairo, and additional degrees in economics and Islamic studies.He lived in Texas and later, after embracing religion, worked as a chaplain in Maryland prisons from 2006 to 2009, as an imam at the Islamic Society of Annapolis from 2009 to 2010 and at Masjid Umar, a small storefront mosque outside Baltimore, from 2011 to 2014. Last year he created the Islamic Jurisprudence Center, whose street address turns out to be a mailbox at the UPS Store near his home in Clarksburg. The authorities said he also frequently visited another mosque, Dar al-Taqwa, in the Baltimore suburb of Ellicott City.Imam Bengharsa appears to have long held very conservative views. In his 2011 lectures at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, for example, he said Muslims must strictly follow the shariah, or Islamic law, no matter where they live.In his standoff with the F.B.I., Imam Bengharsi appears to have scant support in the American Muslim community. Muhammad Jameel, the president of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, said that the imam\u2019s marriage lectures five years ago were his only connection to the mosque and that his recent statements were \u201cagainst all the tenets of Islam.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a nut,\u201d Mr. Jameel said. \u201cHe has freedom of speech. But if he\u2019s a criminal, I want to see him in jail.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

The Hajjes cringed at making requests of their patrons or doing anything that could seem like taking advantage. Even when Mr. Hajj\u2019s father asked the couple for money, a humiliating request for the older man, they did not feel they could siphon from the allowances the sponsors had given them.Asking the sponsors about more than one relative seemed like too much.

He was one of the million-plus refugees in Lebanon, another face in a cluster of laborers waiting all day at the intersection for a chance to work. Even if one of the trucks rumbling by stopped, work was not a sure thing. Sometimes the men would rush the vehicle, piling onto the back, and the strongest would force the others off, winning the job.

They had lived in tandem since childhood. Mouhamad was the one who had spotted Eman as a potential wife for his younger brother. When the Hajjes lost their fourth child, shortly after birth, in Lebanon last year, the two brothers stood shoulder to shoulder to dig the tiny grave.The two used to stand at the intersection together, looking like a matched set with their skinny frames.

The shelter was so cramped that they often slept outside during the summer. Ali did not want his older children, 5 and 3, to feel deprived, so he sometimes brought home candy even though he could not afford it.

He feared that his family had no prospects: no ability to return to Syria, no ticket out of Lebanon, no education. His 5-year-old daughter, Nihal, longed to attend school, but he could not afford to send her. She sat in the shed and tried to write, holding pencil over paper.

She entered with a long to-do list: Remind Ms. Hajj of her first-ever teeth-cleaning appointment. Check in about sign-ups for swimming classes. Slip a few dollars to 8-year-old Moutayam to pay for his school assignment book. She told his parents to check it regularly, even though she knew they were unlikely to understand a word.After a morning at an art exhibit, Peggy Karas arrived at the Hajj apartment just as Mouhamad and the children were returning from school.

But the relationship had taken on a depth she had never predicted. Ms. Hajj had arrived in Canada in her final trimester of pregnancy, and when the older woman learned that the Syrian mother had lost her last baby, she devoted herself to seeing this one into the world. At 68, she wanted grandchildren, but none had yet arrived. Here were four children who needed help, the oldest three delighted by things Canadians took for granted \u2014 new pencils, popcorn at the movies, a soccer goal with a net. Like a real grandmother, she often found herself thinking about them during the day, wondering what they were up to.Initially, she thought sponsorship would be a matter of \u201cO.K., yes, we\u2019ll give you money,\u201d as she put it.

The Hajjes were supposed to be self-sufficient by next February, but she feared they had virtually no chance of succeeding.

Mr. Hajj\u2019s triumphs in English class, like counting the capital letters in a sentence, shrank next to the magnitude of what he had to learn. When the sponsorship year ended in less than six months, he would need a job, but that could mean he would have less time \u2014 or none \u2014 for language instruction. The Canadian government had already funded part of the Hajjes\u2019 integration, and without financial support from the sponsors, they might have to go on welfare.Together, the sponsors had more than a century of experience teaching school, yet they struggled to propel the family to basic literacy.

But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.\u201cCountries like Germany are well aware of data privacy, and it has made them more wary of where data is kept,\u201d said Gregor Petri, a cloud computing analyst at the technology research firm Gartner in Veghel, the Netherlands. \u201cLocal data sovereignty has become important, and American companies are now aware of that.\u201dThere is also a more basic explanation for American companies\u2019 expansion into European cloud computing: a growing amount of money to be made.Europe\u2019s market for so-called cloud application services, or software that is run virtually across the internet, is expected to more than double, to $16.1 billion, by the end of the decade, according to Gartner. That will still correspond to just one-third of the North American market, whose value is expected to reach $47 billion over the same period.Despite that relatively small size, Europe\u2019s market remains one of the largest for American cloud providers, many of which are increasing investments worldwide as companies and individuals increasingly rely on cloud-based services \u2014 such as iCloud, from Apple, and Dropbox, the online storage company \u2014 in their daily lives.In an interview, Rainer Strassner, manager of Microsoft\u2019s cloud program in Germany, said the country\u2019s law protected data stored on the servers there from information requests by foreign governments, including the United States.While such investments have focused primarily on business customers, other American tech companies have made similarly large investments aimed at speeding up digital services for everyday users across the 28-member European Union.Facebook is also working on its own Irish cloud computing center, while expanding an existing site in Sweden.Advertisement"}

And as global businesses grow, collaborative technology has become a necessary tool to help sustain this 24/7-work model.

It was an unwieldy process that could take up to several months. But since then, the 1,000-person Switzerland-based operation has gone through a digital overhaul, vastly improving its workflow.\u201cWe\u2019ve come from an environment that was not very collaborative,\u201d says Tatam, the company\u2019s IT Business Partner Manager. \u201cPeople were taking all their files on USB drives and having difficulties getting into networks with various passwords to answer simple business needs. We had piles and piles of black books with secretaries running around trying to find people (to sign off). They would stay on people\u2019s desks three or four weeks.\u201dAt any given time, 30 to 40 percent of Global Fund\u2019s employees are traveling to foreign countries where their partners are working, completing applications for funding, monitoring supply chains and more. The bottom line, says Tatam, isn\u2019t making a profit, but giving away money\u2014and as efficiently as possible.\u201cThe first KPI (key performance indicator) is impact: how many lives we\u2019re saving, how quickly we\u2019re managing to get services to people in need,\u201d says Tatam, who instituted Adobe\u2019s Document Cloud to enable digital work processes, and in particular, electronic signing. \u201cIf you're waiting for someone to physically look at a document, then you can\u2019t go to the next stage. If you digitalize it, you can do it when you\u2019re waiting for the cab at the airport. Ten people can get it at the same time and sign it in minutes.\u201dBut for Joseph Hei, who cofounded car seat and stroller company Orbit Baby in 2005, working purely virtually is still fantasy. Based in Newark, Calif., the company frequently collaborates with overseas factories, and digital communication is key.\u201cI always tell young engineers that the real-world job nowadays with consumer products is mostly a communication job, not the 'building things' job they thought they were preparing for in school,\u201d he says. For example, the company's Silicon Valley-based engineers would spend a lot of time creating computer-aided designs (CAD) that would be emailed to their factories\u2019 engineering teams in Asia for implementation. Eventually, Hei developed a more efficient workflow involving a daily communication with CAD ideas and notes.\u201cWe should admit that in an ideal world, your team is all in one place,\u201d says Hei, who has also lectured at Stanford University on design and business. \u201cIf the person has a very specific technical job, then this precondition becomes less important, but it's a matter of degrees.\u201d Meanwhile, Plex's Valory argues that the collaborative technology that allows a distributed workforce to function has an added advantage: It helps monitor employee productivity.\u201cPeople can hide out in cubicles doing nothing for months,\u201d says Valory, who formerly worked for a number of large enterprise software companies. \u201cEven open workspaces, no cubes, that doesn\u2019t make it work. The engineer will say, \u2018It will take me four months\u2019 when it actually took him three days.\u201dBut in a virtual environment, you can\u2019t hide because all of the communication is out in the open. \u201cIf you eliminate all the bottlenecks and don't have to wait for a one-on-one once a week, information is completely open,\u201d he says. From the start, Plex built a dashboard that shows what employees are working on, as well as a culture of trust and accountability. It also has an open vacation policy.\u201cWe don\u2019t care when they're working,\u201d he says, \u201cas long as they get work done.\u201dAnd finally, the technology ultimately improves the product \u2014 from a cultural perspective.\u201cIt allows you to not have such a U.S.-centric or myopic view of the world,\u201d says Valory. \u201cYou\u2019re building a product for a global market. If all your employees work in a 20-mile radius of your Sunnyvale office, user empathy is pretty low.\u201dUltimately, Hei says the barriers for a 9-to-5 virtual reality are those of human nature.\u201cI think of virtual work as an elastic process in the sense that you can stretch the two ends of the rubber band apart, but at some point the two need to come back together before stretching apart again,\u201d he says. \u201cThe \u2018bounciness\u2019 of the rubber band or how often it needs to snap back together is influenced by a lot of things: for example, the type of work and industry.\u201dValory concedes that he can\u2019t work around demand for more intimate socializing, especially for isolated single employees who might need a work environment where they can meet co-workers in person.\u201cThat might be a market force against us,\u201d says Valory, who predicts that perhaps one day, a physical office space could be a selling point when virtual offices become the norm.Though we're still years away from that possibility, as our workforce gets younger, a shift has undoubtedly begun. Millennials and the generation behind them are embracing the distributed model, with many startups naturally forming in a virtual sphere.\u201cThe world is so connected, it\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d says Valory. \u201cWho knows which ones of us will graduate to be the next Google or Apple?\u201d But what Valory does know for sure? \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going back.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

The temperature rises. The Blue Angels buzz overhead for Fleet Week as tens of thousands of business technology types descend on the city for Salesforce.com\u2019s annual conference.This year\u2019s Salesforce shindig comes with a little extra noise: For weeks now, there have been reports that the company, which makes online software to help users manage tasks like sales and marketing, is looking to buy Twitter.It is not a stretch to say that this would be a puzzling move. Salesforce has become a staple of San Francisco. It is arguably the city\u2019s biggest tech employer, and the soon-to-be tallest building in town will carry the company\u2019s name. While it has never had big profits, the Salesforce business appears stable and growing.Just a few miles down the road from Salesforce\u2019s main office is the home of Twitter, a company with a much-better-known brand but a far less successful business. Twitter is a giant of social media, of course, used by celebrities, athletes and presidential candidates. But it is struggling with growth and its problem with trolls, a term for those who torment others online, and various sorts of hateful content have proved hard to fix.How the two companies would jell is not clear. Could Salesforce absorb all of Twitter\u2019s content to improve its artificial intelligence projects? Could Salesforce help its customers gain a better understanding of their brands by having close access to the world\u2019s Twitter feeds? And would any of that justify putting up with Twitter\u2019s problems?\u201cThis would be a disaster,\u201d said Joel Fishbein, managing director at BTIG, a financial services firm. \u201cBenioff is a visionary, but this could blow up. Engineers could leave Salesforce, and it would send the stock down 30 or 40 percent.\u201dMixing different kinds of tech companies into one big outfit rarely goes well. EBay and Skype didn\u2019t work, before eBay sold Skype to a group of investors. Cisco Systems, the networking technology company, tried to get into the consumer electronics business with acquisitions like Pure Digital, but it eventually shut down the whole consumer effort. And do we even need to mention star-crossed combinations like Google and Motorola, and Microsoft and Nokia?Sometimes it\u2019s best to stick to what you\u2019re good at. Your product may not be a fixture on the celebrity circuit, but having your name on the tallest building in your hometown is a pretty high-profile thing, too.Advertisement"}

Buczkowski, who oversees advanced engineering at Ford.\u201cYour spouse could add things to the shopping list, which your car would alert you to,\u201d Mr. Buczkowski said. The updated list could then automatically tip off the car\u2019s navigation system about where to pick up the last-minute items.The first generation of connected systems like G.M.\u2019s OnStar were focused on helping drivers when they were lost or their cars broke down, and the second generation has been about connecting the dashboard to smartphones for streaming live traffic information or audio services like Pandora, said Mr. Moinzadeh at Airbiquity.The next generation, he said, will focus on managing our entire digital lives, aided by semiautonomous systems that assume more responsibility for actual driving tasks.\u201cOnce we get to the world of autonomous driving, these cars are not going to be about horsepower but about the in-vehicle experience and how it\u2019s connected to your lifestyle,\u201d Mr. Moinzadeh said. \u201cThe car will talk to all your connected things, whether it\u2019s your refrigerator or your home security system.\u201dMercedes-Benz is among the automakers intent on integrating cars more fully into the mobile communications network, without waiting to peg it to autonomous driving.\u201cThe car is developing into a quality-time machine,\u201d Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of Daimler, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, said last month at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin.Next year, Mr. Zetsche said, the company\u2019s In Car Office services will automatically connect drivers to scheduled conference calls and navigate to appointments based on calendar entries.Other industry executives see potential health and safety applications.\u201cIn health care, it\u2019s about monitoring people and how they are behaving,\u201d said Bret Greenstein, vice president for the Watson internet-of-things artificial intelligence division at IBM.Driver attentiveness can be assessed by a combination of sensors in the car, including acoustic monitors, eye trackers and wearable devices, Mr. Greenstein said.\u201cEven how fast or safely you drive tells us about your mood and well-being,\u201d he said.Brain waves and heart rates can indicate stress, according to Mr. Buczkowski of Ford. Such signals might then tell the car to block incoming calls or switch the audio system from AC/DC to Yanni.The welter of onboard sensors, Mr. Buczkowski said, could turn the car into a four-wheeled digital stethoscope that compiles a continuous record of your condition, generating a more accurate assessment of your health compared with the snapshot of a once-a-year checkup.Between the digital dreams and the on-road reality, though, there are technological challenges, according to Chris Penrose, who oversees the internet-of-things group at AT&T. The company, he said, is working on such efforts with nearly 20 different auto brands around the world.But right now, for example, there is no single networking standard for internet-of-things devices, even in the so-called smart home segment. There are multiple wireless systems, including ZigBee and Z-Wave, and no single software platform has taken hold.\u201cThere are multiple gateways into the house now,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive technology for the Silicon Valley company Nvidia.Onboard car systems must have access to the vast amount of information accumulating from all these devices to take advantage fully of the internet of things, Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut if there is no standard,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes it very difficult.\u201dMr. Buczkowski acknowledges the hurdles. Separate and incompatible systems from Google and Amazon might be able to compete or coexist in the home market. But cars operate in the public sphere and will need to share information with traffic systems, parking meters and other cars.\u201cVehicles from Ford, G.M., Honda, etc., will all have to talk to each other,\u201d Mr. Buczkowski said. \u201cHow do we manage it \u2014 and who manages it?\u201d\u201cIn automotive, it\u2019s a unique situation because the device is traveling at 60 or 70 miles per hour,\u201d Mr. Moinzadeh said.There is also the sheer ubiquity of automobiles. Everything around us will be connected, including people and cities, said Mohamad Nasser, general manager of the internet-of-things business at Sprint, the mobile communications company.\u201cYou don\u2019t want people messing around with the streetlights,\u201d Mr. Nasser said.While being constantly online may have its drawbacks, it also makes vehicles more resilient, experts say. More and more, as Tesla has already demonstrated, our cars will be upgradable over the air, making them easier to update and repair. And if cars are communicating with their surroundings and one another, the benefits will outweigh the risks, many predict.But the risks cannot be ignored. Tim VanGoethem, a vice president at the telematics firm Harman International, which has been focusing on automotive security, said the threat from hackers was one aspect of an inevitable evolution automakers would have to confront.\u201cOnline shopping and mobile banking,\u201d he pointed out, \u201chave had to go through this already.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Curbs Expansion of Fiber Optic Network, Cutting Jobs", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is signaling a strategy shift for one of its most ambitious and costly efforts: bringing blazing-fast web connections to homes across America.The company said on Tuesday that it was curbing the expansion of its high-speed fiber optic internet network and reducing staff in the unit responsible for the work. Alphabet did not provide an exact number for the jobs that will be cut.Craig Barratt, chief executive of Access, the Alphabet division containing Google Fiber, also said he planned to step down because the company was shifting to new technologies and methods of deploying high-speed internet. No replacement was announced. Mr. Barratt, an Alphabet senior vice president, said he would remain an adviser to the company.When Google introduced Fiber in 2010, it was heralded as a sign of the company\u2019s ambitions to compete against cable and telecommunications operators who have controlled the market for internet access. But after years of costly investments to dig up roads and lay fiber optic cable, Google started considering alternatives, including wireless and fiber partnerships, that did not necessarily require the company to build a full network.The company\u2019s fiber optic internet and television are currently available in eight metro areas, including Atlanta, Nashville and Salt Lake City.The company does not disclose financial results for Access. But its other-bets businesses reported revenue of $185 million in the second quarter of this year and an operating loss of $859 million. The Fiber business accounted for the bulk of $280 million in quarterly capital expenditures \u2014 money spent on things like equipment, the company said.Alphabet has not disclosed the number of Google Fiber subscribers in cities where the service is available. In the markets where it operates, Google Fiber costs $70 a month for the fastest internet connection and an additional $60 a month for its TV service, but Google has to pay to connect homes to the network even if they do not subscribe.Access said it would continue to operate in markets where it already offers fiber optic service or has started construction, but it planned to halt discussions with cities where it was considering expansion. On its website, Google Fiber identified eight \u201cpotential fiber\u201d cities, including Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix.Because Google runs most of its business on the internet, analysts have suggested that its entry into the costly world of fiber optic internet was an attempt to motivate existing internet providers to accelerate the introduction of faster web connections.Advertisement"}
