{"Headline": "A Lieutenant in Eradicating Smallpox Remembers the General", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byThe Doctor's WorldThe Agency for International Development, which sponsored the program, had grievously erred in designing it and carrying it out, making it impossible to accomplish the mission. But Dr. Henderson, who died in August, saw a way to turn the fiasco into a victory. He forced AID to add smallpox vaccination to the immunization program.That small achievement led to an even greater one. Eventually, from a small office at the World Health Organization, Dr. Henderson oversaw an army of thousands of lieutenants who wiped smallpox first from West Africa and then, in 1980, from the world.His legions did what no other group of doctors has ever done: rid the world of a naturally occurring human disease. He was the overseer of what is perhaps medicine\u2019s greatest triumph.The path to this monumental public health victory was tortuous, full of mini disasters, bureaucratic quagmires, rivalries, skepticism and dissension. Dr. Henderson met it all with diplomacy, old-school epidemiology and cutting-edge technology.His team freeze-dried a vaccine that Edward Jenner developed in England in 1796, so it no longer needed refrigeration, and adapted a two-pronged needle to simplify its application. The team also adopted a strategy of \u201cring vaccination\u201d \u2014 identifying and isolating each case and vaccinating only those exposed to the infected individual, instead of immunizing the entire population.I first met D.A. \u2014 everyone called him D.A. \u2014 in 1963, when I joined the epidemic intelligence service program at the C.D.C. As we chatted in a cafeteria line, D.A. raised the theoretical possibility of eradicating smallpox, a preventable but incurable scourge.In medical school, none of my professors had ever broached the possibility of disease eradication. They rarely even spoke of smallpox, even though the disease has altered the course of history, killing hundreds of millions of people and blinding and scarring even more.Before I left for West Africa on my measles mission, D.A. told me to learn about smallpox \u2014 a hint, I realized only later, that he planned to take on this fiend.The measles vaccine was effective. But, as was all too evident after I arrived in West Africa, the number of children who received it was vastly reduced by various logistical problems, like limited communications and difficult travel.The vaccine had to be kept cold and away from ultraviolet light, for instance. To deliver it to remote areas in the savanna and the Sahara, AID purchased huge trucks designed for American highways.The trucks were too large to maneuver through ruts in the dirt roads and too heavy for the wooden planks that served as bridges. The agency also bought refrigerators that operated only in temperatures below 90 degrees and ran on butane. They were placed near the gasoline tanks on the trucks.The only time one of those refrigerators was actually operating, it set off an explosion just after I exited a truck cab, injuring the driver. Had those refrigerators worked, we\u2019d have had many blasts.I cabled AID about the problems. The reply: Park the trucks in the shade to lower the temperature below 90. In the savanna, alas, the tallest trees were shrubs.Exasperated, I wrote a cable requesting 10,000 trees. The language recalled something I might have written back when I was at The Harvard Lampoon. D.A. appreciated the humor; AID officials did not, but they needed C.D.C. support.D.A. eventually goaded them into adding smallpox to the flailing measles program in West Africa. It would soon turn the tide against the disease, and in 1966, the World Health Organization approved its own global smallpox eradication program and appointed D.A. its director.Soviet officials and the first director of the W.H.O. had long advocated a smallpox vaccination program, but the United States and many other countries opposed it, favoring malaria as the target. D.A.\u2019s success in West Africa had a critical domino effect, however, convincing many skeptics that smallpox could be eradicated worldwide.Since then, health workers have come close to ridding the world of just two other diseases: polio and Guinea worm (dracunculiasis). But after a two-year absence from Africa, polio has re-emerged in Nigeria, which joins Afghanistan and Pakistan as the only countries where the virus is spreading.And the recent discovery of Guinea worm among many domestic dogs suggests the possibility it has found a new host, delaying the goal of making it the first parasitic disease to be eradicated worldwide. (One animal disease, rinderpest, caused by a viral cousin of measles, was eradicated in 2011.)Many experts have wondered why the spectacular success with smallpox did not earn D.A.\u2019s vaccinators, or the W.H.O., a Nobel Prize. One reason, a member of the committee that chooses recipients in the medicine category told me several years ago, is that the prize honors scientists for recent discoveries.The smallpox eradication program did not qualify, then, because Jenner\u2019s vaccine came 184 years earlier.Over the years, D.A. and I sparred over the fate of the remaining stocks of smallpox virus in high-security laboratories in Russia and the United States. He ardently favored destroying them, in keeping with the original plan.I favored keeping them, in case scientists someday needed to test a novel and presently unfathomable finding. D.A. and I traded our last emails in June, after he had reread several of my articles from India and elsewhere about the final efforts to eradicate smallpox.He recalled the time I was trapped on a rooftop as the Ganges overflowed, and \u201cthe all but impossible problems of working in the summer heat of India, in the middle of floods while battling armies of mosquitoes.\u201dIt may have been all but impossible, as he said. But it was also an era of great possibilities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Is Being Hypocritical", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe Supreme Court\u2019s motto may be \u201cequal justice under law.\u201d But sometimes it seems more like \u201cdo as we say, not as we do.\u201dConsider Williams v. Pennsylvania, a case the court heard in February concerning whether a state judge should have recused himself from a capital case in which he had an earlier involvement. At one point during the hearing, Justice Elena Kagan, who participated in both Supreme Court lawsuits concerning the Affordable Care Act despite having served as solicitor general in the Obama administration, asked what would constitute \u201csignificant involvement\u201d in a case \u2014 i.e., enough to require a recusal.The answer to that question may not be obvious. But surely Justice Kagan\u2019s experience in the Obama administration constituted \u201csignificant involvement\u201d in the Affordable Care Act cases. In the end, a majority of justices, including Justice Kagan, ruled in Williams v. Pennsylvania that the judge who refused to recuse himself should have stepped aside.So went another case in what I call the court\u2019s self-referential docket. Each year, the justices hear a handful of suits that have parallels with how they act as stewards of their institution. But instead of changing their own practices in light of their holdings in these cases, the justices too often carry on as before, as if they can play by their own rules when it comes to transparency and accountability.In recent years there have been a number of such cases concerning money and the potential for judicial corruption. In 2015, for example, the court ruled that the Florida Bar was within its rights to discipline a judge for personally soliciting campaign contributions. The majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., held that there was a \u201cvital state interest in safeguarding public confidence in the fairness and integrity\u201d of the nation\u2019s judges.But if there is a vital interest in the integrity of the court, why was Justice Stephen G. Breyer allowed to rule on a case last fall in which his wife held about $33,000 worth of stock in a company whose subsidiary was one of the litigants? Or how about the $400,000 worth of shares that Chief Justice Roberts owned in Intel, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, which all signed amicus briefs supporting Walmart in a 2011 class-action lawsuit before the court? (Chief Justice Roberts voted in favor of Walmart in that case.)Other cases have concerned the First Amendment\u2019s protection of speech. In May, the Supreme Court considered whether to review a circuit court\u2019s decision that upheld the conviction of a Maryland man for carrying a placard in protest in the middle of the Supreme Court\u2019s plaza. A lower court had deemed unconstitutional part of the 1949 law under which the man was prosecuted, which had banned protests in that plaza, but the circuit court overruled the decision. The justices decided not to hear the case, effectively condoning an anti-protest buffer zone in front of their courthouse \u2014 even though the Supreme Court has deemed anti-protest buffer zones around abortion clinics unconstitutional.Another ruling, from 1991, still looms over the court. In that case, Gregory v. Ashcroft, the court upheld a provision of Missouri\u2019s Constitution requiring state judges to retire at 70. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, writing for a majority that included Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, offered the following observation: \u201cIt is an unfortunate fact of life that physical and mental capacity sometimes diminish with age.\u201d Of course, Justice Scalia remained on the bench nearly a decade past his 70th birthday, and Justice Kennedy, who began his 30th term on the court this month, turned 80 over the summer.Just a week into the current term, there has already been a self-referential case. In Salman v. United States, argued on Oct. 5, the justices looked to reconcile two appeals courts\u2019 differing standards for what constitutes insider trading. Though the justices presumably don\u2019t give any thought to their investment portfolios when hearing cases, ample research has shown that their decisions do affect financial markets. Yet three justices \u2014 Justices Roberts, Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2014 maintain holdings in individual stocks and apparently do not place them in the types of investment accounts or blended funds that would shield them from any appearance of benefiting financially from their legal decisions.If the court wants to regain some of the respect it has lost in recent years, the justices should consider how, by acting more consistently with their own rulings, they could help build a more open and accountable institution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Answers to Questions About 403(b) Plans", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byPublic SacrificeCorporations that want to offer retirement plans must generally offer 401(k)\u2019s. The rules are different for public schools, which generally must offer 403(b)\u2019s, consultants say. Nonprofits and religious groups have some flexibility, but offering 403(b)\u2019s often can be simpler for them as employers.That depends. First, some background: 401(k) retirement plans are covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, overseen by the Labor Department. The law outlines minimum guidelines and protections for workers and requires employers or plan overseers to act in the best interests of participants.Here is where it gets more complicated. Governmental 403(b) plans \u2014 including public schools \u2014 are always exempt from Erisa (and it would take an act of Congress to change that). Instead, exempt plans are covered by a patchwork of state laws or less stringent federal securities regulations.Church 403(b) plans are also generally exempt from Erisa, unless they opt to follow those rules.Plans run by certain nonprofits may or may not be covered by the more stringent federal law, depending on the employer\u2019s role in the plan. If a nonprofit employer offers a match, for example, it must comply with Erisa regulations. Some nonprofits choose to offer 401(k) plans instead of 403(b)\u2019s.Whatever their differences, all 403(b) plans are tax-deferred vehicles, so they must, at a minimum, follow Internal Revenue Service regulations to ensure the plans are properly operated and administered.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Lost Cultures of Whales", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Supported byOpinionAboard the Balaena, Caribbean \u2014 I am alone on deck, my headphones filled with the sounds of the deep ocean. I have been tracking the sperm whales since 4 a.m. Now the island of Dominica imposes its dark shape in front of the rising sun.I tell him it\u2019s Pinchy and her calf, Tweak. Tweak is making small suckling dives alongside his mother. Then Pinchy dives, and we move the boat into the calm spot she left behind \u2014 the \u201cflukeprint.\u201d We are collecting the whales\u2019 skin and fecal samples and recording the sounds they make on a hydrophone, an underwater microphone. Soon after Pinchy dives, we hear the clicks of her codas \u2014 whale social calls; she is talking with Tweak. Then the echolocation starts as she hunts for squid. Tweak slides below the surface in search of his babysitter, Fingers, who is Pinchy\u2019s aunt. Hal and I have breakfast, then wake the crew.Sperm whales live rich and complex lives in a part of the world we find difficult to even explore. And many aspects of their lives appear remarkably similar to our own. Grandmothers, mothers and daughters babysit, defend and raise calves together. Family is critical to surviving in the open ocean, and each has its own way of doing things. The whales live in communities of neighboring families in a multicultural oceanic society.Behavior is what you do, culture is how you do it. All sperm whales do the same things \u2014 feed, swim, babysit, defend, socialize \u2014 but how they do them is different around the world. Just as humans use forks or chopsticks, they, too, differ in how they eat, what species of squid they eat, how fast they travel and where they roam, their social behavior, and probably many other ways we still do not understand.They seem to mark these cultural differences with different dialects \u2014 or distinct sets of codas. Families that share the same dialect we call a clan. The whale families in the Eastern Caribbean Clan use 22 different coda patterns. When two sperm whale families meet at sea, they need a way to recognize one another; those from a similar culture are more likely to cooperate. It turns out that sperm whale families in the same clan will spend time together, while families that speak different dialects, from different clans, will never interact.Whales\u2019 codas appear to broadcast their identities. One coda pattern distinguishes individuals, a set of others identifies their families, and a special one marks the cultural clan. The 1+1+3 coda (click pause click pause click click click) is unique to the Eastern Caribbean, is made by all the whales in the Eastern Caribbean Clan, and has remained identical for at least 30 years. Calves spend at least two years learning to make it correctly. And they learn to produce it with great fidelity, which most likely ensures that their clan membership is recognizable over their large geographic ranges and across the diversity of other whales they encounter.The whales in the Caribbean are distinct, and they appear to identify themselves as distinct. Unfortunately, as a result of a changing climate and human impacts, these urban whales, who live in nearshore waters, are at risk. One in three baby whales born off Dominica will not survive to its first birthday. Tweak\u2019s cousin, Digit, had just begun hunting on her own when she got rope from a fishing net tangled around her tail; now she can no longer dive as well, and is struggling to survive.Losing a large number of individuals is a tragedy, but what happens when we lose an entire whale culture? What do we lose when we lose a way of life?Every culture, whale or otherwise, is its own solution to the problems of the environment in which it lives. With its extirpation, we lose the traditional knowledge of what it means to be a Caribbean whale and how to exploit the deep sea riches around the islands efficiently. And that cannot be recovered, not even if the global population of sperm whales was robust enough to support remigration into the Caribbean. These would be different whales, from elsewhere, who do things differently. This region would be profoundly impoverished for the new whales, who would be more vulnerable here. The species as a whole would lose some of its repertoire on how to survive.They surrounded the divers and started clicking \u2014 they seemed to be saying hello. Read and then take a swim with whales in a virtual reality feature.I could point to many reasons to protect whales, like the way they mitigate the effects of climate change by cycling nutrients that enable the ocean to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, or how top predators regulate marine food chains. But if we are to preserve life, ours and theirs, we must find ways to succeed together, and value diversity in our societies and in our ecosystems.Shane Gero, a behavioral ecologist, is a founder of the Dominica Sperm Whale Project.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Family Behind Korean Conglomerate Lotte Is Indicted in Corruption Case", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The head of the South Korean retail giant Lotte, one of the country\u2019s largest family-controlled conglomerates, was indicted on Wednesday on tax evasion, embezzlement and other criminal charges, the latest high-profile corruption scandal to hit big businesses here.Several relatives of the Lotte chairman, Shin Dong-bin, 61, were also indicted, with the family accused of evading $76 million in taxes over all and costing the company $165 million through embezzlement and breach of trust, South Korean prosecutors said in a news release.Although corruption scandals have regularly rocked family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols, in South Korea, it is rare for the entire chaebol family to be indicted together.In a typical chaebol conglomerate, the chairman\u2019s family owns a small portion of the corporate empire but controls it through loyal executives at subsidiaries that are also interlocked through circular holdings.Over the decades, the chaebols have spearheaded South Korea\u2019s export-driven economy. But their imperious chairmen have in several instances been convicted of tax evasion and other crimes, though seldom kicked out of management.Indicted with Mr. Shin on Wednesday were his brother, Shin Dong-joo, 62; their 94-year-old father, the Lotte founder, Shin Kyuk-ho; and the senior Mr. Shin\u2019s common-law wife and a former winner of the Miss Lotte beauty pageant, Seo Mi-kyung, 57. None of them was arrested.Mr. Shin was accused of arranging for his father and other relatives to receive fat salaries from Lotte subsidiaries although they did not work there, prosecutors said.He was also accused of arranging for Lotte subsidiaries to buy stocks of another affiliate at illegally high prices, and giving lucrative contracts \u2014 like running cafeterias in a chain of Lotte movie theaters \u2014 to a company owned by his family members without conducting competitive bidding.South Korea has placed restrictions on such deals because chaebol chairmen were often accused of using them to help their children accumulate a fortune.A household name in South Korea, Lotte operates department stores, duty-free shops, shopping malls, hotels, amusement parks, multiplexes, burger joints and coffee shops.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "TD Ameritrade to Buy Scottrade in $4 Billion Deal", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byTD Ameritrade announced on Monday that it would acquire Scottrade Financial Services, a rival discount brokerage, for $4 billion, in a bid for scale at a time when small investors are losing their taste for stock trading.The deal reflects the ongoing evolution of the investment business.Both companies trace the roots of their business model to a regulatory move in 1975 that banned fixed brokerage commissions, giving rise to a clutch of firms, including Charles Schwab & Company, that offered stock trades with discounted commissions. Discount brokers continued to flourish in the dot-com era, when individual investors, day traders and smaller advisers helped drive a boom in online trading.But in the current market uncertainty, mom-and-pop investors are more reticent to buy and sell stocks. Index funds and other so-called passive investments have also gained favor, limiting interest in owning individual stocks.The industry is feeling the pressure. TD Ameritrade, for example, said on Monday that its average client trades per day declined 7 percent in the three months through September.The weak environment is driving a broad industry consolidation.The deal with Scottrade would give TD Ameritrade, which is based in Omaha, $944 billion in client assets and 10 million accounts. TD Ameritrade would also more than quadruple the size of its branch network.After the merger, Rodger Riney, the Scottrade founder and chief executive, would join TD Ameritrade\u2019s board.\u201cJoining forces will enable us to offer clients an expanded array of trading tools, enhanced education resources and advanced option capabilities with broader geographic reach,\u201d Mr. Riney said. \u201cTogether, we will be well-positioned to compete in today\u2019s rapidly evolving financial services industry.\u201dThe deal is expected to take place in two parts, with Toronto-Dominion Bank, one of TD Ameritrade\u2019s largest shareholders, first acquiring Scottrade\u2019s banking business for $1.3 billion in cash.

{"Headline": "Trump, the Next Big Short", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byA Republican billionaire entrepreneur runs for president on a platform of huge tax cuts for the rich and for business and yet, when his candidacy appears ascendant, the markets swoon.When the prospects brighten for his Democratic challenger \u2014 who has not held a private sector job in more than two decades and who is proposing tax increases for the wealthy \u2014 stocks climb.This is yet another paradox of the tumultuous candidacy of Donald J. Trump: He has spent his entire career among business executives, and yet that constituency is voting with hard cash that he should not be president.I understand that Mr. Trump has pitched his campaign more to white working-class Americans. But no Republican presidential hopeful in memory has been so unpopular in the business community, as one of the prime thermometers of the private sector \u2014 the stock market \u2014 indicates.At a board meeting two weeks ago, I chatted separately with two prominent Republican businessmen. One, the chief executive of a Fortune 100 company, said that he had never voted for a Democrat but couldn\u2019t support Mr. Trump.The other, a private equity investor who had voted Republican only once, said that he was so scared of a Trump presidency that he has donated \u201cevery cent possible\u201d under the campaign finance rules to Hillary Clinton.Even before the tape of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 comments about women became public, many executives were appalled by his temperament and judgment. They also find his economic policy positions \u2013 from his trade-bashing to his budget-busting tax cuts \u2013 terrifying.According to a recent compilation by The Wall Street Journal, not a single chief executive of a Fortune 100 company has donated to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or endorsed him. In contrast, Hillary Clinton has received contributions from 11 of these corporate chieftains. In 2012, nearly a third of this group supported Mitt Romney, while just five donated to President Obama.As Mrs. Clinton\u2019s dominance of the first presidential debate became apparent, investors cheered; markets around the world rose and the dollar strengthened. A report from Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm, estimated that a Trump victory would cause stocks to lose 7 percent, while a Clinton victory would lead to a 4 percent increase.In a poll by Bloomberg Politics (conducted in August, before Mr. Trump\u2019s recent rocky spell), 46 percent of those with more than $50,000 invested in the market preferred Mrs. Clinton, compared with 36 percent for Mr. Trump.They are not alone. The National Association for Business Economics surveyed 414 members, and Mr. Trump didn\u2019t even come in second. Mrs. Clinton was supported by 55 percent, while the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, received 15 percent, and the Republican hopeful trailed at 14 percent.Another group of economists is similarly unenthusiastic. A Wall Street Journal survey of 45 former members of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers found not one who would endorse Mr. Trump. (Some did not respond or wouldn\u2019t say.)At the top of business\u2019 fears is Mr. Trump\u2019s stance on trade. While Mrs. Clinton has also opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Trump has taken trade-bashing to a new level, threatening retaliatory moves like putting 35 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and 45 percent on those from China.A recent study by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that, rather than bringing jobs back to the United States, the tariffs would result in trade wars that could cost our economy five million jobs and possibly lead to a recession.His other economic policies also often cause alarm. In repeatedly attacking the Federal Reserve as being \u201cpolitical,\u201d Mr. Trump has ignored decades of almost entirely consensus decision making by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. The committee is a model of rational, nonpartisan judgment compared with the Supreme Court, which often breaks along political lines.And while businessmen surely like tax cuts \u2014 especially for themselves \u2014 they worry over the magnitude of Mr. Trump\u2019s reductions and the lack of any specificity about how he would pay for them. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Trump tax policies would add $5.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.Lastly, people in business are repelled on both moral and economic grounds by Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deport more than 11 million illegal immigrants, which the conservative American Action Forum calculated would cost $400 billion to $600 billion, reduce gross domestic product by $1.6 trillion and take 20 years.All told, Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates that under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, unemployment would rise to nearly 7 percent, and about three million jobs would be lost.With metronomic regularity in his stump appearances, Mr. Trump promotes his qualifications as a billionaire businessman to fix what ails our economy. But his peers in the business world don\u2019t agree.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Aims for an Empire in Merger Talks With Time Warner", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byFor companies that sell consumers cable and internet service, merely distributing entertainment and programs is not enough. They want to own them.The media conglomerate Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN and the movie studio Warner Bros., has long been among the most prized takeover targets.It is being courted by AT&T, a telecommunications giant that lacks ownership of any of the shows and videos it delivers through its various businesses. The two are in advanced talks for AT&T to acquire Time Warner, and a deal may be announced as early as Monday, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.A merger would come at a pivotal time in the communications industry, where the giants are scrambling to create entertainment empires to maintain competitiveness as consumers increasingly embrace cheaper, digital alternatives.Regulators have been wary of allowing combinations of businesses that could create less competition and thwart innovation by start-ups, and a tie-up of AT&T and Time Warner could raise concerns. It is a bold move in an election year that will usher in a new administration and a fresh set of regulators.Time Warner is asking AT&T to pay more than $90 a share in the deal, said the people who asked not to be named because the details are still private.The transaction is not yet final and may fall apart or get delayed, said the people with knowledge of the discussions. Representatives from Time Warner and AT&T declined to comment.A combination with AT&T would be an about-face from Time Warner\u2019s strategy just seven years ago. The company divested Time Warner Cable in 2009, and Time Inc. in 2014, in order to focus on developing programs and entertainment.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Still, AT&T has historically been less aggressive than its peers in building a content empire. It was a losing bidder for Yahoo, for example.AT&T has a tendency to acquire industry leaders. In the media world that would be Time Warner and Disney, and Disney\u2019s $150 billion market valuation makes it a much larger takeover to swallow. Two other companies, Viacom and CBS, both controlled by the Redstone family, have been exploring a reunification.The biggest question posed by analysts after Bloomberg News first reported the talks on Thursday is whether or not this transaction would pass regulatory muster. Regulators including the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department have historically been skeptical of similar combinations.\u201cAt best, we believe a lengthy antitrust review of T/TWX with an uncertain outcome may give both sides pause on considering a combination,\u201d Credit Suisse research analysts wrote in a note on Thursday using the ticker symbols for AT&T and Time Warner. \u201cAt worst, it may act as a barrier to a deal being proposed, in our view.\u201dAdditionally, it is an audacious move with the presidential election just around the corner, which will most likely yield a reshaping of the top regulators that will study this deal. Hillary Clinton has promised to be tough on corporate mega-powers and consolidation within industries. Most analysts have surmised that a deal between AT&T and Time Warner would carry a significant amount of regulatory scrutiny.For Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, signing a deal may be worth the risk, if AT&T is willing to pay both a high enough price and a generous breakup fee in the event that the combination is blocked, said Richard S. Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG.In addition to the potential regulatory challenges, an acquisition of Time Warner would be a large one for AT&T to digest. The combined company would have about $150 billion worth of debt, with around $175 billion in annual revenue. In a low-interest rate environment, financing of such large deals has been more prudent.Some analysts are skeptical that AT&T could handle the deal. AT&T has said its \u201cplate is full\u201d in absorbing DirecTV, Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said in a note.Time Warner itself is no stranger to slicing and merging. The company is a byproduct of a merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1989, which created the largest media conglomerate in the world at the time, with cable, publishing and movie assets. Seven years later, the company acquired Turner Broadcasting, bringing the cable network CNN under its wing.In 2000, Time Warner merged with AOL, a combination that has since been seen as one of the largest mistakes ever in deal making. Nine years later, Time Warner said it would spin off AOL at a fraction of its valuation after the dot-com bubble burst.These days, Time Warner\u2019s units comprise premium channels such as HBO and Cinemax, as well as Turner, which operates TBS, Turner Sports and others, in addition to CNN. Time Warner also runs Warner Bros. Entertainment, which released movies including \u201cSully,\u201d \u201cStorks\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d this year.If the deal between AT&T and Time Warner succeeds, other media and entertainment companies could become takeover targets. Many stocks in that industry gained on Friday as more reports surfaced about the deal.Time Warner\u2019s shares gained 7.8 percent on Friday to $89.48, while AT&T\u2019s declined 3 percent to $37.49.Michael J. de la Merced and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs Didn\u2019t Trick Libyan Fund, Judge Says", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Libya, in the words of one lawyer, \u201cwas like the Wild West\u201d in 2008, when Goldman Sachs bankers arrived in the capital, Tripoli.What happened next was fought out in a London courtroom this summer.In a trial that revealed tales of prostitutes and lavish spending on hotels and meals, the Libyans accused Goldman of exerting undue influence over its employees and pushing the fund into improper investments that led to more than $1 billion in losses. Goldman argued that the Libyan fund was far more sophisticated than it had claimed and was simply suffering from \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse.\u201dOn Friday, a London judge came down heavily in Goldman\u2019s favor, sparing the Wall Street firm from paying a huge sum in damages. The ruling also provides some relief after several embarrassing overseas predicaments that have dogged Goldman and its reputation this year.The judge, Justice Vivien Rose of the High Court here, found that the relationship between Goldman Sachs and the fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, \u201cdid not go beyond the normal cordial and mutually beneficial relationship that grows up between a bank and a client.\u201dThe judge also found that the fees that Goldman earned on the disputed trades were not excessive \u201cgiven the nature of the trades and the work that had gone into winning them.\u201dAlthough the disputed trades may be regarded as unsuitable for a sovereign wealth fund, \u201cthere were other reasons why the L.I.A. wanted to enter into them and, if they were unsuitable, they were no different from many other investments that the L.I.A. made over the period in that regard,\u201d the judge said in her 120-page ruling.After the ruling, the Libyan Investment Authority said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the court\u2019s decision.\u201cTime will be needed fully to digest the judgment, and all options are being considered at this time,\u201d the fund said in a statement.In a statement, Goldman said, \u201cWe are pleased to win this case, with a comprehensive judgment in our favor.\u201dThe Libyan Investment Authority argued at trial that it was improperly steered into a series of complicated derivatives transactions by Goldman \u2014 when it simply wanted to invest in the stocks of Western companies \u2014 and lost $1.2 billion after the financial crisis hit, while Goldman pocketed more than $200 million in fees.The nine derivatives transactions were tied to the stocks of Citigroup, the French utility EDF and other companies.The court heard testimony from fund officials claiming that there was considerable anger when they discovered how risky the derivatives were. A lawyer for the Libyan Investment Authority told of a fund official\u2019s storming into a board room to scream obscenities at two Goldman bankers and telling them to leave Libya.\u201cI remember thinking that I had experienced the strangest meeting of my career between one of the largest sovereign wealth funds and one of the biggest international banks,\u201d she said.Despite such colorful descriptions, the trial featured few documents \u2014 and no testimony \u2014 from the major decision makers at the center of the dispute.A London court judged that the Wall Street firm hadn\u2019t taken advantage of the inexperienced sovereign wealth fund.Muhammad Layas, the chairman and chief executive of the Libyan Investment Authority, died in 2015, and Mustafa Zarti, the fund\u2019s former deputy chairman, did not testify in the case.Many of the fund\u2019s documents from before October 2013 were either destroyed or lost. One of Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s sons used the building in Tripoli where the sovereign wealth fund has its offices as his base during the revolution that unseated the Libyan leader and led to his death.Youssef Kabbaj, a former Goldman Sachs banker and an important contact for the wealth fund, also did not testify.As part of its case, the Libyan fund leveled accusations that Mr. Kabbaj had tried to win influence by providing entertainment and gifts to members of the wealth fund\u2019s staff, including iPods and chocolates.The fund also claimed that Mr. Kabbaj provided prostitutes during a lavish trip to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, and an internship to Haitem Zarti, the younger brother of Mustafa Zarti, the wealth fund\u2019s deputy chairman.The judge rejected that argument on Friday, saying that the main motivation behind the offer of an internship to Haitem Zarti was that Goldman thought he might be chosen to lead the wealth fund\u2019s new office in London and it would be beneficial to establish a working relationship at an early stage.\u201cAlthough the offer of the internship may have contributed to a friendly and productive atmosphere during the negotiation of the April trades, it did not have a material influence on the decision of Mr. Zarti and the L.I.A. to enter into the April trades,\u201d the judge said in her ruling.She also noted that there was no evidence that Mustafa Zarti knew the nature or extent of entertainment provided to his brother or that it had any influence on his investing decisions.\u201cIndeed it is not clear to me that he would have taken a positive view of what went on,\u201d the judge said. \u201cHe may well have been less, rather than more, inclined to give Goldman Sachs more business if he had found out about what went on.\u201dThe judge noted that other banks seeking to win the wealth fund\u2019s business also purchased meals, provided trading and engaged in other corporate hospitality aimed at the fund\u2019s staff, including providing tickets to sporting events.\u201cI do not accept that it necessarily shows any special relationship between these parties,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIndeed the perceived need to keep providing expensive entertainment in order to maintain the relationship rather negates the idea that the relationship had grown into one where Goldman Sachs could exercise undue influence.\u201dThe judge also said the Libyan Investment Authority, in its arguments, placed too much weight on what were \u201ceffectively sales pitches\u201d by the bank to the fund.The judge also questioned the recollections of several junior members of the wealth fund\u2019s staff in their testimony, saying she believed that they were \u201cmistaken.\u201d\u201cI also consider that the L.I.A. witnesses\u2019 written and oral evidence shows that they now view the material events from a perspective that may have caused them to exaggerate the closeness of their relationship with Goldman Sachs and downplay the contacts they had with other banks with whom the L.I.A. is not in dispute,\u201d the judge said.United States authorities have accused Mr. Najib and people close to him of embezzling billions of dollars from Malaysia\u2019s state investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB.In Britain, Goldman was dragged into the controversy surrounding the collapse of one of country\u2019s best-known retailers, BHS, over its role as an informal adviser to Philip Green, the chain\u2019s former owner.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stocks Climb Under Heavy Clouds", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Despite the prospect of higher interest rates, the imminent presidential election and heightened uncertainty in Europe, shares have for the most part risen.Supported byThe Federal Reserve still hasn\u2019t raised interest rates, though it insists that an increase is just around the corner. An even bigger decision that cannot be put off \u2014 it will be made by American voters on Nov. 8 \u2014 is stirring concern all over the world.Stock prices have for the most part risen, all the same. Even with the prospect of higher interest rates, the imminent presidential election and heightened uncertainty in Europe, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 3.3 percent in the third quarter, to 2,168.27.How much longer the Fed\u2019s easy monetary policy will continue to placate Wall Street is anyone\u2019s guess. But with little evidence that keeping interest rates just above zero at this stage appreciably bolsters the economy and businesses \u2014 and with stocks and bonds already expensive \u2014 the best guess of some advisers is that the strategy may not help investors much longer.The Fed may be at risk of inflating a bubble, but portfolio managers have preferred, though reluctantly in some cases, to be inside it rather than outside. But with returns from loose monetary policy diminishing in the economy and in stocks \u2014 the market isn\u2019t much higher now than it was in the spring of 2015 \u2014 some investors are becoming concerned.\u201cI think we are reaching the limits of how much central banks can stimulate the market,\u201d said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an investment consulting firm. \u201cThe equity market has kept going on liquidity, not fundamentals. Now we\u2019re reaching the stage where liquidity is not helping as much anymore.\u201dKrishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, agreed that the days of maintaining faith in the Fed were numbered, although he offered a wide range for what that number is.\u201cOver the next three to six to 12 months, I\u2019m pretty confident that this game of central bank support will continue\u201d to prop up stocks, he said. \u201cOver the longer term, things are far more uncertain and highly dependent on how things play out in the real economy.\u201dOthers contend that there is plenty of uncertainty for stocks in the short term, too, as the political outlook makes the course of the economy harder to gauge.\u201cNobody has a really good sense, fundamentally, where this market should be going over the next couple of quarters,\u201d said Scott Klimo, co-manager of the Sextant International Fund. Beyond the question of whether the Fed will raise rates in December, he said, \u201cthere is the possibility of right-wing nativist governments taking over in Europe, and who knows what\u2019s going to happen in the United States.\u201dThe reality of how different this presidential election is from the typical one is finally setting in, Mr. Klimo said.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a sense that, \u2018I want this guy to win, but if the other guy wins, it won\u2019t be a disaster,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true now.\u201dThe prospect of \u201cnationalism and protectionism\u201d should Donald J. Trump win the presidency is a concern for Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management at Northern Trust.The outlook for trade is already fragile without any change in American policy. In late September, the World Trade Organization lowered its forecast for 2016 global trade growth to 1.7 percent from 2.8 percent in April. The body attributed the revised forecast to a \u201cdramatic slowing of trade growth\u201d early this year.The presidential election and the Fed meeting the next month are reasons Ms. Nixon is \u201cnot going to be interested in making bold moves\u201d in the markets now, she said, even as she acknowledged that the Fed was also unlikely to make any bold moves.\u201cThe Fed delivered exactly what we thought they would \u2014 nothing much,\u201d she said about the September meeting. \u201cOur base case is they won\u2019t move in December, either.\u201cThere\u2019s always a reason\u201d for the inaction, she added. \u201cEvery time the Fed seems ready to do something, there\u2019s some sort of macro surprise; the economy has not cooperated.\u201dDespite her misgivings, Ms. Nixon continues to favor stocks over traditionally safer instruments like Treasury bonds.\u201cWe are still very positively inclined toward risk assets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think rates are going to stay low, and the calendar is very much our friend now.\u201dShe was referring to the trough in corporate profits that occurred late last year; once a year has passed, comparisons will become more favorable.Yet Mr. Sri-Kumar warned that the outlook may not be so rosy after more pages are turned on the calendar. The markets may breathe a sigh of relief if Hillary Clinton is elected next month, he said, but they may hold their breath again next summer when it comes time for the president, whoever it is, to decide whether to renominate Janet L. Yellen to continue running the Fed when her term as chairwoman expires in early 2018.Another matter for investors to confront is how, and how easily, Britain will extricate itself from the European Union, he added.The mechanism for carrying out \u201cBrexit\u201d is for Britain to invoke Article 50 of the union\u2019s Lisbon Treaty. That begins the negotiation of the terms of separation and the relationship between the country and the union afterward. That must be completed within two years after Article 50 is invoked, which Prime Minister Theresa May said this month would occur in March.As worrisome as these issues are, many investors heavily exposed to stocks rationalize the high valuations by pointing out that other investments are even more expensive.\u201cThe challenge with all of this is the value of financial assets is not absolute,\u201d Mr. Memani said. With bond yields so low, he said, \u201cequities are going up because they offer more value.\u201dBut it would be imprudent, in his opinion, to avoid Treasuries and other historically safer bonds altogether, no matter how low interest rates are and how much the Fed supports stock prices.\u201cNormally, at these rate levels, you wouldn\u2019t make any fixed-income allocations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with so much uncertainty, high-grade bonds have a significant place in a portfolio as ballast against a potential downturn\u201d in stocks.Funds that own both major asset classes did well in the third quarter. The average domestic equity fund tracked by Morningstar gained 4.6 percent. International stock funds did better, up 5.7 percent, led by a 7.8 percent rise in portfolios that focus on emerging markets, which had underperformed for years.The average taxable bond fund was up 2 percent in the third quarter. Specialists in high-yield instruments did especially well, rising 4.7 percent, as did emerging markets, up 4.2 percent.Funds of all sorts did well in the quarter, but actively managed stock mutual funds remained a tough sell. Investors sold a net $112.8 billion of them in the period, according to Morningstar, and put a net $61.2 billion into the market through exchange-traded funds. SPDR S.&P. 500, a large, actively traded E.T.F. that tracks the benchmark index, returned 3.8 percent during the quarter, trailing the 4.4 percent return of the average mutual fund that specializes in large domestic stocks.Bond investors poured $52.2 billion into actively managed mutual funds and $28.9 billion into E.T.F.s, which are mostly passively managed vehicles that try to match the returns of an index.Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income at BlackRock, expects rates to rise modestly.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to move up that much,\u201d Mr. Rieder predicted, \u201cbecause so many people in an aging population need income.\u201d Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions; high demand for bonds would tend to keep yields relatively low.But with monetary policy likely to remain looser for longer, he anticipates inflation picking up. Based on that forecast, he recommends Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, which offer the creditworthiness of other Treasury bonds but feature rates that move in line with inflation.TIPS are \u201cone of the most mispriced assets in the market today,\u201d Mr. Rieder said. \u201cMore and more people are going to buy inflation.\u201dOther instruments he favors, with prices that are relatively immune to rising interest rates, include short- to medium-term emerging market debt and mortgage securities from nongovernmental issuers.Mr. Sri-Kumar does not view rising rates as a threat. His advice is to \u201cstay very defensive\u201d by making a liberal allocation to Treasury bonds and keeping as much as 30 percent of a portfolio in cash.As for stocks, he encouraged investors to stick with areas like health care and utilities and to emphasize the United States over foreign markets.Staying close to home is a common theme, especially when contemplating the near future.\u201cFrom a short-term horizon, we\u2019re very overweight U.S. assets,\u201d Ms. Nixon said, because what economic growth there is in the world seems to be concentrated in the United States.Looking further ahead, Ms. Nixon recommends more diversification abroad, particularly in emerging markets.Mr. Memani combined those ideas.\u201cThe best stocks to own for a five-year run are U.S. domestic stocks and emerging markets,\u201d he said. Referring to the sluggish economic conditions, he added: \u201cIf we come out of this mess, emerging markets will have to take more of a role in global growth. Valuations there are not cheap, but they\u2019re better than in developed markets.\u201dHe warned investors who need income that \u201cyou\u2019ll have to take risks\u201d because interest rates are so low. Among the more prudent risks, in his view, are dividend-paying stocks, municipal bonds and master limited partnerships, which are exchange-traded vehicles that typically invest in energy infrastructure like pipelines.Mr. Klimo, like Mr. Sri-Kumar, favors health care stocks. \u201cFor pure demographic reasons, I think they will remain attractive for a long time,\u201d he said.Funds that concentrate on health care stocks rose 5.5 percent in the third quarter, the best sector performance after the gains of 12.9 percent for technology and 7.1 percent for financial services.Among foreign stock markets, Mr. Klimo prefers those in Southeast Asia.One area in which he said he was \u201cfar, far underweight\u201d is financial services. Alluding to serious difficulties at big banks like Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank, he said, \u201cWe have no idea what\u2019s going on inside these companies.\u201dThe end of exceedingly loose Fed policy has been coming for so long that it should be no surprise when it arrives. Even so, it could shock investors when it happens, and even if it doesn\u2019t for the foreseeable future.\u201cWe\u2019ve just kept the drug going,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite comforting; we don\u2019t want to wean ourselves off it. But eventually we\u2019ll have an overdose that no one can do anything about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nutanix I.P.O. Creates Opening for Others", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsNutanix, the cloud data-storage firm that made its market debut last week, has jammed open the window for initial public offerings.The firm\u2019s stock popped a whopping 131 percent on its debut on Friday, for a market capitalization above $5 billion. The warm welcome that was extended to new companies in September, combined with decreased venture-capital funding, may lead others to pull the trigger. The coming presidential election means they had better hurry.Nutanix got lucky. A general market rally on its first day of trading \u2013 partly on the back of reduced concern about the stability of Deutsche Bank as the German lender negotiates a big settlement with American prosecutors \u2013 put the wind behind stocks. But Nutanix\u2019s business, selling cheap and easy ways to expand data centers, is also at the center of the latest tech wave.Over all, it has proved a tricky year so far for new and risky companies to sell shares to the public. Only about half as many businesses have floated as in the same period last year, according to Renaissance Capital. To attract investors, solid firms have been priced attractively. The valuations of the networking firm Acacia Communications and the cloud voice and messaging firm Twilio both trade at more than four times where their I.P.O.s priced earlier this year. And Nutanix can claim the best first-day gain of all.Performances such as these have helped bring on a thaw. Sixteen companies floated last month. That is more than twice as many as in September 2015, and it is the first month this year with more I.P.O.s than last year.Another incentive to go public now is a tightening of purse strings at private investment firms. The amount of venture capital invested in the second quarter was down 11 percent from the same period in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. And it was the third-straight quarter showing a double-digit decline.Firms may, however, have little time to take advantage. Later in October, investors will be preoccupied with the election, which takes place on Nov. 8, and thereafter they will be trying to figure out what the new president and congressional makeup mean. Nutanix has created the opening, but it may be brief.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Signs of Strain in the Stock and Bond Love Affair", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byIt has been easy for stock investors to love bonds as they have generated handsome returns while providing protection when the stock market falls.Until recently, bond and stock prices have generally moved in opposite directions when stocks falter. But something different happened in September, and it could render bonds a weaker tool for portfolio diversification.On Sept. 9, when the stock market fell 2.45 percent in a single day, the bond market did not follow its traditional script. Instead of rallying, the average core bond portfolio tracked by Morningstar dipped 0.34 percent that day. The one-day loss for many funds, including Vanguard Total Bond Market, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond, Pimco Total Return and Metropolitan West Total Return, while less than a half a percentage point, still amounted to more than 10 percent of their current yield.In itself, a loss like that isn\u2019t going to upend anyone\u2019s retirement plan, but it doesn\u2019t merely portend declining long-term returns for bonds: It could also reduce the buffering effect of bonds in a portfolio that contains stocks.Jeffrey Knight, co-head of Global Asset Allocation at Columbia Threadneedle, says that problem is likely to continue in the future. In his view, what happened on Sept. 9 is \u201cexhibit A\u201d for what he expects to play out when central banks start to tap the brakes on their aggressive policies to stimulate economic growth.\u201cBoth stock and bond values have been driven up by monetary policy, and as we approach an inflection point where that policy changes, they both have the same reason to sell off,\u201d Mr. Knight said.We may indeed be closer to that inflection point. While the Federal Reserve chose to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at its September meeting, the latest odds put a very high probability on a December increase. In the meantime, the yield of the 10-year Treasury rate has quietly inched up from below 1.4 percent in early July to 1.7 percent. That is still well below the 2.25 percent at the beginning of the year, but it signals that a shift may be underway.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, is mindful that previous rate increases in the bond market have quickly reversed themselves, but he says that this time may really be different. Without the Federal Reserve\u2019s intervention, Mr. Paulsen says, the 10-year Treasury yield would be in the vicinity of 4 percent based on current levels of economic growth, core inflation and wage growth. \u201cI am not suggesting we are headed there this year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if this recovery persists, and the Fed takes its peg off, I would not be at all surprised to see us around 4 percent before the next recession.\u201dIf that were to play out, rising yields would mean bond prices would fall. Total return is the sum of yield and changes in bond prices. Today\u2019s razor-thin yields of around 2 percent for quality bond funds suggest that initial total returns will probably be negative, though over time patient investors will benefit from the reinvestment of higher yields.The challenge is to anticipate today how you might react to a less rosy performance for bonds \u2014 which have returned 4 percent annualized over the last 15 years \u2014 and make any necessary portfolio tweaks. \u201cDiversification still works, but the way to think about it is that the cost of diversification has gone up,\u201d says Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. Because bonds don\u2019t have much room to rally at current price and yield levels, they may merely hold steady, or potentially lose a little when stocks falter.The implications are worth considering. It could mean slightly larger bear market losses for diversified stock and bond portfolios. In 2008, for example, when United States stocks fell 37 percent, high-quality core bonds rallied more than 5 percent. An investor with a standard, index-based portfolio containing 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds lost about 20 percent that year. But bonds rallied while stocks fell. If bonds hadn\u2019t risen in value but instead had lost 2 percent, the portfolio would have lost 23 percent.While not cheery news, that\u2019s not an end-of-days prospect. Core bond funds that invest in high-quality United States securities may not produce world-beating returns, but they are not likely to lose much, either. One important aspect of core bond funds \u2014 their relatively short 5.5-year average duration \u2014 should prevent big losses. Duration is a measure of a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changing interest rates. A one percentage point rise in a portfolio\u2019s yield typically causes the price to fall in line with its duration. That translates to a 5.5 percent price decline for a core bond fund with a 5.5-year duration if rates were to rise one percentage point.In the spirit of hypothetical stress testing, Vanguard crunched the numbers for what would be a highly unlikely event: an abrupt three percentage point increase in the yield of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate index from its current very low 1.95 percent. The index has a current duration of 5.5 years. That increase would produce a return of negative 13.1 percent in the first year. If rates stabilized after that move, the cumulative loss by the end of the second year would be 8.75 percent. Returns would be back above break even in Year 4 thanks to the reinvestment of the much higher yield.How bad would that be? It depends on your perspective. \u201cIn a horrible, truly worst-case scenario, a high-quality bond index fund is still less risky over the course of a year than stocks are in one day,\u201d says the investment adviser Allan Roth, founder of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, alluding to the 20 percent decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index on Oct. 19, 1987.A well-honed actively managed bond fund might mitigate a portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to rising rates.For example, right now bond index funds that closely mirror the Barclays U.S. Aggregate index are loaded with Treasury and government agency bonds. Those are what you want when markets falter, but they have extremely low yields today and typically are very sensitive to rising rates. By comparison, the Baird Core Plus Bond has the freedom to decide on its bond mix.\u201cTrying to hit a lot of singles, and not swing for home runs\u201d as the fund\u2019s co-manager, Mary Ellen Stanek, describes the strategy, has delivered index-beating performance since the fund\u2019s 2000 inception. The fund also ranks in the top quartile of its peers over the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods. Currently, the fund\u2019s Treasury stake is much lower than what is stuffed in its benchmark index, and it owns a lot more American corporate bonds. On average, high-quality corporate bonds currently have yields that are at least one percentage point higher than Treasury bonds. \u201cWe think we\u2019re in the seventh inning for corporate bonds. The fundamentals look pretty good,\u201d says Warren Pierson, also a co-manager.Another option, and a conservative one, is to move some of your money out of bonds and into cash. Even investment strategists \u2014 a tribe always at the ready with the best relative values in stocks and bonds \u2014 acknowledge the \u201coptionality\u201d value of cash these days, which is an obtuse way of saying it makes sense to have some money on the sidelines ready to get back in the game after sell-offs. \u201cThe opportunity cost in the short run is low,\u201d says Mr. Turnill, the BlackRock strategist.Mr. Roth, the Wealth Logic founder, has made five-year certificates of deposit the centerpiece of his clients\u2019 fixed-income portfolios. For example, the current 1.75 percent yield offered on deposits of at least $25,000 by Ally Bank is nearly on par with the 1.95 percent yield of the Barclays Aggregate bond index. Even in the event of paying the penalty for an early withdrawal, the effective yield would be more than 1 percent. \u201cWe have no principal risk, and our money is 100 percent government guaranteed,\u201d says Mr. Roth. (If you\u2019re looking to remove some rate risk from your 401(k) portfolio, check if there is a so-called stable value fund in your plan; the average current yield is 1.8 percent, according to Hueler Analytics.)Of course, cash is a market timing call, and market timing is not easy to do properly. What\u2019s more, cash or liquid investments like money market funds or short-term CDs aren\u2019t likely to keep pace with inflation in the long run. But if you become deeply worried about bonds and stocks, cash is not the worst place to wait out a shifting market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Math Teachers Are at a Loss to Understand Annuities", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byPublic SacrificeEven a well-caffeinated person with an advanced degree in math would have a hard time deciphering a 53-page contract called \u201cYour Flexible Premium Indexed and Declared Interest Deferred Annuity Policy.\u201dMelanie Panush Lindert, a 66-year-old elementary school dance teacher in Los Angeles, was sold one of these mind-numbingly complex products last year through her workplace retirement account. The same agent had sold her three other annuity contracts over the previous eight years, including another within her retirement savings plan \u2014 a so-called 403(b) \u2014 which is offered to employees of public schools, colleges, religious groups and nonprofits.Annuities can be hard to fully grasp even in their simplest configuration, where you hand a pile of money to an insurance company, then receive a guaranteed stream of annual income for life. But schoolteachers and other people doing good works are often left to trudge through a morass of contracts tied to some of the most arcane investments, sold by representatives who may not fully understand the inner workings themselves.It \u201cseemed like a good way to make more money,\u201d said Ms. Lindert, who started teaching when she was 53 and said she hoped to retire next year. For now, she teaches five classes a day, three days a week, to elementary schoolchildren at three schools. She brings her own speakers, drums, scarves and an iPod with 400 hours of music, along with a light lunch.Certain types of annuities can serve as a useful retirement tool for some savers seeking a stream of guaranteed income. But many teachers already receive pensions providing a steady income base.The type of annuity in Ms. Lindert\u2019s account, a so-called fixed index annuity, is particularly complex. In theory, these are appealing: They provide a guaranteed minimum interest rate; they let investors participate in the market\u2019s gains up to a certain ceiling; and they promise that buyers will not lose money when the market dives.Still, how do investors know whether the product is appropriate for them?\u201cNo agent selling these or investors buying these has the foggiest idea of how these work,\u201d said Mr. McCann, who reviewed Ms. Lindert\u2019s contracts.But indexed annuities have to make sense for at least some investors, right? Perhaps for the incredibly risk averse? \u201cNo,\u201d he said, without hesitation. \u201cNever.\u201dThough it appears that investors have some exposure to the stock market, he says many are left with a return they could have achieved with a supersafe bond portfolio, without paying an obscured 2.5 to 3 percent annual fee charged by the annuity provider. \u201cThey are all Rube Goldberg machines,\u201d he said.In her case, Ms. Lindert was advised to annuitize her first contract \u2014 which paid a minimum interest rate of 3 percent \u2014 and direct the stream of income into the new annuity, which paid a minimum of 1 percent. The other investment options provided were also far less generous \u2014 shockingly so, Mr. McCann added. \u201cThis switch is really awful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really good for the insurance company. But it\u2019s really bad for the investor.\u201dThe new policy did include a so-called guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit \u2014 for an additional fee of 0.7 percent annually \u2014 which promises a certain level of lifetime income. But Mr. McCann said his analysis found that the new policy was still less valuable than the first.Then, there\u2019s the matter of surrender charges. Ms. Lindert would have owed a penalty for 15 years after signing her original contract \u2014 set on a sliding scale starting at 14 percent \u2014 if she wanted to withdraw more than 10 percent of her account\u2019s \u201caccumulation\u201d value. The policy she bought last year, also issued by Life Insurance Company of the Southwest, has a nine-year surrender period, with a penalty fee starting at 8.25 percent.The American Council of Life Insurers, a trade group that represents annuity issuers and life insurers, echoed that point, noting that guarantees come at a cost so insurers can make good on their promises.\u201cAnnuities are among the most highly regulated products,\u201d Jack Dolan, a spokesman for the group, said, \u201cwith disclosure being a key consumer protection.\u201dSlightly more than half of all 403(b) assets, approaching $900 billion, have been invested in fixed annuities \u2014 which promise either a minimum rate of annual growth or interest based on changes in a market index. Another 25 percent were in variable annuities that invest in mutual funds, according to Investment Company Institute data as of March. The remaining 23 percent were invested in traditional mutual funds.In contrast, about 60 percent of 401(k) assets, which totaled $4.75 trillion, were invested in mutual funds, with only a small share in variable annuities. Despite the risks from short-term market declines, a diversified mix of stock and bond funds is generally less costly and provides a significantly greater return over time.Under that plan, run by TIAA, she has access to low-cost Vanguard funds. She chose to redirect her new contributions into one that invests up to 65 percent in bonds, with the remainder in stocks.But most of her money is still tied up in four annuities that she does not understand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Three Excellent Books on Long-Term Investing", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfIt is easy to forget personal investing fundamentals when stock prices hit new highs one week, fall sharply the next and then rise again in no reliable pattern, as they have been doing this year. So now is an ideal time to reread \u2014 or perhaps pick up for the first time \u2014 three excellent books by people who are particularly good at explaining the building blocks of a solid portfolio.In the first of these, Andrew Tobias promises in his title that he is offering \u201cThe Only Investment Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need\u201d ($15.95, Mariner Books). And in the book, which has been continually updated since it was published in 1978, he covers a great deal of important territory, although some of the advice by now may sound familiar. He includes nostrums like this: Buy only investments you understand. If the projected return sounds too good to be true, stay away. You\u2019re going to have to take some risk and buy stocks to stay ahead of inflation. Never forget the impact taxes can have on returns.Solid counsel, but it is not why the book is worth reading. Mr. Tobias\u2019s ideas about saving money \u2014 you can\u2019t build a portfolio without savings \u2014 are his real gems. And the reason for that is his approach. He combines humor \u2014 it starts with the dedication, \u201cto my broker \u2014 even if he has, from time to time, made me just that\u201d \u2014 with common sense presented in an uncommon way.For example, you may already know that you shouldn\u2019t carry credit card debt, because the interest rates can drain what you are able to sock away; you can lower your insurance premiums by increasing deductibles (allowing you to save more) and buy in bulk when items you consume frequently are on sale.But when Mr. Tobias explains it, doing things like this seem as if they would be financial brilliance on your part instead of drudgery.\u201cWhy put $1,000 into the stock of some utility and earn $40 in annual taxable dividends if you can put the same money into insulation and save $350 \u2014 tax-free \u2014 on your utility bill?\u201d he asks.But what should you do if you actually save money by following Mr. Tobias\u2019s suggestions? John C. Bogle has some good ideas in \u201cThe Little Book of Common Sense Investing\u201d (Wiley, $24.95).Let\u2019s get the negatives out of the way first. Mr. Bogle can be hectoring. (\u201cYou ignore these rules at your peril.\u201d) And, perhaps because it was published a decade ago, the idea of owning international stocks or bonds gets little attention.That said, in clear, convincing fashion he lays out a solid strategy for getting \u201cyour fair share of stock market returns.\u201d That isn\u2019t difficult, he writes. \u201cSuccessful investing is all about common sense.\u201dAmong his common-sense ideas:\u25a0 Since timing the market is virtually impossible, you should buy and hold stocks.\u25a0 Being diversified minimizes risk.\u25a0 Because transaction costs and brokerage fees can eat up a significant portion of your returns, invest heavily through low-cost index funds.That last isn\u2019t surprising since Mr. Bogle is founder and former chief executive of Vanguard, the mutual fund company known for its index funds. But he argues everyone should be a fan of the funds.\u201cSimple arithmetic suggests, and history confirms, the winning strategy is to own all the nation\u2019s publicly held businesses at very low cost,\u201d he writes. \u201cBy doing so you are guaranteed to capture almost the entire return they generate in the form of dividends and earnings growth. The best way to implement this strategy is indeed simple: buying a fund that holds this market portfolio. Such a fund is called an index fund.\u201dOf course, one reason most of us try to create a solid portfolio is so we can live the kind of life we want when we get older. The final book grabs me partly because of my age. And as I wrote two years ago, I found two things appealing about \u201cThe Charles Schwab Guide to Finances After Fifty\u201d(Crown Business, $26), written by Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz.First, Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz thoroughly answers her target market\u2019s most common questions. For example, if you are 50 and older, don\u2019t have much money stashed for retirement and wonder what you should do, she says start saving at least 40 percent of your income immediately.Conversely, if you are in good financial shape as retirement looms, you may wonder whether you should pay off your mortgage. Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz, a certified financial planner, shows you how to do the arithmetic to decide. You multiply your current mortgage interest rate \u2014 say 4 percent \u2014 by your tax bracket. Let\u2019s assume 30 percent. That means your mortgage is only costing you 2.8 percent (since you get to deduct the interest you pay).So, paying it off is equivalent to a 2.8 percent risk-free return. If you are pleased with that, especially since you know you will own your house free and clear, pay off your mortgage. If you think you can earn more elsewhere, keep paying the loan and invest the money you would have used to pay off the mortgage.The other nice thing is that Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz \u2014 the daughter of Charles Schwab, the founder of the mutual fund company that bears his name \u2014 treats her readers like adults who know the personal finance basics.For example, she says, when it comes to retirement planning, you need to answer only three questions: What do you expect to spend each year in retirement? How much money will you need in savings/investments to support that spending? And how much more do you need to save to get from here (where you are now) to there (the point where you can fund the retirement you want)?If your projections show you coming up short, she says, you should postpone retirement. That \u201cwould allow you to build a bigger retirement portfolio and shorten the time you\u2019ll rely on savings,\u201d she says, and it could also increase your Social Security benefits.These three books are at the top of my list. If I expanded it, I would include \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d by Benjamin Graham (Collins Business Essentials, $8); \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d by Jeremy J. Siegel (McGraw-Hill, $40) and \u201cMaking the Most of Your Money Now\u201d by Jane Bryant Quinn (Simon & Schuster, $35).They, too, are worth a second read, or a first if you haven\u2019t had the pleasure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Plays Goldilocks on Insider Trading", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byWhite Collar WatchSometimes the Supreme Court is a bit like Goldilocks, looking for a ruling that will be like a perfect bowl of porridge \u2014 not too hot, not too cold, but just right.The issue in the case centered on defining what kind of benefit the source of inside information must receive to violate the law when passing it on to someone else who trades on it. The defendant, Bassam Y. Salman, bought stocks based on confidential information leaked by his future brother-in-law, Maher F. Kara. Mr. Kara worked for Citigroup on health care transactions, and he passed the information to his brother, Michael, who gave it to Mr. Salman.The lawyers for both sides offered a stark contrast, with Mr. Salman\u2019s lawyer asking for a much narrower reading of insider trading law, while the government lawyer sought to make almost any disclosure subject to prosecution if it could be shown that the tipper knew that the information would be used for trading.The gift theory allowed the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to focus solely on the relationship between the source and the recipient to establish insider trading. Casual friendships between golfing buddies or fellow churchgoers could be enough of a link \u2014 at least until the theory was called into question by a decision in December 2014.In other words, just being friends was not enough, and perhaps even family members could avoid a violation if there was no evidence that the tipper received something of value.The Supreme Court rejected the Justice Department\u2019s request to review the Newman decision. But a few months later, it took up the Salman case, which was prosecuted in California, providing a chance to explain what constitutes the necessary benefit.The lawyer arguing for Mr. Salman, Alexandra A. E. Shapiro, asked the justices on Wednesday to bless the Newman decision\u2019s tangible benefit test, arguing that the government must prove there was an exchange that resulted in some financial gain to the tipper.In that case, the justices expressed concern that an overly broad interpretation of the law gave prosecutors too much discretion to charge defendants for questionable conduct that might not be illegal on its face. So the crime was limited to only the clearest types of dishonesty.Ms. Shapiro tried to hook her case to that wagon, arguing that insider trading law was also too ill-defined to permit a criminal conviction based on something as ephemeral as a gift of inside information made between family or friends. Thus, a tangible personal benefit was needed to confine the law and give the defendants \u2014 and Wall Street \u2014 enough notice of what constitutes a violation.She immediately ran into a string of skeptical questions from the justices, mainly about her argument for a significant change in the law, which has been well settled for over 30 years. Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that \u201cyou\u2019re asking us to ignore some extremely specific language\u201d in the Dirks decision, while Justice Stephen G. Breyer noted that the gift analysis worked because \u201cto help a close family member is like helping yourself.\u201dIn response to the argument that insider trading needs to be more narrowly defined because Congress has never adopted a specific statute establishing its elements, Justice Breyer referred to the antitrust law that courts have developed over the years to fill gaps in the law, much as it has done with the tipping of confidential information.Tellingly, Justice Breyer said that adopting the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in the Newman case \u201cis really more likely to change the law that people have come to rely upon\u201d than to keep it as it has been since the Dirks ruling.Ms. Shapiro, the defense lawyer, would not budge, even when given the chance in a question by Justice Sonia Sotomayor about whether there was an alternative to the proposal to require a tangible benefit. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any other test that the court could provide,\u201d she responded.The lawyer for the government, Michael R. Dreeben, took a similar hard line with the justices in asking them to affirm Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction. He argued that it is a violation any time confidential information is given for a noncorporate purpose with the expectation that the recipient will trade, without regard to the relationship between the tipper and the person receiving the tip.Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. posed a hypothetical situation to demonstrate just how broadly the government\u2019s argument reached. He asked whether it would be insider trading if a person \u201cis walking down the street and sees someone who has a really unhappy look on his face and says, I want to do something to make this person\u2019s day\u201d by giving confidential information, telling that person, \u201cyou can make some money if you trade on this.\u201d Mr. Dreeben said that would be a violation, even though the recipient is a complete stranger.Needless to say, the justices appeared to be unwilling to give prosecutors that much leeway, with Justice Sotomayor pointing out later that \u201cyou\u2019re taking this way out of existing law.\u201dNear the end of the argument, Mr. Dreeben gave some ground, telling the court that if it were \u201cmore at home with the language that was actually used in Dirks and wants to reaffirm it, it should do so.\u201dIt seems clear that most of the justices view the Dirks case as governing law, with little appetite to change the test used for decades that recognizes gifts as one form of benefit received by the tipper for passing along confidential information.That diminishes the likelihood that Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction will be overturned. There was evidence at his trial of a close family relationship that showed Mr. Kara benefited from revealing the impending deals learned from his investment banking position.The court was also reluctant to endorse a test that expands insider trading liability to situations in which a person just gives information to someone else without any proof that something was received in return. That means the opinion will most likely put a little more meat on the bones in the Dirks opinion, about what is sufficient to show the requisite benefit when information is given outside a family or close friendship.The devil is always in the details, so the language the Supreme Court uses to draw a line around what is enough to prove a violation will affect how prosecutors and defense lawyers proceed in future cases. I doubt there will be a radical restructuring of how tipping cases are established, but there is a good chance the Justice Department and S.E.C. will have to deal with more detailed requirements to win a case.After the decision, it will most likely not be too difficult, but also not too easy, to prove insider trading \u2014 just something that seems about right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start-Up Taking Aim at Bloomberg Terminals Hires Former Bloomberg Head", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byA start-up looking to take on the financial information behemoth Bloomberg L.P. is hiring a former Bloomberg executive to begin a new financial news service.Norman Pearlstine, a former top editor at Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Time, is joining Money.net, which has been building a low-cost alternative to the data terminals that sit at the core of Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s business empire.Mr. Pearlstine is tasked with building a news feed for Money.net that will be based on machine-generated news bulletins and stories. He will be hiring journalists to help guide the computers and potentially supplement them with reporting \u2014 part of a broader move toward the automation of journalism.\u201cI think I know what the customer is looking for, and I think I know where smart developers and journalists working together can add value,\u201d Mr. Pearlstine said in an interview. \u201cMy bias is toward not spending a lot of time duplicating things that everybody else is doing \u2014 trying to think about what timely, usable information is for a professional investor.\u201dMr. Pearlstine was the chief content officer at Bloomberg until 2013, shortly before Mr. Bloomberg ended his final term as New York City\u2019s mayor and rejoined the company he founded in the 1980s. Mr. Pearlstine is currently the vice chairman of Time Inc. and will remain in that role.Money.net was founded by another former top executive at Bloomberg, Morgan Downey, who got to know Mr. Pearlstine when they were both at the company.Mr. Downey has been outspoken about his belief that Money.net can win over Bloomberg customers who are unhappy with the high price of the terminals, which generally cost around $21,000 a year. A Money.net subscription costs about $1,500 annually.Mr. Downey said that Money.net now had about 50,000 paying subscribers, up from fewer than 10,000 a year ago. Over the same time period, the number of Bloomberg subscribers has remained steady at around 325,000.Mr. Downey has been trying to capitalize on the fact that revenue is down in the financial industry, leading many banks and asset managers to look for lower-cost service providers.\u201cThe industry is at this inflection point,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know that the ecosystem of Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters can\u2019t continue.\u201dA Bloomberg spokesman said the company had no comment on Mr. Pearlstine\u2019s hiring.Money.net began as a platform for basic financial data, but Mr. Downey has been trying to add tools that can compete with other parts of the Bloomberg terminal.Recently, Money.net announced a partnership with the Wall Street messaging service Symphony, which is mostly owned by a consortium of banks. Symphony has been described as an effort by the banks to create an alternative to Bloomberg\u2019s messaging system, which is often cited as a main reason to have the terminals.Professional investors also choose Bloomberg because of the huge journalistic operation it has built, focusing in particular on market-moving news.But Mr. Downey sees another opportunity to take on Bloomberg at a lower cost.He contends that much of the information that investors need is freely available in news releases, government statements and social media.Mr. Downey already has a team of developers working on software that can scan the web for news releases and stories from other publications to generate headlines for Money.net customers.Last week, for instance, Money.net generated a headline from a Department of Transportation release. It read: \u201cD.O.T. issues emergency order banning all Samsung Galaxy 7 phones from air transportation in the U.S.\u201dHigh-powered computers are crucial to processing more news and doing so faster than Bloomberg\u2019s human-based system, Mr. Downey said.Several other technology companies are already working to automate journalism, using software that can take raw data and turn it into proper sentences. But this strategy has run into obstacles. When Facebook recently moved to make its trending stories feature more automated, fake news stories crept in unnoticed.Mr. Downey is hoping that Mr. Pearlstine can bring in a team of journalists to help guide the machines toward accuracy. Mr. Downey says that he wants Mr. Pearlstine to hire about 25 journalists to work with around 75 programmers.Mr. Pearlstine is more measured than Mr. Downey in his ambitions to immediately take on Bloomberg. He says that for now the data giant still has a big lead in many areas.But Mr. Pearlstine says there is an opportunity to do things in a smarter way given the current state of technology. He said that Bloomberg News began more than three decades ago as a small team of people aggregating news from other publications.\u201cTechnology has given you the opportunity to revisit that model in ways that could be better, faster and smarter,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Economy Was Resilient After \u2018Brexit.\u2019 Its Leaders Learned the Wrong Lesson.", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byPound Foolish?The British pound fell to about $1.24 on Friday from $1.30 a week earlier and continued edging down Monday. Even if you treat a \u201cflash crash\u201d in the pound on Asian markets Thursday night as an aberration \u2014 it fell 6 percent, then recovered in a short span \u2014 these types of aberrations seem to happen only when a market is already under severe stress. (See, for example, the May 2010 flash crash of American stocks, during a flare-up of the eurozone crisis).Sterling, as traders refer to the currency, is acting as the global market\u2019s minute-to-minute referendum on how significant the economic disruption from Brexit will end up being. So what does the latest downswing represent? It\u2019s worth understanding why British financial markets and the country\u2019s economy stabilized quickly after the Brexit vote to begin with.The vote set off a chaotic time of political disruption, especially the resignation of the prime minister, David Cameron, who had advocated for the country\u2019s remaining part of the E.U. Theresa May won the internal battle to become the next prime minister, which was to markets and business decision makers a relatively benign result.Ms. May, the former home secretary, is temperamentally pragmatic. She reluctantly supported remaining in the union. And while she pledged to follow through on leaving it (\u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d she said), she seemed like the kind of leader who would ensure that some of the worst-case possibilities of how Brexit might go wouldn\u2019t materialize. Exporters would retain access to European markets. London could remain the de facto banking capital of Europe. All would be well.Meanwhile, the Bank of England sprang into action to cushion the economic blow of Brexit-related uncertainty. Despite the inflationary pressures created by a falling pound, the bank, projecting loss of jobs and economic output, cut interest rates and started a new program of quantitative easing to try to soften the blow.All of that \u2014 the prospect of \u201csoft Brexit\u201d and easier monetary policy \u2014 helped financial markets stabilize and then rally, and kept the economic damage mild, as the purchasing managers\u2019 surveys show.But in the last couple of weeks, the tenor has shifted.That sets up confrontational negotiations between the British government and its E.U. counterparts. European leaders will be reluctant to allow Britain continued free access to its markets, which the May government wants, without similarly free movement of people across borders.And beyond the substance of the negotiations, the British government has signaled in recent days that it is looking inward, and will be hostile to those who are not British citizens.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.In essence, the confidence that Brexit will not mean Britain is shutting itself off from Europe and the world is starting to dissipate.Then there\u2019s monetary policy. At the same party conference, Ms. May indicated skepticism of the role the Bank of England and other central banks have played in the economy in recent years, saying that while low interest rates and quantitative easing provided necessary help after the financial crisis, \u201cwe have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects.\u201dIn short, after Mr. Carney helped foam the economic runway after the Brexit vote, Ms. May\u2019s comments were the equivalent of complaining about the mess created by all that foam.There\u2019s always going to be some jockeying on both sides in advance of a difficult negotiation, and the sympathetic view to the British government is that it is merely trying to maximize its advantage in hammering out a deal to execute its Brexit.The problem is that staking out that ground means risking the very economic damage that a conciliatory tone and easy money helped avoid over the summer.Advertisement"}

Awash in acquisition rumors.\u201cGiven Iger\u2019s interest in technology, Twitter\u2019s in-process repositioning as a mobile live video destination and Disney\u2019s need to shift its story away from the challenges facing ESPN, a Twitter acquisition has real strategic merits,\u201d Rich Greenfield, an analyst at the financial services firm BTIG, wrote in a blog post.Mr. Greenfield noted that Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, also sits on the Disney board: \u201cWe believe Dorsey wants to sell to a media company to power their over-the-top, mobile-video ambitions.\u201dAdding to the acquisition speculation is Mr. Iger\u2019s track record of going shopping about every three years \u2014 he\u2019s overdue by that measure \u2014 and his history of bold moves, Ms. Reif Cohen said.The problem: Unlike the reactions to deals with Pixar, Marvel or Lucasfilm \u2014 companies that were instantly lauded as perfect targets for Disney \u2014 any cheerleading for a Disney-Twitter tie-up was drowned out by sharply negative responses.\u201cTo buy Twitter would be the equivalent of throwing money out the door,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty for taking a look, but I\u2019d be shocked if Disney actually buys it.\u201d\u201cDisney needs to buy nothing,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Disney is incomplete at all.\u201dMr. Iger, who declined to comment for this article, does seem to have an itch to buy something. But there are no clear moves. (Lego, long on Disney\u2019s wish list, is too expensive; the often-on-the-edge Vice brings potential image problems.) And, as the Twitter reaction shows, there are no obvious technology moves.Uncharted territory for Mr. Iger and the company he has steered to overwhelming success.Advertisement"}

If it emboldens other chief executives, the likes of Lazard and Moelis should benefit. They could use the help as the advice market goes through a rough patch.Third-quarter results released this week by independent advisory companies have held up well despite a 22 percent decline in annual global deal volume, according to Thomson Reuters data. Only Greenhill reported a drop in revenue related to mergers and acquisitions from the end of June. It was nevertheless the boutique\u2019s best showing in a while, and revenue growth was 52 percent higher than a year ago. Lazard and Moelis, however, experienced little or no growth in merger fees from 2015.The falloff from a record year of wheeling and dealing has taken its toll. Market values for Lazard, Greenhill and Moelis are each down at least 10 percent this year. In contrast, shares of two of the top three deal advisers \u2014 Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 are up around 5 percent, while those of the third, Goldman Sachs, are down only slightly. Evercore stock, thanks in part to an industry-beating one-third increase in advisory revenue so far this year, is flat.An increase in new deals would help reverse this decline. The contribution of merger advice fees to earnings is, after all, easier to divine than the ups and downs of trading stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.This week\u2019s slew of announced transactions, including Qualcomm\u2019s $47 billion agreed takeover of the rival chip maker NXP Semiconductors \u2014 which included Evercore, Centerview and Frank Quattrone\u2019s Qatalyst among the list of advisers \u2014 is already having an effect.

The fact that money can be deducted directly from your paycheck seems to help spur contributions, as 27 percent of those with a workplace account contribute between 6 percent and 10 percent of each paycheck toward their retirement.But even those who are actively investing may not have a clear idea of how to balance their funds to target the returns they need at an acceptable level of risk. While 80 percent of those who have a retirement account say that they either fully or somewhat understand diversification, many experts feel investors are often unsure of what diversification really looks like in a portfolio. Brett Mossman, who heads up BlackRock Portfolio Solutions group, explains that diversification is not just about owning a certain percentage of stocks and bonds or even how many different funds you own. \u201cIt's actually more about the type of risk that you consume in the portfolio,\u201d he says. This is often the part that eludes people.\u2014BRETT MOSSMAN, BLACKROCK PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS\u2014BRETT MOSSMAN, BLACKROCK\u00a0PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS\u201cFor example, certain types of bonds have similar risks to stocks, which means that a portfolio that appears balanced may actually be riskier than you realize.

This may be in part because men and women are motivated differently, including how they get their financial information and attitudes about risk. \u201cBy not watching and reacting to the markets, like their male counterparts, women investors are often far better off long term,\u201d says Hollie Fagan, head of the registered investment advisor business and retail direct platform at BlackRock. \u201cHistory bears that out. What's more important to these women is whether they're able to achieve the goals they've set out for themselves.\u201dThere are also more beneficial forces that drive people to engage, notably positive changes in their work circumstances. A third of respondents who ever make changes to their portfolios (33 percent) said they do so when they get a raise, while 21 percent would do so if they got a new job. Other key triggers include getting married (7 percent) or making a large purchase (12 percent), with the numbers about evenly split between men and women in both cases.It's important for people to be aware of what kinds of changes these events bring about. \u201cChanges in life circumstances are either going to create more assets to invest or create more liabilities,\u201d Small says. \u201cIndividuals need to be able to manage both.\u201dOver the past few years, exchange traded funds have quickly grown into a popular way to diversify long-term portfolios. Although ETFs debuted in the '90s, and today hold more than $3 trillion globally, according to BlackRock, many admit they still don\u2019t know much about them. Only 40 percent of those with a retirement account felt they either somewhat or fully understood ETFs.OF RESPONDENTS SAYTHEY SOMEWHAT OR\u00a0FULLY UNDERSTAND\u00a0DIVERSIFICATION.\u00a0Over the past few years, exchange traded funds have quickly grown into a popular way to diversify long-term portfolios. Although ETFs debuted in the '90s, and today hold more than $3 trillion globally, according to BlackRock, many admit they still don\u2019t know much about them. Only 40 percent of those with a retirement account felt they either somewhat or fully understood ETFs.\u201cAn ETF is like a mutual fund that an investor can buy or sell just like a stock in a brokerage account,\u201d Small says. Similar to a mutual fund, an ETF is a bundled group of assets such as stocks and bonds that are divided into shares. Most ETFs are designed to track an index and can be traded in the market throughout the day, while mutual funds can only be bought and sold with the fund company at the end of the trading day.\u201cTheir versatility gives individuals and advisors the choice to build any portfolio they want in a low-cost, tax efficient way,\u201d Small says. These advantages can make them good vehicles for core, long-term holdings where global diversification and value really matter.ETFs are also popular because they can be acutely targeted.\u201cIn addition to rounding out the core of a portfolio, ETFs give people the ability to express a really precise view on the exposures they want,\u201d Mossman says. \u201cFor example, if an individual wanted to invest solely in Asian technology stocks, or in small-cap value stocks or emerging markets bonds, there is an ETF for each one of those things.\u201dOF MILLENNIALS GET\u00a0THEIR FINANCIAL\u00a0INFORMATION FROM\u00a0THEIR FAMILY.\u00a0Transparency is just one piece of the puzzle for millennials and ETFs. Another is the growth of online platforms such as self-directed brokerages, which make access to ETFs even easier. \u201cThese platforms are particularly attractive to millennials, who are quicker to embrace technology and who tend to be more concerned about the impact of cost and taxes on the long-term growth of their money,\u201d Small says. And with less money to invest, they may not meet required minimums for traditional advisory accounts.Of course, these reasons make ETFs appealing for all generations, not just millennials. \u201cToday, as the challenges of investing have gotten more complex, we are seeing the creation of smarter and more innovative solutions to help people manage that complexity,\u201d Small says. \u201cIn this world, more and more investors are turning to low cost, tax-efficient ETFs to build diversified, quality market exposures at a competitive price.\u201dIllustration by Tamer Koseli.*Methodology: All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc.

Talks with pharmaceutical and biotech executives led them to a holding in PRA Health Sciences.\u201cIt\u2019s a contract research organization that manages clinical trials,\u201d Mr. Swank said. \u201cBased on our conversations, we believe it\u2019s gaining market share, and the entire industry is being helped along by the high level of biotech financing that happened in 2015.\u201dThe institutional shares of the Hood River fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 15.01 percent in the third quarter, compared with 3.85 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Baker builds his portfolio around themes that he sees shaping technology and the economy, like the emergence of artificial intelligence, and seeks stocks with strategies that will play out over three to seven years. Market attention tends to be short-term, creating opportunities for people who can be more patient, he said.He has long held Amazon shares, for example, even as other investors have said they are overvalued, based on the price-earnings ratio.\u201cAmazon has gone, over the last 15 years, from $5 to $840,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019d think people would wear down and realize that looking at it on current-period earnings isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.\u201d\u201cMore than a million people die every year driving,\u201d he said. \u201cSelf-driving cars will never drive drunk or high or distracted. They won\u2019t be texting and driving.\u201dArtificial intelligence favors the biggest tech companies, he said, because it demands lots of data and cheap, powerful computing, both of which they have in abundance.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009, and over the last five years, it has been one of the top performers among large-cap growth funds, returning an annualized average of 18.53 percent. In the third quarter, it returned 11.89 percent. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.91 percent.The fund holds only 36 stocks, a deliberately focused selection, he said. \u201cYou have to choose between the last two to get down to the one you really like,\u201d he said.For several years, worrisome economic news has streamed from China \u2014 reports of a slowing economy, overheated real estate markets and banks fat with problem loans. Mr. Mattock said such macro scares have buffeted China portfolios, on and off, for the roughly 15 years he has been investing in the country.But the \u201cobsession with macro,\u201d he said, has overshadowed a continued maturation of Chinese companies that offers opportunities for committed investors. \u201cWe have a lot of the big industry leaders in the portfolio, and these macro stories meant I could pick them up at a very good price,\u201d he said.In insurance, for example, the fund owns Ping An and China Life, two of the country\u2019s biggest insurers. In e-commerce, it holds Alibaba and Vipshop Holdings. Alibaba and Vipshop are leading e-commerce companies.The Matthews fund, with an expense ratio of 1.14 percent, returned 14.95 percent in the third quarter.An article in the special Mutual Fund Quarterly section last Sunday about the strongest-performing mutual funds misstated the expense ratio for the institutional shares of the Hood River Small-Cap Growth Fund. It was 1.09 percent, a net figure that accounts for fee waivers and expense reimbursements by the fund company, not 1.49 percent, which is the gross expense ratio.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snap Is Said to Pick Bankers for an I.P.O.", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The newest generation of technology darlings has signaled that it is about to come of age: Snapchat, the messaging service beloved by teenagers, is preparing to step out into the public markets.The company \u2014 born only five years ago \u2014 may end up ushering in a wave of huge tech initial public offerings at a time when Wall Street has seen few such big deals.Snapchat\u2019s parent, recently renamed Snap Inc., has hired the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, essentially firing a starting gun for a potential stock sale as soon as the first quarter of next year, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.Should Snap follow through on its plans, it would be the most prominent debut by the latest batch of \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 those private companies valued at more than $1 billion. Its class also includes Uber, the enormous ride-hailing service, and Airbnb, the home-rental start-up.Many of those companies are already awash in cash they have raised privately from mutual funds, venture capital firms and hedge funds, money that once needed to be raised on the public stock markets. But an initial offering would represent a new level of status and legitimacy, placing them on the same level as Google and Facebook.A wave of unicorns hitting the public markets would help end what has been one of the bleakest times for tech initial offerings \u2014 and I.P.O.s in general \u2014 in some time. No tech companies went public in the first three months of this year, a drought that had happened only three times since the early 1990s.Over all, just 84 companies have gone public so far this year in the United States, according to data from Renaissance Capital, down nearly 42 percent from last year.Among the problems that had bedeviled the market for new stocks was the ease with which tech companies like Uber have found cash from private investors, removing the need to go public anytime soon. The venture-backed companies that have gone public over the last 12 months have largely been smaller, lesser-known names like the communications service Twilio or the business software maker Atlassian.And public market investors like mutual funds have pushed back against the prices that start-ups have demanded, often leading to fewer of the sky-high stock debuts that Twitter and others enjoyed.But as the markets have stabilized, start-ups and their backers have again resumed discussions about splashy market debuts.\u201cIn the last three months, a number of companies have started saying that it\u2019s not all bad to be public,\u201d Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a mature company with more than $50 million in revenue, an I.P.O. is very much on your mind now.\u201dThe prospect of a huge offering has had banks racing to seize a piece of it for some time. Beyond Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, Snap has also engaged a bevy of other banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Company, Barclays and Credit Suisse \u2014 to help manage its stock sale, one of the people briefed on the matter added.At the heart of the frenzy is Snap, born in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011. The company is known for its mobile storytelling and messaging app, which lets users watch videos and send photos and messages to friends. The company also makes sunglasses called Spectacles that are equipped with a video camera.Currently, Snap would be able to file its public offering documents confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission because the company now generates less than $1 billion in annual revenue.The company may ultimately decide not to file for an offering. Yet Snap may be in a better position to go public before some other highly valued private companies because it has comparatively few regulatory concerns that would be listed as risk factors in a prospectus.Uber and Airbnb, for example, are fighting legal battles in numerous cities around the country and the world. Even though all of these battles will most likely be resolved, a long list of outstanding litigation and regulatory uncertainties could create an additional hurdle for investors.And unlike those two companies, Snap isn\u2019t based in Silicon Valley itself but in Venice, Calif., spearheading a nascent tech community in the Los Angeles area.Snap\u2019s app Snapchat was an early hit with young users who liked the fact that their messages and photos disappeared. The company was criticized for making it easier to send inappropriate photos with fewer consequences. Yet the ephemeral nature of the platform also made it seem like a more authentic way of communicating. Snapchat was an online facsimile of a casual conversation while platforms like Facebook and Instagram were the equivalent of a permanent record.Snap eventually added in tools that let users tell stories about their days and augment their selfies with stickers and masks, which the company calls filters and lenses. It also introduced channels for professionally created content from media companies like CNN and Cosmopolitan magazine.As users continued to flock to the app, a year ago Snap began to monetize its growing audience by allowing advertisers to sponsor filters and lenses and run video ads between stories produced by media companies or made up of user photos and videos.Advertisers have been keen to reach the Snapchat app\u2019s audience, which now includes 41 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 and 150 million daily users. At the moment, Snapchat is the trendiest, newest thing and advertisers want to be associated with it, Chad Stoller, executive vice president and global innovation director of IPG Mediabrands, said in an earlier interview.Snap has continued to build out content on Snapchat, the app has increasingly drawn comparisons to traditional television and is seen as an internet company that could someday draw ad dollars away from TV.This year, Snapchat is expected to generate nearly $367 million in ad revenue worldwide, according to data from the research firm eMarketer; and that figure is expected to rise to nearly $1 billion next year.For now, nearly all of Snapchat\u2019s revenue comes from the United States, according to eMarketer, but other markets should account for about a quarter of Snap\u2019s revenue by 2018.Yet for all of the service\u2019s phenomenal growth, Snapchat\u2019s parent must still demonstrate to potentially skittish stock market investors that it has a path to profitability if its offering is to soar, analysts say.\u201cInvestors aren\u2019t willing to buy growth at all costs,\u201d Kathleen Smith, a co-founder of Renaissance Capital, said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Picking a Portfolio With Pok\u00e9balls", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byEssayIt has sent me wandering through Times Square on my lunch break on a quest to capture imaginary monsters. These odd creatures have gotten me looking at the screen of my phone even more than usual. A lot of people stopped playing over the summer, but I haven\u2019t given up: As they say, Gotta Catch \u2019Em All.The game, like so many other things, has me thinking about money: If you can use augmented reality to find monsters, why not use it to capture weirdly enticing investments?\u201cAugmented reality?\u201d Maybe you\u2019re not pleased by the thought of yet another new technology, and techie buzz phrase, coming your way. A.R., as it\u2019s called, brings the physical world into a cartoon-inspired game. If you haven\u2019t played, it looks like this: Your phone shows a map of your surroundings, and the camera shows the Pok\u00e9mon characters popping up around you.I find it addictive. As I walk toward the office elevator on my way to lunch, a Mankey, a furry, ball-shaped dude with monkey arms and tail but a piggy snout, pops up on my screen. It has found a perch by a bookshelf, and is bobbing saucily at me. Lunch can wait; I want to catch that ugly little sucker. These creatures show up everywhere \u2014 on the street, in the park, even sitting on my wife\u2019s lap.The notion of applying A.R. to investing could be a million-dollar idea. I used to have billion-dollar ideas, but since nobody liked them much, I started discounting. For all I know, they might only be $10 ideas. But they are precious to me, and in my heart they shine like gold.This one seems especially brilliant: Instead of running all over town finding imaginary creatures, why not locate investments? You\u2019re a new parent, buying diapers in the store. You grab that box of Huggies, and scan the bar code: On the phone\u2019s screen, up pops a little creature that identifies the parent company, Kimberly-Clark. The company trades under the ticker KMB so let\u2019s call the creature a KMBino. Along with the waggling diaper creature, you\u2019d see the ticker symbol, stock price, one-year return \u2014 heck, maybe even the price-earnings ratio.Grab it!After all, you\u2019re giving the company thousands of dollars, you think, so why not get something back by buying the stock and watching it rise? This also could work for older investors buying Depends \u2014 it\u2019s the same company! And the same KMBino. Now there\u2019s a cradle-to-grave investing strategy.Buying beer? Get some BUD \u2014 the ticker symbol for its maker, Anheuser-Busch InBev, at least until the merger with SABMiller goes through. Throw your colorful Pok\u00e9ball at that BUDrosaur and put the stock into your portfolio \u2014 the investor\u2019s term for what Pok\u00e9mon players call their Pok\u00e9dex.My A.R. investing game is complicated, but no more so than evolving a Bulbasaur into an Ivysaur. The game could even go from augmented reality to the real thing: Just as the Pok\u00e9mon game lets you spend money to buy things like extra balls, incense and potions, my game would let you use actual dollars to buy shares. Players learn about the stock market, and inject a little fun into their lives and portfolios.You can firm up your calves while firming up your investments.You might not see the point of tying the market to a game that has you wandering around all the time. But consider that the phrase \u201crandom walk\u201d describes a theory that basically says prices move randomly, and so trying to beat the market is a sucker\u2019s game. Burton G. Malkiel popularized the idea in his 1973 investing classic \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street.\u201dWhat\u2019s more random than a walk to find and catch Pok\u00e9mon?I asked Mr. Malkiel what he thought of my game. \u201cI think that\u2019s actually fun,\u201d he said, astonishingly. \u201cI was the one who said, sort of jokingly, you might as well throw darts at the stock page, because you\u2019ll pick your stocks as well that way as any other way.\u201dSo why not modernize the dart-throwing with virtual Pok\u00e9mon? It\u2019s the most random walk out there \u2014 I almost fell into Verona Lake, in what is known in the real world as New Jersey, while pursuing yet another Magikarp.I did not tell Mr. Malkiel about the Magikarp or the lake; the conversation had been going well, and I didn\u2019t want him thinking I am not a serious journalist. Anyway, he was off and running with the idea, thinking about using the game to mimic other forms of investing.Many people, for example, think that rather than buying individual stocks, you should follow the buys of professional stock pickers, like mutual fund managers. He summed up this idea as \u201cInstead of picking the horse, pick the jockey, pick the trainer \u2014 whatever analogy you want to use.\u201dThe problem with that approach, of course, is that picking actively traded funds hasn\u2019t really turned out any better than picking individual stocks when it comes to beating the market. As he likes to put it, at least two-thirds of those trying to beat simple market indexes fail. About a third do beat the market, but it\u2019s not the same third from year to year.That\u2019s when I realized that Mr. Malkiel\u2019s approach to investing provides a road map to the perfect A.R. investing game. A little oversimplified, it comes to this: Don\u2019t pick and choose. Buy the whole market.Low-cost index funds would go up and down with the market index that they reflect, like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. The game could distribute the component stocks around the landscape like so many Jigglypuffs and Clefairies. Catch the stock, and it goes into your portfolio.Get the millennials I see playing out in the park to switch to Ind\u00e9xmon, and we might even be able to solve the national retirement savings crisis.Ah! I hear you saying (and not for the first time), \u201cSchwartz, you idiot! The point of an index fund is to have the whole basket of stocks from the start.\u201dI see your point. To use a Pok\u00e9mon analogy, if all you\u2019re capturing are Caterpies or Rattatas, it will take years to build a well-rounded portfolio.Of course, I\u2019ve thought of an answer for that: Every dollar would be invested in an index fund from the start, and your game is about filling in the virtual scorecard for the fun of it. Play and profit; it\u2019s beautiful.And that\u2019s a game anybody should want to win.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sticking With Stocks, Especially in Market Downturns", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byCall it confidence, or an unwillingness to try to time the market, or even complacency. But whatever the reason, some mutual fund managers with the best performances over the last five to 10 years say they are disinclined to sell their stock holdings \u2014 even if the overall market turns down.Mr. Dodson said he did not know when the next market peak would arrive, and so would not try to sell stock in anticipation of it. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may come soon. But I can\u2019t predict it.\u201dThis stick-with-stocks approach, which is embraced by many managers of funds that have prospered in the long bull market, may be a stabilizing force these days, offsetting some of the downward pressures that come when stock prices fall.That doesn\u2019t mean that all of these bullish stock fund managers are pouring fresh money into the market, however.Even if Mr. Dodson isn\u2019t selling stock, his fund\u2019s cash levels have risen from just over 4 percent in September 2015 to 14 percent in August. That\u2019s mainly because the fund\u2019s strong performance has attracted investors, and Mr. Dodson said he could not immediately put all of their money to productive use.\u201cBecause the market is near a high, I can\u2019t really find good stocks to invest in,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t find companies, so I stay in cash.\u201dOther funds maintain their stock holdings because they know that their shareholders expect them to maintain full exposure to, say, small-cap growth or large-cap value stocks. And many others maintain their overall asset allocations, but buy and sell specific securities depending on market conditions, including downturns.\u201cWe are not going to raise cash,\u201d said Chip Reed, who manages the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap fund, which has returned nearly 12 percent annualized over the last decade, according to Morningstar.Mr. Reed said he would not sell heavily even if he were to come to believe that a bear market was underway. Money can be made in bear markets, he said: \u201cYou just don\u2019t realize it at the time.\u201dIs there good reason to fear a bear market? Some managers are still weighing what they see as conflicting signals.On the negative side, Mr. Adams said, the valuations of many stock indexes have reached 10-year highs. But on the positive side, the dividend yield on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index is above 2 percent, while the 10-year average is 1.71.\u201cCompanies have been increasing dividends faster than stocks have been rising,\u201d he said. Mr. Adams said he could still find attractive growth stocks, sometimes in unexpected places. One example he cites is the Oshkosh Corporation, which this year won a United States Army contract to upgrade heavy tactical vehicles.\u201cWe don\u2019t use cash as an asset allocation tool,\u201d Mr. Ognar said. Instead, even if the market were to appear to be overpriced, he would search for stocks that had relatively good prospects, which he defined as having the ability to sustain growth at twice the pace of gross domestic product growth for three to five years.But Mr. Ognar said he saw no \u201cmajor warning signs\u201d that the market was near a top.He said he did become nervous in January, though even then he did not stay out of the stock market. Instead, he wanted to see whether companies \u201cwere overextended on the debt side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were doing more trading between positions.\u201dLarge fund families often offer asset allocation guidance to their individual portfolio managers, but T. Rowe Price hasn\u2019t recommended an \u201cunderweight\u201d position in stock holdings since 2001, said Sebastien Page, co-head of asset allocation at the company. These days, Mr. Page said, neither stocks nor bonds are particularly appealing. \u201cBoth appear expensive right now,\u201d he said.\u201cFor us the rally seems a bit artificial \u2014 like a sugar high,\u201d Mr. Page said. The Fed\u2019s sustained low interest rate policies have spurred stock advances, he said. But because \u201cbonds are expensive, too,\u201d Mr. Page has not called for a reduction in equities.What would induce Mr. Page to recommend a cutback in stock holdings now? \u201cIf bonds were more attractively valued, maybe we would reconsider our neutral on stocks,\u201d he said. Asked to put a percentage probability on a renewed \u201cunderweight\u201d call, Mr. Page estimated a zero to 15 percent chance.On the other hand, Bruce Picard, MassMutual\u2019s chief investment officer for asset allocation, reported that MassMutual had \u201cslightly\u201d lightened its equity holdings. Still, he said the company was unlikely to make a major shift unless three factors aligned: \u201ca faltering in the employment situation, a loss of momentum in consumer spending and a faster pace of Fed tightening.\u201dOf course, one fund manager\u2019s reason for selling stocks may be another\u2019s reason for buying.Mr. Adams of Mairs & Power said a downturn might well be a buying opportunity. \u201cWhen prices on good stocks go down,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m like a kid in a candy store.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Higher Prices Dim the Appeal of Dividend-Paying Stocks", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byFundamentallyDividend-paying stocks have had a terrific run for the last five years and already have double-digit gains in the first three quarters of 2016.But as money has been moving out of bonds and into these equities in search of income \u2014 dividend stocks are yielding 2.5 percent, nearly a point higher than 10-year Treasury notes \u2014 investors find themselves in a quandary.For one thing, traditional high-yielding areas of the market are trading at frothier levels than in recent memory.The price-to-earnings ratio for utility shares in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, for example, is now 17, based on projected profits over the next 12 months. That represents a 20 percent premium to the sector\u2019s historical average.\u201cThe parts of the dividend market that feel most at risk are stocks that are perceived to be more stable and bondlike, like regulated utilities and consumer staples stocks,\u201d said Ben Kirby, a manager of the Thornburg Investment Income Builder Fund.Mr. Kirby said his fund, which beat more than 70 percent of its peers in the third quarter and more than 90 percent in the last decade, has been reducing its exposure to these areas this year.At the same time, an alternative approach known as dividend growth \u2014 which focuses not on high yielders, but on modest payers that are likely to increase their dividends consistently over time \u2014 is also running into problems.The earnings growth rate among companies in the S.&P. 500 has been declining for five consecutive quarters, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence, and dividends represent that portion of profits that is returned to shareholders.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that there\u2019s a lot of room for dividends to grow in the absence of earnings growth,\u201d said Floyd Tyler, president and chief investment officer at the asset management firm Preserver Partners. \u201cThat\u2019s a real headwind.\u201dMoreover, corporations have just been through an extended stretch in which dividends have grown much faster than their historical average.Josh Peters, senior portfolio manager for Morningstar Investment Management, pointed out that over the last 12 years, the growth rate for dividends on an inflation-adjusted basis has been 5.9 percent. That is significantly faster than the historical real dividend growth rate of about 2 percent for stocks in the S.&P. 500.Payout ratios \u2014 which measure the percentage of a company\u2019s earnings being used for dividends \u2014 have been rising. This combination of slowing earnings growth and rising payout ratios is why Mr. Peters said \u201cthe golden age of dividend growth is over.\u201dThis leaves investors with few options.Melda Mergen, head of North American equities for Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said it makes sense to \u201cbe as diversified as possible.\u201d She added, \u201cYou have to try to balance the growers with the current payers.\u201dThat involves embracing economic sectors that have not historically been associated with dividends.Take technology. Though the sector has a below-average current yield of 1.6 percent, tech companies are now the second-largest contributor to S.&P. 500 dividends, behind the financial sector, based on total dollars returned to shareholders.\u201cThere are pockets of tech with good cash flow and strong balance sheets,\u201d Ms. Mergen said. \u201cAnd companies are starting to hear more shareholder demand to have more profits returned through dividends.\u201dThe key, she said, is to look at high-quality companies with strong balance sheets and reliable earnings that \u2014 in the event of an economic downturn \u2014 will be likely to maintain payouts.Mr. Kirby also prefers high-quality companies, but he notes that these stocks have been in big demand in recent years. So to find quality businesses that trade at decent prices, investors must be willing to consider economically cyclical companies, which may not be popular with dividend investors this late in the economic recovery.Take the CME Group, which runs several financial exchanges in the United States, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.\u201cThis is a high-quality business with high market share in each of the contracts it trades, so there\u2019s pricing power,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s interesting about the stock is that it\u2019s a bit countercyclical.\u201d He pointed out that volatility and fear were usually detrimental to financial businesses. But \u201cwhenever investor concerns rise, they hedge that risk with futures and options contracts, so CME\u2019s trading volume can increase in those times,\u201d he said.In addition to the stock\u2019s 2.2 percent dividend yield, the company often issues a special dividend at year-end, which sometimes can effectively double the yield, he said.John D. Linehan, manager of the T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund, said, \u201cIn order to be a value-conscious dividend investor, you have to make some sacrifice today, whether that means compromising on valuations, stability of earnings, or the regions where you invest.\u201dWhen Mr. Linehan took over management of the fund nearly a year ago, he began broadening the universe of potential holdings. \u201cThere can be more attractive opportunities outside the United States without sacrificing on quality,\u201d he said, noting that foreign stocks now make up about 7 percent of the fund\u2019s assets.As an example, \u201cwe were having problems finding opportunities in consumer staples companies in the U.S. where valuations look stretched,\u201d he said. Yet overseas, he found cheaper stocks like Diageo, the London-based multinational maker of spirits such as Guinness and Johnnie Walker.Robert Hordon, a manager of the First Eagle Global Income Builder Fund, said he had similar experiences with real estate stocks. In the United States, real estate stocks have shot up since March 2009, raising questions about the sector\u2019s valuations.\u201cThat being said, we are owners of real estate securities outside the U.S., in Asia, where high-quality real estate stocks are trading at more reasonable valuations,\u201d he said. One example, he said, is Mandarin Oriental International, which is based in Hong Kong and owns and operates hotels and residences there, elsewhere in Asia and in other parts of the world.Mr. Hordon added that the United States market \u201cis a relatively low-yielding stock market anyway.\u201dWhat is more, American stocks have outperformed foreign shares for several years, a traditional sign to value-minded investors that better opportunities may exist elsewhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Earnings Impress but Don\u2019t Fully Convince", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsGoldman Sachs is charting a frustrating path back to the top.Trading, share buybacks and operating leverage all helped the investment bank earn $2.1 billion in the third quarter, its best showing in a year and a half. The way it beat its cost of capital, though, fails to inspire full confidence.More than half the $1.3 billion increase in revenue from a year ago came fromfrom from the company\u2019s investing and lending division. Gains on equity investments accounted for most of it. That is fine, as far as it goes. Results in this area fluctuate wildly, however. And new regulations are curbing how large this part of the business can be.What\u2019s more, Goldman\u2019s tax rate slipped to 27 percent for the three months to the end of September, compared with a rate of at least 30 percent. If taxes had been more like usual and investment gains half what was reported, the annualized return on equity for the quarter of 11.2 percent would have dipped to around 9.3 percent.Even so, Goldman fared well by current industry standards. Few rivals have managed to achieve the 10 percent return considered the theoretical cost of capital. And the bank run by Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive, is hitting the right notes elsewhere.Fixed-income trading jumped 34 percent, roughly in line with that of rivals Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase. Top-line gains of 19 percent outpaced the 10 percent increase in expenses as Goldman slashed noncompensation costs by almost a quarter.There was good news for employees, too. The amount set aside for bonuses swelled by more than a third, even as staff levels fell 5 percent as Goldman reversed its mistimed hiring exuberance last year.There was another unexpected benefit: buybacks reduced outstanding shares by 6 percent, far more than the 1 or 2 percent decrease Goldman has tended to carry out. That helps push up shareholder returns.As welcome as these many elements are, Goldman\u2019s earnings look overly lumpy. That makes them too unreliable to justify its shares heading back above book value any time soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Targets Companies\u2019 Weakness: The Gender Gap", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byThe chief executive at a plastics company was playing golf. A lot of golf.The activist hedge fund the Barington Capital Group, through a website that tracked golfers\u2019 handicaps, found that the chief executive was routinely playing 18 holes or more on weekdays, even as the company\u2019s stock price was lagging.It was that finding a decade ago that helped shape the career of Dianne McKeever, then a partner at Barington.Lack of oversight by the company\u2019s board enabled the incessant golf games, and the chief executive\u2019s time on the green was keeping him away from trying to fix the stock price, Ms. McKeever argued.\u201cThis was a perfect example of why diversity of all types \u2014 not only gender and multicultural diversity, but also operational and skill-set diversity \u2014 is needed in the boardroom,\u201d Ms. McKeever said.Her idea: Bring in new blood, get rid of the frequent golf games and focus management\u2019s attention on the company.Ms. McKeever declined to name the company, but filings indicated that it was A. Schulman, a Midwestern plastics supplier. A. Schulman did not respond to four requests seeking comment. The company\u2019s management team was all men, and while it did have one woman on the board, the directors were close friends, she recalled.\u201cThe board\u2019s chumminess and insularity were impediments to making those difficult, but necessary, decisions,\u201d Ms. McKeever said recently.To her, the episode amply illustrated how a lack of gender diversity could contribute to deficient corporate governance, like a distracted chief executive, and board entrenchment.Ms. McKeever, 38, and her partner and co-founder of Ides Capital in Manhattan, Robert Longnecker, 42, saw diversification as a missing part of the typical activist strategy.Ides, which was started about a year ago, has a short track record, with only one public battle \u2014 and the fund is small. But it appears to be the first activist hedge fund in the United States fronted by a woman, according to data compiled by Josh Black of Activist Insight, a research firm that tracks the subject.Like any other hedge fund, Ides seeks to generate returns from its investments and sees diversifying small and midsize corporate boardrooms as a way to help improve stock prices.\u201cWeak governance practices, including a lack of diversity, coincides frequently with poor valuations,\u201d Ms. McKeever said in an interview. \u201cThose improvements, in our minds, are no-brainers.\u201dIn starting Ides, Ms. McKeever is charging through the notoriously male-dominated world of activist investing, known for the famous personality-driven investors like Carl C. Icahn, William A. Ackman, Daniel Loeb and Nelson Peltz.Traditional activist investors also rail against the chumminess of corporate boards but do so by incorporating their own associates, who, more often than not, are male and white.Ms. McKeever grew up in Indianapolis. Her father was a small-business owner who taught her about companies by letting her buy and sell stocks at a young age. She moved to the New York area for college, majoring in chemistry at New York University and chemical engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology, and later attended law school at Fordham.She got into activist investing after meeting James A. Mitarotonda, the founder of Barington, at an event at N.Y.U., which he had also attended. She began working at the firm in 2001.\u201cHaving worked with Dianne for almost seven years, it is not surprising to me that she would start an activist hedge fund focused on improving gender diversity,\u201d said Mr. Mitarotonda, the chief executive of Barington. \u201cShe feels strongly about fairness and equality.\u201dShortly after starting Ides, Ms. McKeever wasted little time with her first public fight: Boingo Wireless, a company known for providing Wi-Fi, for a fee, at airports.In a letter to Boingo in April, she listed various corporate governance mishaps, including \u201cthe board\u2019s failure to diversify the boardroom.\u201d She later filed proxy materials, nominating two directors to Boingo\u2019s board: one woman and one man.Ultimately, Boingo agreed to settle with Ides, expanding the board from six to nine members. Ms. McKeever agreed to withdraw her two nominees in exchange for the three that Boingo brought in. One of the three was a woman, the first since the company went public.\u201cWe believe diversity at every level of the company is critical to Boingo\u2019s success,\u201d said Lauren de la Fuente, a spokeswoman at Boingo. \u201cIt\u2019s why we were already actively engaged in recruiting women onto the Boingo board when Ides Capital approached us, and had been in discussions with Kathy Misunas, whom we subsequently added to the Boingo board.\u201dSince Boingo and Ides reached their settlement on June 1, shares of Boingo have gained more than 30 percent.Some countries, like Norway and Germany, have passed laws that require a minimum percentage of women on each corporate board. In the United States, where there are no such requirements, shareholders have taken it upon themselves to change board composition. More than 250 proposals have been made since 1997, according to data compiled by Carol Marquardt, a professor at Baruch College, and Christine Wiedman, a professor at the University of Waterloo.But the growing class of shareholder activists, many of whom promote themselves as the stalwarts of corporate governance, have a paltry record when it comes to women.In addition to nominating fewer women as directors, they appear to disproportionately target female chief executives. The Fortune 500 executives Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, Irene Rosenfeld of Mondelez International, Ursula Burns of Xerox Corporation and Sheri McCoy of Avon Products have all encountered activist investors.A potential reason for this is that upon announcing female leadership at a company, the market tends to react negatively, sending its stock price lower, according to Christine Shropshire, who wrote the study for A.S.U. There can also be spillover effects, where the stocks of other female-led companies fall on the appointment of another woman chief executive, she said. Activists focus on companies that they perceive to be undervalued, which may explain some of why they have targeted women-run companies more frequently.There is also an implicit bias to nominate someone who is demographically similar, said Ms. Shropshire, who has been interviewing female directors at publicly traded firms.\u201cTheir anecdotes about determining the slate of potential board candidates reflect a hesitation among men to change the status quo of boardroom dynamics by bringing in female members, especially more than one,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen may be more likely to pose tough questions or engage in more intensive monitoring efforts, though interestingly, I would expect those behaviors could also make them more valued and potential allies for activists themselves.\u201dThat is the bet that Ides is making.An article on Wednesday about activist hedge funds and the gender gap on company boards referred incorrectly in some copies to efforts at the hedge fund Barington Capital Group more than a decade ago to change the practices of a company where a chief executive was deemed to be spending too much time on golf. Dianne McKeever, then a Barington partner \u2014 not the hedge fund itself \u2014 argued that the golf games were hurting the company\u2019s stock price and that management changes were needed.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

On Saturday afternoon, after Mr. Cervony splurged on records by Mr. Dylan and Mr. Young at the festival\u2019s vinyl shop, the duo struck up a conversation with a graying couple about Bernie Sanders, the blues and whether Mr. McCartney is a corporate sellout.\u201cGood luck with the future \u2014 it\u2019s in your hands,\u201d the man, 70, told them in parting.Even among themselves, Mr. Cervony and Mr. Kray remained devotedly on topic, musing on Dylan mythology, comparing obscure solo Keith Richards songs and anticipating a potential Desert Trip concert film. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to buy the DVD,\u201d Mr. Kray said.Having claimed their spot against the general admission barricade more than four hours before showtime, Mr. Cervony Snapchatted in anticipation, for once showing his \u201990s-baby bona fides.

{"Headline": "$28 Billion Flows Out of Hedge Funds in Quarter Suffer Biggest Quarterly Outflow Since 2009", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byIt has been a bruising year for hedge funds. Big bets have been disastrous, investors have voiced discontent and some managers have been forced to rewrite their playbooks or call it quits.And now, there is new data to rub salt into the industry\u2019s wounds: Over the last three months, investors pulled $28 billion out of hedge funds, according to the research firm Hedge Fund Research. It is the biggest quarterly outflow of dollars since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.So far this year, more than $50 billion has flowed out \u2014 much of that from the industry\u2019s biggest and best-known funds, Hedge Fund Research said in its latest industry report, released on Thursday.Among this year\u2019s biggest losers are firms tarred in recent months by scandal.The firm, which informed investors in 2014 that the government was investigating it over questions of bribery, said in August that it had lost $5.5 billion in investments this year alone. This month, New Jersey said it would pull $190 million from Och-Ziff.But it\u2019s not just regulatory action that has irked hedge fund investors.Performance across the industry has been mediocre for years.The Hedge Fund Research Composite Index, the broadest gauge of hedge fund performance, lags the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index so far this year, with a 4.14 percent gain through the end of September compared to the index\u2019s 8 percent gain over the same period, accounting for reinvested dividends.Over the last year, some categories of hedge funds have consistently made wrong-footed bets, and the outlook has become so dire that the billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel S. Loeb told his investors this year that \u201cwe are in the first innings of a washout.\u201dThe prominent investor William A. Ackman has become an example of how quickly the fortunes of hedge fund titans can be reversed. Just two years ago, his Pershing Square Holdings finished the year with a 40 percent gain. But it lost 20.5 percent last year and is down 22 percent so far this year.While Calpers\u2019s hedge fund holdings were small \u2014 just $4 billion compared with the $300 billion that it managed at the time \u2014 the move sent ripples across the hedge fund industry, prompting other public pensions to question their own investments.Since then, public pension funds and insurance companies have withdrawn their money at a rapid pace. This month, the Kentucky Retirement Systems voted to exit hedge funds over the next three years. The New Jersey State Investment Council also announced plans this month to pull nearly $2 billion from 11 hedge funds. MetLife, the New York City employee pension and the American International Group have recently started asking hedge funds for their money back, too.For decades the industry operated on a model known as \u201c2 and 20,\u201d which meant that investors paid fees of 20 percent of any gain in a year and 2 percent of assets under management. To keep investors from jumping ship, managers are beginning to reduce fees in exchange for locking up money for longer periods of time. In some cases, hedge fund managers have promised not to charge any fees until they surpass a performance target.In another sign of trouble for the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund industry, the pace at which hedge fund managers open new shops has slowed, according to the research firm Preqin.Despite the flood of negative news, some industry experts argue that investors are fleeing the industry at a time when the industry could still make a comeback.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Is Vital to Protecting Antarctica\u2019s Ross Sea", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBut there are reasons to hope that this year may be different.The commission was created in 1982 to avert the overfishing and deterioration that is happening throughout the world\u2019s oceans. Antarctica is particularly vulnerable because so much life there depends on one tiny creature, the krill. Penguins, whales, seabirds and seals all eat krill, as do many other marine animals. These shrimplike invertebrates are the linchpin of the entire ecosystem, and it was the increasing commercial exploitation of this creature that led to the international commission\u2019s creation and the growing awareness of the vulnerability of Antarctica\u2019s ocean.It\u2019s easy to take such resources for granted since 70 percent of the planet is covered by water. But human influence and interference has grown enormously as we\u2019ve harnessed technology to plumb the marine depths and scoop up the bounty. For instance, while most of us don\u2019t eat krill, we now use them to feed farm-raised salmon and incorporate them in cosmetics and nutritional supplements. The faster gathering and processing of these tiny creatures threatens to remove a key source of nutrition from the Southern Ocean\u2019s food web.There is no single solution to all these problems. But research has demonstrated that the creation of large, fully protected marine reserves can play an important part in helping to regenerate ocean life and buy time in an age of climate change, if we can set aside key areas before they become overfished and degraded by warming waters.Enric Sala, a marine ecologist who is an explorer in residence for National Geographic, said, \u201cThis historical national park designation has shown Russia\u2019s commitment to the conservation of the Arctic environment, and sent a powerful signal to the other Arctic nations.\u201dBy joining with the 25 other members of the Antarctic commission, Russia has the chance to usher in its Year of Ecology and make a bold demonstration of its commitment to global cooperation and conservation by protecting a region that a Russian discovered.Doing so would not only save fish, penguins, whales and seabirds, it would confirm the environmental aspirations of Russia and make the ocean a healthier, more resilient place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Just Another Stinky Fish", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBranford, Conn. \u2014 In a bay near this coastal town, the sea was boiling with hundreds of herring-size shiners leaping to flee a marauding squad of bluefish. \u201cThese waters are coming back,\u201d Bren Smith yelled above the shrieking din, as sea gulls plunged near our boat, scooping up fish. Mr. Smith grows seaweed and shellfish in Long Island Sound, and he says he\u2019s seen a lot more action out here recently.What thrilled me about this scene was that I was witnessing what happens when fishery managers set strict catch limits to stop overfishing.Those leaping silvery fish were menhaden, also known as bunker, or pogies. To Mr. Smith and other fishermen I spoke to, there are encouraging signs that the menhaden population along the Atlantic Coast is healthy after decades of intensive commercial exploitation. Other sea creatures whose lives are intertwined with them also seem to be doing well. Sharks, whales, bluefish, tuna, osprey and other predators depend in part on these fish.\u201cThere\u2019s all this life that wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d John McMurray, who captains his own charter boat, told me. He said it\u2019s been a boon for his sports fishing business off Long Island: \u201cIn the past four years, striped bass fishing has gotten a lot better, bluefish as well. We\u2019re even getting bluefin tuna coming inshore to feed on the schools of menhaden.\u201dMenhaden are filter feeders. They swim in vast schools of hundreds of thousands of fish. Mouths agape as they feed, menhaden are living vacuum cleaners sucking up algae blooms that deplete inshore waters of oxygen and create biological deserts in the sea. A single adult menhaden can clean four to seven gallons of water in a minute.The name menhaden is a corruption of \u201cmunnawhatteaug,\u201d which means fertilizer in Algonquian. Native Americans taught the pilgrims to plant them with their corn, enabling colonists to coax a crop from rocky New England soils, according to Bruce Franklin, author of \u201cThe Most Important Fish in the Sea.\u201d Bony and smelly, menhaden have rarely been caught for food. But their oil greased the wheels of America\u2019s machine age after the Civil War, replacing whale oil as a cheaper alternative.Today, menhaden oil continues to be sought, not as an industrial lubricant, but as a health supplement. Most of the 188,000-metric ton annual catch is rendered into heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid fish oil. Much of the rest is used to produce fertilizers and high-protein feeds for chickens and pigs. In terms of weight, more menhaden are caught than any other fish on the East Coast.But concerns that menhaden were being overfished led the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in 2012 to impose a quota that reduced the historic harvest by 20 percent. That limit was raised by 10 percent last year after regulators concluded that menhaden were not being over-harvested.Now the fisheries commission is considering a proposal to expand the allowable catch by another 20 percent when it meets Wednesday in Bar Harbor, Me. The largest industrial menhaden harvester on the East Coast, Omega Protein, has suggested that the quota could easily be raised by up to 30 percent. The company points to the commission\u2019s conclusion last year that menhaden were not being overfished. Critics of the 2012 quota decision say, moreover, that it was based on faulty methodology that identified a problem that didn\u2019t exist; others argue that it understated the plight of the menhaden.Regardless, the commission should keep the quota where it is and wait until a more comprehensive management approach is developed to safeguard this critically important fish.That work is underway now. Scientists are developing reference points to measure the ecological role that menhaden serve as forage fish and how changes in their numbers would affect the predators that feed on them.This would be a departure from the way most fish, including menhaden, are managed now. Regulators focus narrowly on how many fish of a particular species can be sustainably harvested. A decision on whether to adopt this more comprehensive approach is expected to be made next year.Robert Ballou, the chairman of the commission\u2019s Menhaden Management Board, said this method would enable \u201ca new way of managing the fish that will credit them for their unique role in the environment and set quotas that are right, not just for menhaden, but for all of the species that depend on them.\u201dThis is the right approach.Setting quotas can be a messy process. Sports fishermen, commercial interests, state lawmakers and environmental groups often squabble over fishing quotas, and the limits that result can be split-the-difference compromises that leave nobody happy. And they can be environmentally catastrophic, when commercial considerations trump sound science. That\u2019s what happened to New England\u2019s groundfish fishery, including cod, which was declared a federal disaster in 2012.This is why regulatory decisions need to be based not just on short-term profits but on the health of the ecosystem as a whole. This approach would be an enlightened departure for fisheries regulators, who typically see their job only as ensuring that specific fish stocks remain commercially viable.Joseph Gordon, manager of mid-Atlantic Ocean Conservation for the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the commission\u2019s effort to develop a holistic strategy for managing menhaden \u201cis an incredibly exciting precedent.

Calm has been restored, they acknowledge, but they warn that long-term risks remain in Europe, Britain most of all, for businesses and therefore for investors, too.The investment outlook is \u201ca lot less favorable\u201d in Britain, said Alan Mudie, head of investment strategy at Societe Generale Private Banking Hambros. Until companies have clarity about their longer-term relationship with the European Union, they will delay investments, he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense not to, until they know what sort of marketplace they\u2019re going to be operating in.\u201dSarah Ketterer, manager of the Causeway International Value fund, agreed that \u201cfrom an investment perspective, everything is delayed.\u201d As a result, she said she was \u201cmaking very conservative assumptions\u201d about conditions in Britain, and she predicted a mild recession in 2017.She is not alone, and Britain may not be, either, when it comes to the consequences of Brexit. The British bank Barclays warned that Brexit is likely to create substantial headwinds for economies in Britain and on the Continent in coming months.Highlighting surveys showing that corporations\u2019 plans to invest declined markedly and that consumer confidence had eroded, Barclays forecast that the British economy would be pushed into a recession imminently.As for Europe over all, \u201cwe expect growth to slow further towards year-end, as Brexit weighs on confidence, private consumption and investment,\u201d the bank said in an economics report in August. Reaction to the vote in regional economic and confidence data had been muted, the report said. But: \u201cMost forward-looking components showed that expectations had resumed their downward trend, and we expect confidence to be further affected in the months to come. Uncertainty is likely to weigh on investment, with a negative feedback loop on the labor market and private consumption.\u201dThe initial reaction to the Brexit vote was much starker. Many people assumed that Brexit would be awful for the country, the region and beyond. The result was plunging stock markets and currencies almost everywhere.The MSCI Europe index fell 13 percent in the two trading days after the June 23 referendum, and the MSCI index of British stocks fell 15.7 percent. The indexes are calculated in dollars, so those figures incorporate the declines in stocks and also in the euro and the pound against the dollar.Within a week, both indexes had recovered more than half of the losses, although it is unclear why. A new British prime minister had taken over and pledged to honor the decision to leave the 28-nation bloc, but everything else related to Britain\u2019s departure was still up in the air. The outlook had not changed, only the public\u2019s feelings about it.Markets in the region have stabilized, helping investors who hung on for the wild ride. Funds that specialize in European stocks rose 5.3 percent in the third quarter, according to Morningstar.But where investors, and businesses, go from here is much less certain.What makes the post-referendum outlook especially hard to gauge for businesses is that Britain has yet to make clear how it intends to honor the result. A report by Brewin Dolphin, a British wealth management firm, suggested that the new government of Prime Minister Theresa May would have to thread a very slender needle as it tries to keep the country in the single European market for goods and services while imposing limits on immigration.How it will go about accomplishing that could become clearer next spring. Mrs. May said earlier this month that Britain would invoke Article 50 in March. That is a European Union treaty provision that governs the process for a country to leave the union.Evidence of the concern among businesses can be found in a Bank of England survey taken just after the vote. It reported that \u201ccompanies indicated the result of the E.U. referendum would have a negative effect, overall, on capital spending, hiring and turnover over the coming year.\u201d It added that \u201cemployment and investment intentions had weakened in absolute terms, pointing to expectations of little change in staff numbers and capital spending over the coming six to 12 months.\u201dJames Hunt, manager of the Tocqueville International Value fund, is willing to give the economy and stocks in Britain and the rest of Europe some benefit of doubt when it comes to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, if and when it occurs.\u201cThe market reaction is overdone,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cBrexit may not happen. There are plenty of ways the U.K. government can cause it not to happen\u201d through what it asks for, and when, in its negotiations with the union.If Brexit goes ahead, \u201cthere will be a moderate impact on the U.K. initially and then I think they could end up in a better place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a smaller impact on the European economy, and what I hope is that it\u2019s another incentive for Europe to accelerate whatever structural reforms they have going.\u201dSome businesses and investors in Europe have waited \u2014 and hoped \u2014 for many years for government initiatives to reduce regulatory hurdles and to make labor cheaper and employment more flexible, which would improve competitiveness and economic growth.The prospect of Britain leaving the European Union could concentrate the minds of political leaders, but Ms. Ketterer said many large companies are tired of hanging around and are undertaking changes of their own. That fact tends to get lost amid the apprehension over factors such as Brexit, creating what she sees as solid investment opportunities, particularly in large, European, multinational companies in economically fragile sectors.\u201cWe might have to wait awhile for governments to restructure, but these companies aren\u2019t waiting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really like these globally competitive, cyclical companies. They are really well managed and cheaper\u201d than shares of equivalent American companies.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.The preference for large British companies that make money abroad is widespread. Mr. Hunt likes the beverage purveyor Diageo, for instance. Its \u201ccash flows are global, and the perceived connection to the U.K. is greater than it really is,\u201d he said.A globally diversified revenue stream should inoculate such companies against weakness in the pound, a development that provides British exporters with a substantial competitive advantage over their peers elsewhere by making British goods and services cheaper to foreign customers, Mr. Mudie of Societe Generale pointed out. That is a prime reason that he also favors large British companies.Within the eurozone, he recommends health care and consumer sectors. Consumer stocks should benefit from a continuing decline in unemployment and improved access to bank credit, he said. Considering the markets more broadly, he anticipates American stocks outperforming their European peers, with British stocks doing better than ones on the Continent.Ms. Ketterer said she is taking a chance on British financial companies. A post-Brexit reduction in interest rates by the Bank of England hit their stocks especially hard; banks\u2019 profits depend on the spread between rates at which they borrow and lend, which is squeezed when rates fall, and insurance companies\u2019 profits depend on the income paid on the bonds in which they invest their policyholders\u2019 premiums. But the decline in bank and insurance stocks has been so severe, in her view, that they warrant a bet.Ms. Ketterer likes the British insurance companies Prudential and Aviva. Among British multinationals, she said the energy company Shell is appealing for its high yet secure dividend yield of close to 7 percent.But how big a bargain any European stock is may not become clear until the uncertainty surrounding Brexit abates. As Ms. Ketterer reminds investors, that could take awhile.\u201cThe initial shock has worn off\u201d since the referendum, she said. But \u201cin the U.K. nothing has been settled. There\u2019s a very long road ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Democrats and Republicans in Congress. State treasurers in California and Illinois. Even Hillary Clinton. They have all lambasted Wells Fargo in recent weeks over the phony accounts scandal.Now, a wealthy 80-year-old businessman and philanthropist from Texas is taking aim at the besieged bank.Lacy Harber, who owns real estate in Las Vegas and numerous small banks and marinas, took out advertisements in four large newspapers on Thursday \u2014 including The New York Times \u2014 denouncing Wells Fargo.Mr. Harber\u2019s ad describes itself as an \u201copen letter to the Senate Banking Committee, House Financial Services Committee, Wells Fargo board of directors and the American public.\u201dIt goes on to assert: \u201cThe recent disclosures about Wells Fargo are only the tip of the iceberg.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Harber said his complaint with Wells Fargo centers on its investment brokers. He said that on Aug. 24, 2015, as the stock market dropped precipitously, he placed orders for about $34.8 million worth of stocks through his brokers at Wells Fargo Advisors.Working from his kitchen counter at home in North Texas, Mr. Harber said he went on the buying spree to take advantage of the dropping prices, snapping up shares of blue chip companies like Apple and Exxon Mobil.Like many active investors, Mr. Harber bought the stocks \u201con margin\u201d which typically means putting down some money and borrowing the rest from the broker. But given the extreme volatility in the market that morning, Wells Fargo, he said, demanded that he pay for the stocks in full.Mr. Harber said that even though he told Wells he could wire $19 million that day and deliver the balance the next day, the bank said it needed the total amount.At the end of that day, he said, Wells sold all of the shares he had bought that day, resulting in a $5 million loss. Adding insult to injury, he said, he was charged about $480,000 in broker fees.In a statement, a spokesman for Wells Fargo Advisors said: \u201cMr. Harber is a highly sophisticated, experienced investor who routinely made his own investing decisions. We executed his transactions on a day of extraordinary market volatility that included a 1,000-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. Mr. Harber\u2019s trades were done on margin. Unfortunately, his trading was affected by adverse market conditions. We\u2019re in litigation with Mr. Harber and are strongly defending against his claims.\u201dThe statement added that \u201cMr. Harber has chosen to use the current media focus on Wells Fargo as a means to draw attention\u201d to his case.But there are similarities. Last year, Mr. Harber filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo Advisors in District Court in Grayson County, Tex., over the stock trades.Like many of the customers who have filed lawsuits over the phony accounts in court, Mr. Harber\u2019s claim was also sent into private arbitration, which he called a \u201cstacked deck\u201d that favors the bank. The arbitration is pending.Wells forces many of its customers to agree to settle any dispute in arbitration as a condition of doing business with it.Earlier this week, Mrs. Clinton, on the presidential campaign trail, said that the scandal over the fake accounts at Wells Fargo highlighted how private arbitration hurts consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s time for corporate greed to end,\u201d the ad reads. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was also ordered to surrender more than $200,000 in profit from trading shares of Evergrande Real Estate Group Limited, a developer in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.The case, filed in 2014 by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, has heightened fears that regulators in one of Asia\u2019s biggest financial centers are seeking to suppress critical commentary and the free flow of financial information.It was the second time in recent years that the commission has taken aim at a foreign financial company for criticizing the accounting, governance or other performance aspects of Chinese businesses.In April, an appellate board in Hong Kong upheld a $1.4 million fine that the regulator won against the ratings agency Moody\u2019s Investors Services related to a 2011 report that outlined \u201cred flags\u201d at several Chinese companies.Short-selling involves investors borrowing stock and selling it, betting that the price will fall and that the shares can be bought back at a lower price before being returned.The securities appeals tribunal, in its ruling on the Moody\u2019s case, acknowledged the right of financial market participants to freedom of expression.Those allegations, denied repeatedly by Evergrande, included claims that the developer was \u201cinsolvent and had consistently presented fraudulent information to the investing public.\u201dChina\u2019s property market has recently rebounded from a slump, and prices have soared to the point that analysts have warned of a bubble.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janus to Merge With Henderson, Forming Asset Management Giant", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byThe Janus Capital Group and the Henderson Group, a large London-based investment manager, said on Monday that they would merge in an all-stock deal that would create an asset manager with greater global scale and about $320 billion of assets under management.The deal \u2014 creating a company to be called Janus Henderson Global Investors \u2014 highlights the extent to which smaller mutual fund companies that focus on actively managed investment offerings are feeling the pressure from the explosive growth of lower cost, passive strategies like exchange traded funds.The companies said on Monday that combined they would be more stable through market cycles and would have greater geographic reach. They said the merger would also result in annual cost savings of $110 million.Andrew Formica, the Henderson chief executive, told analysts on a conference call Monday that the merger talks grew out of conversations beginning in February with Richard M. Weil, the chief executive of Janus, about issues affecting the industry.\u201cAt some point, it was clear to both of us to achieve our own ambitions we would have to do a transformational deal or a larger transaction to give us greater scale in the market we\u2019re operating in,\u201d Mr. Formica said. \u201cIt just merged into a point of saying: \u2018Well, hang on a minute. Let\u2019s explore if it works for both of us.\u2019 \u201dJanus, based in Denver, was one of the industry\u2019s most dynamic outfits in the 1990s, with an expertise in investing in fast-growing companies. The firm was hit hard following the financial crisis. It has lost $30 billion from its mutual funds since 2008, according to Morningstar, as investors have piled into better performing E.T.F.s that track a variety of stock and bond indexes.Although Janus has begun to introduce a suite of E.T.F.s, they have not yet been able to attract significant assets.Janus has also not had a huge inflow of cash after its decision to offer Mr. Gross a home following his departure from its rival Pimco.The size of Mr. Gross\u2019s benchmark unconstrained fund is $1.5 billion and has not budged much from this level in the last year.In an emailed statement, Mr. Gross expressed his support for the merger and went out of his way to remark that his fund was beating a similarly themed fund at Pimco.\u201cHenderson obviously bought a great performing fund with Janus Global Unconstrained,\u201d Mr. Gross said. He pointed out that his fund\u2019s performance, in absolute and relative terms, was \u201ctypical of my historical standards, at 400 basis points above the benchmark for the year, far better than Pimco.\u201dAccording to data from Morningstar, Mr. Gross\u2019s fund has gained 4.9 percent through this year to date, compared with 3.8 percent for Pimco\u2019s unconstrained bond fund.Under the terms of the deal announced on Monday, each share in Janus, which has a market capitalization of about $2.61 billion, would be exchanged for 4.719 new Henderson shares, giving Henderson shareholders about 57 percent of the new company.The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of next year and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.The combined company would be based in London and would have had revenue of more than $2.2 billion in 2015. It will have about 2,300 employees at 29 locations worldwide.Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica would serve as joint chief executives of the combined company.Mr. Formica said that keeping the combined company\u2019s headquarters in London made sense given its expanded global footprint.\u201cFor a global business, London still acts as the best global financial center, or pivot, for a business that spans everything from Asia, Europe to the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cLondon sort of sits in the middle of that.\u201dMr. Formica said that Britain\u2019s referendum in June to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, did not drive the discussions.\u201cAt the end of the day, whenever the Brexit discussions conclude, the U.K. is going to remain a core and big financial market for our products, as will Europe,\u201d he said. Over a 10- or 15-year time frame, he added, \u201cthe Brexit debate is just a drop in the ocean.\u201dOn a pro forma basis, about 54 percent of the company\u2019s assets under management would come from the United States; about 31 percent would come from Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and 15 percent would come from Asia.Michael Werner, a UBS analyst, said that the merger appeared to be complementary \u201cin many respects,\u201d given Janus\u2019s position in the Americas and Henderson\u2019s scale. The two companies also had differing asset portfolios, with Janus more heavily invested in American equities and Henderson having more in global and European stocks.Dai-ichi Life, the Japanese insurer that is Janus\u2019s largest shareholder, has agreed to vote in favor of the merger and would hold about 9 percent of the combined company, according to the news release. Dai-ichi Life intends to invest further in the combined company, aiming to increase its ownership interest to at least 15 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aligning Your Investments With What Motivates You", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersAlpha. Beta. Gamma. Phi.The letters could be the name of a college honor society or maybe a fraternity or sorority. But in finance, they represent the progression of thinking about investments and how to judge them. Phi is the newest one.Alpha measures an investment\u2019s performance against a market index. If the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up 10 percent and a mutual fund is up 15 percent, for example, that 5 percentage point difference is alpha.Beta is the return of any given market. And charting beta is what a passive index fund does. Comparing different indexes\u2019 beta \u2014 say domestic equities and international bonds \u2014 helps investors in deciding how to allocate their investments.For individuals, high gamma is generally achieved by seeking advice from a qualified investment professional. But not always. The original Morningstar paper on gamma discussed the need for intelligent decisions across five areas, including tax management and withdrawal strategies.What phi aims to add is a way for investors to quantify how their motivations \u2014 or those of the people managing their money \u2014 will affect long-term investment returns.Suzanne Duncan, global head of State Street\u2019s Center for Applied Research, who led the team that surveyed and studied about 7,000 individuals and investments professionals over 18 months, said their research began by looking at the role incentives play in making investment decisions. But, she said, it quickly shifted to examining what motivated a person to invest \u2014 or not \u2014 in the first place.\u201cWe understood quite quickly and clearly that most individuals and professionals are working with a market-based motive,\u201d said Ms. Duncan, who conducted the study in conjunction with the CFA Institute, which administers the chartered financial analyst designation. \u201cIt can manifest itself in a passion for markets with individual investors. But for most, it\u2019s a fear of markets.\u201dAnd both of these motivations, the study found, can negatively affect long-term returns.To score high on phi, Ms. Duncan said, people need to have a deeper sense of purpose in what they are doing, whatever the job. \u201cIt\u2019s not about outperforming markets or peers, and it\u2019s not an asset-gathering measure of performance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe performance has to be defined as sustainable and with a deeper sense of purpose.\u201dShe noted that in the research, financial services professionals had low phi scores, ranking 12th out of 14 industries. Phi is \u201ca unicorn in our industry,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not a unicorn in other industries.\u201dMs. Duncan cited companies like Whole Foods Market, Southwest Airlines and Disney for instilling a high sense of passion, or phi, in their employees.Qualities that you might think are desirable are not, when it comes to phi. For example, answering that you have a passion for the markets or that you like your job because you work with smart people will not raise your phi score. Both responses seem good at first, but there is the risk that there is no greater purpose in what you are doing.\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting because it talks to a very needed culture shift to our industry,\u201d said Rebecca Fender, head of the future of finance initiative at the CFA Institute. \u201cPhi takes this heretofore very unquantifiable subject and puts some numbers around it so we can have a more meaningful conversation with the industry.\u201dWhile the study found that wealth was not a differentiator for phi scores, there were generational differences. Millennials scored high on the test and, more generally, as people got older, their phi scores increased.When it came to the types of investors who score high on the phi test, Ms. Duncan was careful not to overgeneralize. But she said the research found that people who invested with a socially responsible mind-set scored better. Their dual goal of seeking profit but doing so to achieve some social benefit naturally gives them a purpose beyond returns.But what about those who invest more broadly or do so to maximize their gains? It\u2019s not easy to change them.Individuals seeking to improve their phi have to move their focus beyond competing with their neighbors and looking toward a specific goal. Ms. Duncan said there were three areas where they should focus \u2014 their purpose, habits and incentives.In terms of purpose, individuals need to ask soul-searching questions about what they want their life to be. With investing, the investment goal ranks below the purpose of those investments \u2014 what they might use the money for in the future and not the sheer amount in the portfolio.To stay on the path to that purpose, investors need to change habits that distract from it.\u201cIn the case of individual investors, the cue is this market motive,\u201d Ms. Duncan said. \u201cThey need to replace the market motive with the purpose motive, which is phi.\u201d\u201cThose with high phi will have sustainable performance to a much greater degree,\u201d she added. \u201cThe purpose motive breaks the bad habit\u201d of following the markets.The incentives to get people to shift their purpose and break bad habits, she said, are taken from nudge theory, a term coined by the economist Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, a legal scholar. The idea is to persuade someone to adopt better behavior, like automatically signing people up for retirement plans or getting them to agree to increase their contribution rate to the plans when they get a raise.For investment professionals, Ms. Duncan said, the way to increase phi is to change motivation that is often tied to compensation. The study discusses four ways of doing this, including laying out a compelling vision for the future, challenging investment professionals\u2019 assumptions and discussing their values and beliefs.At its simplest, this could mean changing annual bonuses so they are paid out over several years, with a greater reward if the performance is sustainable.The study showed that changes that increased phi had a meaningful impact on a person\u2019s investment strategy.Every one-point increase in people\u2019s orientation toward investment goals with a purpose \u2014 and the scale is 0 to 3 \u2014 equated to 42 percent greater odds that the investors know what they are paying in fees, 37 percent greater odds that investors are not rejecting their financial adviser, 38 percent greater odds that the people consider investing in socially responsible investments and 79 percent greater odds that investors will trade less frequently, the research found.For investment professionals, that same one-point increase resulted in a 21 percent greater likelihood of excelling at long-term goals and 37 percent greater chance of scoring higher on client satisfaction.\u201cThis is intended to start a thought process of leaders in the industry,\u201d Ms. Fender said. \u201cCulture can\u2019t be changed overnight. It\u2019s essential to reconnect the investment profession with its stated purpose of improving society.\u201dAnd for those seeking an adviser, administering a phi test would surely help. As a group, wealth managers have higher phi than others in financial services. One reason is they are more connected with the people they serve.Advertisement"}

An anonymous woman in Amsterdam, eventually identified as Martine Neddam, built a brightly colored site that purported to be the home page of a 13-year-old named Mouchette, after the girl in the 1967 Robert Bresson film who finds a life of torment and abuse too much to bear.In addition to salvaging the past, the aim is to tell the story of Internet-based art in an online gallery that serves much the same narrative function as the galleries in the Museum of Modern Art. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of amnesia about the history these things have,\u201d Michael Connor, Rhizome\u2019s artistic director, said as he sat in the New Museum\u2019s ground-floor cafe. \u201cThis is an opportunity to really be rigorous.\u201dBroadly speaking, the story Rhizome is telling can be divided into two parts, with the dot-com collapse of 2000-1 as the inflection point. The post-bubble side looks relatively familiar, facilitated as it is by high-speed, always-on connections and characterized by rapid commercialization and the emergence of social media and streaming video platforms like Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005) and Tumblr (2007).But before the bubble in internet stocks burst, before Google took over and Netscape collapsed and Apple was resurrected from near-death, the web was \u201can entirely new world,\u201d as Mr. Arcangel, 38, put it in a telephone interview from his home in Norway. \u201cSometimes it was not even clear what you were looking at \u2014 was it an artwork or a web server that was broken?\u201d Even so, he knew something exciting was happening.Net Art\u2019s political posture was characteristic of the feverish, techno-utopian excitement shared by netheads in general. \u201cThere was this radical idea that the internet was going to change the way art is made and shared,\u201d said Lauren Cornell, who was Rhizome\u2019s executive director from 2005 to 2012 and who has since moved to the New Museum as a curator and associate director of technology initiatives. \u201cThat it might even do away with traditional institutions and gatekeepers\u201d \u2014 that is, museums and curators.Preserving this work is not just a matter of uploading old computer files. \u201cThe files don\u2019t mean anything without the browser,\u201d Mr. Connor, 38, said. \u201cAnd the browser doesn\u2019t mean anything without the computer\u201d it runs on. Yet browsers from 15 or 20 years ago won\u2019t work on today\u2019s computers, and computers from that era are hard to come by and even harder to keep working.Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome\u2019s preservation director, has been working with the University of Freiburg in Germany to develop a sophisticated software framework that emulates outdated computing environments on current machines.\u201cVVEBCAM\u201d was provocative, and it got a strong response. \u201cPeople were really nasty,\u201d she said, \u201cand my policy was always to respond in a way that was equal to or greater than the comments they made.\u201d Rhizome intends to embed the video in a reconstructed YouTube player, but there\u2019s no way to recreate the reaction the video provoked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you were taking screen shots,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.\u201dWhich could be said for Net Art itself. \u201cNet Art is not over,\u201d Mr. Tribe said, \u201cbut it is over as an avant-garde art movement.\u201d In its place is art posted to the internet not by art world renegades but by professionals for whom the internet is one medium among many \u2014 people like Ms. Cortright or Mr. Trecartin, whose deliriously disjointed videos are equally at home on YouTube and at the Saatchi Gallery in London.The term that\u2019s being used is Post-Internet Art \u2014 not \u201cpost\u201d in the sense that the internet is over, but that it\u2019s ubiquitous. In the post-internet era, the internet is simply assumed.\u201cIt\u2019s different, now that everybody\u2019s online,\u201d said Ms. Cortright, 30. \u201cEven 10 years ago, it was not as much a part of people\u2019s lives as it is today.\u201d She considers it \u201cadmirable\u201d that Rhizome has committed itself to preserving artifacts from a past that\u2019s so recent and yet so distant, \u201cOtherwise, they really would be lost.\u201dAnd yet, she added, \u201cyou can\u2019t be too attached to something that\u2019s completely fleeting. I don\u2019t know. It just happens.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Williams Jr., a onetime president of Washington Mutual \u2014 as senior executives.The hires are meant to help the five-year-old firm grow as it competes in the business of buying and selling stock in privately held companies. As a merchant bank, Disruptive Technology Advisers helps companies find buyers for their shares and often invests as well.Among the companies it has worked for, according to news reports, are the data analysis provider Palantir Technologies, the file-sharing giant Dropbox and the genetic testing service 23andMe.

{"Headline": "Tobacco Giant Reynolds American Unlikely to Get a Sweeter Offer", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsJohn Boehner, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, may find that his month-old gig as a board member at Reynolds American does not last as long as he expected. British American Tobacco is offering $47 billion for the 58 percent of the Camel cigarette maker that it does not already own.At an enterprise value of 16 times the last 12 months\u2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, that is a decent price. Mr. Boehner and his colleagues may struggle to smoke out a noticeably better deal.Reynolds American, the second-biggest American tobacco group after Altria, said on Friday that it would consider the cash-and-share offer from its overseas peer, which already owns 42 percent of the company.British American Tobacco\u2019s offer is worth $56.50 a share based on Thursday\u2019s closing prices. That is around a 20 percent premium to where Reynolds\u2019 stock traded before the bid was announced. That is no knockout, but because the two companies have long been considered likely merger partners, some kind of takeover premium may have already been baked into the target\u2019s worth.Viewed through a value lens, British American Tobacco looks more generous. Reynolds paid only about 13 times Ebitda for a smaller rival, Lorillard, in a deal that closed last year. British American Tobacco is offering a higher multiple, and handing the majority independent shareholders of Reynolds a premium worth more than double the roughly $3 billion upfront value of the anticipated $400 million a year in savings \u2014 calculated after tax and on a conservative multiple of 10.That is not the only reason for Reynolds\u2019s independent directors to take British American Tobacco\u2019s opening salvo seriously. The British group\u2019s 42 percent stake means Reynolds can\u2019t count on a credible rival bid emerging. Third-quarter earnings earlier this week were not as good as Wall Street expected. The company also announced a transition at the top, with Debra Crew set to take over from Susan Cameron as chief executive in January. That could further filter Reynolds\u2019s appetite for playing hardball.Longer term, higher American interest rates could take some of the air out of tobacco companies\u2019 rich valuations as their allure as dividend stocks wanes. Mr. Boehner was known in Congress for a propensity to burst into tears, but even if Reynolds cannot squeeze much more out of British American Tobacco, it would not be something to cry over.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want an Old Piece of the Statue of Liberty? This Is the Man to See.", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byFor more than three decades, Rick Stocks has been hoarding a mountain of construction debris \u2014 so much of it that he had to squirrel it all away in three different warehouses in Tennessee and Florida.Only he is no ordinary hoarder, and this is not just any debris. Mr. Stocks is the self-appointed caretaker of tossed-out parts of the Statue of Liberty.He also got the worn, bronze handrails from the staircase inside the statue\u2019s pedestal, and two dozen bronze lamps that once sat at its base.In all, Mr. Stocks took possession of more than 50,000 pounds of discarded materials from the statue, as well as from a historic building on Ellis Island also being renovated at the time. He spent a total of $3 million in order to purchase, haul away and preserve everything. \u201cIt\u2019s a labor of love,\u201d he said. \u201cI never focused on the money side of things.\u201dSome of the iron bars were given to the State Department to be fashioned into gifts for foreign dignitaries. One bar was hand forged into another symbol of liberty: a replica of a key to the Bastille, the infamous French fortress and state prison. Another bar was presented intact, with a sculpted \u201cpeace dove\u201d added, to Pope Francis during his visit to the United States last year.\u201cIt truly is Liberty reaching out and touching people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Mr. Stocks, 57, in a recent phone interview from his home in Franklin, Tenn. \u201cI\u2019m just the caretaker and I\u2019m trying to find a way to keep them for the public good.\u201dNow, in the biggest release of materials yet, copper from the statue is being featured in a new line of jewelry \u2014 the Liberty Copper Collection \u2014 introduced in September by a Rhode Island-based jewelry company, Alex and Ani. More than 10,000 pieces bearing a raised copper flame have been sold so far, according to the company.Mr. Stocks, a genial man who sprinkles historical tidbits about the statue into his conversation, recalled reading about the monument in history books while growing up, in Alabama and Florida. His family had no personal connection. The closest he ever came to the statue, he recalled, was in third grade, when someone made a cardboard prop with the statue painted in the background. He still has a photograph of himself posing beside it.He was working for his father, a real estate developer, in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1982 when he learned of the planned restoration of the Statue of Liberty. Though he had no training or skills in preservation, he wanted to be part of the effort, he said. He called the foundation, which was in charge of the restoration, and asked how much stuff was \u201ccoming off\u201d the monument. A lot, he was told.Mr. Stocks started a company, called Gold Leaf, which also does business as Soleia, or Statue of Liberty Ellis Island Ambassadors, and headed to New York City. He paid $1 million to the foundation for the copper and other debris from the statue and the Liberty Island site. The agreement also included discarded materials from the registry building at Ellis Island: ornamental copper rosettes from the roof, as well as bricks, wood doors and bronze doorknobs.Mr. Stocks said he spent another $2 million transporting, storing and preserving the materials from the two sites. He said he had not yet recovered the costs.Peg Zitko, executive vice president of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, said the materials would have been disposed of because there was simply no room to store them. As part of the agreement with Mr. Stocks, officials with the foundation and the National Park Service must approve any future use of the items.\u201cIt was a kind of construction discard \u2014 some was more meaningful than others \u2014 but nonetheless it had to be hauled away,\u201d she said.Besides, she added, \u201cWhat can you do with all of this?\u201dMr. Stocks has spent years trying to answer that question. Nearly every week, he said, his phone rings with offers from people who have ideas for selling his materials for profit. He said he had rejected hundreds. \u201cOnce you preserve these artifacts, you\u2019re responsible for them,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt the weight of that responsibility. It\u2019s a very important thing to do.\u201dThe Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation received an initial payment from Gold Leaf for use of the copper, but it would not name the amount, citing a confidential agreement with Mr. Stocks. Alex and Ani has pledged to donate a minimum of $100,000 to the foundation in the next year.John Piltzecker, the park service\u2019s superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument and of Ellis Island, said park officials were always concerned about the use of the statue\u2019s materials for commercial purposes, but he believed the new jewelry line \u201cwas executed with a sensitivity and respect for the subject matter that is apparent in its design.\u201d He added, \u201cWe hope that it will inspire and spark countless conversations about what the Statue of Liberty means.\u201dMr. Stocks said he envisions preserving many of his remaining items for a museum display. He wants to use other items to create what he calls \u201cone-of-a-kind art.\u201dAt his request, the Gibson company created a so-called Spirit of America guitar, using wood removed from Ellis Island and copper from the old copper support saddles inside the statue. He commissioned another company, Orange County Choppers, to build a \u201cLiberty Bike,\u201d a copper-plated motorcycle, which is now on display at Liberty Island.Mr. Stocks learned of Carolyn Rafaelian, the owner of Alex and Ani, from a friend in 2013. Ms. Rafaelian\u2019s paternal grandfather, Melkon Rafaelian, had arrived at Ellis Island from Armenia in 1913, settled in Providence, R.I., and started a family. His son, Ms. Rafaelian\u2019s father, Ralph, started a company, Cinerama Jewelry, which became known for its American flag pins.In 2004, Ms. Rafaelian started her own jewelry company, which has grown to 80 stores worldwide. Mr. Stocks contacted Ms. Rafaelian and they were soon sharing their visions for the Statue of Liberty\u2019s copper.Mr. Stocks eventually sold the bulk of the copper in his warehouses to Ms. Rafaelian. Both have declined to give details of their financial arrangement, citing a confidential agreement.\u201cWe connected on a soul level,\u201d Ms. Rafaelian recalled. \u201cI was going to take on his mission with him.\u201dThe new jewelry features a round, sterling-silver medallion with a raised copper flame in the shape of the statue\u2019s torch, accompanied by the words \u201cCarry Light.\u201d A simple cord bracelet costs $38; a diamond necklace, $2,000.Mr. Stocks has bought a bracelet for himself and a ring for his wife, and he plans to load up on presents to give to his two daughters and other relatives.He will also keep some of the jewelry on hand for the next time he gives a talk with his artifacts at a local school. Inevitably, he said, someone asks to keep a piece of the statue.Before, his answer was no, he said. Not anymore.\u201cFinally,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, I can give them something.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New True-Crime Books for Fall", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionNot all true-crime books are created equal. Some explore the criminal mind. Others focus on the lives of the victims. And then there are the ones that look beyond the crime to the historical period and social conditions in which it\u2019s rooted. But one thing can be said for them all: True crime is hardly ever boring.Although by 1868 the formerly quiet town of Indianapolis was becoming \u201ca city of strangers,\u201d nearby Cold Spring was a more inviting place to settle \u2014 except for that blood-soaked patch of ground on the west bank of the White River where the bodies of Jacob and Janey Young were found on the morning of Sept. 13. To an excitable reporter for The Indianapolis Sentinel, it was \u201ca picture of grisly horror seldom seen except upon the battlefield.\u201dJacob and Janey Young had been great friends of Frank and Nancy Clem, who lived in their genteel neighborhood and shared their \u201cexemplary social qualities.\u201d But Jacob and Nancy had something else in common \u2014 a good head for business. As \u201cstreet brokers\u201d working outside an established firm, the friends dealt in stocks, mortgages and promissory notes. And if some of their transactions seemed a bit dicey, they made plenty of money for themselves and their clients. The first ones, anyway, because what the partners were shilling turned out to be an early, if not the earliest, Ponzi scheme.The murder of a business partner doesn\u2019t sound very sexy. But Gamber raises a provocative issue when she studies the era\u2019s disapproving attitude toward any woman who dared to benefit from the commercial opportunities of a postwar world \u2014 especially if that commerce happened to be illegal. At Mrs. Clem\u2019s fifth murder trial, court attorneys were still exchanging fierce arguments over \u201cthe respectability of \u2018working women.\u2019\u2009\u201dTo be sure, Mrs. Clem speculated in dubious investments and openly consorted with cardsharps, forgers and other scam artists. Then again, as Gamber dryly notes, \u201cPerhaps a woman known for eagerly scanning the real estate pages was bored with domestic life.\u201dLowry lays out the basics of the case in a chillingly concise fashion: \u201cGirls. Kids. Bound, gagged. Naked. Stacked. Burned to the bone.\u201d The city of Austin was still a laid-back place in 1991 \u2014 until the sixth day of the last month of the year, when someone assaulted four teenage girls who worked at the I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Yogurt (ICBY) store, shot them and set their bodies on fire. Lowry works the case from a human rather than a forensic angle. She even deals sympathetically with the lead detective, whom the case had rendered \u201cobsessed, single-minded, snarly, socially incapacitated and a total loser as both husband and father,\u201d according to a speech he gave in 2014 at a convention of the Texas Citizens Police Academy.By 2009, when Lowry became interested, there had been years of appeals, reversals and higher-court decisions concerning the four young men who were eventually charged with the crime, and retrials were being lined up. A final suspect was still at large in 2010, when he was shot dead while running away from a routine traffic stop. This is the kind of case a writer takes up in the hope that she might be of some help.The eight victims were killed between 2005 and 2009 by a person or persons unknown \u2014 although the author has come up with a likely suspect. They were all prostitutes and drug addicts, which made them vulnerable and defenseless, expendable in a jurisdiction that\u2019s centrally positioned along the route of the Gulf Coast drug trade. Brown is especially enlightening when it comes to this region of swampland, where the Spanish banished the original Acadians and the land is currently fouled by oil and gas refineries, coal-fueled power plants and petrochemical facilities that \u201crelease high levels of cancer-causing chemicals into the environment, contaminating fish and leaking toxins into groundwater.\u201dBrown gives the victims more respectful attention than they probably got in life, and he believes he has identified their killer in Frankie Richard, \u201ca onetime pimp, strip-club owner, drug dealer, meth addict and muscle for hire.\u201d His contempt for Richard is palpable, but the brunt of his crusader\u2019s fury is aimed at law enforcement: \u201cThere were credible reports of tampered and destroyed evidence, unethical cash deals, an epidemic of sexual assaults in the jail, whistle-blowers pilloried.\u201dSheriff Ricky Edwards is one of the people Brown claims to have the goods on. Elected to office after his predecessor was indicted in a federal investigation into widespread corruption in the parish, he immediately got to work by adopting a predatory practice of traffic stops and searches that resulted in the town being slapped with numerous civil rights lawsuits. More disastrous was his dismantling of the drug-interdiction program that had become the last line of defense against the traffickers. He even got rid of Armin, the department\u2019s drug-sniffing dog. \u201cYou can buy him or we kill him,\u201d he is said to have told the dog\u2019s handler, who paid the sheriff $10,000 to save the German shepherd\u2019s life.Lord Byron presented written testimony that he had seen no sign of lunacy when he served in the wedding party. But in the autumn of 1822, when Byron was out of the country, Portsmouth\u2019s 22-year-old nephew successfully petitioned for the commission. The financial stakes were higher for Mary Ann and her grasping family, since she had given birth to a girl earlier that year and the earl had to be ruled sane in order for the child to be legitimate. Portsmouth, it should not surprise us to learn, was close to tears throughout the proceedings.Just when the machinations of these two rapacious clans begin to make your blood boil, Foyster switches to a straightforward biographical treatment of John Charles, third earl of Portsmouth, who deserves our attention and our sympathies. Compassion, of which he got precious little in his life, is exactly what Portsmouth receives from Foyster. And from Jane Austen\u2019s mother. As a child, he was boarded and tutored in the rectory home of the (as yet unborn) novelist, where he was judged to be simple-minded but teachable, like the Austens\u2019 own son George. To make matters worse, he stuttered badly and was bullied at boarding school, not only for his stammer but for wetting his bed and being such a poor scholar. Needless to say, he never went on to Eton. Foyster is a historian who studies family dynamics, which might explain why she seems so sympathetic to her subject, a grown man, but so very much like a child.Thorpe was besotted with a 19-year-old stableboy named Norman Josiffe, whom he cleaned up and kept in a long-term clandestine relationship that suited him but asked too much of his mentally fragile paramour. At one point, Josiffe made the mistake of sending a blackmail letter to Thorpe\u2019s formidable mother, threatening to expose their relationship. To his credit, Thorpe didn\u2019t immediately hire a hit man to plug the blackmailer, although it did eventually come to that. Thorpe found numerous jobs for his \u201cbunny,\u201d but Josiffe usually skipped out on them, carrying a bundle of incriminating love letters for security. He was, however, briefly happy in a Trappist monastery, which should have told Thorpe something.Preston has written this page-turner like a political thriller, with urgent dialogue, well-staged scenes, escalating tension and plenty of cliffhangers, especially once the trial begins. But no matter how hard he tries to convince us of Thorpe\u2019s \u201cmagnetic personality,\u201d his central character comes off as selfish, arrogant and manipulative, expecting his close friend, Peter Bessell, another Liberal M.P., to clean up after him. Bessell, who seems to be the truly tragic figure in this unsavory affair, is so loyal that he agrees to commit perjury and sets himself up as a possible suspect in the murder plot: \u201cThe only explanation Bessell himself could offer is that he was flattered to be asked. Despite everything, he yearned to feel the warmth of Thorpe\u2019s approval.\u201dStrange as it seems, until the late 19th century, \u201cthe whole system was based on trust.\u201d Ladies and gentlemen were simply not expected to do such things and generally did not. But after the Civil War, when many of the traditional verities seem to have broken down, a certain lassitude crept into the American ethic, allowing the professional con artist to stride upon the stage.The whole point about being a con man (or woman) was the ability to inspire confidence in your victims. That described Nancy Clem in 1868 in Indianapolis, and it describes Austin Biron Bidwell, \u201can international man of mystery\u201d whose many aliases included \u201cFrederick Warren.\u201d His partner, George Macdonnell, was thought to be \u201cone of the most slippery con men in the world.\u201d There were five Bidwell brothers all told, but only George and Joseph joined Austin in practicing the art of the con. When William Pinkerton, son of the legendary detective Allan Pinkerton, came face to face with Austin in Havana, the criminal shared more of his personal history. But, as Pinkerton later discovered, it was mostly a pack of lies. Apparently, a con man is constitutionally unable to tell the truth.The brothers established themselves by working a long firm fraud (selling wholesale goods acquired on credit) in Cincinnati. But the family business didn\u2019t flourish until they moved the operation to Chicago (\u201cthe sort of town where you could not help becoming involved in crime\u201d) and they honed their skills by selling real estate they didn\u2019t own. Although the Bidwells were occasionally caught dead to rights, these scoundrels were adept at eluding justice through bribery, impersonating one another or simply walking off into the sunset \u2014 and eventually to New York, in those days serving as Boss Tweed\u2019s piggy bank.If it makes readers feel better to hear it, Austin Bidwell announced that \u201cwe did not save a dollar of the millions secured from the Bank of England.\u201d As for me, I\u2019m more fascinated by the gang\u2019s meticulously detailed plot to engage in this plunder, and by Austin\u2019s frequently surprising and seemingly out-of-character conduct. In the course of pulling off the heist, Austin was forced to bamboozle a gentleman banker named Col. Peregrine Madgwick Francis. On the stand, Austin took the extraordinary step of apologizing to Colonel Francis for causing him to be ridiculed in court and in the banking world.Once these \u201cdude\u201d thieves, as Pinkerton called them, were put away, Booth notes that the detective became \u201calmost nostalgic for this vanishing breed of gentlemen who were defined by their relative intelligence and sophistication.\u201d I\u2019m with him.Marilyn Stasio writes the Crime column for the Book Review.Advertisement"}

The military\u2019s authority derives from the king, and there is a sense of national anxiety about his condition and what will happen when he dies.All of the king\u2019s children \u2014 the prince and his three sisters \u2014 were reported to have arrived on Wednesday at Siriraj Hospital, where King Bhumibol, one of the world\u2019s longest-reigning monarchs, has been confined for most of the past few years. He last left the hospital in January.The royal palace announced on Sunday that the king, a widely revered figure who suffers from kidney failure and receives hemodialysis to filter his blood, was in unstable condition and that he was breathing with the help of a ventilator.That was reiterated by the palace in a health bulletin issued Wednesday evening, adding that his blood pressure was low, his liver function was abnormal and he appeared to have a blood infection.\u201cThe king is a father of the entire Thai people,\u201d said Suwanna Kaennamtiew, 62, of Bangkok, who came to the hospital to pray for him. \u201cWe are living under his virtue. We love him very much. Nothing can compare to him.\u201dLike many of the king\u2019s supporters, she was wearing pink to promote his well-being.Throughout most of his reign, the king offered moral leadership and promoted economic development. A strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law prohibits defaming, insulting or threatening the king, queen, heir-apparent or regent.Most Thais have known no monarch other than King Bhumibol, who ascended the throne in 1946.Rumors began circulating around noon that he was near death and then flooded social media. The Stock Exchange of Thailand fell 6.9 percent, although it recovered to close down about 2.5 percent. The Thai currency, the baht, fell about 1 percent against the dollar.Srikaew Attasana, 48, a hotel housekeeping manager from Bangkok, was among the crowd at Siriraj Hospital wearing pink and offering prayers.\u201cThai people worship him like a god,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is like a god to me. I always feel grateful to be in his country.\u201dMs. Srikaew said she felt happy to be close to the king, even though she could not see him. \u201cI come here to at least see the building where he lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me.\u201dMs. Suwanna, who was wearing a badge on her shirt that read \u201cLove Father,\u201d said that all she wanted was the king\u2019s recovery. \u201cI wish I could sacrifice my life for his majesty,\u201d she said. \u201cI can endure pain for his majesty. If I could die so he could live, that\u2019s what I would do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Regular Investing Smooths the Market\u2019s Ups and Downs", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byYou may not realize you are doing it, but if you are salting away money every month in a workplace retirement plan, there is a good chance that you are practicing one of the most time-honored methods for long-term investors: dollar-cost averaging.If you are not doing it, dollar-cost averaging is worth considering, because it will keep you invested in markets all of the time. That way you avoid the risky business of guessing when the top or bottom is and save gradually, at a reasonable price.The idea is to keep buying at varying prices. Your average price, using this method, is neither at the highest- nor lowest-possible market price. While dollar-cost averaging is not a perfect strategy, it is a good way to blunt the emotional distress of market volatility and reduce the risk of making bad decisions.When share prices drop, you can buy more of a fund or stock, and vice versa when prices rise. It is a durable middle-of-the-road method to stay invested over the long term.Dollar-cost averaging is compelling because most investors are not good at timing markets to their advantage. In its most recent survey of long-term investor behavior, Dalbar, a financial research company, found that the average stock mutual fund investor trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index by almost 4 percent over the last two decades through 2015.That means despite the market downturn after the British vote to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), the 2013 federal debt ceiling scare and the 2008 meltdown, you still would have been better off just sitting in a stock index fund after the market\u2019s most volatile periods and continuing to buy shares even as stocks plunged.Regular contributors to retirement plans who do not jump in and out of the market are adept, if often unknowing, practitioners of the technique.\u201cMost do dollar-cost averaging throughout their careers,\u201d said Rob Cheney, a certified financial planner in Palo Alto, Calif. \u201cPeople are hesitant to put lump sums to work.\u201dMost people who invest in their 401(k) accounts not only employ dollar-cost averaging but also trade infrequently, avoiding money-losing market-timing moves.In the \u201cBrexit\u201d-related sell-off in July, for example, only 0.4 percent of 401(k) accounts tracked by Aon Hewitt, the human resources consulting firm, shifted money from stock funds to cash or bond funds. That compares with an average of 0.2 percent during nonvolatile periods, according to Rob Austin, Aon Hewitt\u2019s director of retirement research, whose company has been tracking retirement trading for 20 years and monitors more than 1.3 million 401(k) accounts.While trading within a 401(k) is generally a bad idea because traders tend to lose money over time, steady contributions add up.\u201cMost people in 401(k)\u2019s are also making contributions along the way,\u201d Mr. Austin said, and that increases their balances. \u201cWe see a lot less trading over all.\u201dAdvice on dollar-cost averaging becomes complicated when a lump sum, like an inheritance, big bonus or other large cash payment, is being invested.Mr. Cheney, whose clients include Silicon Valley employees who receive stock awards or large bonuses, says dollar-cost averaging a lump sum may not work for everyone.In such a situation, you could benefit from buying shares in one or more timed purchases when the market offers bargain prices. But you must gauge your risk tolerance on making such moves. You could easily guess wrong on the market\u2019s direction, and it is hard to tell if you are getting the best price.That adds another wrinkle, which is why it is important to consider risk tolerance. How much of a loss can you stomach? What is your investment time horizon?\u201cI don\u2019t advise dollar-cost averaging for lump-sum investing such as inheritances,\u201d said Simon Brady, a certified financial planner based in Manhattan.\u201cTaking a significant lump sum and breaking it up into, say, 24 equal chunks and contributing one chunk a month for two years would mean that for much of that time, the majority of the funds would be sitting in some useless savings account, where the temptation will exist to go in and spend it. In any case, you would be holding money that would not be working for you,\u201d Mr. Brady said.\u201cDollar-cost averaging works best for money that comes to you over a period of time. It\u2019s based on the assumption that markets go up over time,\u201d he added.Then there is the potential continuing cost of dollar-cost averaging. If you are buying individual shares of stock or exchange-traded funds, you might be paying a commission on every purchase, which can add up. But most large mutual-fund companies do not charge commissions for direct purchases, particularly for shares of their largest index mutual or exchange-traded funds. This is not a problem in most 401(k) accounts, either.Of course, if shares really are cheap, a big purchase may make sense. Making that decision can be risky, though, and before doing so, you might want some sound advice, perhaps from a chartered financial analyst or certified financial planner.Yet even market professionals are often wrong about the timing of stock market cycles. For most people, dollar-cost averaging is a reliable fallback.Sticking with the strategy may take discipline if stocks start to veer up and down, especially down. If you have sufficient risk tolerance and do not need cash immediately, regular, steady, long-term investing may be just the thing. Patience and consistency reduce the opportunity to make bad decisions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marmite Survives After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Spurs Tesco-Unilever Price Dispute", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the first tangible victim of that decision has emerged and, like the 28-nation bloc itself, it is something that has divided the country for years: Marmite, a sludgy and odd-tasting breakfast spread.But they probably never thought it would come to this.Fears that Marmite and other British classics, like the PG Tips brand of tea, might disappear from store shelves had gripped Britons after reports that the supermarket chain Tesco and the owner of those brands, the British-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever, were locked in a price dispute over who should bear the cost of the weakening pound. Marmite was briefly unavailable in Tesco\u2019s online market, and store supplies dwindled.The pound has fallen drastically against other major currencies since the vote to leave the bloc, and as worries have increased that Britain would opt for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2014 shorthand for a strict break with the European Union \u2014 which could limit its tariff-free access to the region\u2019s single market for goods and services.But after the markets closed on Thursday, Tesco reassured the public that the crisis had been averted. In a statement, Tesco said, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased this situation has been resolved to our satisfaction.\u201dIn reality, consumers will most likely have to dig deeper into their pocketbooks. Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer, said during an earnings call on Thursday that \u201cprices should start to increase to cover the cost of imported goods due to weaker sterling.\u201dStill, the concerns over the beloved consumer goods led to a political uproar.\u201cWho would have thought that the first casualty of a hard Brexit would be the nation\u2019s supplies of Marmite?\u201d asked Pete Wishart, a member of Parliament for the Scottish National Party, which campaigned to remain in the European Union.On Twitter, Britons wryly noted that store shelves were emptied of Marmite jars, and one used jar was put up for sale on eBay for 100,000 pounds, or about $122,000. News bulletins on the BBC led with the possible Marmite shortage.\u201cThis is a concrete case of Brexit affecting people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Pinar Hosafci, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor International. \u201cTalk of Brexit had been more political, financial and a bit abstract\u201d before, she added. \u201cThis touches their lives.\u201dAmong the affected brands is Colman\u2019s Mustard, which, like Marmite, is produced in Britain.Analysts noted that although Marmite and some of the other affected brands were made in Britain, Unilever published its company results in euros, meaning that those products were still affected by a weaker pound. Imported household goods like Dove soap and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream are also under the Unilever umbrella.In 2011, Tesco refused to stock Branston Pickle after another supplier, Premier Foods, tried to pass on cost increases.Analysts have predicted that food prices will start to rise across the board in the coming months as supermarkets struggle to absorb the extra cost of imported goods, which are more expensive when a currency weakens.Stores have already stopped promotions and discounts on their products, Ms. Hosafci said. But \u201cprice increases will start happening in the next four to five months, when they will need to renew their stocks.\u201d\u201cEventually, they\u2019ll need to increase prices,\u201d she added. \u201cOtherwise, their businesses will no longer be profitable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is a \u2018Personal Benefit\u2019 From Insider Trading? Justices Hear Arguments", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Supreme Court justices offered hope to both prosecutors and traders on Wednesday during arguments in the first insider trading case to come before the nation\u2019s high court in two decades.A ruling by the court could clarify one of the most hotly debated issues on Wall Street: what prosecutors must prove to secure insider trading convictions based on confidential tips.In their questioning, the justices grappled with where to draw the line. Even as they appeared sympathetic to the government\u2019s interpretation of the high court\u2019s past insider trading decisions, the justices were wary of radically expanding the government\u2019s power and affording prosecutors too much of a free hand in these cases.The case now before the court, Salman v. United States, No. 15-628, comes from California and centers on the insider trading conviction of Bassam Salman in 2013. According to prosecutors, Mr. Salman placed profitable stock trades based on confidential information leaked by his future brother-in-law, Maher Kara, who had advance knowledge of corporate mergers because of his job in Citigroup\u2019s health care investment banking group.For decades, courts have held that it is not inherently illegal to trade stocks based on material, nonpublic information like a merger or acquisition. For an insider to be guilty of sharing inside information, his leak must breach a duty to keep the information confidential and he must receive a personal benefit in exchange for the leak. By extension, the person who receives the information must generally know of that breach and benefit.The Salman case presents a question that has vexed federal appeals courts and left prosecutors and traders alike seeking clarity: What exactly amounts to a \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d?Prosecutors hope the court will afford them leeway in defining the benefit, arguing that if an insider provides a gift of information, that should count as a benefit. In the Salman case, Maher Kara did not receive any financial benefit, but arguably leaked the information as a gift.Mr. Salman\u2019s lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, argued on Wednesday that the benefit must be more \u201ctangible\u201d \u2014 like cash or something that eventually can be monetized.Several of the justices, citing one of the court\u2019s seminal insider trading decisions from three decades ago, seemed skeptical of her argument and poised to uphold Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction.After all, as Justice Stephen Breyer noted, \u201cto help a close family member is like helping yourself.\u201dYet the court, often skeptical of prosecutors in white-collar crime cases, also questioned the government\u2019s lawyer, Michael Dreeben, about where to draw the line. The justices seemed hesitant to afford prosecutors broad authority to apply the so-called gift test to situations in which the insider and recipient are not family or close friends.Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office secured insider trading convictions against dozens of people in the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund industry, has been an outspoken critic of the Second Circuit ruling. Mr. Bharara, who attended Wednesday\u2019s argument, has argued that the Second Circuit\u2019s decision could create \u201ca potential bonanza for friends and family of rich people with material nonpublic information.\u201dThe Supreme Court denied the Justice Department\u2019s request that it review that ruling, though the justices could indirectly rebuke it in deciding Mr. Salman\u2019s case.In Mr. Salman\u2019s case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco took a different approach. The Ninth Circuit upheld Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction and adopted the view that giving inside information to a family member qualified as a benefit, creating what some legal observers saw as a split that only the Supreme Court could reconcile.That decision directed courts to focus on \u201cwhether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure, such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings.\u201dIn overturning Mr. Newman\u2019s conviction, the Second Circuit seized on that financial element.But when the Ninth Circuit upheld Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction, it focused on another passage in the Dirks decision that allowed liability \u201cwhen an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.\u201dThat excerpt strikes at the heart of Mr. Salman\u2019s case. Maher Kara passed the inside information, arguably as a gift, to his brother, Michael Kara, who in turn shared it with Mr. Salman. The two families were close; Maher Kara was engaged to Mr. Salman\u2019s sister. (While Maher Kara struck a plea deal and was sentenced to three months of home confinement, Mr. Salman was sentenced to three years in prison.)Some of the justices, appearing skeptical of Mr. Salman\u2019s argument, highlighted the passage within the Dirks ruling that references gifts to family members.\u201cYou\u2019re asking us to cut back significantly from something that we said several decades ago,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan told Ms. Shapiro, adding that \u201cthe integrity of the markets are a very important thing for this country. And you\u2019re asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that threatens that integrity.\u201dBut a decision that just upholds Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction \u2014 and reaffirms the Dirks decision with some clarity \u2014 would disappoint some prosecutors who argue that the current unsettled nature of the law has had a chilling effect on cases. The Justice Department\u2019s ideal ruling would uphold the conviction of Mr. Salman and then take the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling further so that the gift rule would not be limited to just family and close friends.Mr. Dreeben mentioned the case of a barber who could slip through the cracks.He also proposed an even looser standard that would allow charges whenever information is shared for a noncorporate purpose and the insider knows that the recipient will place trades based on the leak.The justices appeared to balk at that extension of prosecutorial power.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me that your argument is much more consistent with Dirks than Ms. Shapiro\u2019s,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito told Mr. Dreeben.Justice Alito then proposed a hypothetical: \u201cNow suppose someone, the insider is walking down the street and sees someone who has a really unhappy look on his face and says, I want to do something to make this person\u2019s day. And so he provides the inside information\u201d and allows the recipient to trade.Mr. Dreeben replied that such a case was indeed a violation. Later in the argument, however, as other justices expressed skepticism about the Justice Department\u2019s position, Mr. Dreeben conceded that \u201cif the court feels more comfortable given the facts of this case of reaffirming Dirks and saying that was the law in 1983, it remains the law today, that is completely fine with the government.\u201dDaniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and now a professor at Columbia Law School, predicted that because insider trading law was almost entirely judge-made, rather than set by Congress, the Supreme Court might be reluctant to radically revisit its Dirks ruling from three decades ago. It would be simpler to draw distinctions between cases involving family members and business associates.\u201cIf you were going to be a minimalist, this little bit of family relationship could be elaborated on without wholesale redevelopment,\u201d he said.Although Ms. Shapiro made a similar argument, the remaining eight justices seemed to be unswayed. They also seemed skeptical of her argument that Maher Kara turned over the information to Michael Kara for \u201cthe scant benefit of getting his brother off his back.\u201dJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom Ms. Shapiro was once a law clerk, remarked: \u201cHe\u2019s no longer being pestered. Isn\u2019t that a benefit?\u201dBen Protess reported from Washington, and Matthew Goldstein from New York. Peter J. Henning and Adam Liptak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Corzine Nears Settlement, Ads Berate Wells Fargo, Pound Plunges", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byJon S. Corzine has been through numerous lawsuits in recent years.Since he presided over the brokerage firm MF Global when it collapsed in 2011, Mr. Corzine, 69, has been the target of federal investigations, including one filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the misuse of $1 billion in customer money.In recent weeks, Mr. Corzine and the agency have struck a tentative settlement, which would include $5 million in penalties that he would have to pay out of his own pocket. That figure would be more than what the agency could expect to win at trial if he were found liable, the people briefed on the matter said.Mr. Corzine would also accept a lifetime ban from personally trading other people\u2019s money in the futures industry.A settlement, which has not yet been completed, would avert a trial for Mr. Corzine, a former Democratic senator and New Jersey governor. Had it gone ahead, it was originally scheduled to begin this month.Wells Fargo has heard from disgruntled customers, fired employees and angry lawmakers over the fake accounts scandal.In an interview, Mr. Harber said that on Aug. 24, 2015 he placed orders for about $34.8 million worth of stocks \u201con margin\u201d (which usually requires putting down some money and borrowing the rest from the broker).But given the extreme volatility in the market at the time, Wells Fargo demanded that he pay for the stocks in full, he said.At the end of the day, Mr. Harber said, Wells sold all the shares he had bought that day, resulting in a $5 million loss. He was also charged about $480,000 in broker fees. The bank said in a statement that it was \u201cstrongly defending\u201d against his complaints.Though his case is different from that of the thousands of Wells customers who had illegal bank accounts and unauthorized credit cards issued in their name, it has one crucial similarity.Mr. Harber\u2019s lawsuit is being heard in private arbitration \u2014 Wells forces many of its customers to agree to settle any dispute in arbitration as a condition of doing business with it.The pound is dropping. Fast.A sudden drop like the one it suffered \u2014 down as much as 6 percent at one point \u2014 is often called a flash crash, and is sometimes caused by computer-driven automated trades or a simple misplaced keystroke (a fat-finger error, as it is known on trading floors). In the case of the drop in Asia for the pound, experts said they were hard-pressed to identify a single cause.But over all, they pointed to a general area of unease: Britain\u2019s vote in a referendum in June to leave the European Union, or \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe pound dropped as low as $1.1841 before recovering.Advertisement"}
