{"Headline": "How Three Strong-Performing Funds Pick Stocks", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byMany stock-picking styles have sizzled lately, with growth and value and domestic and international investing all toting up gains. Three of the better-performing mutual funds of recent months found their winners among small- and large-cap growth stocks and Chinese shares.\u201cOur typical company might have only six analysts following it, compared to maybe 50 for Apple,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. The Hood River managers say there is a \u201cresearch gap\u201d that they can fill, thanks to their 20 years of work with small caps.The three met in the 1990s while working at what was then Columbia Management in Portland, Ore. In the early 2000s, Mr. Smoluch and Mr. Marvin created a predecessor to their fund at Roxbury Capital Management. A few years later, they recruited Mr. Swank, and, in 2013, the three started Hood River Capital Management, also in Portland.As stock pickers, they\u2019re generalists, surveying all parts of the market. They will scoop up several companies in a field if they see growing companies benefiting from a broader trend. They have done that in fiber optics, with holdings like Oclaro, Fabrinet and Finisar, all recent double-digit gainers.\u201cFor a while, there was a huge overcapacity of components for fiber networks,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve had a major industry consolidation combined with accelerating demand,\u201d as networks upgrade to meet the bandwidth needs of smartphones, cloud computing and video streaming.In researching a promising company, they talk with its competitors, customers and suppliers. They estimate they make about 1,000 calls a year. Talks with pharmaceutical and biotech executives led them to a holding in PRA Health Sciences.\u201cIt\u2019s a contract research organization that manages clinical trials,\u201d Mr. Swank said. \u201cBased on our conversations, we believe it\u2019s gaining market share, and the entire industry is being helped along by the high level of biotech financing that happened in 2015.\u201dThe institutional shares of the Hood River fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 15.01 percent in the third quarter, compared with 3.85 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Baker builds his portfolio around themes that he sees shaping technology and the economy, like the emergence of artificial intelligence, and seeks stocks with strategies that will play out over three to seven years. Market attention tends to be short-term, creating opportunities for people who can be more patient, he said.He has long held Amazon shares, for example, even as other investors have said they are overvalued, based on the price-earnings ratio.\u201cAmazon has gone, over the last 15 years, from $5 to $840,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019d think people would wear down and realize that looking at it on current-period earnings isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.\u201d\u201cMore than a million people die every year driving,\u201d he said. \u201cSelf-driving cars will never drive drunk or high or distracted. They won\u2019t be texting and driving.\u201dArtificial intelligence favors the biggest tech companies, he said, because it demands lots of data and cheap, powerful computing, both of which they have in abundance.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009, and over the last five years, it has been one of the top performers among large-cap growth funds, returning an annualized average of 18.53 percent. In the third quarter, it returned 11.89 percent. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.91 percent.The fund holds only 36 stocks, a deliberately focused selection, he said. \u201cYou have to choose between the last two to get down to the one you really like,\u201d he said.For several years, worrisome economic news has streamed from China \u2014 reports of a slowing economy, overheated real estate markets and banks fat with problem loans. Mr. Mattock said such macro scares have buffeted China portfolios, on and off, for the roughly 15 years he has been investing in the country.But the \u201cobsession with macro,\u201d he said, has overshadowed a continued maturation of Chinese companies that offers opportunities for committed investors. \u201cWe have a lot of the big industry leaders in the portfolio, and these macro stories meant I could pick them up at a very good price,\u201d he said.In insurance, for example, the fund owns Ping An and China Life, two of the country\u2019s biggest insurers. In e-commerce, it holds Alibaba and Vipshop Holdings. Alibaba and Vipshop are leading e-commerce companies.The Matthews fund, with an expense ratio of 1.14 percent, returned 14.95 percent in the third quarter.An article in the special Mutual Fund Quarterly section last Sunday about the strongest-performing mutual funds misstated the expense ratio for the institutional shares of the Hood River Small-Cap Growth Fund. It was 1.09 percent, a net figure that accounts for fee waivers and expense reimbursements by the fund company, not 1.49 percent, which is the gross expense ratio.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap Is Said to Pick Bankers for an I.P.O.", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The newest generation of technology darlings has signaled that it is about to come of age: Snapchat, the messaging service beloved by teenagers, is preparing to step out into the public markets.The company \u2014 born only five years ago \u2014 may end up ushering in a wave of huge tech initial public offerings at a time when Wall Street has seen few such big deals.Snapchat\u2019s parent, recently renamed Snap Inc., has hired the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, essentially firing a starting gun for a potential stock sale as soon as the first quarter of next year, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.Should Snap follow through on its plans, it would be the most prominent debut by the latest batch of \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 those private companies valued at more than $1 billion. Its class also includes Uber, the enormous ride-hailing service, and Airbnb, the home-rental start-up.Many of those companies are already awash in cash they have raised privately from mutual funds, venture capital firms and hedge funds, money that once needed to be raised on the public stock markets. But an initial offering would represent a new level of status and legitimacy, placing them on the same level as Google and Facebook.A wave of unicorns hitting the public markets would help end what has been one of the bleakest times for tech initial offerings \u2014 and I.P.O.s in general \u2014 in some time. No tech companies went public in the first three months of this year, a drought that had happened only three times since the early 1990s.Over all, just 84 companies have gone public so far this year in the United States, according to data from Renaissance Capital, down nearly 42 percent from last year.Among the problems that had bedeviled the market for new stocks was the ease with which tech companies like Uber have found cash from private investors, removing the need to go public anytime soon. The venture-backed companies that have gone public over the last 12 months have largely been smaller, lesser-known names like the communications service Twilio or the business software maker Atlassian.And public market investors like mutual funds have pushed back against the prices that start-ups have demanded, often leading to fewer of the sky-high stock debuts that Twitter and others enjoyed.But as the markets have stabilized, start-ups and their backers have again resumed discussions about splashy market debuts.\u201cIn the last three months, a number of companies have started saying that it\u2019s not all bad to be public,\u201d Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a mature company with more than $50 million in revenue, an I.P.O. is very much on your mind now.\u201dThe prospect of a huge offering has had banks racing to seize a piece of it for some time. Beyond Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, Snap has also engaged a bevy of other banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Company, Barclays and Credit Suisse \u2014 to help manage its stock sale, one of the people briefed on the matter added.At the heart of the frenzy is Snap, born in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011. The company is known for its mobile storytelling and messaging app, which lets users watch videos and send photos and messages to friends. The company also makes sunglasses called Spectacles that are equipped with a video camera.Currently, Snap would be able to file its public offering documents confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission because the company now generates less than $1 billion in annual revenue.The company may ultimately decide not to file for an offering. Yet Snap may be in a better position to go public before some other highly valued private companies because it has comparatively few regulatory concerns that would be listed as risk factors in a prospectus.Uber and Airbnb, for example, are fighting legal battles in numerous cities around the country and the world. Even though all of these battles will most likely be resolved, a long list of outstanding litigation and regulatory uncertainties could create an additional hurdle for investors.And unlike those two companies, Snap isn\u2019t based in Silicon Valley itself but in Venice, Calif., spearheading a nascent tech community in the Los Angeles area.Snap\u2019s app Snapchat was an early hit with young users who liked the fact that their messages and photos disappeared. The company was criticized for making it easier to send inappropriate photos with fewer consequences. Yet the ephemeral nature of the platform also made it seem like a more authentic way of communicating. Snapchat was an online facsimile of a casual conversation while platforms like Facebook and Instagram were the equivalent of a permanent record.Snap eventually added in tools that let users tell stories about their days and augment their selfies with stickers and masks, which the company calls filters and lenses. It also introduced channels for professionally created content from media companies like CNN and Cosmopolitan magazine.As users continued to flock to the app, a year ago Snap began to monetize its growing audience by allowing advertisers to sponsor filters and lenses and run video ads between stories produced by media companies or made up of user photos and videos.Advertisers have been keen to reach the Snapchat app\u2019s audience, which now includes 41 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 and 150 million daily users. At the moment, Snapchat is the trendiest, newest thing and advertisers want to be associated with it, Chad Stoller, executive vice president and global innovation director of IPG Mediabrands, said in an earlier interview.Snap has continued to build out content on Snapchat, the app has increasingly drawn comparisons to traditional television and is seen as an internet company that could someday draw ad dollars away from TV.This year, Snapchat is expected to generate nearly $367 million in ad revenue worldwide, according to data from the research firm eMarketer; and that figure is expected to rise to nearly $1 billion next year.For now, nearly all of Snapchat\u2019s revenue comes from the United States, according to eMarketer, but other markets should account for about a quarter of Snap\u2019s revenue by 2018.Yet for all of the service\u2019s phenomenal growth, Snapchat\u2019s parent must still demonstrate to potentially skittish stock market investors that it has a path to profitability if its offering is to soar, analysts say.\u201cInvestors aren\u2019t willing to buy growth at all costs,\u201d Kathleen Smith, a co-founder of Renaissance Capital, said.Advertisement"}

Bankers Also Helped Bring Alibaba to Market", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As Snapchat\u2019s parent company prepares to go public, it has turned to some familiar faces to help shepherd it through the process.In picking Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as the lead banks for an initial public offering of stock, the social media company Snap Inc. has hired two of the banks that worked on the $25 billion stock market debut of the Chinese company the Alibaba Group, the biggest I.P.O. on record.They will be working hand in hand with Imran Khan, who was Credit Suisse\u2019s top internet investment banker and is now the chief strategy officer of Snap.That is not to say that other companies like Goldman or JPMorgan Chase played only small roles in the Alibaba offering. But teams from Credit Suisse, co-led by Mr. Khan, and Morgan Stanley worked for Alibaba well before it became an e-commerce colossus with enormous valuations in the private markets.Morgan Stanley\u2019s selection as the overall lead bank for Snap\u2019s initial offering \u2014 giving it the title \u201clead-left\u201d underwriter because of where its name would appear on an offering\u2019s prospectus \u2014 was perhaps telegraphed when Snap hired it to put together a line of credit last month. Such a move is often regarded as a precursor to a public offering, with banks often clamoring to lead those debt offerings to gain a spot on the more prominent initial public offering.There are other reasons to turn to Morgan Stanley. The firm was the top underwriter on initial public offerings worldwide for the first nine months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters.Goldman usually duels Morgan Stanley to win the prestige of leading tech I.P.O.s in the United States.

{"Headline": "Snooping in the Bathroom to Assess Credit Risk in China", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byKUNSHAN, China \u2014 Banks and other lenders typically look at borrowers\u2019 credit histories, tax forms and other financial information to determine whether they will get paid back. In China, lenders also look at their bathrooms.Lenders have to be creative. As the economy slows, the government wants to nurture a credit culture to get Chinese families spending instead of saving.But judging creditworthiness is tricky in a country where cash reigns, fraud is rife and even the most basic details can be difficult to verify. Despite China\u2019s size and wealth, most people have never taken out a mortgage or used a credit card, so lenders often have little reliable information about potential borrowers.To fill the gaps, one upstart lender, China Rapid Finance, supplements data analysis with on-the-ground spade work. The company\u2019s investigators, in more than 90 cities, check for the number of toothbrushes or towels to determine how many people are living in a house. They look for dirty dishes in the kitchen. They take photos of a potential borrower at work to confirm employment status.\u201cThis is probably the largest untapped consumer finance market globally,\u201d said the founder and chief executive of China Rapid Finance, Zane Wang, who spent years as the head of analytics at the credit arm of Sears, the American retailer.Getting credit right is crucial to China\u2019s economic plans. The government is trying to bolster consumer spending to help offset the sharp decline in the smokestack industries that previously helped power the country\u2019s ascent. China will need to increase the use of credit to make it easier to spend, while at the same time avoiding the pitfalls that come with too much debt.Shifting generational dynamics will play a big role, as China\u2019s millennials are much more likely to use credit than their scrimping and saving parents. But lenders will also need to put the right products in their hands.While the country\u2019s wealth has swelled, the financial system has not kept pace.China\u2019s banks have a modest consumer lending business. But they typically favor making loans to big state-owned companies.They are trying to attract the next generation of spenders like Mao Yiting, a researcher at the local antiquities bureau in the coastal city of Haining.Ms. Mao, 27, has never had a credit card or taken out a loan. But she regularly borrows small amounts of just over $90 from Huabei, a consumer lending business started by the Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial. She uses the money to pay for online purchases like books, dog food, or ingredients for the dessert recipes she likes to cook.\u201cI always pay the debt on Huabei on time,\u201d said Ms. Mao, who repays the money in installments. \u201cIt\u2019s more convenient than the credit cards issued by banks.\u201dBut online lending in China still has a Wild West aspect \u2014 for both the lender and the borrower.After that, regulators have stepped up their oversight of online lenders, including setting caps on the amounts that can be borrowed. The regulators\u2019 tightening grip is \u201csomething like a shepherd gradually herding his sheep into an increasingly narrowing pen or chute,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the founder and managing director at Marbridge Consulting, based in Beijing.The lenders themselves are entering a financial black hole, with little to no credit history on potential borrowers.In the United States, the Big Three credit bureaus \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 compile borrowing and repayment records to create so-called FICO scores. Financial institutions rely heavily on those scores to make lending decisions.China lacks a direct equivalent. The central bank\u2019s main database includes personal credit history data on less than a third of the country\u2019s population.\u201cCompared with the broad consumer base, there is still lots of room to go,\u201d said Paul Wang, a co-founder and the chief executive of Happyfi.com, a Shanghai start-up that guides online lenders on risk management.Without a more complete depository of information, the industry is finding new ways to build those histories.WeLab, an online lender, uses data collected on mobile phones, with the permission of users, to automatically process hundreds of details about potential borrowers\u2019 habits, online and offline. When deciding whether to lend money, it becomes granular, like the time of a day a loan application is submitted. Those filed from 1 and 6 a.m. have a higher correlation with repayment default, according to Simon Loong, the founder and chief executive of WeLab.\u201cGetting efficient access to cheap lending is still a fundamental way of how people improve their quality of life,\u201d said Mr. Loong, a banking veteran whose start-up has backing from Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, and Sequoia, the Silicon Valley investor.China Rapid Finance draws on transaction data and other records from dozens of internet companies, including Baidu and Tencent. The company feeds this raw data into its own algorithms to identify potential customers.Based on that information, the company first gives out small, preapproved loans to build a credit history. China Rapid recently teamed up with Tencent\u2019s QQ messaging platform to offer loans of $75.After a borrower repays several loans, the company then hands out bigger amounts. At that point, the company\u2019s investigators step into the mix to vet borrowers further.One applicant, the company said, wanted to borrow 100,000 renminbi for 18 months at an annual interest rate of 2.89 percent. The applicant, a 28-year-old single man from Changchun, wanted the money to renovate his home.It did not pass muster. On inspection, the company found that the applicant had stayed at what he claimed was his residence for only three days. His stated employer had no record of him.\u201dWe need to have a mechanism to check and verify,\u201d said Mr. Wang of China Rapid Finance. \u201cWe have to start somewhere.\u201dKaroline Kan contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

This Year", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byThe latest company to offer American investors a piece of China\u2019s internet boom has risen with the help of thousands of couriers on electric carts who speed garments, lipsticks and electronic devices to customers\u2019 homes.The company, ZTO Express, is one of a host of delivery companies that have emerged in China to ferry packages from merchant to consumer, to propel the country\u2019s vast e-commerce revolution. China is now the world\u2019s largest delivery market; nearly 21 billion packages were sent last year, roughly 70 percent originating from online transactions, according to the market research firm iResearch.That concept enabled ZTO to raise a greater-than-expected $1.4 billion in an initial public offering of stock on Thursday, the largest I.P.O. in the United States this year, according to Dealogic, a deal information provider. But by the close of trading in New York, its shares on the New York Stock Exchange had tumbled 15 percent, to $16.57, a concerning signal for new listings, which have been challenged this year.ZTO is one of four Chinese delivery companies that ferry a bit more than half of all packages in China. The companies, known as the Tongda Operators, share similar names, business models and origins, and all of the founders hail from Tonglu County, about 50 miles south of Alibaba\u2019s headquarters in Hangzhou, in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Proximity to Alibaba has been a boon for business; Alibaba\u2019s online shops accounted for about 77 percent of ZTO\u2019s business in 2015, according to the company\u2019s I.P.O. prospectus.\u201cTo Xinjiang, Beijing, anywhere in China, all the Tongda Operators are about the same price,\u201d said Liu Song, who runs the Sweet Lisa Flagship Store, which sells women\u2019s apparel on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall online shopping platform. From China\u2019s southern city of Guangzhou, Mr. Liu ships about 3,000 dresses, blouses and skirts each month, for roughly 53 cents a parcel. In 2011, he paid $1.20 a parcel to ship to Beijing.\u201cEvery year the price is going down,\u201d Mr. Liu said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can go down any more.\u201dThough ZTO depends heavily on the legions of delivery people who zip around Chinese cities delivering makeup, clothes and gadgets, it doesn\u2019t employ them. The Tongda Operators run only the sorting and long-haul transportation network, leaving last-mile delivery \u2014 traditionally the most costly link in the chain \u2014 to partners who ferry packages from hubs to homes.That has helped ZTO maintain profit margins as prices charged to customers decline. ZTO earned a net income of $115 million on revenue of $639 million in the first six months of this year.\u201cAs the market cost leader, we are not afraid of a price war,\u201d said James Guo, ZTO\u2019s chief financial officer, while also noting that the decline in parcel weight and the introduction of digital waybills explained some of the falling prices. \u201cIn the case of the price war, we can actually benefit from that and gain market share.\u201dAlmost anyone can open a delivery outlet by paying a fee and signing a contract with ZTO or one of its partners. Then come logos, three-wheeled carts and delivery personnel to start carrying packages. These partners set the prices charged to senders and are the ones being squeezed by a price war.Though the Tongda Operators are the biggest, China\u2019s delivery market is fragmented and cutthroat. It has an estimated 8,000 companies, according to 2015 figures from the China E-Commerce Research Center. No single courier holds more than 15 percent market share by volume, according to iResearch. Deutsche Post DHL pulled out of the domestic delivery market entirely in 2011; FedEx and UPS have a tiny share.ZTO\u2019s business model is particular to China, with its densely populated cities and its online shopping boom. It is a business model probably unsuited for many other countries, so the bet for investors is on growth in China\u2019s e-commerce market and eventual consolidation in the delivery space.An American initial public offering like ZTO\u2019s is unusual among China\u2019s express delivery companies. ZTO\u2019s immediate peers \u2014 YTO Express, STO Express and Yunda Express, as well as the premium competitor SF Express \u2014 are going public in mainland China using what are called reverse mergers, in which the company pours its operations into an existing company that has publicly traded shares.ZTO said on Thursday that it would sell more than 72 million shares at $19.50 each, though it said its underwriters had a 30-day option to buy an additional 10.8 million. The offering was led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, China Renaissance, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and J. P. Morgan.Leslie Picker contributed reporting, and Amie Tsang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo Says Traffic Rose Despite Hacking That Could Alter Verizon Deal", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 If Verizon Communications really wants to renegotiate its $4.8 billion deal to buy Yahoo\u2019s internet operations, it\u2019s probably going to have a fight on its hands.Yahoo\u2019s overall business in the quarter exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations, and the stock rose more than 1 percent in after-hours trading. The company\u2019s third-quarter revenue fell 15 percent compared with the previous year, after adjusting for an accounting change. But its profits rose as management cut capital spending and eliminated 300 jobs over the last three months.Citing the pending Verizon deal, Yahoo did not hold its customary conference call with investors to discuss the results. That left many questions unanswered \u2014 particularly, what Yahoo has learned from its investigation into the data breach.Avivah Litan, a security analyst at the Gartner research firm, said it was entirely credible that Yahoo\u2019s traffic rose after news of the breach.\u201cIt raises consumer awareness of the brand,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople remember they have accounts there.\u201dIn 2007, sales at TJX, the parent company of the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls retail chains, rose after the company disclosed that millions of customer credit card numbers had been stolen, Ms. Litan noted. \u201cI\u2019ve watched breaches for years, and they don\u2019t have an impact,\u201d she said.ComScore, which tracks traffic across many websites, said its data showed a slight drop in the number of American visitors to Yahoo\u2019s desktop and mobile sites in September compared with August. But Andrew Lipsman, vice president of marketing and insights at the data firm, said that the drop was well within the normal fluctuation of Yahoo\u2019s traffic.Yahoo said its business remained on track as it works to close the Verizon deal. But the performance of its internet operations matters much less to investors than getting the deal done.Most of the value of Yahoo\u2019s shares is from its vast holdings of stock in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and in Yahoo Japan. Before it can monetize those investments, it needs to separate out its internet operations.Douglas Melsheimer, who heads the North American mergers and acquisitions practice at Bulger Partners, a tech advisory firm based in Boston, said that regardless of the impact on traffic, Verizon was likely to push for a lower price for Yahoo because of the specter of legal liability for the data breach.\u201cVerizon has leverage in this situation, and they can use that to drive down the price,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think ultimately the price does come down.\u201dAdvertisement"}

F.B.I. officials have confirmed that the Yahoo breach has the hallmarks of a state-sponsored attack, but they also say it is too early to say which country was behind it, according to two people who with knowledge of the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In a statement on Thursday, Yahoo said, \u201cWe are confident in Yahoo\u2019s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.\u201d The transaction is expected to close by early next year.On Monday, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, Lowell McAdam, said at a conference that the Yahoo deal made sense but that his company was still trying to assess the financial effect of the hack.Yahoo has been vague about the timeline of the hacking, but has maintained that it learned of a potential breach after the Verizon agreement was struck in July.The company\u2019s reputation has suffered online in the last few months, according to an analysis by Spredfast, a marketing firm that helps businesses analyze what people are saying about them on social networks. About 90 percent of the Twitter comments about Yahoo were negative in October, Spredfast said, up from 68 percent in August, before news of the hack.Yahoo\u2019s stock dropped nearly 2 percent on Thursday after Reuters published the first report about Mr. Silliman\u2019s comments.Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said investors were not concerned about a small price reduction. The real worry is that if Verizon walks away from the deal, it will delay the process of selling Yahoo\u2019s large stakes in two Asian tech companies, Yahoo Japan and Alibaba, which are worth far more than the portion of the company being sold to Verizon.\u201cThere are some serious questions about whether Yahoo\u2019s customers will continue to use the service knowing that their data has been compromised,\u201d said Jacob Olcott, vice president of BitSight Technologies, a security company. \u201cThat is likely to be the biggest question Verizon is trying to determine here. They acquired Yahoo, in part, because of its large customer base.\u201dThe S.E.C. guidance also notes that the costs of remediation \u2014 which include increased security spending and the costs of customer notification and litigation \u2014 can have a material effect. A report by the Ponemon Institute in July found that the cost to remediate a data breach was $221 per stolen record.All tallied, that would top Verizon\u2019s $4.8 billion purchase price.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

Its founder, Adam Dell, says consumers need an \u201cunbiased advocate helping them.\u201dJust two years ago, Alibaba\u2019s whopping $25 billion debut made the potential of e-commerce in China clear.It is the largest Chinese initial public offering in the United States since Alibaba went public and the biggest United States I.P.O. this year, a time when the market for new offerings has been muted. But the company, which is betting on continued growth in Chinese e-commerce, faces stiff competition in what is already a cutthroat sector. Several rivals are going public in mainland China.It is not certain that prices will drop though. Auvi-Q was more expensive than the EpiPen when it was on the market and the price still has not been decided. Mylan even cited its debut in 2013 as a reason for raising its own prices. And Kal\u00e9o has also been under scrutiny over its prices.How? With the help of a vast amount of consumer data. The companies think that all of their data will finally bring about so-called addressable TV advertising.This already happens on streaming services to some extent, but advertisers are hoping to push further on television, so that people see ads based on their individual interests as they do on the internet.Could AT&T and Time Warner drive that progress? Some certainly see advertising becoming more efficient.
