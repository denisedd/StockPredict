{"Headline": "Why a Media Merger That Should Go Through Might Not", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseOpponents of the proposed AT&T purchase of Time Warner don\u2019t want to just block the $85.4 billion deal: They want to overturn decades of antitrust policy and case law.Until recently, that would have been all but unthinkable. But in today\u2019s superheated and politically charged environment, they may just succeed.Politicians were piling on this week to criticize the deal, including Donald J. Trump; Tim Kaine, the Democratic nominee for vice president; and Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Al Franken of Minnesota. Still to be heard from is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a prominent foe of corporate consolidation.A younger generation of antitrust scholars who are rethinking the nation\u2019s fundamental approach to antitrust law may prove even more influential.In vertical mergers, a company buys a supplier; in horizontal mergers, direct competitors combine.But the new generation harks back to the original trustbusters of the early 20th century, who were most concerned about preventing corporations from gaining too much power.\u201cThe antitrust system as it stands is focused on prices to consumers, innovation and efficiencies,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cThat reflects the triumph of the University of Chicago school of economics. But there\u2019s an older tradition, embodied by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, that says a concentration of too much power in too few hands is bad for democracy and bad for consumers.\u201dScott Hemphill, an antitrust and intellectual property professor at New York University School of Law, agreed. \u201cVertical deals rarely get prohibited outright,\u201d he said. \u201cModern antitrust case law has pretty much kept politics out of the analysis.\u201d\u201cBut is antitrust law only about economics, or does enhanced political power play a role?\u201d Mr. Hemphill asked. \u201cWould a combined AT&T and Time Warner put too much power in one company? That\u2019s the big question.\u201dIt\u2019s a question AT&T says it is prepared to answer. \u201cIf someone is looking for a test case to overturn the time-honored judicial precedents of vertical mergers, this is not the case,\u201d David R. McAtee II, AT&T\u2019s general counsel, told me this week. \u201cWhat we have here is a classic vertical merger that will benefit consumers in an environment that\u2019s begging for innovation.\u201dGiven antitrust precedents, it\u2019s no wonder AT&T and Time Warner would expect regulatory approval, even if they have to accept some conditions imposed by the government. Time Warner is so confident the deal will be approved that it negotiated a paltry breakup fee (by megamerger standards) in the event it\u2019s blocked: just $500 million.At nearly every opportunity, Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, and other architects of the deal have repeated the \u201cvertical\u201d mantra. As Mr. Stephenson told me this weekend, \u201cThis is strictly a vertical merger. We\u2019re combining with one of our big suppliers. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a vertical merger denied by the regulators. They won\u2019t give us a free pass, but we expect that if they have concerns, they\u2019ll impose conditions to address them.\u201dMr. Stephenson is right about that. Time Warner is just one of many content suppliers to AT&T, albeit an important one. Time Warner competes vigorously with other film and television studios, cable networks, and producers of news and entertainment.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.AT&T competes in cable delivery systems, satellite and wireless. While more concentrated than news and entertainment (there are just four major wireless carriers), they are still competitive markets.This isn\u2019t a \u201chorizontal\u201d American Airlines-US Airways merger (which inexplicably passed antitrust review) or even the earlier 21st Century Fox bid, which Time Warner rebuffed in part because of antitrust concerns.Since neither firm competes with the other one, merging the two would have little or no effect on market concentration. And the deal\u2019s architects are promising a bevy of virtues for consumers, from more wireless video access to lower prices.Case closed?Thanks in large part to groundbreaking books in the 1970s by the Supreme Court nominee and Yale Law School antitrust scholar Robert Bork (\u201cThe Antitrust Paradox\u201d) and Richard Posner (now an influential judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals) at the University of Chicago Law School (\u201cAntitrust Law\u201d), vertical mergers came to be viewed as usually promoting competition and, by extension, consumer welfare.The view was embraced by the Supreme Court and embedded in the Justice Department\u2019s vertical merger guidelines during the Reagan administration.The proposed Comcast-NBC Universal deal set off an avalanche of criticism from rival media companies and consumer advocates who argued that it consolidated too much power in one company. In 2011 the Justice Department sued to block the deal on grounds it had the potential to disadvantage competitors that delivered video services, such as satellite broadcasters and telecom companies, and emerging online video providers like Netflix.In an opinion that has no doubt been closely scrutinized by AT&T\u2019s antitrust lawyers at Arnold & Porter, a federal judge ruled that the conditions Comcast accepted to ease the regulator\u2019s concerns \u201cwill provide a prompt, certain and effective remedy for consumers by diminishing Comcast\u2019s ability\u201d to \u201charm competition.\u201dWhether that has indeed been the case will no doubt be the subject of intense scrutiny by regulators. \u201cIt\u2019s important to assess how well the NBC consent decree has done,\u201d Mr. Hemphill said. \u201cOn the face of things, online video seems to be thriving. But has Comcast engaged in troubling behavior as a result of owning NBCUniversal? That\u2019s an important question for thinking about this deal.\u201dSusan P. Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School and author of \u201cCaptive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age,\u201d was an influential voice in encouraging regulators to oppose the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. She predicted the same fate for AT&T-Time Warner.\u201cI think this is unlikely to be approved,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were very few public benefits to the Comcast/NBCU deal, which should not have gone through. It\u2019s difficult even to identify a public benefit for this one.\u201dMr. McAtee of AT&T said it would \u201cbe fundamentally inconsistent and unfair\u201d for the government to reject AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner after it approved the Comcast NBC Universal merger.\u201cWe feel we have an even stronger case,\u201d he added. \u201cComcast was a dominant, entrenched cable and broadband provider, and NBC Universal had big broadcast licenses in an ecosystem where over-the-top video was still in its infancy. Yet the government approved the deal with conditions. On all counts, we have a stronger case for approval.\u201dAT&T and Time Warner executives will have many months to make their argument to consumers, Congress, regulators and the White House. But there\u2019s a risk they will find themselves in the midst of a revolution in antitrust thinking that transcends any one case.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that both presidential candidates have said they\u2019d take a close look at this,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cSo one of the first tests for the new president will be where they come down on this: Will it be Louis Brandeis or the University of Chicago?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emerging Climate Accord Could Push A/C Out of Sweltering India\u2019s Reach", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported by\u201cYou wake up totally fresh,\u201d exulted Kaushilya Devi, a housewife, whose husband bought a unit in May. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we are middle class,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are closer.\u201dBut 3,700 miles away, in Kigali, Rwanda, negotiators from more than 170 countries gathered this week to complete an accord that would phase out the use of heat-trapping hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, worldwide, and with them the cheapest air-conditioners that are just coming within reach of people like Ms. Devi. Millions of Indians might mark the transition from poverty with the purchase of their first air-conditioner, but as those purchases ease suffering in one of the planet\u2019s hottest countries, they are contributing profoundly to the heating of the planet.But the deal, which could be completed this weekend, could have as much or more of an effect on climate change. Unlike the Paris accord, the emerging Kigali agreement will have the force of international law, a legal requirement that rich countries give poor countries money to help them comply, and trade and economic sanctions against countries that do not.But there is no guarantee that Mr. Modi will give Mr. Obama the deal he wants. The president\u2019s rapid timeline pits the planet\u2019s richer, cooler countries against poorer, hotter ones. And among the latter, none has more at stake than India, whose strong economic growth means tens of millions of families will soon be able to afford air-conditioning.\u201cBoth Obama and Modi understand that we\u2019re going to have to have a viable answer to the typical business owner and consumer as to why this is not going to come on the backs of increased costs and burdens for them,\u201d said Brian Deese, Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change adviser.\u201cIt is me of 10 years ago. It is many of my younger colleagues,\u201d Mr. Mathur said. \u201cIt is my driver, who after 20 years working for me bought his first air-conditioner. It is a marker of social mobility.\u201dBut a new global deal committing the world to a rapid phaseout of HFCs, Mr. Mathur said, would mean that many Indians would never \u201cbe able to get the benefits that go with air-conditioning.\u201dA fast phaseout comes with big wins for the United States, since many of the replacement chemicals are manufactured by American chemical companies like Dow and Honeywell. But those manufacturers concede that their products are more expensive than HFCs.\u201cThe replacements are more flammable and toxic,\u201d said Stephen Yurek, the president of the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, an advocacy organization. \u201cSo there is a need to make sure the equipment is better designed and maintained, a need to make sure that when it is installed, it is done correctly and safely. You need better-trained people to do all that, and that will be more expensive.\u201dAt this week\u2019s talks, developed countries led by the United States have proposed to require developing countries to freeze HFC production and use by 2021, phasing down to about 15 percent of 2012 levels by 2046.Developing nations in the hottest corners of the world, led by India, say that making the transition so quickly would be too costly. The Indian proposal would delay developing countries\u2019 freeze of HFC use until 2031. By 2050, it would phase down to about 15 percent of 2029 levels. That would probably still leave a much higher level of HFCs in the atmosphere, since the 2029 HFC levels are expected to be much higher than those in 2012.But a compromise solution is not just a matter of meeting in the middle. Experts say that it is crucial to ban HFCs before the Indian air-conditioning boom begins.\u201cIt\u2019s the iPhone moment, when a product that wasn\u2019t widely available is suddenly ubiquitous,\u201d said Nihar Shah, an engineer at the Energy Department\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.During the 1990s, 5 percent of urban residents in China owned air-conditioners. A decade later, it was nearly 100 percent.\u201cThe idea is to get the best air-conditioner technology in place before this happens,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ll have these HFC air-conditioners locked in place for another decade.\u201dIn Burari, the Delhi neighborhood where Ms. Devi lives, and which Kamalpur is a section of, air-conditioning signifies both arrival and investment in the future. Homeowners here are mostly migrants from mountainous north India who work as government clerks or drivers and are investing heavily in their children\u2019s English-language education.S. S. Pathak, a bank manager, said he installed air-conditioning so his children, who are studying for medical school entrance exams, could manage late-night study sessions without nodding off or being devoured by disease-carrying mosquitoes.Sandhya Chauhan and her family live in two musty, windowless subterranean rooms, which turn stifling on summer nights, leaving six sweat-soaked adults to fidget, toss and pace until morning. They have lived there for 20 years, unable to find other lodging on the household\u2019s combined earnings of around 30,000 rupees a month, or less than $450.But it was never as awful as this May, when temperatures crept so high that Ms. Chauhan\u2019s friends speculated that the earth was colliding with the sun. After a doctor warned Mrs. Chauhan that heat exhaustion was affecting their oldest son\u2019s health, her husband bought an air-conditioner on credit. Though they are hardly middle class \u2014 \u201cwe have never let this thought cross our minds,\u201d Mrs. Chauhan said \u2014 the purchase has changed the way they see themselves.\u201cMy children sleep in peace,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a sense of happiness from inside. There was a sense that father has done a great job.\u201dAmong the changes that have come with increasing wealth, Ms. Devi said, is the confidence to spend on the family\u2019s comfort, rather than squirreling every bit of savings away.\u201cEducation is teaching people to take care of themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that we are used to air-conditioners, we will never go back.\u201dAn earlier picture with this article was published in error. It showed an air cooler, which does not use hydrofluorocarbons, not an air conditioner.Ellen Barry reported from Delhi, and Coral Davenport from Kigali, Rwanda.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Britain\u2019s \u2018Brexit\u2019 Bunch, the Party Just Ended", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisLONDON \u2014 For those blithely inclined toward the view that Britain would somehow find a way to sever its relationship with the European Union free of drama or financial consequences \u2014 like canceling a car rental reservation, with a tad more paperwork \u2014 Friday was a sobering day of reckoning.As the British pound plunged some 6 percent against the American dollar in the span of two minutes in early trading in Asia, the markets offered a reminder that divorce tends to be messy, expensive and laced with uncertainties. It rarely ends happily.The selling was so frenzied and swift that those who swap currencies for a living spoke of computerized transactions going haywire, rogue algorithms at work or a data entry error. The drop in the value of the pound appeared excessive, and it soon recovered some losses, though the British currency was down about 17 percent \u2014 around 25 cents \u2014 since June 23, the day Britain voted to abandon Europe.More than anything, though, the precipitous drop seemed to attest to an increasingly unmistakable reality: Britain\u2019s vote to exit the European Union \u2014 Brexit, in common parlance \u2014 has put its commercial relationships with the world on uncertain and potentially perilous ground. That poses risks for the British economy, making its money less attractive to hold.\u201cThe world believes that the U.K. is going to be poorer in the future, and find it more expensive to trade,\u201d said Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research institution in London. \u201cEssentially, the world is betting against the pound.\u201d And against the British economy.\u201cThe U.K. has decided to do a Brexit, I believe even a hard Brexit,\u201d Mr. Hollande said. \u201cWell, then, we must go all the way through the U.K.\u2019s willingness to leave the E.U. We have to have this firmness.\u201cIf not,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe would jeopardize the fundamental principles of the E.U. Other countries would want to leave the E.U. to get the supposed advantages without the obligations.\u201dHard Brexit, Soft Brexit, Brexit Over Easy. No one really knows what these terms mean (and the last one is made up). But, crudely, they divide potential outcomes into the ones in which Britain maintains effective inclusion within Europe\u2019s single market \u2014 a realm sprawling from Ireland to Romania, holding some 500 million people \u2014 and the ones in which Britain winds up outside.European leaders have been resolute that free movement of people across the borders of member nations is a nonnegotiable cost of admission in the common market.But Brexiteers had steadfastly maintained the illusion that Britain could have it both ways \u2014 that it could retain access to the European market while still controlling immigration. In destroying that idea, the prime minister\u2019s admission badly rattled the markets.The stakes are considerable. Britain ships nearly half its exports to other European Union members. The giants of global banking have turned London into a financial center rivaling New York, using hubs here to extend their reach across the rest of the European market.Investment has poured into Britain from around the world, as major manufacturers have set up factories so they can sell their wares across Europe without incurring tariffs.To one degree or another \u2014 and no one really knows how much \u2014 Brexit puts all of this in play.Negotiations between Britain and Europe are expected to commence sometime early next year. Whatever settlement results must be ratified by the remaining members of the European Union, meaning that Britain\u2019s economic prospects are now tethered to the vagaries of domestic politics in 27 other countries.None of these risks were unforeseen. During a fractious campaign leading up to the referendum, great reams of paper were released sketching out the potential effects on the British economy should voters opt to leave. Reports varied on details and degree, but they nearly unanimously concluded that Brexit would entail economic pain.The British Treasury surveyed the trading arrangements the government might strike with Europe after a Brexit vote and concluded it could lop some 6.2 percent off the gross domestic product by 2030. That would leave the average household worse off by about 4,300 pounds a year (at the current, depressed exchange rate, about $5,300).But those campaigning to leave dismissed such talk as fearmongering. They described a swashbuckling and reinvigorated Britain that would break free from a stagnating Europe \u2014 the land of unemployed children moving in with their parents \u2014 to instead focus on improving trade with faster-growing countries like China, India and the United States.Since the vote, those who urged leaving Europe have pointed to the facts that the sun still rises and the earth still spins to declare validation.Even as the pound has fallen against the dollar, consumer spending has generally held up along with employment. Economic growth has yet to be hit. Boutiques and high-end restaurants in London remain packed.Some have focused on the upsides of a declining pound, which makes British exports cheaper on world markets and renders Britain a more affordable tourist destination.But this misses the fact that nearly one-third of the goods and services consumed in Britain are imported. In dollar terms, the price of those goods and services is spiking. Eventually, economists assume, this inflation will work its way through the economy, further depressing growth by crimping consumer spending and potentially sowing unemployment.During the campaign, those in favor of leaving offered assurance that, whatever resulted, Britain would ultimately secure a beneficial trade deal with Europe. Germany sells vast quantities of cars to British consumers, giving it every incentive to keep trade flowing unimpeded by tariffs. As the largest economy in the union, Germany would hold the cards.But in her speech on Thursday, Ms. Merkel took direct aim at that argument, telling a gathering of industry leaders that any wavering on the principle of free movement of people would pose \u201ca systemic challenge for the entire European Union.\u201dThe sudden plummeting of the pound appeared to signal that investors were absorbing the intricacies of this dynamic, and seeing through the Brexiteers\u2019 claims that Britain could impose limits on immigration while also negotiating a settlement with Europe that would maintain access to the common market.Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who campaigned for leaving the European Union and is now foreign secretary, managed last week to maintain the government line while simultaneously making fun of the charade.But on Sunday, as Prime Minister May addressed a gathering of her governing Conservative Party in Birmingham, she essentially dumped the cake in the bin.\u201cWe have voted to leave the European Union and become a fully independent, sovereign country,\u201d Mrs. May declared. \u201cWe will do what independent, sovereign countries do. We will decide for ourselves how we control immigration.\u201dIn short, a \u201chard Brexit\u201d appeared to be in Britain\u2019s future.\u201cSomehow, a whole combination of people were in denial up until now,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England, and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.\u201cThere were the people who thought Brexit would be reversed,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere were the people who delusionally thought there would be a soft Brexit, and all the northern Europeans would be nice to them. And there were people who believed that this crew in charge of the British negotiations were somehow going to strike a good deal. All of the delusions have run out of material.\u201dFollow Peter S.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump, the Worst of America", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byDonald Trump has virtually stopped trying to win this election by any conventional metric and is instead stacking logs of grievance on the funeral pyre with the great anticipation of setting it ablaze if current polls turn out to be predictive.There is something calamitous in the air that surrounds the campaign, a hostile fatalism that bespeaks a man convinced that the end is near and aiming his anger at all within reach.As his path to victory grows narrower, his desperation grows more pronounced.Last week a steady stream of women stepped forward to accuse Trump of some form of sexual assault, abuse or inappropriate behavior. Trump\u2019s response has been marked by a stunning lack of grace and dignity, let alone contrition or empathy, a response much like the man himself.Instead, he is doubling down on sexism.On Thursday, Trump said of the People magazine reporter who accused him of forcibly kissing her: \u201cLook at her. Look at her words. You tell me what you think. I don\u2019t think so.\u201dHe said on Friday of the woman accusing him of groping her on an airplane: \u201cBelieve me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.\u201dHe also said of Clinton, \u201cWhen she walked in front of me, believe me, I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201dHis response to these charges has been surprisingly \u2014 and perhaps, revealingly \u2014 callow. He has mocked, whined, chided, bemoaned and belittled. It\u2019s as if the man is on a mission to demonstrate to voters the staggering magnitude of his social vulgarity and emotional ineptitude. He has dispensed with all semblances of wanting to appear presidential and embraced what seems to be most natural to him: acting like a pig.Furthermore, everything is rigged against him, from the media to the election itself. He\u2019s threatening to sue The New York Times. He says he and Clinton should take a drug test before the next debate.These are the ravings of a lunatic.Trump is back to carelessly shooting off his mouth and recklessly shooting himself in the foot.It is sad, really, but for him I have no sympathy. He has spent this entire election attacking anyone and everyone whom he felt it would be politically advantageous to attack. Trump, now that you\u2019re under attack, you want to cry woe-is-me and have people commiserate. Slim chance, big guy.The coarseness of your character has been put on full display, and now the electorate has come to cash the check you wrote.Trump now looks like a madman from Mad Men, a throwback to when his particular privileges had more perks and were considered less repugnant. He looks pathetic.He is a ball of contradictions that together form a bully, a man who has built a menacing wall around the hollow of his self. He is brash to mask his fragility.But in a way, Trump was authentically made in America.America has a habit of romanticizing the playboy as much as the cowboy, but there is often something untoward about the playboy, unseemly, predatory and broken.For years, Trump built a reputation on shuffling through women, treating his exploits with jocularity and having too much of America smiling in amusement at the bad boy antics.But he\u2019s not a kid; he\u2019s a cad.And he seems constitutionally incapable of processing the idea that wealth is not completely immunizing, that some rules are universally applicable, that common decency is required of more than just \u201ccommon\u201d folks. He seems genuinely offended that he should be held to the same standards of truth, decorum and even law as those less well off.Trump is in fact the logical extension of toxic masculinity and ambient misogyny. He is the logical extension of rampant racism. He is the logical extension of wealth worship. He is the logical extension of pervasive anti-intellectualism.Trump is the logical extension of the worst of America.With him you get a man who believes himself superior in every way: through the gift of fortune and the happenstance of chromosomes. He believes the rules simply don\u2019t apply. Not rules that govern the sovereignty of another\u2019s body, not rules that dictate decorousness.And the Republican Party was just the right place for him to park himself.When you have a political party that takes as its mission to prevent government from working instead of to make government work, a party that conflates the ill effects of a changing economy with the changing complexion of the country and is still struck by fever over the election of President Obama, Trump is a natural, predictable endpoint.Furthermore, Trump is what happens when you wear your Christian conservative values like a cardigan to conveniently slip off when the heat rises.Trump is fundamentally altering American politics \u2014 coarsening them, corrupting them, cratering them. And America, particularly conservative America, has only itself to blame.Republicans sowed intolerance and in its shadow, Trump sprang up like toxic fungi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A \u2018Balloon Warrior\u2019 Subverts North Korea, Thousands of Leaflets at a Time", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byThe Saturday ProfilePOCHEON, South Korea \u2014 Lee Min-bok\u2019s house, fashioned out of two shipping containers, is monitored by 12 police surveillance cameras. Dogs woof at any stranger walking up the dirt path. Plainclothes detectives check his mailbox and tag along wherever he goes to protect him from possible assassins sent by North Korea, which openly threatens to kill him.But that has not stopped him.On days when the wind blows to the north, Mr. Lee, 59, ventures out with his secondhand five-ton truck, hauling a large hydrogen tank to the border with North Korea, an hour\u2019s drive away. There, he fills dozens of 23-foot and 39-foot barrel-shaped balloons with the gas and lets them drift away.The balloons carry special payloads: radio sets, one-dollar bills, computer memory sticks and, above all, tens of thousands of leaflets bearing messages that Mr. Lee says will debunk the personality cult surrounding Kim Jong-un, the youthful leader of North Korea.\u201cMy leaflets are a poison for Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime, because they help North Koreans wake up to his lies,\u201d Mr. Lee said during an interview at his home.Sailing 9,800 to 16,400 feet above sea level, Mr. Lee\u2019s balloons waft across the world\u2019s most heavily guarded border, high enough that North Korean soldiers have little chance of shooting them down. Then his patented \u201ctimer\u201d devices click, unfastening vinyl bundles. Leaflets fall out like snowflakes over the North, where Mr. Kim struggles to keep his people under a total information blackout, blocking the internet and prefixing all radio and TV sets to receive only his government\u2019s propaganda-filled broadcasts.In South Korea, there are 50 \u201cballoon warriors,\u201d many of them defectors from the North like Mr. Lee, who seek to breach the wall with leaflets.To anyone who will listen, Mr. Lee preaches that the best way to reform North Korea and end its nuclear weapons program is to subvert Mr. Kim\u2019s government from inside the country. And the surest way to do that, he says, is to infiltrate it with outside information through leaflets, radio broadcasts and DVDs filled with South Korean TV dramas and smuggled through the North\u2019s border with China.\u201cLeaflets are the cheapest and safest,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cNo border guards, no radar, no radio jamming signals can stop them.\u201dWhile some defectors claim to have fled after reading leaflets or listening to outside radio, critics say leaflets do little more than provoke Pyongyang.It calls them an act of war and threatens to direct an artillery attack at their launching sites near the border. Balloonists have clashed with South Korean villagers worried about becoming targets of Northern retaliation.Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul who grew up in the former Soviet Union and studied at a North Korean university, was skeptical about the impact of leaflets on the North.\u201cOne leaflet is not going to change views of a person who is exposed to daily official propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it would be mistake to stop the campaign now. That is what the North Korean authorities demand, and it is not a good time to show weakness.\u201dMr. Lee avoids clashes with villagers by releasing his balloons away from their towns. Unlike more flamboyant activists, he seldom invites journalists to his launchings. The other activists\u2019 leaflets often carry highly personal attacks on Kim Jong-un, ridiculing him as \u201ca nuclear lunatic\u201d and exhorting North Koreans to overthrow the \u201cbloodthirsty pig.\u201d Mr. Lee believes that a less provocative approach will yield better results.His leaflets, for instance, list the number of cars and other figures from South Korea\u2019s vastly superior economy. It then asks North Koreans to ask ethnic Koreans from China, who often visit their country, whether those figures are correct. It also urges them to ask front-line soldiers to confirm that the South Korean fences on the border are awash with blinding lights at night while the energy-starved North is buried in darkness.There has been no reliable study on how many North Koreans read the leaflets or how they react.But Mr. Lee said his own story is proof that a leaflet can change a North Korean\u2019s life.He was a biologist at a state-run agricultural research institute in 1990 when he picked up a leaflet from the South while on a trip near the border. It made what was to him the shocking claim that the Korean War started in 1950 with a North Korean invasion.In the North, he said, the government had taught people to hate the Americans by endlessly reiterating that the United States and its South Korean puppets started the war. Mr. Lee did his own research, asking old veterans and people who had lived near the border when the war started, and became convinced the leaflet was right.By then, his faith had already been shaken, after the authorities reprimanded him for suggesting agricultural reforms.Mr. Lee fled the North in 1991 and, after traveling through China and Russia, arrived in the South in 1995. On his way, he was helped and baptized by South Korean missionaries.Today, sending balloons is Mr. Lee\u2019s full-time job. He finances his operation with cash he earns from lectures he gives at churches and elsewhere. Christians also donate, asking him to drop small Bibles and food into the North. A Japanese group contributes with the understanding he will send leaflets urging North Koreans to help find the whereabouts of dozens of Japanese believed to have been abducted to the North.Mr. Lee said his obsession with leaflets made him neglect his family. The South Korean wife he married in 1996 divorced him. He is now married to a Chinese woman who is far more supportive.\u201cYou need a partner in this work,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know when the right wind will blow, and your wife is the only helping hand you can get when you have to rush out with balloons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That would give the court time to consider allegations that the pact violated the principles of democracy.Despite rejecting the complaints, the court attached conditions to the decision on Thursday that would seek to address the concerns.Sigmar Gabriel, the German vice chancellor and economy minister, had warned that delaying the signing of CETA could destroy the trade deal.CETA was expected to be signed at a summit meeting later this month between Canada and European Union member states, before being submitted for ratification next year.Mr. Gabriel said he was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the judgment and cast the success with the Canadian agreement as paving the way for an eventual deal on T.T.I.P.\u201cIt is also a step toward regulating globalization,\u201d said Mr. Gabriel, who has faced strong opposition in his Social Democratic Party to both trade pacts.

{"Headline": "The Big Companies That Avoid Taxes", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byThe most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes.Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax.Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It\u2019s called cash taxes paid \u2014 the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes.I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country\u2019s 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. If Hillary Clinton wins, it may well be.A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes.Remember: That\u2019s not just federal taxes. It\u2019s federal, state, local and foreign taxes.How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices.Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent.\u201cThe tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. \u201cAll these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.\u201dThere is another victim, too \u2014 one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can\u2019t take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren\u2019t as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven\u2019t persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can\u2019t easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon\u2019s rate.This system is cumbersome \u2014 causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance \u2014 and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors\u2019 money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they\u2019re just looking out for the rest of us.Don\u2019t be fooled.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can the Democrats Resurrect the Middle Class?", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byWith the likelihood of major gains for their party on Election Day rising, the most important task facing Democrats is the development of a coherent economic agenda that addresses issues that were central in both the Republican and Democratic primaries.There are preliminary signs that Democrats and their allies are willing to put together just such an agenda.The two authors outline numerous proposals, including some that would be risky for Democrats, particularly those that call for the redistribution of resources from the party\u2019s upscale wing to downscale voters.These proposals include changes in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to benefit families with incomes of less than $100,000 (while reducing the benefits of the tax credit to the affluent) as well as the reduction or elimination of tax breaks in education savings plans for the affluent to generate revenues to boost Pell grants for poorer students.Sawhill and Rodrigue don\u2019t shy away from what they see as a necessary step in combating economic inequality:If we could empower young adults to only have children when they themselves feel ready to become parents, we could reduce unplanned pregnancies and out-of-wedlock births. That alone would reduce poverty and lack of mobility. The solutions here are often nongovernmental and involve changing social norms around the importance of responsible, two-person parenthood.They go on:Some have called for a new generation of government-sponsored marriage or relationship programs and for reducing marriage penalties in tax and benefit programs. But with some exceptions, these do not appear to be a cost-effective way to bring back the two-parent family. More promising are efforts to make the most effective forms of birth control (IUDs and implants) more widely available at no cost to women.the specter of secular stagnation and inadequate economic growth on the one hand, and ascendant populism and global disintegration on the other, has caused widespread apprehensionamid fears that \u201cthe global economy is entering unexplored and dangerous territory.\u201d And when economies worldwide stagnate, the result, Summers writes, is that \u201celectorates turn surly.\u201d The way to counter these negative trends, in his view, is to abandon \u201causterity economics in favor of investment economics.\u201dFurman focuses on a pair of crucial factors underlying slow growth: a lack of corporate dynamism and the weakening of competitive forces in the marketplace. Diminishing vitality in the marketplace has become a mounting concern among economists and policy makers.One advantage of Furman\u2019s approach is that it cuts across ideological boundaries.To support his case, Furman cites a wide range of data and reports. These include the finding that \u201cin 42 percent of the roughly 900 industries examined, the top four firms controlled more than a third of the market in 2012, up from 28 percent of industries in 1997\u201d and that in financial services, \u201cthe loan market share of the top ten banks increased from about 30 percent in 1980 to about 50 percent in 2010.\u201dIf the creation of new firms is a marker of a thriving competitive economy, Furman argues that the trends are not favorable. The accompanying chart shows a sharp decline over the past 30-plus years in the percentage of companies that are five years old or less, from just over 50 percent in 1982 to roughly 33 percent now, and a decline in the share of total employment provided by these young firms, from roughly 21 percent in 1982 to about 11 percent now.The decline in corporate dynamism has been accompanied by a decline in labor dynamism, with \u201cworkers less likely to move between jobs, industries, occupations, and locations,\u201d Furman writes.What Furman describes is a nation suffering from what amounts to economic arteriosclerosis. This has not hurt corporate management and the owners of capital \u2014 stockholders \u2014 but it has been disastrous for workers.Furman argues that \u201cboth market concentration and frictions that reduce worker mobility can lead to greater monopsony power for employers\" (monopsony is a buyer\u2019s monopoly). \u201cWith fewer firms competing for a given type of worker,\u201d Furman contends,each firm is more likely to exercise local monopsony, and their smaller numbers may also facilitate tacit or explicit collusion. If, on top of that, employees face greater search frictions or costs of moving, then this reduces their ability to raise their wages by changing jobs and thus also reduces their bargaining power with their current employer.The growing strength of businesses to bargain for low wages, bolstered by the decline in unionized employment and the falling value of the minimum wage, has contributed to the declining share of total income going to workers. Furman describes the trend as follows:Starting around 2000, the distribution of income between labor and capital shifted noticeably away from the former and towards the latter. Today, the labor share of income is in the mid-50s, compared to the mid-60s two decades ago.Despite rising returns to capital, there has not been a parallel increase in business investment. \u201cOne explanation,\u201d Furman argues, \u201cis that monopoly power has increased \u2014 which is consistent with higher returns and lower output.\u201dTogether, \u201cdeclining firm dynamism, high returns and low output, and disparities in the rate of return on investment are all potential consequences of increasing barriers to entry\u201d and restraining the operation of a free and open market.With these findings in place, Furman has laid out the groundwork for a liberal Democratic agenda:To the extent that these macroeconomic trends are related to decreased competition, then procompetitive policies have potential to not only benefit consumers but also improve the state of the macroeconomy by, for example, increasing productivity and ensuring that the benefits of growth are widely shared.Furman describes four areas where pro-competitive reforms are possible \u2014 and in some cases have already been initiated.The first is intellectual property and patent reform, areas where there is growing bipartisan agreement that excessive and often frivolous patent claims and the emergence of a new breed of patent tort litigators have held back innovation, especially technological innovation.The second is the need to increase the bargaining power of workers, whose leverage has steadily declined. More stringent antitrust enforcement could break up some business consolidation, giving workers access to job mobility; the practice of requiring employees to sign noncompete agreements should also be restrained.The third area is reform of state laws requiring occupational licensing, which Furman describes as an \u201cexample of policies that create inefficient and inequitable rents,\u201d and which have grown fivefold in the second half of the 20th century, from less than 5 percent of the work force in the early 1950s to 25 percent by 2008.While such licensing is needed in the case of health and safety occupations, in otherslicensing requirements create economic rents for licensed practitioners at the expense of excluded workers and consumers \u2014 increasing inefficiency and potentially also increasing inequality.Insofar as the licensing serves a legitimate need, the federal government can press for cross-border portability, giving licensees more opportunity to cross state lines for better jobs.The fourth is reform of land use regulation.\u201cOverly burdensome land-use restrictions \u2014 like minimum lot sizes, off-street parking requirements, height limits, prohibitions on multifamily housing, or lengthy permitting processes \u2014 can instead artificially reduce competition by acting as supply constraints,\u201d Furman contends. \u201cIn doing so, such policies both allow a small number of landowners to capture economic rents and reduce the stock of available affordable housing.\u201dFurman notes that land use constraints limit productivity growth and labor mobility by making it more difficult for workers to move to higher-productivity cities.One of the most vexing problems facing those seeking to develop a liberal, pro-competition agenda is the emergence of the digital marketplace.The complexity of the economics of the internet is, according to Furman, reflected in the following contradiction. On one hand, internet markets \u201chave tended to favor digital giants that hold high market shares\u201d and digitalization also poses an increased danger of opaque price fixing through the \u201cuse of advanced machine learning algorithms to set prices and adapt product functionality.\u201d On the other hand, the digital marketplace has encouraged competition by lowering \u201cmany costs for small businesses, increasing their ability to rapidly and inexpensively scale up, collect information on potential consumers, and create new products and ideas.\u201dThere is disagreement among economists concerning Furman\u2019s work.Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, wrote me by email: \u201cI am a big fan of Jason Furman and think the directions he has been sketching on technology, competition, and globalization make a lot of sense.\u201dDavid Card, an economist at Berkeley, conversely, wrote that he does not think Furman\u2019s proposals \u201cwill amount to more than a couple of percentage points higher wages (or a few percent lower prices) for low to middle income folks.\u201d Overall, Card said, \u201cI am deeply skeptical, to say the least.\u201dI would argue that even if Card is right, wages that are a couple of percentage points higher are nothing to sneeze at.Furman\u2019s proposals should not be viewed in isolation, but as one piece of a broader liberal agenda \u2014 an agenda that could include some or all of what Larry Summers, Isabel Sawhill, and others, have proposed.The economy has added nearly 10.7 million jobs; median household income has gone up $1,140, or 2 percent; the buying power of the average worker\u2019s weekly paycheck is up 4.2 percent; the median sales prices of existing single-family homes are up 23 percent; the unemployment rate has dropped well below the historical norm; job openings are at a 15-year high; corporate profits and stock prices have both soared to record highs; the number of people lacking health insurance has gone down by 16.5 million; the murder rate is down nearly 5 percent, despite an increase in 2015; and the number of unauthorized immigrants estimated to be living in the U.S. is down, according to demographers.There have also been a number of failures, as Factcheck.org also pointed out, perhaps most notably a 36 percent rise in the number of Americans on food stamps and a 0.3 increase in the poverty rate.Assuming for the moment that Clinton is Obama\u2019s successor, it will fall to her to build on his record and to address the yearning of those hard-pressed voters who have felt for far too long like beggars at the banquet.Advertisement"}

He grew up there. Her school was a 20-minute bicycle ride away. They raised their son there, though he eventually grew so tall that his head grazed the ceiling of his cramped room. When city officials pushed them to sell, they said no.Then came China\u2019s latest property bubble \u2014 a frothy surge in prices that could have global repercussions if it pops.In August, an unremarkable piece of land around the corner from Ms. Zheng sold for nearly $2,000 a square foot, a national record and nearly three times the average land price in Manhattan. Local officials grew more insistent and threatened to tear down their bathroom.Finally, they relented, and Ms. Zheng\u2019s husband signed away the home for a price to be determined later. Then, on Oct. 9, Mr. Sun died of a heart attack, something Ms. Zheng said was perhaps influenced by stress over the pending demolition of their home.Now, as she grieves, she is waiting to hear how much the Shanghai government will offer in compensation \u2014 but however much that is, she knows it will not be enough for her to be able to afford to live anywhere close to Lufeng Road.Said Ms. Zheng: \u201cI never expected housing prices in Shanghai would get this high.\u201dChina is in the midst of a dizzying housing bubble. Shanghai\u2019s average housing price is up nearly one-third from a year ago, with prices in major cities like Beijing and Guangzhou not far behind. Chinese consumers are rushing to buy homes before the government steps in with restrictions.When rumors swept through Shanghai that the government would require homeowners to pay more in taxes and down payments to buy additional properties, many couples filed for divorce so that one partner could still be treated as an independent buyer.But economists warn that the current boom on the Chinese mainland could be extra difficult to resolve: It comes with a growing amount of American-style debt.Long-term household loans \u2014 mostly mortgages \u2014 have doubled as a share of total official bank lending this year. They accounted for about 40 percent of all new loans in August, contrasted with just 20 percent at the start of the year. The value of new home loans as a percentage of all housing sales has surged to a record high.That could be bad news for the global economy. Many economists estimate that housing and related areas \u2014 like construction, cement manufacturing or furniture making \u2014 account for roughly one-fifth of China\u2019s economic activity. But if the bubble pops, that support could disappear quickly.Chinese officials, apparently mindful of the 2008 American housing bust, appear to be aware of the risks of a debt-fueled property bubble. But some economists worry they will be too slow to rein it in.\u201cThe risk is that the government is late in cooling the market, the rally spreads to more areas, pushing up household leverage and construction activity, pushing the bubble bigger, which is then followed by a bigger downward correction,\u201d said Tao Wang, the head of China economics at UBS in Hong Kong.Local regulators are already trying to cool things down. In the last few weeks, local authorities have accelerated efforts to tighten housing markets in up to 20 Chinese cities, according to economists at China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank.But in many cases these steps have only added to the rush, as home buyers move in while they can.By her account, Zhang Xia and her husband have enjoyed a happy marriage. Then the rumor swept the city that Shanghai authorities would make it harder for couples with one home to buy more.On a recent Monday, Ms. Zhang, a 40-year-old resident of Shanghai\u2019s Huangpu area, and her husband sat waiting at a local marriage registry office to file for divorce. Shanghai officials continue to deny that they will limit house buying by couples, but Ms. Zhang is among many who do not believe them.\u201cWe know the government said this is a rumor, but they also said that a few times before, when the rumor actually came true,\u201d Ms. Zhang said. \u201cSome people even said the fact that the government said it\u2019s a rumor means it\u2019s going to be true.\u201dShanghai, China\u2019s financial capital, is at the heart of the property boom. Demand there is so intense that developers now commonly require sizable deposits of cash just to join a lottery to buy a new apartment. Only holders of winning numbers will be offered the chance to buy a unit. One flashy new development in central Shanghai charges a refundable 200,000 renminbi, or $30,000, to enter its lottery.\u201cIn Shanghai now,\u201d said Wang Jie, a sales manager there, \u201cit\u2019s not like you can buy an apartment just because you have money.\u201dBack on Lufeng Road, the recently widowed Ms. Zheng and her neighbors try to go about their lives despite the boom going on around them. Men and women play mah-jongg near a half-demolished house, one of a number of dwellings along the road in various states of disassembly, like a row of rotting teeth. Stray dogs sunbathe and alley cats hunt around piles of red bricks and wooden beams scattered on the street.In recent months, local officials hung red propaganda banners on people\u2019s housing extolling the benefits of selling out. \u201cNo more hesitation means no more disappointment,\u201d reads one. Says another: \u201cRequisition and compensation are lawful. Smart alecks will regret it later.\u201d\u201cLook at those banners,\u201d Ms. Zheng said, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the Cultural Revolution once again.\u201dEarlier, local officials told Ms. Zheng that the land where her home stands would be used to build supporting facilities for the next-door complex of high-rises built by China Vanke, the country\u2019s largest property developer.\u201cThey said that when people who live in the high-rises in Vanke look down, the view from their windows is our ugly roofs,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they have to get rid of us.\u201dKaroline Kan contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

But he can\u2019t say whether he will support Mr. Trump for president.His views on social issues jump right out of the Tea Party playbook: He is anti-abortion and voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Ms. McGinty favors a woman\u2019s right to choose and Planned Parenthood. Mr. Toomey voted to repeal Obamacare. Ms. McGinty supports it. Mr. Toomey\u2019s vote on environmental issues won him a zero ranking in 2015 from the League of Conservation Voters. Ms. McGinty\u2019s environmental record speaks for itself.Mr. Toomey portrays Ms. McGinty as a sure rubber-stamp for Hillary Clinton. Our own take is that she has an independent streak that would place her state\u2019s interests before party fealty. In any case, she is clearly the much better choice for anyone concerned about social and economic fairness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The U.S. Is Standing in the Way of Cheaper Drugs for the Poor", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorEvery few months, a drug company gets caught cranking up prices. Most recently, Mylan, the maker of EpiPen, took its turn in the hot seat for raising the price of a lifesaving allergy treatment by 500 percent. Congress was rightly enraged and opened yet another inquiry into pharmaceutical price gouging. Mylan offered discount coupons.The story will soon fade from the headlines \u2014 until the next pricing scandal.In the United States, companies have raised prices on many drugs over the past five years, mostly with little public notice or scandal. Pfizer alone raised the prices of more than 100 drugs in one year. Drug prices have seen double-digit inflation over the past three years, at a time of relatively low inflation in the rest of the economy. Recent research suggests that cancer patients may be delaying use of lifesaving drugs, while there are reports that prisoners are rationed access to hepatitis C treatments \u2014 all because of high prices.But this problem is also international. In poorer countries across the world where our organizations work, millions of people are priced out of medicines that could save lives and relieve suffering. For example, a recent World Health Organization study found that in some 30 countries, hepatitis C medicines were unaffordable for much of the population.Many world leaders recognize that high drug prices are a public-health crisis. Earlier this year, Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, commissioned a panel of industry, government, academic and civil society experts, including Oxfam International\u2019s executive director, to recommend ways to bring drug prices down to affordable levels and to improve research and development of new medicines in order to fulfill the human right to health.The panel\u2019s report, released last month, found that today\u2019s system is failing. Pharmaceutical monopolies reap huge profits from high prices, while medicines are unaffordable for too many people. The report called for more transparency and competition in the drug industry and for preserving and implementing existing policies that help reduce prices.Shamefully, the American government sought to obstruct and oppose the panel, even denying the premise that high drug prices undermine public health.The Obama administration\u2019s response to the report\u2019s release called the panel\u2019s work \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and accused it of recommending \u201cdivisive policies,\u201d which it warned ominously \u201ccould have significant unintended negative consequences.\u201d In other words, if we want new medicines and innovations, we must continue to support a system in which the pharmaceutical industry has unlimited power to set prices. Considering alternative pathways is apparently off limits.These scare tactics not only contradict the United States\u2019 stated global and domestic health priorities, they are also an offense to people unable to afford critical treatment. Worse yet, the American government actively exports this approach to other countries through trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, if allowed to take effect, will lock in and extend global monopoly protections and high medicine prices for years to come.This can\u2019t be allowed to happen. High prices and monopolies are not delivering innovation that responds to people\u2019s needs. In fact, many public health issues are being neglected by the pharmaceutical industry because the market for the needed medicines is not sufficiently profitable.A clear example is the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, which turn once-treatable infections deadly. Drug-resistant infections already kill 23,000 people each year in the United States and 700,000 people globally. Yet it has been more than 30 years since a new class of antibiotics has been introduced, and the pipeline for critically needed new antibiotics is nearly dry.There are alternative means to stimulate innovation that do not rely on monopolies and high prices. Grants, prizes and other research incentives could go a long way. The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative, a public-private partnership that Doctors Without Borders helped to found, was able to develop therapies to treat malaria, sleeping sickness, kala azar and Chagas\u2019 disease \u2014 illnesses long ignored by the pharmaceutical industry.These approaches, which do not depend entirely on the pharmaceutical industry alone to fund research, show that it is possible to separate the cost of developing drugs from their final product price, ensuring both innovation and affordability.Yet to really transform how drugs are developed, governments must lead the charge. There are hopeful signs this might happen. In September, world leaders agreed to address antibiotic resistance in part, by committing to develop new drugs through such new research and development models.The United Nations panel recommendations, which the Obama administration has tried to attack and discredit, are precisely designed to open new paths to medical innovation that benefit us all. Access to existing and new medicines and treatments should not depend on how much money you have, where you were born or whom you know.The United States government, especially the next president, must stop defending industry profits and work to reform how we pay for medical research to ensure that all patients\u2019 needs are addressed. High prices of medicines are not inevitable; they are a choice the American government has made. Many lives and livelihoods hang in the balance until that choice changes.Jason Cone is the executive director of Doctors Without Borders USA. Raymond C. Offenheiser is the president of Oxfam America.Advertisement"}

The classic young-adult novel of that period typically dealt with characters managing the fracture of American family life \u2014 divorce, a mother\u2019s new boyfriend and so on \u2014 but those characters most often enjoyed the comforts of middle-class life.

But their imperious chairmen have in several instances been convicted of tax evasion and other crimes, though seldom kicked out of management.Indicted with Mr. Shin on Wednesday were his brother, Shin Dong-joo, 62; their 94-year-old father, the Lotte founder, Shin Kyuk-ho; and the senior Mr. Shin\u2019s common-law wife and a former winner of the Miss Lotte beauty pageant, Seo Mi-kyung, 57. None of them was arrested.Mr. Shin was accused of arranging for his father and other relatives to receive fat salaries from Lotte subsidiaries although they did not work there, prosecutors said.He was also accused of arranging for Lotte subsidiaries to buy stocks of another affiliate at illegally high prices, and giving lucrative contracts \u2014 like running cafeterias in a chain of Lotte movie theaters \u2014 to a company owned by his family members without conducting competitive bidding.South Korea has placed restrictions on such deals because chaebol chairmen were often accused of using them to help their children accumulate a fortune.A household name in South Korea, Lotte operates department stores, duty-free shops, shopping malls, hotels, amusement parks, multiplexes, burger joints and coffee shops.Advertisement"}

The move caps a yearlong effort by the leftist government to use the courts, which are controlled by Maduro loyalists, to neutralize the Congress.It could also forecast a more aggressive campaign by Mr. Maduro to derail the recall referendum.Since then, Mr. Maduro has presided over an economic collapse; food, medicine and electricity shortages; and rising crime.Removing Mr. Maduro was a central pledge of opposition lawmakers when they took control of the Congress in January. A vote against the president in a recall referendum, were it held this year, would prompt a new election that would challenge leftists\u2019 grip on the presidency. But if the vote was put off until next year and succeeded, Mr. Maduro would be replaced by his vice president.Mr. Maduro has called the recall effort the equivalent of a coup.On Oct. 26, the opposition will begin three days of collecting the signatures required to reach the threshold for calling the referendum \u2014 20 percent of voters.Critics have said that the government placed restrictions on the process, particularly on the number of polling sites, which will make it challenging for Mr. Maduro\u2019s opponents to gather the four million signatures they need.The Supreme Court justified its budget ruling as a means to guarantee constitutional order.\u201cFor the first time in Venezuelan history, the government is going to approve its own budget,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Guerra, an opposition legislator who is the president of the finance commission. \u201cThis has always been the Parliament\u00b4s job.\u201dThe ruling by the court\u2019s constitutional chamber follows a raft of decisions against the opposition. The court has declared Congress in contempt and ruled that its laws are therefore unconstitutional. That dispute stems from the assembly\u2019s decision to seat three legislators in defiance of another ruling by the court.The courts also overturned an opposition law meant to stabilize the economy, limited lawmakers\u2019 power to remove judges, and ratified an emergency decree that legislators had rejected.In addition, judges invalidated a law that would have freed some 120 prisoners, many of them opposition politicians or activists jailed by the government during protests. The court\u2019s initial onslaught against the assembly\u2019s authority was a demoralizing blow to lawmakers who had taken power promising to free the prisoners immediately.Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

As a curator at the V&A for 18 years, and not on an executive shortlist, I\u2019ve seen firsthand that for the women who aim to balance an arts career with a life outside the institution, reluctance to throw their hats into the ring may be linked to the international travel and all-consuming nature of a directors\u2019 dozen role.

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Buicks", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byLetter of RecommendationThe moment my father pulled into the driveway with his new Buick LeSabre Limited was one of his proudest. He parked the car in the center of our circular driveway, right by the front door, and beckoned my mother and me to come have a look. The LeSabre was a beautiful car, the color of Champagne. It had a tufted velour interior, soft vinyl doors and a faux-walnut dashboard that lit up warm as a hearth.This was 1984, and I was 14 \u2014 too young to take the car out for a drive myself, though that was all I wanted to do. When my father went inside to help Mom with dinner, he let me stay in the driver\u2019s seat with the keys in the ignition so I could listen to the Delco stereo. After a while, he came back out with a yellow cassette tape, the words \u201cJohann Strauss\u201d embossed on its plastic casing. He shoved it into the player and lit a cigarette. As the sun set on our Cincinnati subdivision, Dad and I fell deep into the Vienna woods. It\u2019s one of those moments I still go back to, a reminder of the fleeting security of being a kid.Security, both personal and financial, is how General Motors long marketed Buicks. By the time my father bought one, Buick had already carved out its insecure spot in the pantheon of American sedans: a step up from the Chevy and a corner office shy of the Cadillac. But as the years have passed, the qualities that made Buicks attractive to accomplished parents and grandparents \u2014 their sofa-on-wheels comfort, their ocean-liner smoothness \u2014 have become more of a joke than a selling point. That\u2019s especially true among those under 65, long the average age of a Buick owner, though I recently read it\u2019s skewing more toward 59.My father died in 1990, and Mom married another Buick man named Ted, who had a penchant for Park Avenues. Visiting the two of them in Florida in my 20s and 30s, I would leave my rigid Volkswagen Jetta in their driveway and drive Ted\u2019s Buick as much as he would allow. A sense of ease washed over me as I settled into its plush leather driver\u2019s seat \u2014 first-class accommodations compared with the Jetta\u2019s economy.As a borderline claustrophobic, I found that the Buick\u2019s spaciousness let me breathe a little. As a Luddite, I found solace in the archaic dashboard controls. I would take the Park Avenue out on warm Florida nights, opening the windows and sailing it through the smooth back roads of New Smyrna Beach, its loose steering always reminding me more of a cabin cruiser than a car. Whenever I came to a straightaway, I would hit the gas pedal as hard as I could. It was a fast and powerful car, and though I drove it recklessly more times than I should have, I rarely worried. There was a confidence that car inspired, a feeling of control.One thing I never felt was cool. That\u2019s because Buicks aren\u2019t cool. They\u2019re not even cool anymore to the demographic that once loved them most. When I told my father-in-law recently that I loved Buicks, he shivered and said, \u201cThose are old-man cars, buddy.\u201d My father-in-law is 72. I suppose his attitude reflects our times, when the pressure to be cool stretches far beyond our teens, into our 30s and well past our 40s.I\u2019m hardly immune to this impulse. Standing in line at a Manhattan lunch spot a few months ago, I eyed the footwear of the nearby 20- and 30-somethings to ensure the next pair of Nikes I bought would be stylish enough. I\u2019m 46. But the truth is that I\u2019m sick of trying. Now more than ever, I find myself drawn to the traditional signposts of American adulthood \u2014 the blue blazer from Brooks Brothers, the four-bedroom colonial-style home, the roomy sedan. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve always found adult life too overwhelming to navigate. Maybe it\u2019s easier to use my parents\u2019 wants as a compass instead of my own.As my father guided the LeSabre through the twists and turns of our suburban streets all those years ago, he looked like a ship captain and a sad-eyed savior. Though I admire him, I didn\u2019t follow my father\u2019s career path. I became a reporter instead of a businessman. I moved to New Orleans and then New York. Adjusted for inflation, my salary has never exceeded his. I didn\u2019t marry until I was 41, and had my first child last year at 45. In terms of how I imagined my life would turn out, I\u2019m a little behind. I wish I had the money for a good wristwatch, a down payment on a house, a Buick of my own.Driving through Pennsylvania last winter, I hit a deer and totaled the Honda my wife\u2019s father handed down to her just before we met. Shopping for a replacement, I urged her to come with me to a Buick dealership, thinking we might be able to afford a used Regal or LaCrosse. She agreed they were nice, but she wouldn\u2019t have it. Buicks were for old people, she said. And more important, we weren\u2019t quite \u201cthere\u201d yet.I look forward to the day when we get there. As for now, whenever I see the red taillights of a Buick glowing before me on a highway, I\u2019ll imagine there\u2019s a family inside; that the mother and the father are accomplished, well heeled. There\u2019s a kid in the back seat, nodding off to the sounds of a Strauss waltz on the radio. When he falls asleep, he\u2019ll dream that he can drive.Keith Pandolfi is a former senior editor for Saveur magazine and the former features editor for Serious Eats.

Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were getting clean water for the first time. In Kenya, enrollment in public universities more than doubled from 2007 to 2012. In many countries, life expectancy was increasing, infant mortality decreasing.But in recent months, as turmoil has spread across the continent, and the red-hot economic growth has cooled, this optimistic narrative has taken a hit. Some analysts are now questioning how profound the growth actually was.\u201cAfrica rising was really good for some crackpot dictators,\u201d he added. \u201cBut in some ways, it was a myth.\u201dNo place exposes the cracks in the \u201cAfrica rising\u201d narrative better than Ethiopia, which had been one of the fastest risers.The government, whose stranglehold on the country is so complete that not a single opposition politician sits in the 547-seat Parliament, recently took the drastic step of imposing a state of emergency.Many of the Ethiopia\u2019s new engines of growth \u2014 sugar factories, textile mills, foreign-owned flower farms \u2014 now lie in ashes, burned down in an antigovernment rage.Political turmoil on the one hand, rosy economic prospects on the other. Can both be true?It seems the continent as a whole is heading into a tough period. Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, faces its gravest economic crisis in years because of low oil prices. At the same time, it is trying to fight off Boko Haram, one of the most bloodthirsty insurgent groups on the planet.As Mr. Leke said, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat growth.\u201dStill, he says, there have been fundamental \u2014 and positive \u2014 changes on the continent, like increases in disposable income for many African consumers.Mr. Chelwa, the Zambian economist, has a different view. The fundamentals of African economies have not changed nearly as much as the \u201cAfrica rising\u201d narrative implied, he said, with Africa still relying too heavily on the export of raw materials and not enough on industry.\u201cIn Zambia, we import pencils,\u201d he said.He also points out that some of the fastest-growing economies, like Ethiopia, Angola and Rwanda, are among the most repressive. These governments can move ahead with big infrastructure projects that help drive growth, but at the same time, they leave out many people, creating dangerous resentments.In Ethiopia, that resentment seems to be growing by the day.The trouble started last year when members of Ethiopia\u2019s largest ethnic group, the Oromo, began protesting government land policies. Soon Ethiopia\u2019s second largest ethnic group, the Amhara, joined in, and the protests have now hardened into calls to overthrow the government, which is led by a small ethnic minority.Several witnesses said the security forces might be beginning to split, with some officers taking off their uniforms and joining the protests.He said that the economic indicators for many African economies in the 1990s and early 2000s were inaccurate, and that the economic progress in the last five to 10 years that appeared to have been sudden was, in fact, gradual.In other cases, Mr. Jerven said, African governments made bold economic assumptions or simply used fake numbers to make themselves look good. \u201cThe narrative had been too rosy,\u201d he said.Africa Yearning or Africa Struggling might be a more apt characterization, but neither of these is especially new. Whatever narrative emerges should include what Mr. Chelwa calls the continent\u2019s \u201cghastly inequality,\u201d and the sharp increase in the number of people who are now better equipped with technology and information and are demanding more from their governments.Of course, it is difficult to apply a sweeping narrative to all 54 countries in Africa, where analysts agree that the picture is mixed. For instance, Rwanda remains stable with new businesses and floods of tourists while its neighbor Burundi teeters on the edge of chaos.Some of the same economic factors that investors cite as grounds for optimism, like Africa\u2019s growing cities, cut both ways. According to Mr. Jerven, rapid urbanization in Africa often leads to sprawling slums, low wages and legions of disenfranchised youth.\u201cAll the economic variables for turmoil are there,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

What Now?", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Amid myriad battles over trade agreements, concerns about the impending negotiations for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, and political instability across the region, the eurozone continued to grow steadily but slowly in the third quarter.Consumer prices in the 12 months through October rose 0.5 percent, up from 0.4 percent in the 12 months through September.Economic growth and inflation were in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts.The indicators were closely watched not only for what they might say about the health of the eurozone economy, but for how they might affect decisions by the European Central Bank that can have a profound effect on financial markets.Here are the main takeaways:First, some good news: The eurozone economy has not shrunk since the beginning of 2013, and some countries are doing pretty well. Spain, which once had one of Europe\u2019s sickest economies, grew a healthy 0.7 percent in the third quarter.Based on recent surveys showing rising optimism among businesses and consumers, some analysts thought the numbers released on Monday would provide a positive surprise. But they were disappointed.The European Central Bank orients its policy to the inflation rate, which remains well below the official target of close to, but below, 2 percent. The annualized inflation rate of 0.5 percent in October was slightly higher than the previous month, but the slight acceleration is not a game changer.Analysts have begun speculating about whether the bank might begin scaling back its de facto money-printing program (which aims to reduce market interest rates and stimulate the economy). But the numbers released on Monday did not provide any ammunition for those who think that \u201ctapering\u201d could begin sooner than expected.Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, has refused to stoke the tapering talk. He said on Oct. 20 that purchases of government bonds, corporate debt and other assets \u2014 a way of pumping money into the economy \u2014 would continue at least through March, and longer if necessary, to push up inflation.If growth and inflation remain sluggish, the central bank could decide to keep buying assets for longer. Bert Colijn, an economist at ING Bank in London, predicted that the central bank would announce an extension of the stimulus program at its next meeting, on Dec. 8.\u201cIt will become very difficult for the E.C.B. to wait longer than that,\u201d Mr. Colijn said in a note to clients on Monday.Some economists expect the eurozone to grow more quickly in the current quarter. The region\u2019s economy seems to have shrugged off the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote from the summer, and Europe is benefiting from the stronger economy in the United States, the biggest market for eurozone exports.The austerity that has weighed on growth is also running its course. Strict limits on government spending, a reaction to excessive indebtedness in countries like Italy and Greece, are being relaxed.\u201cWorries about weak growth in the second half of the year can in our opinion now be tossed overboard,\u201d Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl, an economist at the German insurer Allianz, said in a note to investors.Advertisement"}

Cuomo, the corruption scandal that threatens to inflict lasting harm on his political career and his family\u2019s legacy is a betrayal of multiple dimensions.As a scheduling director and fixer for Mario Cuomo in 1991, Mr. Howe arranged for the then-governor to fly to New Hampshire to launch a presidential bid on two planes that, like Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign, never left the Albany tarmac. Mr. Howe followed Andrew Cuomo to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and, years later, played a role in his re-election campaign for governor in 2014.Federal prosecutors have been more diplomatic in their choice of words. But by their account, Mr. Howe, in already pleading guilty, has confessed to all that and more: supplying the plot\u2019s connective tissue, the brains and the secret shell company used to hide hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes.\u201cThere is shock and disappointment and anger among a number of people who worked under Mario, feeling like it\u2019s a betrayal of the brand, feeling like it dirties the legacy that they\u2019re all so proud of,\u201d said Mayor Stephanie A.

Their banter over emails and text messages is garnished with inside jokes, locker-room nicknames and exuberant punctuation.Mr. Howe even kept a fleece jacket from one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns emblazoned with \u201cHerb.\u201dIt was a reminder of the way that power in the Cuomo orbit tended to accrue to those who had served the former governor long and loyally, cementing decades-long friendships with one another along the way.Even so, the younger Mr. Cuomo has insisted that he does not know Mr. Howe well, and the governor\u2019s chief of staff, Melissa DeRosa, said that she had never heard him speak to or about Mr. Howe. Mr. Cuomo is not accused of any wrongdoing.Of all the \u201cHerbs,\u201d Mr. Howe was closest to Mr. Percoco, who followed Mr. Howe to Washington in the 1990s. Later, they shared an office during Andrew Cuomo\u2019s re-election campaign in 2014; Mr. Percoco served as the official campaign manager, Mr. Howe as his unofficial partner.They often complemented one another. If Mr. Percoco acted as chief lieutenant to the governor, Mr. Howe played administration whisperer, cultivating a reputation as the right person to call for a direct line to the governor\u2019s office. Where Mr. Percoco screamed threats at allies and enemies, Mr. Howe was charming, well liked and apologetic when delivering unwelcome news.But both badly needed the money that mixing government and business could offer.Mr. Howe has cut a chaotic path through courts in Washington and Maryland, where he has been sued repeatedly for ducking a long list of creditors that includes kitchen contractors, a tree nursery and a swimming-pool repairman, as well as for failing to repay a home-equity loan. From 1999 to 2009, he declared bankruptcy, faced three foreclosures and made a false bank deposit of $45,000 to cover an unpaid bill, later pleading guilty to felony theft.Nearly $400,000 in federal tax liens and other judgments have been entered against him. Still, until recently, many of his friends and political associates assumed he had the money to match his prosperous lifestyle. He bought a $1.8 million home in Washington. His children attended boarding schools and private colleges.When he pleaded guilty to the felony charges associated with the bribery scheme on Sept. 20, two days before charges were announced against the other defendants, Mr. Howe told a judge that he was seeing a psychologist \u201cwith regard to financial issues.\u201dMr. Percoco, too, was slipping financially. He and his wife, Lisa Toscano-Percoco, bought an $800,000 home in Westchester County in 2012, moving from Staten Island to the same well-groomed area as Mr. Cuomo and another \u201cHerb,\u201d Howard Glaser, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s former director of state operations.Soon after, Ms. Percoco left her job as a New York City public-school teacher. The couple\u2019s monthly income shrank to less than half their expenses, which averaged about $20,000 a month.Mr. Howe had an idea or two.In exchange, prosecutors say, Mr. Percoco tried to help the company obtain favorable decisions from two state agencies, arranging several meetings between Mr. Kelly and Mr. Glaser or another top aide in the governor\u2019s office. Long after it became clear that Mr. Kelly would not get everything he wanted, Mr. Percoco continued to shake him down.Mr. Howe egged him on, using their not-so-subtle code word for payments \u2014 \u201cziti,\u201d a joking allusion, often misspelled by the two men, to \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d\u201cHandle fat boy carefully,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Percoco, referring to Mr. Kelly, according to the complaint. \u201cWe don\u2019t need an interruption in that Zitti delivery or else we\u2019ll really be up the creek.\u201dAs word of the investigation leaked, Mr. Howe gave friends the impression that his arrangement with Mr. Percoco was more or less legitimate. (Mr. Percoco\u2019s lawyer, Barry A. Bohrer, has described his client\u2019s behavior as legal.)\u201cTodd would say early on, \u2018I wasn\u2019t trying to do anything wrong; Joe was off the clock and he needed work, and I set him up with some of my clients,\u2019\u201d said Chris Lapetina, a political consultant who has known Mr. Howe since they both worked for Mario Cuomo.In the meantime, Mr. Howe urged each developer to flood Mr. Cuomo\u2019s re-election campaign with donations, the better to make an impression in the governor\u2019s office.As part of his deal with prosecutors, Mr. Howe has pleaded guilty to concealing or misappropriating at least $1.5 million in consulting fees and travel expenses from his employer, the Albany-based lobbying firm WOH Government Solutions, and then falsifying his tax returns to avoid paying income taxes on them.When news reports began identifying Mr. Howe as a target of the investigation in late April, friends advised him to cooperate. Facing multiple felony charges, he felt he had little choice.\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to go in and tell the truth,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lapetina recalled.By June, according to court documents, he was in a federal prosecutor\u2019s office, grasping at one more chance for survival.Jesse McKinley and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reefer Republic", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The budtenders of the Rose City are relentlessly helpful with tips pairing a marijuana strain that is \u201cequal parts fruity and musky\u201d with a stimulating Sichuan dish. As Oregon, the place where empires once clashed over the global trade of beaver furs, glides into a second year of legalized recreational pot, the state is determined to show the world that a certain kind of drug prohibition belongs in history\u2019s Dumpster.Soon, with the likely passage of legal pot in California next month, all of the West Coast \u2014 from the tundra of Alaska to the sun-washed suburbs of San Diego \u2014 will be a confederacy of state-regulated marijuana use.Across the Pacific, a completely a different view of drug use is playing out in the horror of the Philippines. That country is ruled by Rodrigo Duterte, a crude and brutal strongman known as the Donald Trump of the Philippines. Under his watch, more than 3,500 suspected drug users and dealers have been killed. Many of those murders are \u201cextrajudicial,\u201d as the State Department calls them.Comparing his vigilante campaign to Hitler\u2019s Holocaust, the Philippine president recently said \u201cI\u2019d be happy to slaughter\u201d three million drug users. By killing that many of his own people, Duterte said he would \u201cfinish the problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition.\u201d This is a Category 5 human rights disaster in the making, and should be universally condemned.The world has always been bipolar when it comes to our fellow humans prone to addiction and chemical diversion. One impulse is hysterical \u2014 the sweeping, lock-\u2019em-up tragedy of the United States following the crack epidemic, the numerous executions in places like Iran and the Philippines. The other is historical, at least by modern standards: the attempt by states in the American West (and a ballot measure in Maine this year) to call out the drug war for the farce that it is.Throughout these swings, little has changed among a vulnerable cohort of humanity. And until a way is found to permanently balance dopamine levels, we will always have small but significant portion of the population prone to addiction. Benjamin Franklin abused laudanum, an opium and alcohol mixture for his bodily pains. And Sigmund Freud was more than a casual user of cocaine.The current opioid epidemic in places not usually associated with drug dens and dirty needles shows that addiction is not confined to ZIP codes of economic despair. On Staten Island, home to many a New York cop, there have been 71 deaths attributed to heroin overdose so far this year.Heroin is the drug of choice in small towns in New England and wide-open rural areas across the country. Blacks and Latinos use and sell drugs at roughly the same rate as whites, but 57 percent of the people locked up for a drug offense in 2014 were nonwhite.Perhaps because so many addicts are white and suburban, or white and rural, there is now a rare bipartisan consensus emerging for wholesale reform of the drug laws.We can start, nationwide, with marijuana. Though legalization is not without its problems \u2014 a spike in emergency room visits attributed to edible pot, persistent black market dealers \u2014 it\u2019s mostly been no big deal. Across the legalized West, consumers frequent their corner pot shop to talk varietals and buzz strength. Homegrown gardeners pass on suggestions to avoid bud rot as harvest nears. Tax revenue from sales \u2014 though not a panacea \u2014 flows to schools and roads and treatment programs.It all works, for the most part. And when California, now the world\u2019s sixth largest economy, passes its legal pot measure in November as expected, it will truly be game over for this absurd form of prohibition.So why are nearly 600,000 people arrested in the United States for simple possession of marijuana every year? And why is pot still illegal on the federal level? People in the loop of this policing circle know it is an absurd and Sisyphean use of law enforcement.The opioid crisis is a tougher problem. Some years ago, at the height of the crack scare, I was given an assignment to go to the worst drug dens in urban America. I ran into my share of scary and sketchy dudes, yes. But where I expected to see \u201csuper-predators\u201d and lifetime addled \u201ccrack babies,\u201d I instead found a fascinating variety of people struggling with an ancient affliction. Many of them could not get into treatment.A clear majority of Americans now favor pot legalization. The problem is the federal government, which still classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, alongside heroin and L.S.D. If pot was legalized nationwide, with a tax on every sale designated for treatment, it would free up the police to get at serious crimes, while ensuring that no addict would be denied treatment for lack of funds. As with most social reforms, it only seems impossible until it\u2019s obvious.Gail Collins is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, the Next Big Short", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byA Republican billionaire entrepreneur runs for president on a platform of huge tax cuts for the rich and for business and yet, when his candidacy appears ascendant, the markets swoon.When the prospects brighten for his Democratic challenger \u2014 who has not held a private sector job in more than two decades and who is proposing tax increases for the wealthy \u2014 stocks climb.This is yet another paradox of the tumultuous candidacy of Donald J. Trump: He has spent his entire career among business executives, and yet that constituency is voting with hard cash that he should not be president.I understand that Mr. Trump has pitched his campaign more to white working-class Americans. But no Republican presidential hopeful in memory has been so unpopular in the business community, as one of the prime thermometers of the private sector \u2014 the stock market \u2014 indicates.At a board meeting two weeks ago, I chatted separately with two prominent Republican businessmen. One, the chief executive of a Fortune 100 company, said that he had never voted for a Democrat but couldn\u2019t support Mr. Trump.The other, a private equity investor who had voted Republican only once, said that he was so scared of a Trump presidency that he has donated \u201cevery cent possible\u201d under the campaign finance rules to Hillary Clinton.Even before the tape of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 comments about women became public, many executives were appalled by his temperament and judgment. They also find his economic policy positions \u2013 from his trade-bashing to his budget-busting tax cuts \u2013 terrifying.According to a recent compilation by The Wall Street Journal, not a single chief executive of a Fortune 100 company has donated to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or endorsed him. In contrast, Hillary Clinton has received contributions from 11 of these corporate chieftains. In 2012, nearly a third of this group supported Mitt Romney, while just five donated to President Obama.As Mrs. Clinton\u2019s dominance of the first presidential debate became apparent, investors cheered; markets around the world rose and the dollar strengthened. A report from Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm, estimated that a Trump victory would cause stocks to lose 7 percent, while a Clinton victory would lead to a 4 percent increase.In a poll by Bloomberg Politics (conducted in August, before Mr. Trump\u2019s recent rocky spell), 46 percent of those with more than $50,000 invested in the market preferred Mrs. Clinton, compared with 36 percent for Mr. Trump.They are not alone. The National Association for Business Economics surveyed 414 members, and Mr. Trump didn\u2019t even come in second. Mrs. Clinton was supported by 55 percent, while the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, received 15 percent, and the Republican hopeful trailed at 14 percent.Another group of economists is similarly unenthusiastic. A Wall Street Journal survey of 45 former members of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers found not one who would endorse Mr. Trump. (Some did not respond or wouldn\u2019t say.)At the top of business\u2019 fears is Mr. Trump\u2019s stance on trade. While Mrs. Clinton has also opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Trump has taken trade-bashing to a new level, threatening retaliatory moves like putting 35 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and 45 percent on those from China.A recent study by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that, rather than bringing jobs back to the United States, the tariffs would result in trade wars that could cost our economy five million jobs and possibly lead to a recession.His other economic policies also often cause alarm. In repeatedly attacking the Federal Reserve as being \u201cpolitical,\u201d Mr. Trump has ignored decades of almost entirely consensus decision making by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. The committee is a model of rational, nonpartisan judgment compared with the Supreme Court, which often breaks along political lines.And while businessmen surely like tax cuts \u2014 especially for themselves \u2014 they worry over the magnitude of Mr. Trump\u2019s reductions and the lack of any specificity about how he would pay for them. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Trump tax policies would add $5.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.Lastly, people in business are repelled on both moral and economic grounds by Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deport more than 11 million illegal immigrants, which the conservative American Action Forum calculated would cost $400 billion to $600 billion, reduce gross domestic product by $1.6 trillion and take 20 years.All told, Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates that under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, unemployment would rise to nearly 7 percent, and about three million jobs would be lost.With metronomic regularity in his stump appearances, Mr. Trump promotes his qualifications as a billionaire businessman to fix what ails our economy. But his peers in the business world don\u2019t agree.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Profound Empathy of Yoko Tawada", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "\u201cMemoirs\u201d is actually three memoirs: the first narrated by Knut\u2019s circus-performing Russian grandmother, the second by Knut\u2019s mother and the final by Knut. Tawada wrote \u201cMemoirs\u201d in Japanese, then translated it into German on her own. The novel\u2019s matriarch polar bear also begins her book in a language other then German. When the bear tells her publisher that she wants to begin writing in German herself, rather than having it translated from Russian, she is told that part of the appeal of her work is that it\u2019s written in \u201cher mother tongue.\u201d She doesn\u2019t like that. \u201cI\u2019ve never spoken with my mother,\u201d she protests. Her publisher counters that a mother is a mother, even if you never speak with her. \u201cI don\u2019t think my mother spoke Russian,\u201d the polar bear says. The publisher is unpersuaded; she is discouraged. When, in another scene, a stranger presses the polar bear similarly about her language and origins, the stranger finally concludes: \u201cOh, I see, you\u2019re a member of an ethnic minority, is that it? ... Minorities are fabulous!\u201dThere were no polar bears out when we arrived at their enclosure. Instead there was just a sign noting that one of them didn\u2019t like noise. \u201cThey used to say it was unfair that Knut had to live with three old ladies,\u201d Tawada said. \u201cThey said the ladies bullied him.\u201d The last time Tawada saw Knut was two days before he died unexpectedly, of an undiagnosed encephalitis. \u201cOne thing that interested me was that Knut\u2019s mother had been a performer, but Knut didn\u2019t have to perform \u2014 and yet he still performed. He really played to the crowds.\u201dI asked her if maybe that was the origin of her idea to write something from Knut\u2019s perspective. She said: \u201cI had memories of myself as a child, of how much I loved to use words to make not only my parents but also other adults smile. I don\u2019t think of that as performing though. But it\u2019s also the case that I wondered, as a child, and still: Was it also different for the animals, under communism and under capitalism?\u201d She laughed. \u201cI really did!\u201d\u201cHow can you not like wolves?\u201d I asked.\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, I know. But they\u2019re fascists. Only the best woman is allowed to make children \u2014 no one else.\u201dTawada and I looked together at the informational sign, which described the loyalty and family values of the wolves. In the novel, Knut notes: \u201cThe wolf was proud of the fact that the members of his family looked as alike as photocopies. But I revere Matthias [his human mother] for having suckled and cared for a creature like me who was not at all similar to him.\u201dIt struck me that you can be offended by an animal only if you take it seriously, as you would a human. Tawada has written most often about foreigners and outsiders, but also about people who metamorphose into animals (\u201cThe Bath\u201d) or have intimate relations with people suspected to be animals (\u201cThe Bridegroom Was a Dog\u201d). An elementary-school teacher who tells her students to wipe with used Kleenex feels, in Tawada\u2019s portrayal of her, as familiar and alien as a household pet. In \u201cMemoirs,\u201d when a polar bear walks into a bookstore or a grocery store, there are no troubles stemming from a lack of opposable thumbs. As with Kafka\u2019s animal characters, we are freed to dislike them in the special way we usually reserve only for ourselves.The varied characters in Tawada\u2019s work \u2014 from different countries, of different sexes and species \u2014 are united by the quality that Benjamin describes as \u201ccrepuscular\u201d: \u201cNone has a firm place in the world, or firm, inalienable outlines. There is not one that is not either rising or falling, none that is not trading its qualities with its enemy or neighbor; none that has not completed its period of time and yet is unripe.\u201dOne of Tawada\u2019s earliest pieces, \u201cThe Talisman,\u201d published in the early 1990s, begins:In this city there are a great many women who wear bits of metal on their ears. They have holes put in their earlobes especially for this purpose. Almost as soon as I got here, I wanted to ask what these bits of metal on people\u2019s ears meant. But I didn\u2019t know if I could speak of this openly. My guidebook, for instance, says that in Europe you should never ask people you don\u2019t yet know very well anything related to their bodies or religion.Another of her short pieces, \u201cCanned Foreign,\u201d also among her earliest stories, opens with: \u201cIn any city one finds a surprisingly large number of people who cannot read. Some of them are still too young, others simply refuse to learn the letters of the alphabet.\u201dEach opening is an accurate description that is nevertheless unsettling. In \u201cMemoirs,\u201d Tawada plays with this same effect through the simple drama of having her polar-bear narrator attending a conference \u2014 \u201chow uninteresting the conference had been yet again\u201d \u2014 and finding herself tripped into thoughts of her childhood by the topic of the day\u2019s discussion: The Significance of Bicycles in the National Economy. (Tawada is very often very funny.) Here as elsewhere, Tawada is reminiscent of Nikolai Gogol, for whom the natural situation for a ghost story was a minor government employee saving up to buy a fancy coat, the natural destiny of a nose to haunt its owner as an overbearing nobleman.Tawada\u2019s biography most likely amplifies her estrangements. Born in Tokyo in 1960, she moved to Hamburg in 1982 and has lived in Germany ever since. Her father worked as a translator of nonfiction books and eventually opened a bookstore specializing in academic books from abroad. Even today, she writes drafts sometimes in German, sometimes in Japanese and sometimes in alternating languages within the same novel. She reads in at least five languages. She has a different relationship than most of the rest of us do to words, to nations and even to taxonomy. One of her translators, Susan Bernofsky, remembers that Tawada asked her American press, New Directions, to work from the German version of \u201cMemoirs,\u201d not the Japanese one, \u201cbecause she said she\u2019d already translated it into a Western language.\u201dYou could argue that it\u2019s always a historical moment of hating (and not seeing) the \u201cother,\u201d but the sentiment seems now at a particularly precarious crescendo. \u201cMemoirs\u201d offers its own version of \u201cseeing the other.\u201d It does this not so much by compelling us to see the humanity in polar bears; polar bears are easy to love. But Knut\u2019s mother, Tosca, devotes most of her memoir to imagining the inner life of her animal trainer, Barbara. The empathic ask there is to look with love and understanding at humans \u2014 even as they are implicated in the structures of brutality and dominance, moved most by their own small-minded fears and dreams and, of course, are hastening the melting of the poles. Even we deserve understanding and love.Then, abruptly, there was the famous Knut. He stood in the glass case next to a gorilla named Bobby. Bobby was also famous in his day; he died in the Berlin Zoo of appendicitis in 1935. Bobby and Knut, side by side, seemed like a stage duo playing for contrast. \u201cSomehow it\u2019s easier to imagine what Knut is thinking than to imagine what Bobby is thinking,\u201d Tawada said. \u201cBobby looks too much like us.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know Knut would look so skinny.\u201d\u201cHe was just an adolescent,\u201d Tawada said. \u201cI know, it\u2019s very sad to see him. But it\u2019s just a sculpture of his body, modeled by hand, and then with his real fur on it. It was important to people that Knut not be taxidermied. It\u2019s a modern version of a stuffed animal.\u201dThe first time I met Tawada was at a very crowded reading she gave at the Deutsches Haus of New York University. She read from fragments of prose-poetry written on a white glove she wore on her hand; she then took off the glove, turned it inside out and read what was written on the other side of the fingers. Barbara Epler, the publisher of New Directions, told me a story about seeing Tawada perform at the Goethe-Institut in New York with the avant-garde jazz pianist Aki Takase; Tawada\u2019s role involved grating stale bread and throwing Ping-Pong balls onto the piano strings.But the Tawada I spent the day with in Berlin was quite shy, and too gently considerate to be at all strange. Her performance self seems constructed to prevent her from having to pretend to be at ease \u2014 a way of exaggerating the unnaturalness of a performance, so as to avoid the lie of \u201cnaturalness.\u201dTawada never particularly intended to move to Germany. \u201cI was in university,\u201d she said. \u201cI loved the work of Dostoyevsky, of Bulgakov, also of Bruno Schulz, and so I wanted to go and study in the Soviet Union, or maybe Poland. But it was 1982 and not an easy time to go there.\u201d With her father\u2019s help, she found an internship in Hamburg with a business that was an intermediary between publishers and booksellers. Tawada already had some familiarity with German because she had studied it, along with English, in school. \u201cBecause of the 1968 student movement, there had been pressure on schools to offer more than just English,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea was, for example, if you wanted to learn about nuclear power and you were only reading in English, you were going to learn something very different than if you were reading in German.\u201dIn Hamburg at the time, it was common for students to attend classes at the university without officially enrolling. \u201cLiving in Germany in the \u201980s and \u201990s was so, so cheap,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of us studied 10 or 20 years! Just working part-time jobs as typists or assistants.\u201d She enrolled officially in the mid-1980s and met her German publisher, Konkursbuch, a small, brainy press that is otherwise known for publishing thrillers and high-end lesbian erotica. Konkursbuch published her first work, in a bilingual edition, in 1987, and she has stayed with that press ever since. Her first publication in Japan wasn\u2019t until four years later.Finally moving past the sad sculpture of Knut, Tawada and I made it over to a hippopotamus whose mouth was wide open; at the hippo\u2019s side was a much smaller hippopotamus. Tawada said there was a famous German hippo, but she couldn\u2019t remember if it was one of these: \u201cThe children know her from a book. She was saved from the zoo during the war.\u201d Only 91 of at least 3,700 Berlin Zoo animals were rescued. \u201cIt\u2019s very upsetting for children to learn that the wild animals, freed from the zoo, were shot,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a book in Japan about the Tokyo Zoo during the war. Maybe in a story about humans, it will always seem like the humans are at least somewhat guilty. But for the animals, the children can feel pure sadness.\u201dIs it possible for a great work of literature to be strongly reminiscent of Don Freeman\u2019s \u201cCorduroy,\u201d that old children\u2019s story of the bear in a department store, searching for a button? Corduroy sees the escalator as a mountain, the furniture floor as a palace. \u201cMemoirs\u201d makes as much use of the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of its bears as of their insight. When the matriarch bear arrives in the West \u2014 in our world \u2014 she describes the opaque (to her) phenomenon of window shopping: \u201cThe boredom of the passers-by was apparently considerable, since they scrutinized every product in the shop windows.\u201d When shopping for smoked salmon in the supermarket, she makes the beautiful and precise observation that it is found \u201cwhere the coldest goods were displayed in the brightest light.\u201d And in another scene, in a department store selling records, she observes: \u201cA gramophone stood on a pedestal, and right beside it, a life-size, black-spotted white dog made of plastic. You could see his image on each of the phonograph records, which I found pathologically excessive.\u201dMany books written for children are of no particular interest once you\u2019re an adult, but the great works for children have the density of poetry and the depth of parable; very little in \u201cadult\u201d literature rivals it. The greatest animal characters come from kids\u2019 books, and Kafka. Together they seem to suggest an alternative citizenship, that of the majorly minor, the brutally gentle. In that sense, Tawada\u2019s work does seem to me to be fittingly that of and by and for a \u201cchild.\u201dSo maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when Tawada told me that she was in the middle of writing essays on 10 children\u2019s books. A publisher in Japan invited her to write them after reading a piece Tawada wrote about a hike she took in Switzerland passing through the village of a famous children\u2019s-book author. \u201cWhen I was young, I wrote to a writer I loved, a children\u2019s writer, K.M. Peyton,\u201d Tawada told me. \u201cI remember this well, because this was the first letter I ever wrote in a foreign language, in English.\u201d\u201cDid she write you back?\u201d I asked.\u201cShe said she was very happy to get a letter from the end of the world! I thought Japan was the center of the world.\u201dFor her essays, she wrote about Curious George, who sees the city from up above rather than from down below, and she wrote about the Russian fable \u201cThe Snow Daughter,\u201d in which the main character disappears by jumping over a fire. She wrote about \u201cThe Hundred Dresses,\u201d which describes a Polish girl in Connecticut being picked on for always wearing the same dress, and about \u201cBedtime for Frances,\u201d a sweet story about a badger who doesn\u2019t want to go to sleep. And she also wrote about \u201cOley the Sea Monster,\u201d an almost unbearably sad tale about a harbor seal taken from his mother and mistaken for a monster before a benevolent aquarium keeper disobeys orders to kill Oley and instead returns him to the harbor. Each of the children\u2019s books was, in a sense, a story of alternative perspective, and of vulnerability. The happy endings felt heavy with sadness, the sad seemed to promise light.I wanted to say something to Tawada about how this reminded me of her work, but I felt as though English had turned into a language that was not my native one. Instead I asked Tawada if she had gone to the circus as a child. \u201cI remember going once,\u201d she said. Her parents took her to see a traveling Soviet circus when it visited Tokyo. \u201cI remember there was a bear who rode a tricycle,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that amazed me. And I knew even then that what was exciting was just that he was doing something normal, something even I could do.\u201dA few of the children\u2019s books Tawada had mentioned I didn\u2019t know. When I got home, I ordered the ones I could find in English. \u201cJeanne-Marie Counts Her Sheep,\u201d by Fran\u00e7oise Seignobosc, was a numbers book about a little girl dreaming of how many lambs her sheep, Patapon, will have, and what Jeanne-Marie will be able to buy with the money she makes from the lambs\u2019 wool. Jeanne-Marie imagines many lambs and many purchases. But it turns out there is just one lamb. Jeanne-Marie (who in the illustrations is now an old, hunched woman) is able to knit only one pair of socks. \u201cBut Jeanne-Marie tried to look very happy, anyway, for she did not want Patapon to feel sad. Patapon was so pleased with her one little Lamb!\u201dWas it a sad ending? Or a happy one?I wrote to Tawada to ask what about the book had held her attention across so many years. She wrote that she loved its use of repetition, because \u201cas a small child, the world won its shape repeating the same words and similar sentences.\u201d But she also liked the ending. \u201cThe sheep is happy with only one child, that is not capital for her, but love.\u201dProduced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Did Walmart Get Cleaner Stores and Higher Sales? It Paid Its People More", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsBENTONVILLE, Ark. \u2014 A couple of years ago, Walmart, which once built its entire branding around a big yellow smiley face, was creating more than its share of frowns.Shoppers were fed up. They complained of dirty bathrooms, empty shelves, endless checkout lines and impossible-to-find employees. Only 16 percent of stores were meeting the company\u2019s customer service goals.To fix it, executives came up with what, for Walmart, counted as a revolutionary idea. This is, after all, a company famous for squeezing pennies so successfully that labor groups accuse it of depressing wages across the American economy. As an efficient, multinational selling machine, the company had a reputation for treating employee pay as a cost to be minimized.But in early 2015, Walmart announced it would actually pay its workers more.That set in motion the biggest test imaginable of a basic argument that has consumed ivory-tower economists, union-hall organizers and corporate executives for years on end: What if paying workers more, training them better and offering better opportunities for advancement can actually make a company more profitable, rather than less?It is an idea that flies in the face of the prevailing ethos on Wall Street and in many executive suites the last few decades. But there is sound economic theory behind the idea. \u201cEfficiency wages\u201d is the term that economists \u2014 who excel at giving complex names to obvious ideas \u2014 use for the notion that employers who pay workers more than the going rate will get more loyal, harder-working, more productive employees in return.Walmart\u2019s experiment holds some surprising lessons for the American economy as a whole. Productivity gains have been slow for years; could fatter paychecks reverse that? Demand for goods and services has remained stubbornly low ever since the 2008 economic crisis. If companies paid people more, would it bring out more shoppers \u2014 benefiting workers and shareholders alike?Deep in a warren of windowless offices here, executives in early 2015 sketched out a plan to spend more money on increased wages and training, and offer more predictable scheduling. They refer to this plan as \u201cthe investments.\u201dThe results are promising. By early 2016, the proportion of stores hitting their targeted customer-service ratings had rebounded to 75 percent. Sales are rising again.That said, the immediate impact on earnings and the company\u2019s stock price have been less rosy.The question for Walmart is ultimately whether that short-run hit makes the company a stronger competitor in the long run. Will the investments turn out to be the beginning of a change in how Walmart and other giant companies think about their workers, or just a one-off experiment to be reversed when the next recession rolls around?The future health of the United States economy, and the well-being of its workers, may well depend on the answer.\u201cSometimes we don\u2019t get it all right,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in the video. \u201cSometimes we make policy changes or other decisions and they don\u2019t result in what we thought they were going to. And when we don\u2019t get it right, we adjust.\u201dWhat most store employees probably didn\u2019t know was that Mr. McMillon and his executive team, who had been promoted into their jobs a year earlier, were under extraordinary pressure from investors. They needed to reverse a slide in business and fight off threats in all directions \u2014 dollar discounters on the low end, Amazon online, direct competitors like Target and countless rivals specializing in one slice of Walmart\u2019s business, from grocery chains to home-improvement warehouses.People were shopping more \u2014 at Walmart\u2019s rivals.The company offers its millions of shoppers a simple way to make their dissatisfaction known. On the back of sales receipts is a message, \u201cTell us about your visit today,\u201d along with instructions to log on to a website and answer questions about the store: Was it clean? Were they able to get what they came for quickly? Were employees friendly?In early 2015, the answers that poured into Walmart\u2019s global headquarters were, in a word, awful. The people paid to analyze the company tended to agree, too. A report by analysts at Wolfe Research in 2014 included photographs from a visit to Walmart of a sad-looking display of nearly empty bins of oranges and lemons and disorganized shelves of crackers.The company had been busy raising profits by cutting labor costs. The number of employees in the United States fell by 7 percent from early 2008 to early 2013, for example, a span in which the square footage of stores rose 13 percent.Some of that reflects technological advances, like self-checkout kiosks. But when Mr. McMillon and a new team came in to reverse the slide starting in early 2014, they diagnosed the problem as having taken the cost-cutting logic too far.From store managers nationwide, they heard that years of cost-cutting meant Walmart had become viewed as a last-ditch option for employment \u2014 not the place that ambitious people might want to work. They were under such pressure to keep labor costs low that the employees they hired showed little loyalty or career-building devotion to their jobs.\u201cWe realized quickly that wages are only one part of it, that what also matters are the schedules we give people, the hours that they work, the training we give them, the opportunities you provide them,\u201d said Judith McKenna, who became chief operating officer in late 2014, in a recent interview. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to do is not just fix one part, but get all of these things moving together.\u201dThat is how Walmart decided to build 200 training centers to offer a clearer path for hourly employees who want to get on the higher-paying management track. And it said it would raise its hourly pay to a minimum of $10 for workers who complete a training course and raise department manager pay to $15 an hour, from $12. It said it would offer more flexible and predictable schedules to hourly workers.The news from Bentonville made headlines worldwide. The federal minimum wage had been $7.25 since 2009, and the labor market had awarded meager pay gains for people at the lower end of the spectrum for decade, facts that helped increase Walmart\u2019s bottom line. Now, the United States\u2019 largest private employer \u2014 Walmart has about 2.3 million workers around the world \u2014 was signaling it was about to gingerly try a different approach, putting $2.7 billion where its mouth was.Walmart says its average pay for a full-time nonmanagerial employee is now $13.69 an hour, up 16 percent since early 2014. In the same span, consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent.On a Thursday morning in late summer, at a Walmart Supercenter No. 359 in Fayetteville, Walmart trainees followed instructors around to learn what this particular store was doing right, and wrong, on this particular day. Teresa Rasberry praised a display of University of Arkansas tailgating equipment \u2014 coolers, grills and folding chairs \u2014 complemented by a fluttering effect created by putting electric fans beneath overhead banners for Razorbacks football.\u201cSee how it pulls the eye?\u201d she asked the trainees. \u201cStep back and think about how the customer sees it.\u201dNot so good was an end display of Mr. Clean, in which the various colors of the cleaning solution were jumbled together. Lining up the bottles so they make vertical stripes of color pulls more buyers in, she said.\u201cIt may sound silly,\u201d Ms. Rasberry said, \u201cbut it works! I\u2019ve tested it myself!\u201dBack in a classroom, Walmart department managers discussed why a $15.86 bottle of Clairol hair coloring might be a bad fit for a store located in a place with an $80,000 average income. Women in that income bracket are more likely to get their hair colored at a salon, an instructor, Amanda Forslund, explained.This is one of the first of Walmart\u2019s planned 200 training academies. New department managers will come in for two weeks of training covering general retail principles (customer service, inventory management) as well as specialized training for their specific area (the bakery or electronics, for example).Walmart\u2019s pay increases got most of the attention. But the new training and prospect of better career paths for hourly staff members could be more significant in the long term.It\u2019s not that the retail industry doesn\u2019t offer potential paths to good incomes. Starting pay for an assistant store manager at Walmart is $48,500, and the manager of one of its large stores can make comfortably above $100,000.The problem \u2014 described by Walmart managers and people outside the company who study labor markets \u2014 is that there is no clear path for an entry-level worker to get there. Much training is impromptu, and chains have tended to view their hourly workers as interchangeable cogs rather than resources worth investing in.That reputation has been particularly strong at Walmart.\u201cI didn\u2019t used to think this would be something I would want to do, to work at Walmart,\u201d said Garrett Watts, a 22-year-old newly promoted customer service manager at a store in Fayetteville. \u201cThere\u2019s a stigma with it. It used to be, if you worked at a Walmart, it was the equivalent of a fast-food restaurant.\u201dHe had gone to college for two years, suspended his education and was working as a desk clerk at a hotel when he switched to Walmart this year, lured not by the starting wage but by what he had heard from a friend about the potential to rise within a giant company. He was soon promoted to department manager and runs customer services for the store. He was hired at $9 an hour and now makes $13.\u201cI wanted something that wasn\u2019t a stopgap, but could be a real career,\u201d Mr. Watts said. He is starting to set his sights on one of those $48,000-a-year assistant store manager jobs.Walmart\u2019s announcement of what it refers to as \u201cthe investments,\u201d made during the all-staff videoconference in 2015, became something of a Rorschach test. To macroeconomists, it suggested that a falling unemployment rate was finally creating the response that theory suggests it should: employers raising wages to attract the workers they need.To labor activists, it was a sign that political campaigns to raise the minimum wage were paying off. To Wall Street analysts, it was the company owning up to the weaknesses long apparent in customer surveys and sales numbers.And in the company\u2019s own framing, it was about doing the right thing. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that one of the highest priorities today must be an investment in you, our associates,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in the video.It was all of these things, Ms. McKenna acknowledged.The improving economy made it harder for Walmart to get good workers without paying more. Political momentum toward a higher minimum wage meant that entry-level pay would soon be rising in many places anyway. And executives really had concluded that customer service woes and slumping sales were because of underinvestment in employees.To some critics, though, it still amounted to a half-measure, and one framed to maximize public attention. \u201cIn our minds this is certainly a step in the right direction, but it\u2019s typical Walmart in that it\u2019s minimal and there\u2019s a lot of spin on top of what\u2019s really happening,\u201d said Daniel Schlademan, a founder of the labor group Our Walmart, which wants the company to have a starting wage of $15 an hour.In particular, new hires typically do not receive the $10 minimum wage until they finish a training program that is supposed to take six months but frequently stretches longer. And a promised increase in the predictability and flexibility of hourly workers\u2019 schedules is being tested in only 650 smaller \u201cneighborhood market\u201d stores. It has not been rolled out to the full 4,500 Walmarts.\u201cThe economic reality is that they put a great deal of pressure on managers to keep labor costs and hours down,\u201d Mr. Schlademan said.And the actions fall well short of what Zeynep Ton, an associate professor of operations at the Sloan School of Business at M.I.T., calls a \u201cgood jobs strategy,\u201d in which a retailer builds its entire operating philosophy around better-compensated staff members who are empowered to make decisions. Companies like Costco and the grocer Wegman\u2019s have a base pay closer to that of what the retail activists seek and are successful by many measures. (Costco pays entry-level workers at least $13 an hour, with hourly pay reaching up to $22.50).But while Walmart\u2019s changes aren\u2019t as extensive as advocates would prefer, the company has shifted, in relative terms, up the industry\u2019s pay scale. In early 2014, Walmart\u2019s self-reported average full-time pay was 3.7 percent higher than the average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial workers at general merchandise stores calculated by the Labor Department. Now, it is 13.7 percent higher.\u201cIt\u2019s about being competitive in the market and making sure the talent pool of applicants was the right talent pool,\u201d Ms. McKenna said.That sounds an awful lot like a reference to the concept of an \u201cefficiency wage.\u201dAn employee making more than the market rate, after all, is likely to work harder and show greater loyalty. Workers who see opportunities to get promoted have an incentive not to mess up, compared with people who feel they are in a dead-end job. A person has more incentive to work hard, even when the boss isn\u2019t watching, when the job pays better than what you could make down the street.What is interesting about this is that, if you look at what\u2019s ailing the broader United States economy, it looks a lot like what you would expect if employers were, en masse, failing to understand the possibility of efficiency wages.Employers have succeeded at holding down labor costs. The \u201clabor share\u201d of national income \u2014 the portion of the national economic pie that goes to workers\u2019 pay, as opposed to corporate profits and elsewhere \u2014 has fallen. And average pay for nonmanagerial workers has grown more slowly than the overall economy.This has coincided with disappointing results for the economy. Worker productivity has been rising slowly for the last decade, and prime working-age Americans are staying out of the work force in droves. This implies that plenty of people don\u2019t see jobs out there that offer sufficient pay or opportunity to make the jobs worth doing.Individually, employers may think they are making rational decisions to pay people as little as possible. But that may be collectively shortsighted, if the unintended result is less demand for the goods and services they are all trying to sell to these same people.Just maybe, in other words, employers across the country are pushing down labor costs like Walmart, circa 2014 \u2014 and this is one of the major culprits behind disappointing economic results since the start of the 21st century.\u201cThe management philosophy that became popular in the 1980s that led companies to cut pay for low-wage workers, fight unions and contract out work may have been profitable for the companies that practiced it in the short run,\u201d said Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist and leading scholar of labor markets. \u201cBut in the long run it has raised inequality, reduced aggregate consumption and hurt overall business profitability.\u201dIf you buy that theory \u2014 and, to be clear, it is more theory than settled fact \u2014 it means that the results of the Walmart experiment matter a great deal. That implies that if large companies were to spend more to pay and train their workers, it could create gains for the economy as a whole. And it would ultimately be better for those same businesses.So, 19 months in, what is Walmart finding?Those customer surveys that were so terrible at the start of 2015 have improved, with \u201cclean, fast, friendly scores\u201d rising for 90 consecutive weeks. Surveys by outside groups, like the investment banker Cowen & Company, point to more satisfied customers as well.The profit landscape is less sunny. Operating income for Walmart\u2019s United States stores was down 6 percent in the most recent quarter, reflecting higher labor costs and other new investments. The company\u2019s stock has underperformed the overall United States stock market and an index of major retailers since the program was announced, suggesting investors are not convinced that these investments will pay a lucrative return anytime soon.But at the store level, managers describe a big shift in the kind of workers they can bring in by offering $10 an hour with a solid path to $15 an hour. \u201cWe\u2019re attracting a different type of associate,\u201d said Tina Budnaitis, the manager of Walmart No. 5260 in Rogers. \u201cWe get more people coming in who want a career instead of a job.\u201dSenior executives speak in the language you might expect from a manager worried about paying an efficiency wage. \u201cOur associates are an asset,\u201d said Ms. McKenna, the chief operating officer. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to have the very lowest cost of an asset. You try to have the right asset. So rather than thinking about the lowest cost, the question is how do you get the best productivity.\u201dThe question for Walmart, and perhaps the economy as a whole, is whether these changes turn out to be one-off, or part of a shifting philosophy of how work and compensation should work in a 21st-century megacorporation.\u201cOut of the gate, they\u2019ve seen some improvement, but I think that\u2019s because they were doing Retail 101 so poorly,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones & Company. \u201cThe better question is what happens next year and the following year. The low-hanging fruit has been harvested.\u201dMs. McKenna declined to be specific about what might come next. And of course in a volatile corporate world, an unexpected recession or management change, or rise of a new competitor, could upend any plans. But she suggests that the company\u2019s changes should not be viewed as a one-time event.\u201cThis is a journey,\u201d she said.In the short term, the Walmart experiment shows pretty clearly that paying people better improves both the work force and the shoppers\u2019 experience, but not profitability, at least not yet.Advertisement"}

A few minutes in the sun will fry your skin. Brains and fingers go numb. At night, the stars are so close they seem tangled in your hair.\u201cLike snakes you are.

You guys can\u2019t take care of this place.\u201dNo ground was broken that day or since.But to its opponents, the telescope would be yet another eyesore despoiling an ancient sacred landscape, a gigantic 18-story colossus joining the 13 telescopes already on Mauna Kea.Later this month, proponents and opponents of the giant telescope will face off in a hotel room in the nearby city of Hilo for the start of hearings that will lead to a decision on whether the telescope can be legally erected on the mountain.Over the years, some have portrayed this fight as a struggle between superstition and science. Others view the telescope as another symbol of how Hawaiians have been unfairly treated since Congress annexed the islands \u2014 illegally in the eyes of many \u2014 in 1898. And still others believe it will bring technology and economic development to an impoverished island.In the 1990s, however, astronomers learned how to build telescopes with thin mirrors that relied on computer-adjusted supports to keep them from sagging or warping.Mauna Kea\u2019s telescopes have helped advance important discoveries in humanity\u2019s study of the universe.There are only a few places on Earth that are dark, dry and calm enough to be fit for a billion-dollar telescope.Rising 33,000 feet from the seafloor, Mauna Kea is one of the biggest mountains in the solar system. The dormant ancient volcano has been the center of Polynesian culture \u2014 the umbilical cord connecting Earth and sky \u2014 seemingly forever.The mountain is part of so-called \u201cceded lands\u201d that originally belonged to the Hawaiian Kingdom and are now administered by the state for the benefit of Hawaiians.On its spare, merciless summit, craters and cinder cones of indefinable age keep company with a variety pack of architectural shapes housing telescopes.In 1968 the University of Hawaii took out a 65-year lease on 11,000 acres for a dollar a year. Some 500 acres of that are designated as a science preserve. It includes the ice age quarry from which stone tools were being cut a thousand years ago, and hundreds of shrines and burial grounds.The first telescope went up in 1970. Many rapidly followed.But some Hawaiians worried that knowledge was coming at too great a cost.\u201cAll those telescopes got put up with no thought beyond reviving the Hilo economy,\u201d said Michael Bolte, an astronomer from the University of California, Santa Cruz, who serves on the TMT board.\u201cNot a lot of thought was given to culture issues.\u201dSome native Hawaiians complained that their beloved mountain had grown \u201cpimples,\u201d and that the telescope development had interfered with cultural and religious practices that are protected by state law.Construction trash sometimes rolled down the mountain, said Nelson Ho, a photographer and Sierra Club leader who complained to the university. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just kept playing king of the mountain.\u201dAn audit by the State of Hawaii in 1998 scolded the university for failing to protect the mountain and its natural and cultural resources. An environmental impact study performed by NASA in 2007 similarly concluded that 30 years of astronomy had caused \u201csignificant, substantial and adverse\u201d harm to Mauna Kea.\u201cCinder cones are burial sites. It\u2019s time to not let this go on,\u201d she said. The group prepared for court by reading popular books about trials.In 2007, Hawaii\u2019s third district court found the management plan for the outriggers was flawed and revoked the building permit.\u201cNASA packed up and left,\u201d Ms. Pisciotta said.The prospective builders of the TMT knew they had their work cut out for them.In 2007, the Moore Foundation hired Peter Adler, a consultant and sociologist, to look into the consequences of putting the telescope in Hawaii.The astronomers picked a telescope site that was less anthropologically sensitive, on a plateau below the summit with no monuments or other obvious structures on it. They agreed to pay $1 million a year, a fifth of which would go to the state\u2019s Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the rest to stewardship of the mountain.Quietly, they also pledged another $2 million a year toward science and technology education and work force development on the island of Hawaii. The Moore Foundation also put some $2 million into the Imiloa Astronomy Center, a museum and planetarium run by the University of Hawaii.Dr. Bolte, a mild-mannered U.C.S.C. professor with a soothing lilt to his voice, became one of the most visible promoters of the project in community meetings.He recalled going to a meeting in Hilo once where tensions were very high. Afterward, he said, he was afraid to go out to his car.Sure enough, a crowd rushed him when he got there. \u201cWhat kind of astronomy do you do?\u201d they asked eagerly.\u201cThe aloha spirit really exists,\u201d Dr. Bolte said.\u201cExploring the universe is a wonderful thing humans do,\u201d he added. Nevertheless, \u201cthere was a core we never won over.\u201d\u201cIn retrospect, we might have underestimated the strength of the sovereignty movement.\u201dIn the years since the first telescopes went up on Mauna Kea, Hawaiian people and culture had experienced a resurgence of pride known as the Hawaiian Renaissance.\u201cAnd that was the first spark of shutting up everybody who said that we were inferior, that we were not intelligent,\u201d Mr. Mangauil, the protester, said.In 1978, the state recognized Hawaiian, which once had been banned from schools, as an official language.Telescopes on a sacred mountain constitute a form of \u201ccolonial violence,\u201d in the words of J. Kehaulani Kauanui, an anthropologist at Wesleyan University.Or as Robert Kirshner, a Harvard professor who is now also chief science officer at the Moore Foundation, put it, \u201cThe question in that case become not so much whether you did the environmental impact statement right, but whose island is it?\u201dHaving cut their teeth fighting the outrigger project, Ms. Pisciotta\u2019s group, known informally as the Mauna Kea Hui, was prepared when the TMT Corporation formally selected the mountain for its site in 2009.Many Hawaiians welcomed the telescope project. At a permit hearing, Wallace Ishibashi Jr., whose family had an ancestral connection to Mauna Kea, compared the Thirty Meter\u2019s mission to the search for aumakua, the ancestral origins of the universe.\u201cHawaiians,\u201d he said, \u201chave always been a creative and adaptive people.\u201dMs. Pisciotta and her friends argued among other things that an 18-story observatory, which would be the biggest structure on the whole island of Hawaii, did not fit in a conservation district.In a series of hearings in 2010 and 2011, the state land board approved a permit for the telescope but then stipulated that no construction could begin until a so-called contested case hearing, in which interested parties could present their arguments, was held.The state won that hearing, and a groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for Oct. 7, 2014.\u201cI thought it was reasonable to restrict access to those who were invited,\u201d he said.Mr. Mangauil, who makes his living teaching hula dancing and Hawaiian culture, said later that he had wanted only to make the astronomers feel uncomfortable to be on the mountain and to get protesters\u2019 signs in view of the television cameras.In an interview, he said he had nothing against science or astronomy, but did not want it on his mountain.\u201cOur connection to the mountain is like, that\u2019s our elder, the mother of our resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the wau akua, the realm of where the gods live.\u201dThere are no shrines on the very summit, he pointed out, which should be a lesson: Not even the most holy people are supposed to go there.Unable to get to the groundbreaking, the Hawaiians formed their own blockade. Tempers flared.\u201cWe were seeing the native Hawaiian movement flexing its muscles,\u201d Dr. Bolte said.Seeing people hiking up the mountain past the port-o-potties, Mr. Mangauil stormed after them and wound up on the hood of a ranger truck, even more angry.Lanakila\u2019s barefoot run set the tone for two years of unrest and demonstrations.Protesters calling themselves Guardians of the Mountain set up a permanent vigil across the road from the Mauna Kea visitor center, stopping telescope construction crews and equipment from going up. Dozens were arrested.Gov. David Ige has tried to appease both sides. While saying that \u201cwe have in many ways failed the mountain,\u201d he said the Thirty Meter Telescope should go forward, but at least three other telescopes would have to come down.Astronomers and business leaders grew frustrated that the state was not doing enough to keep the road open for construction trucks and workers.\u201cThe result of the faulty law enforcement surrounding Mauna Kea is fostering tension, aggression, racism and business uncertainty,\u201d business organizations and the Hawaii Chamber of Commerce wrote to the governor. \u201cAmbiguity surrounding the rule of law has prompted a poor economic climate.\u201dStopping trucks on the steep slope was dangerous, said Dr. Bolte, adding that \u201cpeople were basically trapped at the summit.\u201dDr. Simons, the Canada-France-Hawaii director, grew increasingly worried about the effect of the protests on the astronomers, who became reluctant to be identified as observatory staffers.\u201cIt really tugged at us to see the staff going from being proud to scared in a matter of weeks,\u201d he said.Meanwhile Ms. Pisciotta\u2018s coalition was plugging through the courts.On Dec. 2, the Hawaiian Supreme Court revoked the telescope building permit, ruling that the state had violated due process by handing out the permit before the contested case hearing.By mid-December, Clarence Ching, another member of the opposition, stood in a crowd with other Hawaiians and watched trucks carrying equipment retreat from the mountain.\u201cDavid had beaten Goliath,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were even happy and sad at the same time \u2014 sad, for instance, that somebody had to lose \u2014 as we had fought hard and long.\u201dThe court\u2019s decision set the stage for a new round of hearings, now scheduled to start in mid-October. The case, presided over by Riki May Amano, a retired judge appointed by the Land Board, is likely to last longer than the first round, which consumed seven days of hearings over a few weeks, partly because there are more parties this time around.Among them is the pro-telescope Hawaiian group called Perpetuating Unique Educational Opportunities or PUEO, who contend the benefits of the TMT to the community have been undersold.Whoever wins this fall\u2019s contested case hearing, the decision is sure to be quickly appealed to the Hawaiian Supreme Court.In an interview, Edward Stone, a Caltech professor and vice president of the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory, the group that will build the telescope, set April 2018 as the deadline for beginning construction. Depending on how it goes in Hawaii or elsewhere, the telescope could be ready sometime in the last half of the next decade.\u201cWe need to start building this thing somewhere,\u201d he said.\u201cWe still hope Hawaii will work,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat we need is a timely permit, and we need access to the mountain once we have a permit.\u201dBut there is no guarantee that even if the astronomers succeed in court they will prevail on the mountain. In an email exchange, J. Douglas Ing, lawyer for the TMT Observatory, said they were \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that local agencies would uphold the law, but the astronomers have also been investigating alternative sites in Mexico, Chile, India, China and the Canary Islands.\u201cIt\u2019s wise of the TMT to be exploring other sites,\u201d said Richard Wurdeman, the lawyer for the Mauna Kea Hui.I asked Ms. Pisciotta what would happen if the giant telescope finally wins.\u201cIt would be really hard for Hawaiian people to swallow that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been our way to lift our prayers up to heaven and hope they hear us.\u201dDr. Bolte said he had learned to not make predictions about Hawaii.Referring to the Hawaiian term for a wise elder, he said, \u201cI had one kupuna tell me it was a great sign for TMT that so many pueo sought me out that trip, and another tell me it was a sign that we should leave the island immediately before a calamity falls on TMT.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Mauna Kea\u2019s size relative to other mountains in the solar system. It is one of the biggest, but Mauna Loa in Hawaii, which measures 56,000 feet from its base on the sea floor, is taller, so Mauna Kea is not \u201cthe second biggest mountain in the solar system\u201d after Olympus Mons on Mars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Men Need Help. Is Hillary Clinton the Answer?", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisIf Hillary Clinton wins this election and becomes the first female president of the United States, American men may well be one of her most urgent problems.Consider some startling statistics.More than a fifth of American men \u2014 about 20 million people \u2014 between 20 and 65 had no paid work last year.Seven million men between 25 and 55 are no longer even looking for work, twice as many black men as white.There are 20 million men with felony records who are not in jail, with dim prospects of employment, and more of these are black men.Half the men not in the labor force report they are in bad physical or mental health.Men account for only 42 percent of college graduates, handicapping them in a job market that rewards higher levels of education.Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and now a professor of economics at Harvard, estimates that a third of men between 25 and 54 without college educations could be out of work by midcentury.Well-paying jobs that don\u2019t demand a college degree have been shrinking for generations \u2014 and technology is accelerating that trend. Driverless cars, for instance, could eliminate trucking as we know it, a refuge for many blue-collar men.The crisis is not confined to the white men backing Donald J. Trump, who has commanding majorities among men without college educations. The challenge of masculinity in America extends beyond race and political party.Economists and scholars have assembled a trove of disturbing data about the plight of men, even as they acknowledge that women\u2019s employment has stalled for the past 15 years as well.Nicholas N. Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute has released the latest compendium, \u201cMen Without Work.\u201d Drawing on multiple data sets, he sketches an unsettling portrait not just of male unemployment, but also of lives deeply alienated from civil society. The seven million men who are not even looking for work \u2014 about 60 percent of whom do not have four-year college degrees \u2014 spent an average of five and a half hours a day watching television or movies. Very few cared for children or other household members, or did housework. A third admitted to illegal drug use.Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s backers talk about losing out in the new economy, echoing the points the candidate makes on the campaign trail.Joe Peterson and Al Paslow, 61 years old and friends since high school, waited for hours the other day to attend a Trump rally in Ambridge, Pa. \u2014 a town named for the American Bridge Company. It was a resonant spot, in the heart of what was once a thriving steel and energy powerhouse. Mr. Paslow\u2019s mother grew up in Ambridge on the very street where the rally took place. Their family, friends and relatives all worked in the abundant steel mills in the Pittsburgh area \u2014 Mr. Peterson\u2019s father as an electrician, Mr. Paslow\u2019s father as a blacksmith.\u201cNow these mills are gone, replaced by stores, shops and offices that could have been placed almost anywhere,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cNo industry here now; it\u2019s all been lost.\u201dThe two friends most recently worked as independent contractors in the oil and gas industry, earning six-figure salaries. Mr. Peterson had a high school education; Mr. Paslow a college degree. Last year, they were both laid off \u2014 no severance or unemployment, because they were not technically employees.\u201cI worked for the oil industry, which is dead because of Hillary,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. Now, he said, he was \u201cconsidered nothing.\u201d He is worried about whether his son will find work; both friends fear that they may never get a job again.The friends were thrilled that Mr. Trump promised at the rally to bring the oil and gas industry back on his very first day in office. \u201cUnbelievably, that was exactly what we wanted to hear,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cOur hearts were uplifted.\u201dAdd to economic anxiety a spate of illness and disability. American men \u2014 particularly men without a college degree \u2014 are simply less healthy than women.Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton, recently conducted a study of working-age men. \u201cI came away thinking our biggest social problem is men,\u201d he said.A huge number are on painkillers, including 43.5 percent of men who have stopped looking for work. Both physical and emotional pain \u2014 sadness, stress and dissatisfaction with their lives \u2014 were particularly acute among men without college degrees, the unemployed and those not looking for work.Poor health makes it harder to work. Mr. Krueger found that 11.5 percent of men who were not employed cited illness and disability as a factor. Mr. Eberstadt\u2019s analysis found that nearly two-thirds of American households where men were not in the labor force reported receiving money from at least one disability program in 2013.American men are also far more likely than women to be in jail or to be convicted of a felony, compounding the difficulty of finding work. The government keeps almost no data on the 20 million men who are not in prison but have felony convictions. Mr. Eberstadt estimates that for men with a criminal record between 45 and 54, the odds of being out of the work force are 35 percent for white males and 40 percent for black males.A segment of American men feel under cultural as well as economic assault.Most economists, though, don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to go back to the days when manufacturing was king \u2014 and few women would want to give up economic or societal power, either. So what could help American men?Many of the policies aimed at spurring economic growth and supporting low-wage workers would assist American men without college educations in particular.Liberal economists tend to coalesce around other solutions, such as raising the minimum wage and expanding eligibility for the earned-income tax credit, a proven way to reduce poverty. Mr. Summers is one of many who would push the Federal Reserve to continue stimulating the economy to boost employment, rather than focusing on curbing inflation. He also argues for government subsidies to bolster the wages of less-skilled employees.Wage insurance could address the plight of men like Mr. Paslow; as Mr. Krueger explains it, payroll taxes could be used to make up some of the gap between the higher hourly wages earned in manufacturing and the lower wages more common in the service industry.Liberal and conservative economists agree on the failings of the education system and urge more focus on the school-to-work transition, since so many men without a college education are flailing.Apprenticeship systems and expanded access to community colleges \u2014 both ideas backed by President Obama \u2014 could help train workers for high-demand jobs without requiring four-year colleges, Mr. Cherlin said. But conservatives worry about the cost of subsidizing community colleges.Mr. Summers would like to see more government investment in areas with bad school systems, but conservatives prize local control.Re-examining the effects of mass incarceration \u2014 on black men in particular \u2014 and reconsidering mandatory sentences have attracted bipartisan support, though such efforts stalled in Congress. Mr. Summers calls for improving incarceration-to-work programs.While debate continues to rage about Obamacare, Mr. Krueger is convinced that expanding health insurance could provide American men with more preventive treatments and promote healthier lifestyles.Economically, \u201cwomen have adjusted better than men,\u201d Ms. Sawhill said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are winning.\u201d Women dominate the (often lower-paying) service jobs that are the backbone of the new economy. Men make up just 20 percent of elementary and middle-school teachers, 9 percent of nurses, 16 percent of personal aides and 6 percent of personal assistants, Ms. Sawhill and Mr. Reeves noted.Succeeding in the new economy and culture may well require rethinking conventional ideas about masculinity. Mr. Cherlin bemoans men\u2019s \u201ccontinued reluctance to take jobs they think are beneath the dignity of real men.\u201dFrom the conservative end of the spectrum, Mr. Eberstadt flags the disability system. He\u2019d like to see it redefined as a \u201cwork first\u201d program, much like welfare reform under Bill Clinton. He cites a Swedish program that ties disability benefits to showing up for job training and job placement.Mr. Eberstadt would also like to intensify social pressure on the cadre of men who have stopped looking for work. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we had the same sort of conversation about stigmatizing or shaming unworking men that we had 20 years ago about mothers on welfare?\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not idle; they had little kids.\u201dIf she wins, focusing on American men could pay off for Mrs. Clinton. She could shore up support with traditional Democratic voters such as African-American men. Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic Party have lost considerable ground with a constituency they used to own, blue-collar men. Angry white men are not likely to trust Mrs. Clinton, Beltway politicians or the political system. But they will need their help.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad al-Thani, Former Emir of Qatar, Dies at 84", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported bySheikh Khalifa bin Hamad al-Thani, who as the emir of Qatar for 23 years oversaw its independence from Britain and the rapid modernization of its economy, died on Sunday. He was 84.His grandson Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the current emir, declared three days of public mourning.During Sheikh Khalifa\u2019s reign, Qatar \u2014 a country on a peninsula jutting out of the much larger Arabian Peninsula into the Persian Gulf \u2014 experienced rapid economic growth, helped by its vast oil reserves. In 1981, it joined five neighboring countries \u2014 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 to form the Gulf Cooperation Council, although historical disputes over territory persisted.After Iraq, under President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait in 1990, Sheikh Khalifa joined other Arab leaders in making his country\u2019s military bases available to the American-led coalition that liberated Kuwait. United States, Canadian and French fighter planes flew missions from Qatar during the conflict.After the war, Qatar signed a security pact with the United States, and today it hosts the forward headquarters of the United States Central Command and aircraft involved in airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.Sheikh Khalifa was born in Al Rayyan, Qatar, in 1932, into the House of Thani, the country\u2019s royal family since the early 19th century.He rose through the ranks of the ruling family, commanding its security forces and overseeing its civilian courts. He became the country\u2019s deputy ruler on Oct. 24, 1960, and its finance minister two weeks later.Sheikh Khalifa became the first prime minister of Qatar \u2014 then a British protectorate \u2014 on May 29, 1970, after the job was created by the emir at the time, his cousin Sheikh Ahmad bin Ali al-Thani. Sheikh Khalifa also served as finance minister and oil minister.From that point on, he was effectively the ruler. When Qatar declared independence on Sept. 3, 1971, Sheikh Ahmad was on vacation in Switzerland, and it was left to Sheikh Khalifa to issue the proclamation.Sheikh Khalifa deposed Sheikh Ahmad on Feb. 22, 1972. He announced an immediate increase in salaries for civil servants and the 15,000 members of the police and armed forces, as well as plans to modernize government administration and cut consumer prices.Oil exports boomed, making Qatar one of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations per capita. (Qatar today has about 2.2 million residents, but most are workers from countries like India, Pakistan and Iran, and not citizens.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Not a Regular Day\u2019: What a Trump Rally Clash Reveals About a Divided Nation", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "The rally where these two lives collided by happenstance erupted into one of the most violent episodes of this contentious presidential election. Video footage of protesters punching, egging and tackling Trump supporters went viral, sparking outrage among Republicans and soul-searching among Democrats.Today, the clashes between ordinary people like Mr. McBride and Mr. Tong are playing out in the California courts, in a series of criminal prosecutions brought about as Republican officials accused a city led by Democrats of failing to protect Trump supporters at the rally.The San Jose rally and its aftermath may be the most powerful illustrations of the dangerous polarization that has gripped the country during the 2016 election.But a closer look at Mr. Tong, one of rally\u2019s 24 victims, and Mr. McBride, one of 22 people charged with crimes after the event, suggests that there is much that the two men share. The economic struggles and personal dreams that guided them that day are not so different, after all.On June 2, Mr. Tong woke up in his parents\u2019 house, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.He is 46, an age he does not like saying out loud because it reminds him how far he is from where he had hoped to be. He had dreamed of becoming a product designer and starting his own company. But art school was too expensive and he left after only a year.\u201cCompanies like Facebook and these so-called social networking companies here in Silicon Valley became the economy,\u201d he said.\u201cIf your occupation is in anything other than that,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are not a whole lot of jobs.\u201dMr. Tong\u2019s faith in the American Dream has been shaken. But that day, he had a ticket to see Mr. Trump speak about making America great again. Despite the sweltering heat, Mr. Tong parked in the garage at the San Jose Convention Center and walked a few blocks to the rally.That same morning, Anthony McBride, who is anti-Trump, woke up in his friend\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.He is 21, too young to carry the stain of life\u2019s disappointments. He dreams of being a fashion designer and starting his own company. But art school is too expensive. He works two jobs \u2014 at a car dealership and a clothing store \u2014 to save for it.He also designs shirts that read \u201cBE YRSLF.\u201dHe hopes they will inspire \u201ca movement where people are just being themselves and are not following trends or what society says they have to be,\u201d he said.Mr. McBride\u2019s faith in the American Dream remains intact, but it is marred by the bigotry that he sees as a product of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. On the morning of the rally, Mr. McBride put on a \u201cBE YRSLF\u201d T-shirt and boarded the light rail to the convention center, eager to see for himself what a Trump event was really like.\u201cIt was hot that day,\u201d Mr. Tong recalled. \u201cI was still debating whether or not I wanted to go, and I just kind of thought, \u2018Oh, I got to show my support.\u2019\u201dIn the convention hall, Mr. Tong delighted in the diverse makeup of the crowd.\u201cI was really surprised,\u201d he said. A rally he had attended earlier in the spring in Southern California, he said, \u201cwas mostly Caucasian and middle-aged.\u201d But in San Jose, a city that is about 30 percent Asian and 30 percent Hispanic, more minorities turned out.Outside the hall, beyond the police barricades, protesters waved signs demanding socialism. Young men handed out the Revolutionary Communist Party\u2019s newspaper.Like many Asians in San Jose, Mr. Tong was born in Vietnam. He was 4 when Communists captured Saigon.His family had three strikes against it: His father had worked with the United States military. His grandfather had an import-export business. And they hailed from China, a country that once colonized Vietnam. Officials forced Mr. Tong\u2019s family to move to a remote hut with a dirt floor.\u201cThe Communist philosophy was, \u2018If you are a teacher, a professor, an intellectual, wealthy, then we are going to make you suffer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tong said.When he was 9, his family made it to California. Like others who had fled Vietnam, they embraced the Republican Party\u2019s strong anticommunism stance.Mr. Tong considers himself a moderate. During the booming 1990s, he once cast a ballot for Bill Clinton. He says he does not agree with Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about immigrants and Mexicans.Still, Mr. Tong feels anxious about the racial unrest flaring up across the country. Like many Trump supporters, he blames President Obama.\u201cHe seems more polarizing,\u201d Mr. Tong said of Mr. Obama. \u201cHe stirs people up.\u201dMr. Tong once felt boundless optimism about the United States. His parents, who worked entry-level jobs in electronics, had been able to buy a three-bedroom home in a well-off San Jose suburb. But now Mr. Tong cannot afford to rent \u2014 let alone buy \u2014 a home of his own. He was drawn to the June rally by Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to make America as strong as it was when Mr. Tong arrived in the country.Mr. Trump took the stage and declared, \u201cWe have a country that\u2019s not working anymore.\u201d\u201cWe have a chance to be greater than ever before,\u201d he told the crowd.Mr. Tong left the rally clutching a sign: \u201cThe silent majority stands with Trump.\u201dHe meandered back to his car, chatting with a teenager from Mexico who held a sign opposing Trump. They joked about trading signs. Nothing seemed threatening or out of the ordinary. But when Mr. Tong reached the parking garage, he witnessed something shocking: protesters trying to steal Trump hats off the heads of an older Hispanic couple.He added: \u201cAt that moment, I felt the whole crowd surrounding me. You\u2019re fearing for your life.\u201dMr. Tong ran into the garage. He noticed a tall black man coming behind him.It was Mr. McBride\u2019s day off, he recalled. \u201cI slept in, watched some TV,\u201d he said.While checking Twitter, he noticed that Mr. Trump was coming to town.Mr. McBride hoped to get into the rally \u201cto go experience what he says for myself,\u201d he said. But a wall of police officers blocked the entrance. So he drifted to the \u201cfree speech\u201d area, where protesters \u2014 including some friends from Oak Grove, where he had gone to high school \u2014 gathered. Mr. McBride had fond memories of Oak Grove, even though he was asked to leave it.In his senior year, he had attended a basketball game against a suburban school from a more affluent community. Rival fans chanted that Oak Grove students were on welfare. Mr. McBride said he and his friends responded with their own chant, \u201cWe drive sober\u201d \u2014 a painful reference to a drunken-driving death the rival school had recently suffered. Afterward, Mr. McBride said, school authorities asked him to finish his credits with independent study. (The school\u2019s principal declined to comment.)At the time, Mr. McBride lived with his aunt, who told him he had to be in school to stay with her. He ended up on the couch in the apartment of his best friend\u2019s mother. Three years later, he is still there.Mr. McBride considers himself a moderate. He opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants. He believes that the entrepreneurial spirit should be rewarded.But it is racism \u2014 not government regulation of the economy \u2014 that worries him. The son of an African-American father and an Irish mother he has not seen since he was 4, Mr. McBride blames the recent racial unrest on injustice, not Democratic politicians.\u201cPeople are just frustrated,\u201d he said. \u201cWith police brutality. With feeling not equal to white people.\u201dTo Mr. McBride\u2019s generation, the spate of high-profile police killings of black people shows the limits of politics and the need for activism. Protests \u2014 not the election of a black president \u2014 have brought a modicum of justice.Joining the gathering crowd outside the convention center, Mr. McBride felt he had justice on his side.At first, he said, it felt like a carnival outside the arena. People danced to Mexican music. Street vendors sold watermelon.But then the rally inside ended. Trump supporters poured out. Protesters chanted obscenities at them. They hurled insults back.A blonde woman named Rachel Casey, who was wearing a Trump shirt, filmed herself sticking her middle finger up at the crowd. Protesters traded insults with her as she drifted past the police barricades to the Marriott Hotel next door. Protesters surrounded her in the doorway.Then someone threw a piece of watermelon.\u201cI was in the front, just clapping,\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cSomeone in the back started throwing eggs. One of them hit me. I was like, \u2018Wow, who brought eggs?\u2019\u201dA hotel security guard opened the door and Ms. Casey slipped inside. The crowd marched on. A black female protester burning an American flag got into a shoving match with a white female Trump supporter. A white teenager got scared and started running. A black teenager tackled him. A first-generation Mexican who opposes Mr. Trump punched in the nose a third-generation Mexican who supports the candidate.The police later traced the most violent run-ins to \u201clocal gangsters\u201d with long criminal records, according to Sgt. Brian Anderson, who headed the San Jose police team that pored over thousands of hours of videos from the rally.Some Oak Grove High School students were also charged. \u201cSeveral of them were good students and athletes, but they decided to forget their upbringing,\u201d Sergeant Anderson said.Mr. McBride might have fit into in that category. He was an athlete, but he said his father, who works at a warehouse, allowed him to play sports only if he got good grades.But Mr. McBride admits that he got angry that day at the rally. He says Trump supporters mistook him for Mexican and shouted insults at him.\u201cI heard, \u2018Go back to your country, wetback,\u2019\u201d he said. He started taking every Trump sign he saw and ripping it in half.He followed a wave of protesters into a parking garage. That\u2019s where he spotted an Asian man with a Trump sign.\u201cI was kind of disappointed in him,\u201d Mr. McBride recalled. \u201cHe\u2019s a minority, and I didn\u2019t see why he\u2019s supporting Trump.\u201dMr. McBride snatched Mr. Tong\u2019s sign. Mr. Tong grabbed it back. For a split second, they held it together, in a tug of war. Mr. McBride could see the fear in Mr. Tong\u2019s eyes.Months later, Mr. Tong looked back at the encounter and wondered about Mr. McBride. Was he a college student?\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem like a gangster,\u201d Mr. Tong recalled. \u201cThere are protesters who are just upset, and I think if I was in their position, I\u2019d be upset, too. But no protester \u2014 no matter how angry they are \u2014 can break things and harass people.\u201dMaybe because of the stress of what happened to him at the rally, Mr. Tong dreams of escaping on Election Day. He thinks about camping in Death Valley on Nov. 8 just so he can get away from the news. But sometimes he has the opposite desire. He wants to visit an old friend \u2014 a black man he met in a long-ago photography class \u2014 so they can have political debates about Mr. Obama that he keeps bottled up inside.Meanwhile, Mr. McBride thinks back on that moment and regrets being the source of Mr. Tong\u2019s fear.\u201cI\u2019d probably have been afraid, too,\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with any of the fighting.\u201dBut two weeks after the rally, police officers showed up at Mr. McBride\u2019s job at the mall and asked him to answer some questions. Mr. McBride, who has no criminal record, cooperated. He did not ask for a lawyer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared because I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said.He said he told them everything he could remember. Afterward, he expected to be allowed to go home. Instead, they handcuffed him and took him to jail, where he remained for six days, accused of vandalism, battery and the attempted theft of Mr. Tong\u2019s sign.On a recent Wednesday, Mr. McBride sat in court on a row of benches filled with black and Hispanic men, nearly all of them represented by a single public defender.\u201cMcBride? You\u2019re our Trump guy, right?\u201d she asked.She explained that because of what he had told the police about the confrontation outside the rally, prosecutors were adding a new charge: the false imprisonment of Ms. Casey, who had been egged.\u201cWe\u2019ll try to get it down to \u2018disturbing the peace,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get there, but that\u2019s our goal.\u201dNow Mr. McBride, who cannot afford a lawyer, is not sure if he should plead guilty to a crime he doesn\u2019t feel he committed, or fight the charges. He thinks about that moment when he grabbed Mr. Tong\u2019s sign, and about what made him let it go.\u201cI realized it was stupid,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIf it was on a different street, at a different time, I probably would have just talked to him about why he was supporting Trump.

In an unusual meeting that ended on Tuesday, President Xi Jinping announced that the Chinese Communist Party had the ultimate say over state companies.Senior leaders, including Mr. Xi, have made similar remarks over the past year.

Pence: Face-Off in Farmville!", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverSuch an exchange would be particularly illuminating on the Republican side.Even to many in his own party, Mr. Pence, a former congressman and the sitting Indiana governor, struck a Faustian bargain by joining the Trump ticket. But he has tried to articulate a different set of principles, in contrast to dead-enders like Rudolph Giuliani, Newt Gingrich and Chris Christie. If Mr. Trump loses, Mr. Pence will likely be part of a rump of Republican leaders left to pick up the pieces and focus the party in a more positive direction.Left largely on his own while the Trump inner circle fights fires (and each other), Mr. Pence has been trying to reassure conservatives and evangelicals that he\u2019ll represent them. A social conservative, his anti-abortion, anti-gay stances are deeply at odds with many Americans\u2019 views. At the same time, he has rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the family of an American Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, and distanced himself from Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbirther\u201d campaign.Though he says he\u2019s against Obamacare, as governor he backed the Medicaid expansion that was central to it. He has waffled on the legal fate of 11 million undocumented immigrants, but he has not come out in favor of deporting them. He can legitimately claim firsthand experience and some successes confronting the hollowing-out of the American manufacturing economy. Mr. Pence may in fact be in a better position than Mr. Trump to reinforce the ticket\u2019s appeal to working-class voters, given Mr. Trump\u2019s recent preoccupation with personal attacks and bizarre tweets.Mr. Kaine, the junior senator from Virginia and its former governor, will field the first question of the debate from Elaine Quijano of CBS News, the moderator. At some point he\u2019ll surely attack Mr. Trump\u2019s income tax filings.

The campaign says it had to do with specific weaknesses in the agreement, but her turnabout still mystifies many voters.The debate is set in Mr. Kaine\u2019s home state, Virginia, known for weak laws on influence peddling.

{"Headline": "With Europe-Canada Deal Near Collapse, Globalization\u2019s Latest Chapter Is History", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisLONDON \u2014 Even in this moment of fierce reassessment of the merits of free trade, the deal promoting commerce between the European Union and Canada seemed like a safe bet to secure political blessing on both sides of the Atlantic.So as the agreement appeared dead on Friday \u2014 collapsing in the face of unrelenting opposition from Wallonia, the French-speaking portion of Belgium, where dairy cows have run of the land \u2014 it underscored the extent to which trade has become politically radioactive around much of the globe.In the seven decades since that conflagration, world leaders have forged a series of increasingly large and complex trade deals, pinning hopes for peace and prosperity on the value of turning wartime adversaries into commercial partners.But if a deal negotiated at the highest level between two large and advanced economies like Canada and Europe can be upended by narrow interest groups \u2014 like the dairy industry in a relatively minor participating nation \u2014 forget about every other large and complex deal under discussion.One may presumably close the books on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the enormous trade and investment pact championed by the Obama administration and encompassing a dozen nations around the Pacific Rim. One may reasonably perform last rites on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the similarly gargantuan deal between the European Union and the United States.As for anyone still nursing fantastical notions that Europe and Britain will set aside domestic politics in negotiating what may be the most complicated divorce in history, Friday delivered a sobering development.The British government has insisted that it will find a way to leave the European Union while maintaining access to the European single market \u2014 the buyer of almost half of Britain\u2019s exports. But any deal resulting from tortuous negotiations must win the assent of the 27 other members of the European Union. Any one of those countries seeking to protect the concerns of a single affected industry can essentially stop any deal from proceeding.On Friday, that is precisely what happened when Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s international trade minister, left the talks and went home to Ottawa.\u201cIt is evident to me \u2014 evident to Canada \u2014 that the European Union is incapable of reaching an agreement,\u201d she told reporters.Under Belgium\u2019s complicated federal system, Charles Michel, the country\u2019s prime minister, can give his approval to the deal only once all of the country\u2019s regions assent.The Wallonia region of Belgium is home to 3.5 million of the country\u2019s 11.2 million people. Yet in single-handedly blocking a trade deal produced over seven years between the European Union and Canada, it effectively determined the terms of commerce applying for 500 million Europeans.The Walloons did not relish the idea of having to compete against imported dairy products from Canada. Britain makes cars, medical devices and sophisticated parts for airplanes. It is a global leader in financial services. Somewhere in the European Union must surely lurk some other Wallonia that will seize the opportunity to slap tariffs on British goods even at the cost of broader economic interests.That was already apparent to anyone paying attention to European politics. After Friday, London\u2019s ministers will need spirits to maintain delusions of an amicable divorce. (And if those spirits come from the other side of the English Channel, they are likely to cost more.)There is now \u201ca huge question over whether the common European trade policy can survive,\u201d said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research organization based in Brussels.It is now beyond argument that liberalized trade between wealthy countries and developing countries exposes vulnerable workers to substantial perils. When cheaper imports arrive from low-wage countries, people making more expensive domestic goods can find themselves looking for new jobs.When the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in the mid-1990s, enabling goods to flow across Canada, Mexico and the United States with minimal impediments, factory workers in American industrial communities became vulnerable to job losses as production flowed south. When China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, gaining the right to export its wares around the globe, factory workers in every industrial nation were rendered vulnerable.Trade economists will say with justification that the inclusion of China and Mexico in the global trading system promoted economic growth, increased consumer choice, lowered prices on a variety of goods and allowed companies in wealthy countries to export more of their own wares.Yet if the gains of trade were broad, the pain befalling communities directly in the path of China\u2019s export juggernaut proved intense and poorly cushioned by government policies. A voluminous body of economic literature has in recent years brought home just how intense and damaging the China shock has been in the United States alone.The distrust left after that shock, and anger over the broader workings of trade, have transformed politics in many major economies. Rage over factory closures in the American heartland propelled the rise of Donald J. Trump. Such sentiments fueled Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Here is part of the explanation for the growth of right-wing populist parties in France, Germany, Hungary and elsewhere.Now, even a deal between Europe and Canada looks unachievable.Trade theory teaches that exchange across borders is ultimately beneficial to both countries. Some groups will win and some will lose, but society as a whole benefits, provided the terms of trade are fair and regulated by legitimate governments operating transparently.Here is what is most extraordinary about the demise of the Canada-Europe pact: It did not involve wealthy countries and poor countries with different labor and environmental standards. It spanned two of the most affluent, democratic and regulated societies on earth.If the people in these two regions cannot trust one another to deliver policies that will make the unimpeded exchange of goods and services a desirable deal for both, then the merits of trade are effectively defunct in the political realm.Most of the resistance to this deal and the larger trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific agreements has centered not on the elimination of tariffs but on the so-called investment provisions that standardize \u2014 or harmonize, in the argot of trade negotiators \u2014 applicable rules.To voters in myriad countries increasingly suspicious of large institutions \u2014 those of the European Union and those like the World Trade Organization \u2014 this translates as an erosion of sovereignty. All of these negotiations have been accompanied by accusations that they will effectively elevate the interests of multinational corporations above national laws.But the Europe-Canada deal did not succumb to such grandiose fears. Rather, it was done in by old-school parochial interests trumping larger concerns. The dairy industry in Wallonia was among those interests that prevailed over European trade policy writ large.Here was unmistakable proof that the politics of the moment were more local than ever.And here is a moral that applies to more than this story alone.Peter S. Goodman reported from London and James Kanter from Brussels. Ian Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When the Next Hurricane Hits Texas", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byOpinionImagine a hurricane, a hurricane like Matthew, aimed straight at the heart of the American petrochemical industry. Isaiah whirls through the sky, gathering strength from the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s warm waters. Beach towns are evacuated. Citizens and companies in Texas\u2019 petro-industrial enclaves from Bayou Vista to Morgan\u2019s Point are warned: Prepare for the worst.The huge cyclone gathers strength as it nears the barrier islands off the coast, intensifying to Category 4. Hours before landfall, 150 mile-per-hour winds begin pushing water over the Galveston Seawall, and by the time the eye finally hits, Galveston has been flattened by a 20-foot wave.Isaiah\u2019s monstrous arm reaches across the bay toward Houston, some 50 miles inland, adding water to water, and when it smashes into the Exxon Mobil Baytown refinery, the storm surge is over 25 feet high. It crashes through refineries, chemical storage facilities, wharves and production plants all along the Houston Ship Channel, cleaving pipelines from their moorings, lifting and breaking storage tanks.As Isaiah passes inland, the iridescent, gray-brown flood rises, carrying jet fuel, sour crude and natural gas liquids into strip malls, parks, schools and offices. More than 200 petrochemical storage tanks have been wrecked, more than 100 million gallons of petroleum and chemicals spilled. Damages for the region are estimated at more than $100 billion. More than 3,500 are dead. It is one of the worst disasters in United States history: worse than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, worse than Hurricane Katrina, worse than the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.The good news is that Isaiah hasn\u2019t happened. It\u2019s an imaginary calamity based on research and models. The bad news is that it\u2019s only a matter of time before it does.Any 50-mile stretch of the Texas coast can expect a hurricane once every six years on average, according to the National Weather Service. Only a few American cities are more vulnerable to hurricanes than Houston and Galveston, and not one of those is as crucial to the economy.When the next big storm hits there, the effects will ripple across the globe. The Gulf Coast is home to roughly 30 percent of the United States\u2019s proven oil reserves; The Gulf Coast and Texas hold 35 percent of its natural gas reserves. The refineries and plants encircling Galveston Bay are responsible for roughly 25 percent of the United States\u2019s petroleum refining, more than 44 percent of its ethylene production, 40 percent of its specialty chemical feed stock and more than half of its jet fuel.Houston is the second busiest port in the United States in terms of pure tonnage and one of the most important shipping points in the country for natural gas liquids. A hurricane like Isaiah would shut all that down.There\u2019s more: Future hurricanes will actually be worse than Isaiah. The models Isaiah is based on, developed by Rice University\u2019s Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation From Disaster (Sspeed) Center, don\u2019t account for climate change. According to Jim Blackburn, Sspeed\u2019s co-director, other models have shown much more alarming surges. \u201cThe City of Houston and FEMA did a climate change future,\u201d he told me, \u201cand the surge in that scenario was 34 feet. Hurricanes are going to get bigger. No question. They are fueled by the heat of the ocean, and the ocean\u2019s warming. Our models are nowhere close.\u201dI took a tour on the M/V Sam Houston to see the Houston Ship Channel, the densest energy infrastructure nexus in the United States. The boat slipped from the pier and spun east. Across the brown-black water, giant cranes shifted scrap from one heap to another with magnets and claws, throwing up clouds of metal.Several industrial recycling companies line the upper reaches of the channel, all recognized emitters of one of the most potent carcinogens known to science, hexavalent chromium. Behind the cranes lies the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Magnolia Park, whose residents have long complained of mysterious gas emissions, persistent pollution and strange, multicolored explosions. I thought of the models Mr. Blackburn had shown me, imagining a wave of water sweeping toxic waste into playgrounds, shops and houses.The tour boat\u2019s engines thrummed beneath my feet. In the distance, gas flares flashed against the cloud cover.A voice boomed from the boat: \u201cFirst refinery to the right, this is Valero. This refinery began operations in 1942. It will handle 145,000 barrels of oil per day.\u201d Directly behind Valero lies Hartman Park, with its green lawns and baseball diamonds \u2014 the jewel of Manchester, one of the most polluted neighborhoods in the United States. Manchester is bordered on the north by Valero, and on the east, south and west by a chemical plant, a car-crushing yard, a water-treatment plant, a train yard, Interstate 610 and a Goodyear synthetic rubber plant. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency found toxic levels of seven different carcinogens in the neighborhood.Our tour boat was out and back in 90 minutes, but the Houston Ship Channel keeps going for miles. Rounding the San Jacinto Battleground, it bends south, cutting a trench approximately 530 feet wide and 45 feet deep through Galveston Bay all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. As you follow the channel south on I-45, strip clubs and fast-food franchises give way to bayou resorts and refineries. I-45 ends in downtown Galveston, once known as the \u201cWall Street of the South\u201d: a mix of historic homes, dry-docked oil rigs, beach bars and the University of Texas Medical Branch. The gulf spreads sullen and muddy to the horizon, its placid skin broken by distant blisters of flaming steel.Galveston Bay is a Texas paradox. One of the most productive estuaries in the United States, it offers up huge catches of shrimp, blue crab, oysters, croaker, flounder and catfish, and supports dozens of other kinds of fish, turtles, dolphins, salamanders, sharks and snakes, as well as hundreds of species of birds. Yet the bay is heavily polluted, so full of P.C.B.s, pesticides, dioxin and petrochemicals that fishing is widely restricted.The bay is Houston\u2019s shield, protecting it from the worst of the Gulf Coast\u2019s weather by absorbing storm surges and soaking up rainfall, but hydrologists at Rice University are worried it might also be Houston\u2019s doom: The wide, shallow basin could, under the right conditions, supercharge a storm surge right up the ship channel.The fight to protect Houston and Galveston from storms has been going on for more than a century, ever since Galveston built a 17-foot sea wall after the Great Storm of 1900, a Category 4 hurricane that killed an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 people. The fight has been mainly reactive, always planning for the last big storm, rarely for the next. The levees around Texas City, for instance, were built after Hurricane Carla submerged the chemical plants there in 10 feet of water in 1961. Today, Hurricane Ike, which hit Texas in 2008, offers the object lesson.Hurricane Ike was a lucky hit with unlucky timing. Forecasts had the hurricane landing at the southern end of Galveston Island, and if they\u2019d been right, Ike would have looked a lot like Isaiah. Instead, in the early morning hours of Sept. 13, 2008, Ike bent north and hit Galveston dead on, which shifted the most damaging winds east. The sparsely populated Bolivar Peninsula was flattened, but Houston came out O.K.Still, Ike killed nearly 50 people in Texas alone, left thousands homeless, and was the third costliest hurricane in American history. It would have been the ideal moment for Texas to ask Congress to fund a comprehensive coastal protection system. But on that Monday, Sept. 15, Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in United States history, and the next day the Federal Reserve stepped in to save the failing insurance behemoth A.I.G. with an $85 billion bailout. Nature\u2019s fury took a back seat to the crisis of capital.Since then, two main research teams have led the way in preparing for the next big storm: Bill Merrell\u2019s \u201cIke Dike\u201d team at Texas A&M Galveston, and the Sspeed Center at Rice University, led by Phil Bedient and Jim Blackburn.Dr. Merrell\u2019s Ike Dike has the blessing of simplicity, which softens the sticker shock: It is estimated to cost between $6 billion and $13 billion. The plan is to build a 55-mile-long \u201ccoastal spine\u201d along the gulf. The plan\u2019s main disadvantage is that a strong enough hurricane could still flood the Houston Ship Channel, because of what Dr. Bedient calls the \u201cLake Okeechobee effect.\u201d\u201cThe Okeechobee hurricane came into Florida in 1928 and sloshed water to a 20-foot surge,\u201d Dr. Bedient explained. \u201cKilled 2,000 people. But Lake Okeechobee is unconnected to the coast. It was just wind. Galveston Bay has the same dimensions and depth as Lake Okeechobee in Florida. So imagine we block off Galveston Bay with a coastal spine, and we have a Lake Okeechobee.\u201dDr. Bedient worked on the Murphy\u2019s Oil spill in St. Bernard Parish, La., where flooding from Hurricane Katrina ruptured a storage tank, releasing more than a million gallons of oil and ruined approximately 1,800 homes. One of Dr. Bedient\u2019s biggest worries is what a storm might do to the estimated 4,500 similar tanks surrounding Houston, many of them along the ship channel. If even 2 percent of those tanks were to fail because of storm surge, the results would be catastrophic.The Sspeed Center advocates a layered defense, including a mid-bay gate that could be closed during a storm to protect the channel. On its face, the plan seems unwieldy, but Sspeed\u2019s models show it could stop most of the surge from going up the ship channel, with or without the Ike Dike, at an estimated cost of only a few billion dollars.According to Mr. Blackburn, \u201cEven a locally funded project would probably be three years in the permitting and another six to eight years in construction.\u201d But most local politicians seemed to prefer the Ike Dike, necessarily a federal project. \u201cI have heard more than one person say our plan is to wait until the next hurricane comes,\u201d Mr. Blackburn said, \u201cthen depend on guilt money from Washington to fix the problem.\u201dDr. Merrell said much the same: \u201cWe see local politicians in general content with doing nothing. The do-nothing option is pretty gruesome. It gets you a storm, sooner or later, that\u2019s going to kill thousands of people and cause at least $100 billion in damage.\u201dWe\u2019ve known that climate change was a threat since at least 1988, and the United States has done almost nothing to stop it. Today it might be too late. The feedback mechanisms that scientists have warned us about are happening. Our world is changing.Imagine we\u2019ve got 20 or 30 years before things really get bad. Imagine how that happens. Imagine FEMA trailers and martial law, toxic waste and flooded hospitals. Imagine politics in a world on fire.Climate change is hard to think about not only because it\u2019s complex and politically contentious, not only because it\u2019s cognitively almost impossible to keep in mind the intricate relationships that tie together an oil well in Venezuela, Siberian permafrost, Saudi F-15s bombing a Yemeni wedding, subsidence along the Jersey Shore, albedo effect near Kangerlussuaq, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the polar vortex, shampoo, California cattle, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, leukemia, plastic, paper, the Sixth Extinction, Zika, and the basic decisions we make every day, are forced to make every day, in a world we didn\u2019t choose but were thrown into. No, it\u2019s not just because it\u2019s mind-bendingly difficult to connect the dots. Climate change is hard to think about because it\u2019s depressing and scary.Thinking seriously about climate change forces us to face the fact that nobody\u2019s driving the car, nobody\u2019s in charge, nobody knows how to \u201cfix it.\u201d And even if we had a driver, there\u2019s a bigger problem: no car. There\u2019s no mechanism for uniting the entire human species to move together in one direction.There are more than seven billion humans, and we divide into almost 200 countries, thousands of smaller sub-national states, territories, counties and municipalities, and an unimaginable multitude of corporations, community organizations, neighborhoods, religious sects, ethnic identities, clans, tribes, gangs, clubs and families, each of which faces its own disunion and strife, all the way down to the individual human soul in conflict with itself, torn between fear and desire, hard sacrifice and easy cruelty, all of us improvising day by day, moment to moment, making decisions based on best guesses, hunches, comforting illusions and too little data.But that\u2019s the human way: reactive, ad hoc, improvised. Our ability to reconfigure our collective existence in response to changing environmental conditions has been our greatest adaptive trait. Unfortunately for us, we\u2019re still not very good at controlling the future. What we\u2019re good at is telling ourselves the stories we want to hear, the stories that help us cope with existence in an wild, unpredictable world.An opinion article last Sunday about how a major hurricane could affect the petrochemical industry in Texas described incorrectly one possible effect. A hurricane could produce spills of natural gas liquids; it would not cause spilling of liquefied natural gas, which would be released into the air instead. The essay also misstated a distinction held by the Port of Houston. It is a major shipping point for natural gas liquids, not for liquefied natural gas.Roy Scranton is an assistant professor of English at the University of Notre Dame and the author of \u201cLearning to Die in the Anthropocene\u201d and \u201cWar Porn,\u201d a novel.Advertisement"}

Then he crooned: \u201cEvery kid wants a candy coffin.\u201dIn the interest of avoiding spoilers (something a visual-arts reporter rarely has to worry about), some of the scenarios in the piece are probably best undescribed.But it might give an idea of the range of topical phantasmagoria to say that one room involves cheerleaders singing about abortion. Another features a kind of Tupperware party for handguns. (\u201cI think for a lot of liberal people who have never been around guns, it\u2019s going to be a pretty tense situation,\u201d Mr. Reyes said.)There will be a classroom presided over by a racially shape-shifting computer avatar spouting corporate come-ons through a large computer screen \u2014 \u201cI Googled \u2018classroom of the future,\u2019 and that\u2019s pretty much what it looked like,\u201d Mr. Reyes said \u2014 and a fake cocktail party hosted by a rich couple who are having their own spaceship built.\u201cThey just have so much money that they\u2019re into racing space rockets,\u201d said Mr. Reyes, a compact, bespectacled man who comes off in person like a philosophy professor moonlighting as a late-night comedy host. \u201cThey asked Zaha Hadid to design their spaceship, but then she died, so of course they got Frank Gehry, who\u2019s done most of their houses.\u201dThe actors will have to repeat their parts, written by the playwright Paul Hufker \u2014 some of them highly emotional and physically demanding \u2014 40 times over the course of a night. \u201cWhen I enlisted people to be in this, I told them that it was going to be an act of political rigor,\u201d Ms. Finn said. \u201cIt really is endurance performance.\u201dKatie Hollander, Creative Time\u2019s executive director, said that the organization hadn\u2019t planned earlier in the year to present a major fall piece. But when Mr. Reyes proposed a \u201cpolitical/satirical haunted house,\u201d she said, \u201cthe idea stuck with us, and as the political climate became more and more terrifying to a certain extent, it just became more and more relevant, and we knew that the time this had to happen was now. So we jumped from the frying pan into the fire. It\u2019s not a usual thing for us to do something of this complexity in such a short period of time.\u201dEspecially against the backdrop of this election, Mr. Thompson said, the project made a kind of perverse sense in 2016, the centennial of the birth of the Dada art movement. \u201cI think that\u2019s the kind of moment we\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like a joke but the joke is really not funny at all.\u201dMr. Reyes acknowledged that the piece would probably be received far differently were it presented in suburban Ohio or rural Tennessee; he knows he is preaching mostly to a choir of liberal art lovers who oppose many of the late-capitalist demons he holds up to ridicule. \u201cBut I still very much hope I can offend at least a few people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be so intense that I think people are going to be shaken and pretty worn out after the hour they\u2019re inside.\u201dWhich might be worth something in itself. \u201cThis piece\u2019s inner logic isn\u2019t about hope, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve lost hope in art\u2019s ability to help change things,\u201d Mr. Reyes said. \u201cI still think it\u2019s crucial to keep a critical muscle that mocks the motivations of the system \u2014 to say, \u2018Why are we doing this?\u2019 and to say, \u2018This is crazy.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ambassador Spurs an Irish-American Cultural Exchange", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byDUBLIN \u2014 As the light began to fade on a balmy fall evening last month, Jimmy Webb transported his audience to the lonely plains of Wichita, Kan., and crashing waves in Galveston, on the Texas Gulf Coast.Mr. Webb, the legendary singer-songwriter, was more than 4,000 miles away from those shores, singing at the ornate ambassador\u2019s residence in Phoenix Park here. He was the latest in a series of American artists to perform as part of Creative Minds, a foreign policy initiative with artistic flair.The brainchild of Kevin O\u2019Malley, the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, Creative Minds has given thousands of Irish guests up-close inspiration from American talents like the musicians John Prine, Patty Griffin and Rufus Wainwright; the president of Pixar, Jim Morris; the \u201cSopranos\u201d creator David Chase; the spoken word artist Saul Williams and many others. The artists perform, and all of the guests answer questions from the audience in an intimate setting in a room of the residence.The events cost the United States government nothing other than a bed for the night at the ambassador\u2019s residence and some old-fashioned Irish-American hospitality. The ambassador has been staging these events on an almost monthly basis since March, 2015, and the guests \u2014 some of whom may be playing in Ireland anyway \u2014 do not receive a fee.\u201c21st century economies depend increasingly on creativity to succeed, and Creative Minds is doing its bit to strengthen the ties between the U.S. and the future leaders of Ireland,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Malley, a former prosecutor who expects to return to his native St. Louis after President Obama leaves office. \u201cThat is a legacy worth developing.\u201dCulture has long been one of Ireland\u2019s main calling cards, but in recent years government funding for the arts has been significantly cut. The Arts Council, the main funding body for the arts in Ireland, received \u20ac60.1 million from the state in 2016, compared with $83 million in 2007, before the economy went into a tailspin as a result of a property crash that led to an international financial bailout here.\u201cIn Ireland we have to get over the mind-set that just because something doesn\u2019t have a defined outcome it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t worth investing in,\u201d said Philip King, a producer who will be bringing his Ireland-based Other Voices festival to Austin, Tex., this weekend as a direct consequence of Creative Minds.Since its inception in 2002, the Other Voices festival has become an annual mainstay of the small fishing town of Dingle on Ireland\u2019s southwest coast. On dark December nights a maximum of 80 people huddle together in the tiny St. James\u2019s church to watch up-and-coming acts from Ireland and around the world.After attending several Creative Minds events, Mr. King persuaded Mr. O\u2019Malley to organize one during the festival in Dingle last December. The Austin musician Shakey Graves was invited to perform and speak. At the same time, Mr. King had been mulling a longstanding invitation from Arlyn Studios in Austin to take the festival there, and he credits Creative Minds\u2019 emphasis on forging links across the Atlantic with nudging him to accept it.The dank Irish nights or the bricks and mortar of the little church of St. James may not transfer readily to Austin, but Mr. King and his team are aiming to bring as much of the festival\u2019s spirit as possible.\u201cThey want what we have and the atmosphere we create,\u201d said Aoife Woodlock, the producer of Other Voices, adding that they would be taking the entire production crew rather than hiring locals. \u201cThe idea is to replicate what we do in Dingle by taking it out of St. James\u2019s and into Arlyn Studios,\u201d he said.Unlike in Ireland, where tickets are limited but available, the events will not be open to the public, but the artists who will feature on the bill are expected to invite local fans to attend the various sessions, which will be recorded for Irish TV and then pitched to broadcasters in the United States. Their performances will also be available online shortly after they are recorded.The Austin version will include collaborations from the likes of Willie Nelson, who will record versions of classics such as \u201cBlue Eyes Crying in the Rain,\u201d \u201cOn the Road Again\u201d and \u201cAlways on My Mind.\u201d Other confirmed artists include Band of Horses, Margo Price, Aoife O\u2019Donovan, Asleep at the Wheel, Gregory Porter and Dale Watson as well as Irish traditional music artists like Colm Mac Con Iomaire.As with the Dingle editions, however, Mr. King refuses to divulge the full lineup for this \u201cmusical expedition across the Mississippi.\u201d But if past festivals are any guide, other marquee names are likely to appear. He has a track record of collaborations with musicians such as Rodney Crowell, Emmylou Harris and Elvis Costello, who just happens to be touring nearby next week.One Austin participant, Iarla \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird, who is widely regarded as the best singer in the Irish Sean N\u00f3s tradition and is a visiting fellow at Princeton University, said he would use the occasion to further explore parallels between his music and American blues.\u201dMy singing comes out of a deep tradition, and I am looking forward in particular to the collaborations with other artists in Austin,\u201d he said. \u201cMy songs, usually in the Gaelic language, are songs of love, loss and longing; they\u2019re really our blues.\u201dBefore flying to Austin, Mr. King was at the latest session of Creative Minds in Dublin last month to hear Mr. Webb\u2019s music and musings.Interspersed with songs from his copious back catalog, questions from the audience allowed the singer to share his views on issues such as how to succeed (\u201cit almost broke my father but I couldn\u2019t be dissuaded\u201d); internet streaming (\u201can open invitation to thievery\u201d); and musical philosophy (\u201cimprovisation is the key to creativity\u201d).Mr. O\u2019Malley would not comment on what might happen to Creative Minds after the American presidential elections next month, but insists the foundations are now firmly in place for whoever succeeds him. \u201cI want this to continue long after I\u2019m gone for the sake of both our countries.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Sell/Buy/Date,\u2019 Sarah Jones\u2019s Futuristic Look at Sex Workers", "Date": "2016-12-03", "News": "Supported byIn this absorbing solo show, a Manhattan Theater Club production that opened on Tuesday at City Center, Ms. Jones peers into the future to explore how a sociology professor examines the lives of sex workers in the first decades of the 21st century. More broadly, the show also discusses how women of our era are conditioned to conceive of themselves \u2014 or how others conceive of them \u2014 as sexual beings.The show is conceived as a lecture about sex work sometime in the future. (Once upon a time, \u201cprostitution\u201d was the term.) Our professor, Dr. Serene Campbell, speaks in crisp British tones once associated with the official BBC voice. She is addressing her students, but they are also \u2014 here it gets a little confusing \u2014 employing something called \u201cbio-empathetic resonant technology.\u201d This invention, new, we learn, in 2017, allows the students, once they\u2019ve plugged themselves in (or done something), to directly experience the emotions of the people interviewed for this class.She first switches us on to an almost stereotypically nice elderly Jewish woman, who talks amusingly of her minimal experience with internet pornography \u2013 \u201cjust for inspiration.\u201d She was aghast at what she saw: \u201cIt was all very \u2018extreme,\u2019 like you would say, like the extreme sports,\u201d she adds in a voice of mild surprise. \u201cNeedless to say, that was 19 dollars and 95 cents I\u2019ll never get back again,\u201d she sighs.Other voices include a student majoring in \u201csex work studies,\u201d who chats blithely about her pole-dancing class, which is \u201clike, an amazing way to get in touch with your, like, feminine power without essentializing what constitutes \u2018the feminine,\u2019 and while increasing upper-body strength and stamina.\u201d Bella, named after Bella Abzug, represents a generation that is interested in \u201cprotecting sex workers\u2019 legal freedoms and rights.\u201dIn Ms. Jones\u2019s conception, many people in the future will view sex work as \u201cnormalized,\u201d to use the kind of term that crops up often in the show. We hear from a Jamaican woman who moved to sex work from caregiving because it was better financially. (\u201cYou find me somebody who don\u2019t hate some part of their job.\u201d) Her testimony, as Dr. Campbell annotates it, illustrates the \u201cepidemic\u201d of sex trafficking between richer and poorer economies, during a time (say, now) when people couldn\u2019t \u201clive freely between countries.\u201dOther voices include that of an Irish woman with a more cleareyed view of the work she ended up in after becoming pregnant as a teenager and giving up her baby: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that \u2018Pretty Woman\u2019 film, I can tell you that.\u201dAlthough the play\u2019s subject matter is ostensibly dark, there is a lot of unexpected humor, often quite biting and bright. As when Dr. Campbell, in another interpolation between \u201cinterviews,\u201d holds up a Barbie doll and notes that she initially thought it was an educational tool to protect girls from anorexia. Indeed, if \u201cSell/Buy/Date\u201d has a flaw, it is perhaps that the show is almost too entertaining, too slight, for the harsh subject underlying it. More on that later, as Dr. Campbell might say.Men, by the way, are both discussed and heard from on occasion. Responding to a question from one student, Dr. Campbell notes that, yes men were having sex, too, back in the day. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember from the reading, what were male \u2018sluts\u2019 called? Very good, they were called \u2018men.\u2019\u201dWe meet a frat-dude type at his bachelor party at a strip club who claims to respect women (\u201cI\u2019m marrying a woman\u201d), but easily classifies them into categories \u2014 the ones you marry and the ones, well, you don\u2019t. Also lending his perspective is a reformed pimp called Cookie Chris, born into the business, who recalls his father justifying his trade by saying, \u201cYou might be in combat boots instead of heels,\u201d but you are still \u201cdefinitely getting pimped.\u201d It was after beating up one of his prostitutes while watching \u201cOprah\u201d that Chris had a revelation and left the business.\u201cSell/Buy/Date,\u201d crisply directed by Carolyn Cantor, is stocked in social commentary. Dr. Campbell reminds us that in the bad old days of the 21st century, income inequality, although she doesn\u2019t use the term, was rampant. And she links the spread of celebrity culture to the commodification of sex, at one point featuring a stand-up comic appearing at an awards ceremony for television programs such as \u201cPimp My Bride\u201d \u2014 a game show in which \u201cformerly prostituted women competed to be a pimp\u2019s favorite.\u201dAt such points the show slips almost into satire \u2014 or at least hyperbole. And a subplot involving Dr. Campbell\u2019s real identity, which involves her switching somehow to a private channel to take calls from the dean, and from her mother, seems a trifle contrived.But Ms. Jones\u2019s talent for bringing alive voices of such piercing specificity helped me overlook the main problem that I had with the show. In engaging with a subject \u2014 the sexual exploitation of women \u2014 that takes an appalling toll on the lives of thousands, perhaps millions, I do wish that she had delved a little deeper, and allowed the darkness of the details to come through with more grit.The show\u2019s concept \u2014 that we are students able to directly channel the feelings of its subjects \u2014 certainly succeeds, thanks to Ms. Jones\u2019s remarkable gifts. But we don\u2019t feel much pain, and we probably should.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poverty in Unexpected Places", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialGrinding poverty in the United States has long been synonymous with the Deep South, where low wages, poor health and diminished opportunity are more pervasive than in other parts of the country.That does not mean poverty in California and the West is as grim as in Mississippi and the South. Southern poverty is associated with greater material hardships than are experienced elsewhere, including hunger. (The West includes the 13 westernmost states; the South is a group of 16 states that includes Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, plus Washington, D.C.)The high alternative poverty rate in the West is driven largely by rising rents in California, where industries like technology, finance and entertainment have attracted well-paid workers who bid up housing costs. As rent increases have steadily outpaced wage growth in the last several years, housing costs as a share of total family income have swelled to more than 50 percent for nearly 30 percent of Californians, according to an analysis of Census data by the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality. The results are overcrowding, bad housing, the inability to afford other essentials, frequent evictions and other features of poverty.Similar dynamics are at work elsewhere, notably in Hawaii, New York and Washington, D.C. In effect, high and rising incomes at the top of the economic ladder are impoverishing those with modest pay who are clinging to the lower rungs.Market forces, however, are not the whole story. Another culprit is public policy, which at both the state and the federal levels has failed to soften the effect of the market through law and regulation, including zoning, renters\u2019 rights and other legal protections.The market is not going to cure itself of widening income inequality and the poverty it helps create. Bolstering federal rental subsidies, especially for families with children, is one good place to start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Frieze Art Week, All Eyes on the Pound", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported by\u201cGreat price, great picture!\u201d exclaimed the auctioneer Jussi Pylkkanen, under a screen that showed \u201cGBP 6,200,000\u201d above conversions into a range of currencies that had strengthened against the pound in the last few months \u2014 and days.Mr. Pylkkanen, the global president of Christie\u2019s, had just sold the star lot of his auction house\u2019s Thursday night \u201cFrieze Week\u201d sale of contemporary art. Adrian Ghenie\u2019s almost 14-foot-wide canvas of an octet of sinister figures in an interior, titled \u201cNickelodeon\u201d and dating from 2008, was pushed by at least six bidders to a final fee-inclusive 7.1 million pounds, or about $9 million. The price, given by an anonymous telephone bidder, was seven times the low estimate and a new salesroom high for Mr. Ghenie, a 39-year-old Romanian artist.\u201cIt\u2019s a dollar market. It has to have an effect,\u201d Mr. Pylkkanen said on Thursday after Christie\u2019s deftly curated sale of 41 lots raised \u00a334.3 million, or $43.5 million, with 90 percent of the works sold. The total at the company\u2019s equivalent sale last year was \u00a335.6 million, which was then $55 million.This year, because of a lack of growth in major economies and the volatility of geopolitical events, international collectors have been more cautious at auctions and fairs. But the weakness of the pound gave a boost to Frieze Week\u2014 certainly at Christie\u2019s, where bidders hailed from more than 35 countries.Lucy Dodd\u2019s \u201cStorms R Born N Eagles Land,\u201d above, mixed media on canvas, from 2016.\u201cThe pound is certainly attractive in these sales to collectors. 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Simchowitz said in an email.Christie\u2019s was careful to pack its Thursday night sale with fresh works by artists who are now in demand with collectors. The American figurative painter Henry Taylor, for example, is currently the subject of a sold-out exhibition at the Los Angeles gallery Blum & Poe. Mr. Taylor\u2019s 2008 painting \u201cWalking With Vito,\u201d showing two boys walking a dog, was a timely offering at Christie\u2019s. Four bidders pushed the price to \u00a3137,000. Gallery prices for paintings at Blum & Poe range from $25,000 to about $100,000.Only two lots sold for hammer prices above their high estimates. Most prominent of these was the large 2011 word-splattered abstract \u201cRat Catcher of Hamelin III\u201d by Mark Bradford, who will be representing the United States at next year\u2019s Venice Biennale. With a high estimate of \u00a32 million, it was bought by the London dealer Inigo Philbrick for \u00a33.7 million with fees.Works by reputed contemporary artists whose markets have not been \u201cburned\u201d by speculation was the commodity most in demand at the Wednesday preview of the 14th annual Frieze Art Fair, the centerpiece of Frieze Week.\u201cIt\u2019s the one week of the year in which you get the chance to take the pulse of the whole market,\u201d said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser based in New York. According to Ms. Cromwell, Frieze, which this year featured 166 international gallerists, has \u201cfallen off the map\u201d for many American collectors, in spite of the falling pound.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a bunch of advisers, but not many collectors,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fair has lost its buzzy edge. It\u2019s now a commercial entity, but it still affords opportunities to buy exciting work,\u201d she added, after buying one of two new triangular paintings on linen by the British artist Chris Ofili, priced at $380,000, at the Frieze booth of David Zwirner.The New York dealer David Lewis was among 37 \u201cemerging\u201d galleries in the main Frieze fair\u2019s \u201cFocus\u201d section. Underlining the fair\u2019s commercial maturity, Mr. Lewis was showing nine new abstract paintings and a sculpture by Lucy Dodd, 34, an artist based in New York State, who this year had a solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. The works ranged in price from $7,000 to $60,000, and all had been sold or on reserve by the end of Wednesday.Frieze\u2019s sister fair, Frieze Masters, whose fifth edition previewed on Wednesday, remains an enigmatic event. Supremely elegant in design and pleasant to visit, the fair is dominated by fully-priced modern and postwar art, with a shrinking representation of historic material to appeal to \u201ccrossover\u201d buyers. Data quantifying whether the fair works commercially for dealers remains fragmentary.It is a sign of these post-boom times that arguably the commercially \u201chottest\u201d artist of the moment isn\u2019t a 20- or 30-something in New York or Los Angeles, but the German-born American Josef Albers (1888-1976). The market for his work has been transformed since May, when the New York mega-gallerist David Zwirner took over representation of his estate. Zwirner, who will have solo Albers shows in New York in November and in London in January, sold a gray 30-inch \u201cHomage to the Square\u201d from 1964 to an American collector for $1 million at the preview of Frieze Masters.The previous evening at Christie\u2019s Waddington auction, Mr. Simchowitz, the Los Angeles-based adviser, had to pay \u00a3665,000 each, or about $849,000, for two 16-inch \u201cHomage\u201d paintings, respectively graded in shades of red and orange-to-burgundy and dated 1969 and 1973. Last year, Albers\u2019s 16-inch abstracts were selling for $150,000 to $250,000 at auction.The London dealer Dickinson was showing a small-scale 1949 version of Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s painting \u201cL\u2019Empire des Lumi\u00e8res\u201d (The Dominion of Light) at a spectacular booth devoted to Surrealism. Formerly owned by Nelson A. Rockefeller, the Magritte was one of 17 oil versions of the subject and had been consigned for sale by another American private collector with a Rockefeller-size asking price of $25 million. The \u201cSurrealist Revolution\u201d display offered 50 works, starting at $35,000 for an Yves Tanguy ink drawing.As of Friday morning, the gallery had not reported any confirmed sales.\u201cHealthy, robust, contracting, healthy, robust and contracting like a lung that breathes in and then out,\u201d said Mr. Simchowitz, describing the current state of the art market. \u201cSometimes it has oxygen and sometimes not.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Beyond the question of whether the Fed will raise rates in December, he said, \u201cthere is the possibility of right-wing nativist governments taking over in Europe, and who knows what\u2019s going to happen in the United States.\u201dThe reality of how different this presidential election is from the typical one is finally setting in, Mr. Klimo said.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a sense that, \u2018I want this guy to win, but if the other guy wins, it won\u2019t be a disaster,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true now.\u201dThe prospect of \u201cnationalism and protectionism\u201d should Donald J. Trump win the presidency is a concern for Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management at Northern Trust.The outlook for trade is already fragile without any change in American policy. In late September, the World Trade Organization lowered its forecast for 2016 global trade growth to 1.7 percent from 2.8 percent in April. The body attributed the revised forecast to a \u201cdramatic slowing of trade growth\u201d early this year.The presidential election and the Fed meeting the next month are reasons Ms. Nixon is \u201cnot going to be interested in making bold moves\u201d in the markets now, she said, even as she acknowledged that the Fed was also unlikely to make any bold moves.\u201cThe Fed delivered exactly what we thought they would \u2014 nothing much,\u201d she said about the September meeting. \u201cOur base case is they won\u2019t move in December, either.\u201cThere\u2019s always a reason\u201d for the inaction, she added. \u201cEvery time the Fed seems ready to do something, there\u2019s some sort of macro surprise; the economy has not cooperated.\u201dDespite her misgivings, Ms. Nixon continues to favor stocks over traditionally safer instruments like Treasury bonds.\u201cWe are still very positively inclined toward risk assets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think rates are going to stay low, and the calendar is very much our friend now.\u201dShe was referring to the trough in corporate profits that occurred late last year; once a year has passed, comparisons will become more favorable.Yet Mr. Sri-Kumar warned that the outlook may not be so rosy after more pages are turned on the calendar. The markets may breathe a sigh of relief if Hillary Clinton is elected next month, he said, but they may hold their breath again next summer when it comes time for the president, whoever it is, to decide whether to renominate Janet L. Yellen to continue running the Fed when her term as chairwoman expires in early 2018.Another matter for investors to confront is how, and how easily, Britain will extricate itself from the European Union, he added.The mechanism for carrying out \u201cBrexit\u201d is for Britain to invoke Article 50 of the union\u2019s Lisbon Treaty. That begins the negotiation of the terms of separation and the relationship between the country and the union afterward. That must be completed within two years after Article 50 is invoked, which Prime Minister Theresa May said this month would occur in March.As worrisome as these issues are, many investors heavily exposed to stocks rationalize the high valuations by pointing out that other investments are even more expensive.\u201cThe challenge with all of this is the value of financial assets is not absolute,\u201d Mr. Memani said. With bond yields so low, he said, \u201cequities are going up because they offer more value.\u201dBut it would be imprudent, in his opinion, to avoid Treasuries and other historically safer bonds altogether, no matter how low interest rates are and how much the Fed supports stock prices.\u201cNormally, at these rate levels, you wouldn\u2019t make any fixed-income allocations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with so much uncertainty, high-grade bonds have a significant place in a portfolio as ballast against a potential downturn\u201d in stocks.Funds that own both major asset classes did well in the third quarter. The average domestic equity fund tracked by Morningstar gained 4.6 percent. International stock funds did better, up 5.7 percent, led by a 7.8 percent rise in portfolios that focus on emerging markets, which had underperformed for years.The average taxable bond fund was up 2 percent in the third quarter. Specialists in high-yield instruments did especially well, rising 4.7 percent, as did emerging markets, up 4.2 percent.Funds of all sorts did well in the quarter, but actively managed stock mutual funds remained a tough sell. Investors sold a net $112.8 billion of them in the period, according to Morningstar, and put a net $61.2 billion into the market through exchange-traded funds. SPDR S.&P. 500, a large, actively traded E.T.F. that tracks the benchmark index, returned 3.8 percent during the quarter, trailing the 4.4 percent return of the average mutual fund that specializes in large domestic stocks.Bond investors poured $52.2 billion into actively managed mutual funds and $28.9 billion into E.T.F.s, which are mostly passively managed vehicles that try to match the returns of an index.Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income at BlackRock, expects rates to rise modestly.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to move up that much,\u201d Mr. Rieder predicted, \u201cbecause so many people in an aging population need income.\u201d Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions; high demand for bonds would tend to keep yields relatively low.But with monetary policy likely to remain looser for longer, he anticipates inflation picking up. Based on that forecast, he recommends Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, which offer the creditworthiness of other Treasury bonds but feature rates that move in line with inflation.TIPS are \u201cone of the most mispriced assets in the market today,\u201d Mr. Rieder said. \u201cMore and more people are going to buy inflation.\u201dOther instruments he favors, with prices that are relatively immune to rising interest rates, include short- to medium-term emerging market debt and mortgage securities from nongovernmental issuers.Mr. Sri-Kumar does not view rising rates as a threat. His advice is to \u201cstay very defensive\u201d by making a liberal allocation to Treasury bonds and keeping as much as 30 percent of a portfolio in cash.As for stocks, he encouraged investors to stick with areas like health care and utilities and to emphasize the United States over foreign markets.Staying close to home is a common theme, especially when contemplating the near future.\u201cFrom a short-term horizon, we\u2019re very overweight U.S. assets,\u201d Ms. Nixon said, because what economic growth there is in the world seems to be concentrated in the United States.Looking further ahead, Ms. Nixon recommends more diversification abroad, particularly in emerging markets.Mr. Memani combined those ideas.\u201cThe best stocks to own for a five-year run are U.S. domestic stocks and emerging markets,\u201d he said. Referring to the sluggish economic conditions, he added: \u201cIf we come out of this mess, emerging markets will have to take more of a role in global growth. Valuations there are not cheap, but they\u2019re better than in developed markets.\u201dHe warned investors who need income that \u201cyou\u2019ll have to take risks\u201d because interest rates are so low. Among the more prudent risks, in his view, are dividend-paying stocks, municipal bonds and master limited partnerships, which are exchange-traded vehicles that typically invest in energy infrastructure like pipelines.Mr. Klimo, like Mr. Sri-Kumar, favors health care stocks. \u201cFor pure demographic reasons, I think they will remain attractive for a long time,\u201d he said.Funds that concentrate on health care stocks rose 5.5 percent in the third quarter, the best sector performance after the gains of 12.9 percent for technology and 7.1 percent for financial services.Among foreign stock markets, Mr. Klimo prefers those in Southeast Asia.One area in which he said he was \u201cfar, far underweight\u201d is financial services. Alluding to serious difficulties at big banks like Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank, he said, \u201cWe have no idea what\u2019s going on inside these companies.\u201dThe end of exceedingly loose Fed policy has been coming for so long that it should be no surprise when it arrives. Even so, it could shock investors when it happens, and even if it doesn\u2019t for the foreseeable future.\u201cWe\u2019ve just kept the drug going,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite comforting; we don\u2019t want to wean ourselves off it. But eventually we\u2019ll have an overdose that no one can do anything about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Debt, Diversion, Distraction", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "There was a time, not long ago, when deficit scolds were actively dangerous \u2014 when their huffing and puffing came quite close to stampeding Washington into really bad policies like raising the Medicare age (which wouldn\u2019t even have saved money) and short-term fiscal austerity. At this point their influence doesn\u2019t reach nearly that far. But they continue to play a malign role in our national discourse \u2014 because they divert and distract attention from much more deserving problems, depriving crucial issues of political oxygen.What\u2019s so bad about this kind of deficit scolding? It\u2019s deeply misleading on two levels: the problem it purports to lay out is far less clearly a major issue than the scolds claim, and the insistence that we need immediate action is just incoherent.So, about that supposed debt crisis: right now we have a more or less stable ratio of debt to GDP, and no hint of a financing problem. So claims that we are facing something terrible rest on the presumption that the budget situation will worsen dramatically over time. How sure are we about that? Less than you may imagine.Yes, the population is getting older, which means more spending on Medicare and Social Security. But it\u2019s already 2016, which means that quite a few baby boomers are already drawing on those programs; by 2020 we\u2019ll be about halfway through the demographic transition, and current estimates don\u2019t suggest a big budget problem.Why, then, do you see projections of a large debt increase? The answer lies not in a known factor \u2014 an aging population \u2014 but in assumed growth in health care costs and rising interest rates. And the truth is that we don\u2019t know that these are going to happen. In fact, health costs have grown much more slowly since 2010 than previously projected, and interest rates have been much lower. As the chart above shows, taking these favorable surprises into account has already drastically reduced long-run debt projections. These days the long-run outlook looks vastly less scary than people used to imagine.Still, it\u2019s probably true that something will eventually have to be done to bring spending and revenues in line. But that brings me to the second point: why is this a crucial issue right now?Are debt scolds demanding that we slash spending and raise taxes right away? Actually, no: the economy is still weak, interest rates still low (meaning that the Fed can\u2019t offset fiscal tightening with easy money), and as a matter of macroeconomic prudence we should probably be running bigger, not smaller deficits in the medium term. So proposals to \u201cdeal with\u201d the supposed debt problem always involve long-term cuts in benefits and (reluctantly) increases in taxes. That is, they don\u2019t involve actual policy moves now, or for the next 5-10 years. So why is it so important to take up the issue right now, with so much else on our plate?Put it this way: yes, it\u2019s possible that we may at some point in the future have to cut benefits. But deficit scolds talk as if they offer a way to avoid this fate, when in fact their solution to the prospect of future benefit cuts is \u2026 to cut future benefits.If you try really hard, you can argue that locking in policies now for this future adjustment will make the transition smoother. But that is really a second-order issue, hardly deserving to take up a lot of our time. By putting the debt question aside, we are NOT in any material way making the future worse.And that is a total contrast with climate change, where our failure to act means pouring vast quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, materially increasing the odds of catastrophe with every year we wait.So my message to the deficit scolds is this: yes, we may face some hard choices a couple of decades from now. But we might not, and in any case there aren\u2019t any choices that must be made now. Meanwhile, there are genuinely scary things happening as we speak, which we should be taking on but aren\u2019t. And your fear-mongering is distracting us from these real problems. Therefore, I would respectfully request that you people just go away.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Won\u2019t Say if He\u2019ll Accept Result of Election", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byIn a remarkable statement that seemed to cast doubt on American democracy, Donald J. Trump said Wednesday that he might not accept the results of next month\u2019s election if he felt it was rigged against him \u2014 a stand that Hillary Clinton blasted as \u201chorrifying\u201d at their final and caustic debate on Wednesday.Mr. Trump, under enormous pressure to halt Mrs. Clinton\u2019s steady rise in opinion polls, came across as repeatedly frustrated as he tried to rally conservative voters with hard-line stands on illegal immigration and abortion rights. But he kept finding himself drawn onto perilous political territory by Mrs. Clinton and the debate\u2019s moderator, Chris Wallace.He sputtered when Mrs. Clinton charged that he would be \u201ca puppet\u201d of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia if elected. He lashed out repeatedly, saying that \u201cshe\u2019s been proven to be a liar on so many different ways\u201d and that \u201cshe\u2019s guilty of a very, very serious crime\u201d over her State Department email practices. And by the end of the debate, when Mrs. Clinton needled him over Social Security, Mr. Trump snapped and said, \u201cSuch a nasty woman.\u201dMrs. Clinton was repeatedly forced to defend her long service in government, which Mr. Trump charged had yielded no real accomplishments. But she was rarely rattled, and made a determined effort to rise above Mr. Trump\u2019s taunts while making overtures to undecided voters.She particularly sought to appeal to Republicans and independents who have doubts about Mr. Trump, arguing that she was not an opponent of the Second Amendment as he claimed, and promising to be tougher and shrewder on national security than Mr. Trump.But it was Mr. Trump\u2019s remark about the election results that stood out, even in a race that has been full of astonishing moments.13 PhotosEvery losing presidential candidate in modern times has accepted the will of the voters, even in extraordinarily close races, such as when John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Richard M. Nixon in 1960 and George W. Bush beat Al Gore in Florida to win the presidency in 2000.Mr. Trump insisted, without offering evidence, that the general election has been rigged against him, and he twice refused to say that he would accept its result.\u201cI will look at it at the time,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI will keep you in suspense.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s horrifying,\u201d Mrs. Clinton replied. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating \u2014 he is talking down our democracy. And I am appalled that someone who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that position.\u201dMrs. Clinton then ticked off the number of times he had deemed a system rigged when he suffered a setback, noting he had even called the Emmy Awards fixed when his show, \u201cThe Apprentice,\u2019\u2019 was passed over.\u201cIt\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s also really troubling,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not the way our democracy works.\u201dMrs. Clinton also accused Mr. Trump of extreme coziness with Mr. Putin, criticizing him for failing to condemn Russian espionage against her campaign\u2019s internal email.When Mr. Trump responded that Mr. Putin had \u201cno respect\u201d for Mrs. Clinton, she shot back, in one of the toughest lines of the night: \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet as president of the United States.\u201d\u201cNo puppet, no puppet,\u201d Mr. Trump sputtered. \u201cYou\u2019re the puppet.\u201d He quickly recovered and said, \u201cShe has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen in any government, whatsoever.\u201dWith 20 days left before Election Day and early voting already underway in Florida, Ohio and several other key states, the debate felt less like an argument between equals than a last-ditch attempt by a fading candidate, Mr. Trump, to save himself.Mr. Trump sought throughout the debate to recover from a politically damaging three weeks. He has been unable to gain traction in the polls from his strategy of assailing the Clintons as corrupt and immoral; the news media as biased and bent on rigging the election against him; and the nine women who have come forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances as liars and, in some cases, unattractive.Mr. Trump said, in response to a question from the debate moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, that the claims of the women had been \u201cdebunked\u201d and that they had been put forward by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.But after he denied ridiculing the looks of the women accusing him of sexual harassment \u2014 \u201cI did not say that,\u201d he repeated three times \u2014 Mrs. Clinton repeated nearly verbatim his two comments from last week about the appearances of a pair of his accusers.\u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes after their dignity, their self-worth; and I don\u2019t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like.\u201dReporters for The New York Times fact-checked the statements made by Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump during Wednesday\u2019s presidential debate.After Mrs. Clinton finished an extended condemnation, Mr. Trump said only: \u201cNobody has more respect for women than I do, nobody.\u201dIn contrast to their two previous debates, the 90-minute discussion covered significant substantive ground. On immigration, Mr. Trump argued that Mrs. Clinton wanted to give illegal immigrants \u201camnesty\u201d and that \u201cshe wants to have open borders.\u201d\u201cWe have to have strong borders, we have to keep the drugs out of our country \u2014 right now we\u2019re getting the drugs, they\u2019re getting the cash,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have some bad hombres here, and we\u2019re going to get them out.\u201dMrs. Clinton recalled meeting a young girl in Las Vegas whose parents had been threatened, and noted that Mr. Trump has said that every illegal immigrant would ultimately be subject to deportation.\u201cI don\u2019t want to rip families apart,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.\u201dAt several points, Mrs. Clinton tried to bait Mr. Trump into an outburst, such as when she said that he \u201cchoked\u201d during his meeting this summer with the president of Mexico when he did not press him on Mexico paying to build a border wall.But Mr. Trump pivoted to attack former President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration for supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement and assailed Mrs. Clinton for her past comments supporting \u201copen borders\u201d in the Western Hemisphere.Mr. Trump also called the Clinton Foundation \u201ca criminal enterprise.\u201d Mrs. Clinton returned fire by ridiculing Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation, which she noted purchased \u201ca six-foot portrait of Donald.\u201d\u201cI mean, who does that?\u201d she asked.The two candidates also tangled over abortion rights. After initially declining to flatly say whether he would support overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, Mr. Trump conceded that the justices he would appoint to the court would do just that.\u201cIf we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that\u2019s really what will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019ll happen automatically in my opinion.\u201dMrs. Clinton responded with a full-throated defense of Roe and abortion rights.\u201cThe government has no business in the decisions that women make,\u201d she said.Mr. Trump retorted, \u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.\u201dHere\u2019s how we analyzed in real time the last presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.Mrs. Clinton appeared visibly angry. \u201cYou should meet with some of the women I\u2019ve met with,\u201d she said, accusing him of using \u201cscare rhetoric.\u201dMrs. Clinton used the opening question about the Supreme Court to make a broad appeal to voters to consider the future of the United States under her presidency or a Trump administration. \u201cWhat kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities are we going to provide for our citizens, what kind of rights will Americans have?\u201dMr. Trump asserted that if Mrs. Clinton won, the Second Amendment would become \u201ca very, very small replica of what we have now.\u201d He also said he would appoint justices who \u201cwill interpret the Constitution the way the founders want it interpreted.\u201dMrs. Clinton quickly tried to undercut Mr. Trump on guns.\u201cI support the Second Amendment,\u201d she said, noting that she had lived in Arkansas and represented upstate New York where many gun owners lived. \u201cWhen I think about what I need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks\u201d and to close loopholes that make it easier for Americans to buy guns.On the economy, Mrs. Clinton described Mr. Trump as a hypocrite, accusing him of crying \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d over manufacturers moving abroad while noting that he uses foreign steel for his hotel in Las Vegas.That prompted a ferocious counterattack from Mr. Trump, demanding why she had not done more to improve the economy during her years in public life.\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you do it over the last 15 or 20 years,\u201d he demanded, adding: \u201cThe one thing you have over me is experience, but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201dMrs. Clinton, clearly prepared for him to return to this line of attack, responded with a carefully prepared salvo.She compared what the two of them had been doing since the 1970s, highlighting her public service accomplishments and ridiculing him for borrowing money from his father, mocking a beauty queen as \u201can eating machine\u201d and hosting a reality television show.\u201cOn the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.Mr. Trump defended himself by boasting about his business success and said the country would be well served if it was run in the fashion of his company.Mrs. Clinton, reaching for not just a win but a mandate, made both direct and more subtle appeals to Republican voters. She noted that in the 1980s Mr. Trump had criticized Ronald Reagan over his stewardship, twice invoking the name of the late president revered by so many Republicans.Remarkably, Mr. Trump demanded additional time to speak so he could note that he did, in fact, disagree with Reagan over trade. Mrs. Clinton, in that moment, came off as more respectful to Republican history.\u201cI would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I\u2019m reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we need everybody to help make our country what it should be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Democratic Inversion", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byAccording to an Oct. 23 ABC News poll, Clinton also leads among all white college graduates, 52-36. She has an unprecedented gender gap among these voters, leading 62-30 among college-educated white women and tying among college educated white men, 42-42.What these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true.The data reflects an ongoing evolution in the composition of the two parties.By 2016, the percentage of Democratic voters with college degrees or better outnumbered those with high school degrees or less, 37-32, while 31 percent had some college but no degree. Among Republicans, the share with college degrees rose modestly from 28 to 31 percent, but remained smaller than those with high school diplomas or less, 34 percent in 2016.These shifts in education and income have contributed to sharp changes, at least for the moment, in the outlook of Democrats and Republicans.Democrats, including the party\u2019s elite, remain decisively liberal, and have become more cosmopolitan \u2014 more readily accepting of globalization, more welcoming of immigrants, less nationalistic \u2014 and more optimistic about the future.Highly educated adults \u2013 particularly those who have attended graduate school \u2013 are far more likely than those with less education to take predominantly liberal positions across a range of political values. And these differences have increased over the past two decades.From 1994 to 2014, the percentage of voters with postgraduate degrees holding \u201cconsistently liberal\u201d views grew fourfold, from 7 to 31 percent, and fivefold among those with college degrees, 5 to 24 percent.Working class African-Americans and Hispanics are, like their white counterparts without degrees, on the low end of the income distribution. When blacks and Hispanics compare their situations to those of their parents, they see their circumstances improving, in contrast to low income, non-college whites, who see a downward trajectory.may look back to a time when discrimination deprived their parents of equal opportunities. Many Hispanics may look back to the lower standard of living their parents experienced in their countries of origin. Whites are likely to compare themselves to a reference group that leads them to feel worse off. Blacks and Hispanics compare themselves to reference groups that may make them feel better off.For many whites, Cherlin writes,their main reference group is their parents\u2019 generation, and by that standard they have little to look forward to and a lot to lamentLess well-educated blacks and Hispanics have not experienced the income gains of the college-educated of all races, but they do see their lives improving when their parents are the reference point.The pessimists: Trump supporters (81 worse, 11 better), Republicans (72-17) and whites without college degrees (60-28).Among well-educated whites, there are clear reasons for optimism. What is a primary marker of likely success in the contemporary American economy? The answer in one word is education.Alan Berube and Natalie Holmes, a senior fellow and a research analyst at Brookings, provided me with data from 2015 demonstrating that education is a key determinant of income. For whites with a high school diploma or less, median annual income is $30,038; with some college, it\u2019s $36,047; with a bachelor\u2019s degree, $51,064; and with a postgraduate degree, $68,086.The UVA-IASC survey highlighted the political and cultural gulf between upscale, predominately Democratic whites and downscale, predominately Republican whites.The first group, \u201cthe Social Elite\u201d in UVA-IASC\u2019s terminology, is made up of whites with advanced degrees. They are 49 percent Democratic, 16.8 percent Republican. 87.5 percent say the Democratic Party represents their views very or fairly well, compared to zero percent who say the Republican Party represents them very well and 24.2 percent who say that it does so \u201cfairly well.\u201d They plan to vote for Clinton over Trump by 74.3 to 14.1 percent.The second group, termed \u201cthe Disinherited\u201d in the UVA-IASC survey, comprises religiously conservative whites without college degrees. Republicans outnumber Democrats 52.3 to 11.1, and 60.9 percent say the Republican Party represents their views very or fairly well. They plan to vote for Trump by 74.3 to 13.5 percent.James Davison Hunter, a professor of religion, culture and social theory at UVA, and Carl Desportes Bowman, director of survey research at the IASC, write that half of the Disinheritedlive on less than $50,000 per year compared to 10 percent of the Social Elite. The majority of the Disinherited (58%) describe their family\u2019s current financial situation as \u201conly fair\u201d or \u201cpoor,\u201d with half (52%) seeing their prospects in the future as worse, 21 percent seeing their prospects as \u201cmuch worse.\u201d\u201cConversely, six out of ten (58%) of the Social Elite have family incomes that are $100,000 or over, compared to 13 percent of the Disinherited. The Social Elite are aware of their good fortune: 73 percent describe their current financial situation as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d and an even stronger majority (79%) see their future as staying the same (36%) or getting better (43%).More affluent and well-educated white voters have substantially different policy agendas from their less affluent and less well-educated fellow citizens.First, the downscale whites.Nearly half say they feel alienated from contemporary America (\u201ca stranger in their own land\u201d), that they have little or no power to change the course of events \u2014 84.4 percent believe public officials do not care \u201cwhat people like me think.\u201d 83.5 percent agreed that \u201cin general, Americans lived more moral and ethical lives 50 year ago.\u201dThese voters are convinced (72.6 percent) that they can no longer get ahead in America through hard work, and that the government in Washington threatens the freedom of \u201cordinary Americans\u201d (75.3 percent). In a nation where same-sex marriage has gained public acceptance and gays routinely appear in television and movies, 54.9 percent of these voters say their own \u201cbeliefs and values\u201d are different from those of gays and lesbians, and 66.2 percent oppose requiring every state to permit same-sex marriages.Then the \u201cSocial Elite.\u201d74.2 percent say the economy is holding steady or improving; 71.1 percent say that 25 years from now \u201cpeople like you\u201d will be doing the same or better; 66 percent disagree with the statement that \u201cpeople like me\u201d have no say in government; 68.8 percent say that in America you still get ahead by working hard; 56.7 percent are personally in agreement with the values and beliefs of the cultural elite. 57 percent disagree with the statement that \u201cpeople like me don\u2019t have any say in what the government does.\u201dThese upscale white liberals like government. 52.5 percent have \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot\u201d of confidence that public officials will tell the truth, compared with 17.1 percent of the Disinherited. 68.7 percent of \u201cthe Social Elite\u201d disagree with the statement \u201cthe best government governs least,\u201d compared with the 75.3 percent of the Disinherited.\u201d 74.4 percent disagree with the statement that the government in Washington threatens the freedom of ordinary Americans.There is, in addition, a significant difference in the attitudes toward the poor coming from voters in the \u201csocial elite\u201d and those from \u201cthe disinherited.\u201d Asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement \u201cMost Americans who live in poverty are there because of their own bad habits and choices,\u201d the social elite sharply disagreed, 81-19, while the disinherited were split (47.2 percent agree, 52.8 percent disagree).The two PRRI surveys use more traditional terminology, but the findings reinforce those of the UVA-IASC study.PRRI shows how much the Trump wing of the Republican Party sees itself as the underdog, while Clinton supporters recognize their privileged position in today\u2019s economy:About seven in ten likely voters supporting Donald Trump (72%) say American society and way of life has changed for the worse since the 1950s, while seven in ten likely voters supporting Hillary Clinton (70%) say things have changed for the better.These patterns are repeated in the pronounced class differences among whites:A majority (56%) of white college-educated Americans say American society is generally better now than it was in the 1950s, while nearly two-thirds (65%) of white working-class Americans say things are now worse.White evangelical Protestants have the bleakest view of all: \u201cNearly three-quarters (74%) say American culture has changed for the worse since the 1950s.\u201dThe rise of the social elite constituency in the Democratic Party and the disinherited in the Republican Party has contributed to a shift in partisan views of free trade agreements \u2014 part of a larger split on globalism, immigration, and multiculturalism.There is an argument that the divided preferences of white voters \u2014 with the better off linked to an upscale Democratic Party and the less well off to a downscale Republican Party \u2014 is a unique reflection of this year\u2019s presidential race pitting Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton.Looking now at the changing composition of the Republican electorate, what stands out is the failure of party leaders to anticipate the discontent of their own primary voters.Preliminary indications are that the traditional top levels of the Republican Party hierarchy \u2014 heavily populated by the affluent and the wealthy \u2014 will face major hurdles retaining control after the coming election. The Trump campaign has demonstrated that many Republican voters are deeply critical of their own party establishment, to put it mildly. In the Florida Republican primary, 60 percent of the voters said they felt \u201cbetrayed by Republican politicians\u201d; in Michigan, 58 percent; Pennsylvania, 59 percent. The disaffection of the Republican electorate from the party leadership is palpable everywhere.Democrats would appear to face problems trying to stabilize an affluent white and disadvantaged minority coalition with starkly different economic interests. Divisions over environmental and energy policies, trade and taxes are potentially areas of disagreement. In practice, this may prove easier than expected.The largely white upscale wing of the Democratic Party is far more liberal on economic policy than its self-interest would suggest. In the UVA-IASC survey, the social elite is not only sympathetic to the poor and to pro-government intervention, but, by 3 to 1, believes that the \u201csystem is rigged in favor\u201d of the wealthy; by nearly 6 to 1 believes that Wall Street and big business \u201cprofit at the expense of ordinary Americans;\u201d and believes, by better than 2 to 1, that the government \u201cshould do more to improve the lives of ordinary Americans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sympathetic Canadians Have a Message for Americans: You Guys Are Great", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byThe presidential campaign has exposed deep divides in American society and left many in every political party anxious about the future. During this time of political tension, our neighbors to the north have one thing to say: America is just great.It was the brainchild of the Garden Collective, a creative agency based in Toronto, and in the videos, a diverse and polite group of Canadians earnestly recite all the things they like about the United States.\u201cSometimes friends just need to look out for each other,\u201d Shari Walczak, a founder of the agency, said on Sunday.His testimonial is followed by two dozen more Canadians warmly praising the United States for things like its diversity, its space program and for being the birthplace of Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur.To a jaded American eye, it may all look like the most Canadian thing ever.\u201cI guess we are living up to the stereotype aren\u2019t we?\u201d Ms. Walczak said, laughing. \u201cWe have managed to personify the whole country with this one initiative!\u201dMs. Walczak said she and her co-workers started the campaign as a labor of love \u2014 they are not using it to sell anything, she said \u2014 because they wanted to make a positive contribution to an election season that has been downright depressing.\u201cEvery morning we\u2019d come together at work and there would inevitably be a discussion about another negative piece of news about the election,\u201d she said. \u201cWe look at it through a Canadian lens, but all of us have friends, family and colleagues who live in America. We realized they\u2019re immersed in it day in and day out and how awful that must feel.\u201dOver the weekend, many Canadians chimed in to cheer up their neighbors to the south by tweeting their favorite things about the United States. Ms. Walczak said the hashtag #TellAmericaItsGreat was intended as a play on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201dOf course, every four years American political partisans of one stripe or another swear they will move to Canada if the presidential candidate they oppose wins.President Obama teased him on that visit about the frequency with which Americans threaten to decamp for Canada: \u201cTypically it turns out fine.\u201dMs. Walczak said that close relationship is one reason Canadians were watching American politics so closely. \u201cEverything is so intertwined, we can\u2019t help but realize that we\u2019ll also be affected by the outcome of this election,\u201d she said.Another reason: an embarrassing twinge of recognition.

{"Headline": "The Decline of the West, and How to Stop It", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 For most of the last 70 years, the United States, Canada and much of Europe have constituted a vast zone of peace, prosperity and democracy. The trans-Atlantic community has grown to over 900 million inhabitants of more than 30 countries. It has set an example for regional cooperation in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia, and served as a mainstay of the liberal world order.That achievement is in jeopardy. The bonds within Europe have been fraying for some time, but this year has been the worst yet. Last month, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Union\u2019s highest official, said that the union faced \u201can existential crisis.\u201dMeanwhile, America\u2019s two major parties have soured on trade agreements with Europe and Asia. Donald J. Trump has welcomed Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, derided American allies and hailed an authoritarian leader, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who fears and tries to undermine Western solidarity.Given these pressures, the year ahead may determine whether the West can overcome its current troubles. A vital lesson of the modern era is that internationalism has stabilized the world, while lapses into bellicose nationalism have wreaked havoc.The aftermath of World War I was a series of follies and failures: the Carthaginian peace of Versailles, the ineptitude of the League of Nations, the Great Depression and the emergence of totalitarianism. Together, they made a second conflagration all but inevitable.The victors of World War II determined not to repeat the mistakes of their predecessors. They found in the history of Western civilization the precepts for a community of nations buttressed not only by shared values, interests and institutions, but also by the world\u2019s most powerful military alliance. They had much to draw on: Pericles\u2019 ideal polity (\u201cnot the few but the many govern\u201d), the Hanseatic League (a trade and defense pact in the Middle Ages), the Age of Reason, Adam Smith\u2019s advocacy of open markets and the division of labor to enhance the wealth of nations, and Immanuel Kant\u2019s conviction that \u201cperpetual peace\u201d depended on democratic nations\u2019 conducting vigorous commerce.The first step toward a united Europe was a common market for coal and steel. France and Germany, enemies in both world wars, became partners in peacetime industry and trade. The architects of the European Project, subscribing to a binding ethos of Atlanticism, were inspired by America\u2019s success in molding the newly independent states from the original 13 colonies into \u201ca more perfect union.\u201d Europe\u2019s progress in that direction would never have been possible without the Marshall Plan, which jump-started the Continent\u2019s postwar economic recovery and ensured 42 years of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a shield against the Soviet Union.The collapse of that faltering superpower in 1991 spurred the evolution of the European Economic Community into the European Union. NATO\u2019s decision to accept new members that had been Soviet satellites and republics made it possible for the European Union to do the same.Throughout, the byword was integration: a steady process of harmonizing the policies of individual nation-states into common European ones, making collaboration easier and interdependence beneficial for all.In the 1970s, before the term became pejorative, \u201cEurocrats\u201d in Brussels took pride in being at the vanguard of a worldwide trend for which they popularized a little-used word: globalization. By most accounts, the opening of markets significantly narrowed the inequality between rich and poor regions of the world, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, especially in Asia. The downside of globalization in developed regions, especially in North America and Europe \u2014 depressed wages and jobs at risk in industries exposed to foreign competition \u2014 seemed manageable as long as the world economy was humming.Through the 1990s, for the most part, economies continued to grow, median incomes climbed, jobs were plentiful and markets signaled a bright future. In 2007, the Dow Jones industrial average soared to a record high. A year later, the euro reached its maximum value against the dollar. But within a few months, America\u2019s banking and housing sectors had crashed, prompting the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. Close to nine million Americans lost their jobs and a similar number of homeowners were forced into foreclosures, surrenders of their homes or distress sales. The decline in national wealth hit the poor and middle class hardest.The Great Recession was worse for Europe. Trade with the rest of the world slumped and employment shrank, especially along the Mediterranean rim. The economic crisis exposed and exacerbated structural flaws in the European Union itself. Even in the good times, there had been tensions between debtor and creditor member states. The common currency, the euro, imposed a common monetary policy and a fixed exchange rate, but without fiscal integration among countries. That defect has hobbled Europe\u2019s response to the sovereign debt crises and caused precipitous drops in employment.The last year has seen one catastrophe after another. A rash of terrorist attacks has heightened security concerns; Britain\u2019s decision to leave the union has raised fears of a contagion of other \u201cexits\u201d; and an influx of migrants and refugees from the Middle East and North Africa has placed burdens on labor markets, stressed social services and inflamed public anxieties.The election campaign in the United States has revealed a similar malaise. Many Americans, especially in rural and blue-collar areas, are pessimistic about the future and nostalgic for a seemingly better past. As in Europe, there is widespread mistrust of elites and experts, and feverish enthusiasm for anti-establishment populists.With this backlash comes the threat of protectionism in economics, isolationism in foreign policy, and a resurgent nativism and xenophobia in politics \u2014 precisely the toxic mix that the North American and European visionaries of Atlanticism sought to prevent when they laid its foundations.Fortunately, stewards of that legacy remain in power in most Western capitals. And many citizens of European Union countries, especially the younger generations, tend to identify as Europeans, whatever their nationality. Despite Brexit, this is still true of many Britons.That still leaves Europe\u2019s elected officials with an onerous task. They must convince majorities of their citizens that 27 member states can better protect them within the European Union than without it.To do so, the union\u2019s institutions need to streamline decision-making while improving cooperation. In particular, they must prove effective in thwarting terrorists, whether they are infiltrators from the Middle East or homegrown. The attacks perpetrated this year by European citizens underscore the need for a long-term strategy to tackle alienation and radicalization within Europe\u2019s Muslim communities.That talismanic Euro-word, integration, finds new relevance: Instead of segregating migrants and asylum seekers in enclaves like those in inner-city Brussels or among the banlieues of Paris, several European municipalities are exploring ways to accelerate the process of assimilation by providing low-cost housing, education and job training. Starting and funding such programs would be challenging under normal circumstances, but the difficulties are especially acute now, when virtually all Western European governments are on the defensive and several face daunting electoral challenges from nationalist opponents in the year ahead.Mr. Putin has all too successfully stoked the sense of peril and fear of failure in the West. The Kremlin is backing insurgent euroskeptic parties, bullying Russia\u2019s neighbors and trying to undo sanctions imposed after its illegal annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine. Against such subversion, the NATO alliance needs beefing up to help prevent Europe\u2019s political disintegration \u2014 and this must be a major priority for any incoming United States administration.The next president will have domestic challenges as well, given the gridlock between the executive and legislative branches, and an inward turn in the public mood. The current polarizing and dispiriting presidential campaign may also cast a pall over the future.These handicaps make it even more important for Western governments to address their citizens\u2019 legitimate concerns about the impact of globalization. They must work to cement a new political consensus that will restore public support for free and fair international trade. Persuading the newly industrialized nations with export-based economies to adopt better labor practices and environmental policies, and to respect human rights, is not enough. There will have to be remedial action at home. Vulnerable workers in developed nations deserve better safety nets, as well as ambitious and effective retraining opportunities in growing sectors of economy.Citizens\u2019 sense that the system is unfair needs addressing, too. Big business is ripe for reform. Newcomers to the marketplace should have a better chance in markets that are now dominated by mega-monopolies. American-based corporations should not be able to exploit tax rules that allow them to shift profits to the lowest tax jurisdictions.For globalization to be politically sustainable, it must be more economically equitable. Measures like these would begin to persuade a critical mass of people at global, regional and national levels that they, too, can share in a new wave of prosperity.Restoring social progress on this scale will succeed only if it has buy-in from all segments of society. But the innovation and direction must come from the top. In enlisting their constituents\u2019 support for a renewed commitment to Atlanticism, this generation of Western leaders faces the greatest and most consequential test in 70 years.Javier Solana is a former foreign minister of Spain, high representative for the European Union\u2019s common foreign and security policy and secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

{"Headline": "Competing Views on How to Regulate Illegal Migration", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe Bracero Program, which drew hundreds of thousands of Mexican laborers to toil in American fields from 1942 to 1964, left a searing memory of injustice. The program has been blamed for depressing farm wages and abusing immigrant workers.Critics argue that the Bracero Program did not stop illegal immigration. And they cite some evidence that farm wages rose after it ended. Other studies, however, suggest otherwise. There is no historical census of illegal immigrants, so the numbers will remain in dispute.Today, undocumented immigrants make up about half the agricultural labor force; guest workers under the H-2A visa program make up a much smaller share. Wages are hardly great. As more Mexican immigrants leave the United States than arrive, wages for field laborers average less than $12 an hour. That\u2019s about one-third less than the average pay in the notoriously low-wage retail sector.With Washington expected to return next year to the issue of illegal immigration, the debate deserves even greater attention. David Bacon, a journalist and author, and Philip Martin, an expert on immigration an the University of California, Davis, offer critical views of the proposal for a new guest worker program. Michael Clemens of the Center for Global Development \u2014 the main author of the new blueprint to regulate migration from Mexico \u2014 and Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations, another author, respond. Their letters were lightly edited.From David BaconThe column by Eduardo Porter proposing a new Bracero Program contains significant misstatements of fact. They dramatize the reasons civil rights leaders of the 1960s, including Ernesto Galarza, Cesar Chavez, Bert Corona and Larry Itliong, opposed the old Bracero Program and persuaded Congress to end it in 1964.Porter says apprehensions of people crossing the border dropped to zero during the 1950s. In fact, over a million people were deported in the notorious Operation Wetback operation in 1954. Anti-immigrant enforcement increases during periods of large guest worker programs, because those workers are needed to force migration into those channels.Porter says farmworker wages hardly soared after the Bracero Program ended. In fact, the period in which farmworker wages rose the fastest was during the two decades afterward. Itliong and Filipino workers, whose strikes were broken by growers bringing in braceros, struck in 1965, the year after the program was abolished. When Mexican workers under Chavez joined that strike, the United Farm Workers union was born. The contracts achieved at the union\u2019s height in the 1970s and early \u201880s gave farmworkers the highest wages, taking inflation into account, that they have ever had.Porter proposes that part of workers\u2019 wages be withheld and paid only after the harvest and their return to Mexico. Withholding wages like this is illegal for workers in this country. To this day, growers, banks in Mexico and the United States, and the Mexican government all blame each other for millions of dollars of withheld wages that have \u201cdisappeared,\u201d and braceros are still fighting to reclaim them.If the purpose of Porter\u2019s proposal is not to provide labor at low wages, then I have a counterproposal. Spread California\u2019s laws giving farm workers a legal process for forming unions and requiring growers to negotiate union contracts when they do to every other state. When workers have unions, higher wages and more protections, growers will find it easier to attract people to fill those jobs.David Bacon is the author of \u201cCommunities Without Borders: Images and Voices from the World of Migration\u201d (Cornell University/ILR Press, 2006), \u201cIllegal People: How Globalization Creates Migration and Criminalizes Immigrants\u201d (Beacon Press, 2008), and \u201cThe Right to Stay Home: How U.S. Policy Drives Mexican Migration\u201d (Beacon Press, 2013).__________From Edward AldenIn the summer of 2005, I visited then Representative, now Senator Jeff Flake on his parents\u2019 ranch in Snowflake, Ariz. When he was a kid, the ranch hired dozens of Mexicans each year to tend crops that would feed the cattle when the winter snows came. Nearly all were unauthorized migrants; they simply followed the work and better wages, as their fathers had done before them.The Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico were long part of a single labor market, with a line drawn by their governments in between. If the governments wanted to regulate what Douglas Massey of Princeton called this \u201ccircular migration,\u201d there were only two choices \u2014 legalize the flow or criminalize it and impose harsh consequences.Each of these approaches, however, has been very costly. Under Bracero, poorly designed rules and lax enforcement led to abuses of workers\u2019 rights and unfair wage competition for United States workers. The era of illegal migration that followed was no better for Mexican or United States workers, and it led to the collapse of the American public\u2019s confidence in the immigration system. The era of border enforcement has cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, enriched coyote smugglers and led to hundreds of migrants dying each year in dangerous desert crossings.These requirements go far beyond the current H-2 programs and would address head-on the legitimate criticisms of many past temporary worker plans. And sustained enforcement would be needed to ensure that illegal paths do not again become more attractive than the legal ones for migrants and for employers.Much has been learned since the Bracero Program was ended more the 50 years ago. It is time to apply those lessons and regulate Mexico-United States migration to better serve the interests of Mexican workers, American workers and employers.__________Rather than substituting for illegal migration, the Bracero Program set the stage for large scale illegal Mexico-United States migration via two major channels. First, the availability of braceros combined with water projects and the Interstate System of highways allowed labor-intensive agriculture to expand far away from consumers, so that California replaced New Jersey as the nation\u2019s garden state. Second, Mexican workers and United States farmers gained experience working with one another, a mutual dependence they were reluctant to end.Nevertheless, there was not an immediate upsurge in illegal migration after the Bracero Program ended. Instead, farm wages jumped 40 percent, from $1.25 to $1.75 an hour in the United Farm Worker grape contracts of 1966. The lack of braceros prompted a wave of labor-saving mechanization, including forklifts in the fields to move 1,000-pound bins of produce, and the mechanization of the tomato harvest. Modern personnel management, such as scheduling work carefully and identifying and retaining the best workers, permitted fewer workers to do the work.There are three important lessons from developments in the farm labor market after the Bracero Program. First, economic principles worked, as a reduced supply of labor led to higher wages that primarily reduced the demand for farm workers. Second, farm employers began to treat more expensive workers better, adding benefits such as health insurance and pensions to retain experienced workers. Third, farmers anticipating ever-higher wages sponsored research on labor-saving mechanization, so that one major study predicted there would soon be no hand-labor jobs on farms.Rising unauthorized migration in the 1970s reversed these trends. One example tells the story. In the late 1960s, the citrus industry supported 70-odd projects aimed at harvesting oranges mechanically; by 1980, this industry support ended. Increases in unauthorized migration stabilized labor costs and reversed grower incentives to treat farm labor as an ever-rising cost.Philip Martin is chairman of the Comparative Immigration and Integration Program at the University of California, Davis, and editor of the newsletters Migration News and Rural Migration News.__________From Michael ClemensI write to correct several statements by David Bacon and Phil Martin regarding Eduardo Porter\u2019s discussion of a proposed United States-Mexico labor migration agreement by the \u201cShared Border, Shared Future\u201d working group.Bracero visas obviously substituted for illegal migration. Immediately after the United States vastly raised the number of visas to an adequate 400,000 in 1954, illegal migration collapsed to near zero for the duration of the program. This outcome required both the adequate legal pathway and stronger enforcement, as Kelly Lytle Hernandez documents in her groundbreaking book, \u201cMigra! A History of the U.S. Border Patrol.\u201dSubstantial illegal migration occurred exclusively in the early years of the program, when the number of visas \u2014 around 100,000 a year \u2014 was insufficient. But the end of this legal channel in 1965 was followed by unprecedented illegal migration in the 1970s and \u201980s.Mr. Bacon mentions the unacceptable abuses of workers under the existing seasonal work visa. That is why this new proposal departs sharply from that tainted model. The proposal prevents workers from being tied to a single employer, and it eliminates unscrupulous recruiters the only way it can be done: bilaterally. He also mentions that many braceros\u2019 wages were stolen. No one knows that better than this group, which includes Alejandro Poir\u00e9, a former director of the Mexican government\u2019s program to restitute those losses. Thus the group insists on a 21st century system to transfer any withheld wages from the United States government securely and directly to individual workers.The policy decision of 1965 was to outlaw those longstanding, generational traditions of temporary mobility across the border. The dark consequence of that decision is today\u2019s giant black market in labor that has immeasurably harmed United States and Mexican workers. It is time to move past the failed policies and fossilized positions of the previous generation, and the \u201cShared Border, Shared Future\u201d report offers a specific vision of how to do that.Michael Clemens is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. He was the lead author of \u201cShared Border, Shared Future: A Blueprint to Regulate U.S.-Mexico Labor Mobility.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flush and Dominant, Australia\u2019s Banks Come Under Pressure", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Dr. Benjamin Koh felt it was obvious what his employer wanted: to avoid paying the claim of a terminally ill customer.His employer, the insurance arm of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country\u2019s biggest bank, asked Dr. Koh to check out the customer, who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. \u201cThey asked me to back them up and see if there was a loophole to justify rejecting the claim,\u201d said Dr. Koh, then the insurer\u2019s chief medical officer.The customer\u2019s physician left no doubt. The patient, he said, was on morphine and would be lucky to last even a few days.Dr. Koh cites that example as one of many that he says showed his employer was systematically trying to refuse or delay legitimate insurance claims. Fired shortly after he complained to its board, he took his accusations public \u2014 and added to a growing storm in Australia over the size, power and conduct of the country\u2019s four big banks.Long politically protected and immensely profitable, Australia\u2019s big banks are now facing the biggest public outcry in a generation. The banks dominate Australian financial life, from credit cards and savings accounts to pensions and business services.Still, Australia stands out. At a time when the world is considering what to do about banks that are too big to fail, Australia offers a glimpse of just how big \u2014 and how dominant \u2014 they can become.Politicians from both of Australia\u2019s major parties say the banks have used their position to profit on the backs of the country\u2019s spenders and borrowers. At a gala in April to celebrate the 199th birthday of one bank, Malcolm Turnbull, the country\u2019s prime minister, said, \u201cOur bankers have not always treated their customers as they should.\u201d His government has vowed to increase funding for the local banking regulator and force bank chiefs to appear before lawmakers.The opposition Labor Party wants to get even tougher. Mr. Turnbull is \u201cnow inviting them to lunch in Canberra once a year so he can wag his finger at them,\u201d Bill Shorten, the party\u2019s leader, told reporters. \u201cThis is a friendly catch-up, not an investigation.\u201dThe banks have apologized for some infractions but have largely defended their role, citing their stability and their role in the country\u2019s long spate of uninterrupted economic growth.As a result, the banks capture 3 cents in pretax profit of every $1 spent in the economy, estimates David Richardson, an economist who has studied the industry at the Australia Institute, a policy think tank. \u201cOne way or another, the banks are making monopoly profits,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThere is no competition in Australia.\u201dAdding to the sense of public anger, Australian officials extended $11 billion in financing to the banks during the global financial crisis. The banks have also benefited from low rates that some politicians say they are not fully passing on to borrowers.Australia\u2019s corporate regulator is suing three of the banks \u2014 Westpac, National Australia and Australia and New Zealand \u2014 over claims that they manipulated Australian interest rates to bolster profits. The government cited a transcript of internal Westpac phone calls quoting the head of Westpac\u2019s treasury department, Colin Roden, telling a colleague, \u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money on it we just had to do it, right?\u201dA spokesman for Westpac said none of its employees had broken the law. He declined to make Mr. Roden available for an interview.National Australia Bank and ANZ have also denied any wrongdoing. But ANZ fired several traders named in the investigation after discovering what it said were disparaging remarks about women and casual remarks about drugs in employee emails and chats.Some customers have also accused the banks of selling them products they did not need \u2014 accusations that have drawn the attention of lawmakers. They accuse the lenders of giving their employees big incentives to sell products like mutual funds to unwitting customers. \u201cIt causes deep conflict within the services arm of the bank,\u201d said Josh Mennen, a lawyer at the law firm Maurice Blackburn, which is suing the bank on behalf of several clients.Those incentives occasionally led to outright misconduct, according to a parliamentary inquiry. In one case, a Commonwealth Bank salesman forged a couple\u2019s signatures and transferred some of their retirement savings into high-risk shares, contributing to a 65 percent fall in the portfolio and forcing them onto welfare, one witness said. The bank apologized in 2014 for what it said was widespread inappropriate selling of financial products and offered customers free reviews of its financial advice.CommInsure, a unit of Commonwealth Bank, has been a top target of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, a securities regulator. The regulator is investigating claims that the insurer used outdated medical definitions to avoid paying claims, pressured doctors into denying claims, deleted medical files and left whistle-blowers exposed, according to the commission\u2019s chairman, Greg Medcraft, a former Wall Street banker.\u201cThe banks need to have a culture their customers can believe in,\u201d he said in an interview.The day before Commonwealth Bank\u2019s chief executive was due to answer questions from legislators, the bank said it had updated its medical definitions for heart attacks and severe rheumatoid arthritis. The change means that 17 customers whose insurance claims were denied will be paid, and that 38 more could be after further investigation by the bank.\u201cWe have done wrong by some customers in that business and other businesses,\u201d the chief executive, Ian Narev, told a parliamentary committee. \u201cThe goal is to put things right.\u201dThe government investigation, and lawsuits by former customers, were largely tied to the controversy set off by Mr. Koh, the former chief medical officer of CommInsure, the insurance arm of Commonwealth Bank.By the time he was asked to check whether the man suffering from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease was really sick, Dr. Koh already believed that the company was deliberately delaying claims from terminally ill customers to get out of paying them. \u201cIt was distressing for me,\u201d Dr. Koh said, adding that the customer\u2019s physician \u201cwas basically reading his last rites.\u201dCommInsure fired Dr. Koh last year for sending clients\u2019 files to his private email address, a step he said was necessary to document the bank\u2019s behavior. He is suing under whistle-blower protection laws.Carlos Tejada contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe May Finally End Its Painful Embrace of Austerity", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 As Europe has grappled with the trauma of a devastating financial and economic crisis, policy makers have consistently relied on one approach to managing the damage \u2014 budget austerity.Shrink government spending by trimming pensions and cutting social programs, the logic runs, and the markets will gain confidence in the tough-minded people in charge. Confident markets make for happy markets. Money will pour in, and good times will roll.Even as prosperity has remained painfully elusive across much of Europe, leaders have time and again renewed their faith in the virtues of this harsh medicine.Until now.Some policy makers are flashing tentative signs that they may be prepared to slacken their grip on public coffers to spur growth and improve the lot of ordinary people suffering joblessness and diminished wealth. In the clearest sign of this shift, the heavily indebted Italy is increasingly inclined to challenge Germany \u2014 the guardian of austerity \u2014 to loosen European purse strings.The development comes after Britain\u2019s stunning vote to abandon the European Union, an angry rebuke of the economic elite within struggling communities, and as populist, anti-immigrant movements across the Continent gain traction.Above all, the change could be an antidote to years of dogmatic European policies, replacing a failed effort to generate economic growth through cutting spending with a focus on bolstering investment.\u201cAusterity is out of the discussion in a way,\u201d said the Italian finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, during a recent interview in Rome. \u201cWe need to bring more growth and more jobs to Europe.\u201dThe most obvious place the new dynamic is unfolding is in Britain.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Before the June 23 vote for \u201cBrexit,\u201d the man in charge of the budget, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, was publicly pursuing the aim of delivering a budget surplus by 2020. The target required cuts.But as the political class absorbed the ballot result, interpreting it as a demand for redress from communities reeling from high unemployment and wage stagnation, Mr. Osborne acknowledged that his goal could no longer be achieved.His successor, Philip Hammond, has raised the ante.Budget cutting has given way to fresh spending in large part because of fears of the economic consequences of Britain\u2019s potentially tortuous European divorce proceedings. Investment is expected to slow, reflecting grave uncertainty. British exports could be threatened. High-paying finance jobs could shift from Britain to other countries in Europe.But any fair conversation about austerity must reckon with a complex reality: There are great divergences between the rhetoric of policy-making and the actual spending of money.In Britain, Mr. Osborne presented himself as a courageous guardian of the treasury, intent on making cuts to balance the books. At the same time, he ran budget deficits that were proportionately larger than those in France, where a Socialist government, supposedly intent on handing out loot unencumbered by arithmetic, was in power.In the United States, the Obama administration responded to the Great Recession with a $787 billion fiscal stimulus bill \u2014 a mixture of tax cuts and increased government spending. Its economy proceeded to recover more vigorously than Europe\u2019s, giving rise to the notion that stimulus was at work on the American side of the Atlantic, while austerity prevailed across the water.That story, however, is overly simplistic.In Washington, bickering over the size and duration of many social programs \u2014 emergency unemployment benefits, food stamps and housing supports \u2014 effectively curtailed the scope of these efforts. In Europe, a vastly more generous social safety net limited the impacts of joblessness.Any alteration to European economic policy inevitably involves Germany. The region\u2019s largest economy, it wields outsize influence over the levers of economic policy.The European Union maintains rules limiting budget deficits and public debt burdens. Countries that exceed the limits are subject to negotiations over the consequences.To Germany, those rules are immutable (unless Germany is the one asking for some slack). The German economic view, analysts say, is dominated by moralistic judgments and a grave fear of inflation. Deficits reflect weakness of will and undermine the value of money. Prosperity comes from discipline and sacrifice.German voters have expressed alarm at any possibility that their abundant savings might be used to rescue reckless borrowers on the Mediterranean. This trait has been most on display as Germany has demanded sharp cuts in government spending as a condition for successive bailouts of Greece by European authorities. But it has similarly colored German demands for strict adherence to the limits on deficit spending by Spain, Portugal and other crisis-assailed European nations. (And never mind, critics charge, that most troubled European economies landed there not because of too much public spending, but because of disastrous private borrowing \u2014 often extended by German banks.)Germany, economists say, is effectively combating a phantom: The real threat is not inflation, but the opposite \u2014 deflation, or falling prices. When prices are dropping, that means demand for goods and services is weak, and that reduces the incentive for businesses to expand and hire.Faced with such a downward spiral, the traditional economic playbook calls for government to step in and spend money, even if that entails running deficits. Construction projects, for example, put cash into the pockets of construction workers, who then spread their wages through the economy.\u201cOn the merits, Spain, Italy and France should be ganging up on the Germans and outvoting them and strong-arming them,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England, and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cFor whatever reason, they don\u2019t get there, and I genuinely don\u2019t understand it.\u201dItaly is now making a run at it.Last month, its prime minister, Matteo Renzi, accused Germany of putting European interests at risk by refusing to allow more government spending.In a series of recent interviews in Rome, top Italian officials outlined intentions to liberate Europe from austerity.\u201cIf you want to close this divide and you want to persuade your citizens that there is opportunity in the internationalization of the economy and innovation, you need to invest a lot,\u201d said the Italian minister of economic development, Carlo Calenda. \u201cThe question is whether you do it within the European rule or whether you break the European rule. What we are trying to do is to stay within the European rule.\u201dBut not forever, Mr. Calenda added. Greece confronted Germany loudly and directly as it submitted to wrenching cuts as a condition of the bailouts. Italy is mounting a quieter challenge, operating within the rules while finding favorable interpretations that allow greater spending.\u201cWe do think there is space to maneuver in order to change the European rule,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we will be in a situation where we need to act in a stronger way, especially on fiscal space, then we will take that into consideration.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How This Jobs Report Can Help Clinton, and Trump", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceBut with the election a month away, the jobs report takes on extra significance, as a piece of major economic news that might shape how people vote for president. So looking at the data through a political lens makes perfect sense.Yet the results are still soft enough that Donald J. Trump has plenty of ground for attack on the state of the economy as the Obama administration nears its end: There is that uptick in the unemployment rate, the 156,000 jobs added are no great shakes, a broader measure of unemployment remains at 9.7 percent, and the ratio of Americans working remains significantly lower than eight years ago.One reason is probably that President Obama is not on the ballot, and so debating his economic record is less relevant. But the bigger one is surely that the state of the economy isn\u2019t really the focus of this race because the economy is largely, finally, healed from the 2008 recession. Consider that the 5 percent September unemployment rate is the second lowest for a September before a presidential election in nearly five decades. Since the 1968 election, only the 2000 race featured a lower pre-election jobless rate.Much of what people frame as a debate over \u201cthe economy\u201d in the 2016 election cycle is not about the cyclical state of the economy, which was a first-order issue in 2008, 2012 and, to some degree, 2004. Rather, it is about long-simmering shifts, some of which are barely about economics at all.In other words, the evidence we see in things like the new jobs report, that unemployment is low and wages are rising \u2014 fits what people see in their own lives.But when asked about, as Gallup does, \u201cthe way things are going\u201d more broadly, the results are much more negative. It seems that when asked about how things are going over all, Americans aren\u2019t really making an observation about their personal financial situation, but more a stylized observation about whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about the state of the world. The Trump phenomenon seems to be driven by that pessimistic impulse.Because Election Day falls on the late end this year, there will be one more jobs report the Friday before the Nov. 8 voting, along with a second-quarter G.D.P. report and a Fed policy meeting. But this is the last big economic headline to take place before early voting begins most places, and the conditions that will shape voters\u2019 perception of the state of the world are pretty well baked into the economic cake by now.Yet the evidence suggests that, whether those announcements point to good news or bad, they won\u2019t matter much in shaping how people think about the world heading into the voting booth.Advertisement"}

It suggests steps like building on vacant urban land, building denser apartments around transit hubs, and making it easier for homeowners to build extra units like backyard cottages.Vacant lots in the state, most of them in San Francisco or Los Angeles, could accommodate some 225,000 homes and apartments, a report says.The math is simple: California added 544,000 households from 2009 to 2014, but only 467,000 net housing units, and that deficit is set to get worse. The state is on pace to add about a million new housing units at the current rate of construction, but by then the population will have grown by 3.6 million.All this explains why California ranks 49th of 50 (Utah is 50th) for the number of housing units per capita. And the result is that half of Californians can\u2019t afford the cost of housing in their markets.That might seem inconvenient and unfair to the volumes of young tech workers who make six-figure salaries and still can\u2019t afford their rent.

{"Headline": "U.S. Deficit Increases to $587 Billion, Ending Downward Trend", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration confirmed on Friday that a six-year run of declining annual budget deficits had halted: The shortfall for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was $587 billion, an increase over last year in dollars and as a percentage of the economy.The $587 billion deficit for fiscal year 2016 is equivalent to 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product, the measure of the overall output of the economy. The previous year\u2019s deficit was $438 billion, or 2.5 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 a reduction of three-quarters from the level amid the recession at the end of the George W. Bush administration.While the tax cuts were the immediate cause of the return to rising annual deficits, budget shortfalls long had been forecast to climb unsustainably after 2018 because of the costs of an aging population. The number of people 65 years or older is expected to increase nearly 40 percent in a decade, driving up spending for Medicare and Social Security.Mr. Obama, in his budgets this year and in past years, unsuccessfully proposed significant tax increases for the wealthiest taxpayers and some corporations to offset spending initiatives and reduce deficits. In contrast, congressional Republicans proposed mainly to cut Medicare spending, in part by offering beneficiaries taxpayer-funded vouchers to purchase private insurance, and Medicaid, with reduced block grants to states. But legislation to that end never came to a vote.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, proposes some of the same tax increases as Mr. Obama has, and more. But the new revenue is intended to pay for her spending plans, including for education, not to reduce deficits.The Obama administration\u2019s final reckoning on spending and taxes for 2016, which was jointly released by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and the budget director, Shaun Donovan, showed increases in spending for veterans benefit payments, the health programs Medicare and Medicaid, and for interest payments on the nation\u2019s debt.Military spending increased little over all, and dropped for military operations and maintenance. Spending on nutrition for the poor, formerly known as food stamps, was down 4 percent.Advertisement"}

There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer. Then I\u2019ll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates. By coin toss, it\u2019s been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.(APPLAUSE)Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment\u2019s notice? Senator Kaine?This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. I\u2019m proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so proud to be her running mate.Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. It\u2019ll be whether we can make somebody\u2019s life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer \u2014 it\u2019s going to be about results.And she said to me, you\u2019ve been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. You\u2019ve been a city councilman and mayor. You\u2019ve been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people\u2019s lives.And that\u2019s what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. I\u2019m so proud of her.And, Senator Kaine, it\u2019s an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just \u2014 I also want to say \u2014 I want to say thanks to everyone that\u2019s looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation.For the last seven-and-a-half years, we\u2019ve seen America\u2019s place in the world weakened. We\u2019ve seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being \u2014 being with us tonight.So to answer your question, I would say I \u2014 I would hope that if \u2014 if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I\u2019m going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that\u2019s to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I\u2019ve served in the Congress of the United States, where \u2014 where I\u2019ve led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I \u2014 I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that \u2014 that lifetime of experience.Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it\u2019s always been about putting others first. And that\u2019s a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, \u201coff the backs of the little guy.\u201d And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States.It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States. And I can\u2019t imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish \u201cme first\u201d style of Donald Trump.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times. He\u2019s brought an extraordinary business acumen. He\u2019s employed tens of thousands of people in this country.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)Under Secretary Clinton\u2019s leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth. She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile. She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.(CROSSTALK)Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country. Governor Pence?That\u2019s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually \u2014 he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we\u2019ve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that\u2019ll put the American worker first, and you\u2019ve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that\u2019s when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump\u2019s plan will do, then we\u2019re going to have the resources to meet our nation\u2019s needs at home and abroad, and we\u2019re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.Hillary and I have a plan that\u2019s on the table that\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can\u2019t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we\u2019ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who\u2019ve benefited as we\u2019ve come out of recession to pay more.Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\u2019s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession \u2014 the deepest recession since the 1930s.Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump \u2014 why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.Look, what \u2014 what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government. And if you think that\u2019s all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We\u2019re in the...(CROSSTALK)Those tax returns that were \u2014 that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what\u2019s called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.We have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And we\u2019ll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.Here\u2019s what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security. Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it. We\u2019re going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security. And we\u2019ll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap.(CROSSTALK)Do we ask too much of police officers in this country? And how would you specifically address the chief\u2019s concerns? Senator Kaine?I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.Here\u2019s what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it\u2019s safer for the communities and it\u2019s safer for the police.That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don\u2019t work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.So here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll focus on community policing. We will focus on \u2014 and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.I\u2019m a gun-owner. I\u2019m a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I\u2019ve got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we\u2019re going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won\u2019t have the tragedies that we did.One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn\u2019t survive the scourge of gun violence.We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It\u2019s worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that.Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It\u2019s probably \u2014 probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order.But they also \u2014 they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as \u2014 as a reason to \u2014 to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of \u2014 of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop.I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith \u2014 Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I \u2014 we \u2014 we mourn with those who mourn. We \u2014 we grieve with those who grieve. And we\u2019re saddened at the loss of life.But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where \u2014 where she used \u2014 when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there\u2019s implicit bias in everyone in the United States. I just think...The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school. And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated.But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a \u2014 they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked. The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act. We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice. But what \u2014 what \u2014 what Donald Trump and I are saying is let\u2019s not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement. We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country...And I just want to talk about the tone that\u2019s set from the top. Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He\u2019s called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don\u2019t like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn\u2019t hero because he\u2019d been captured. He said African-Americans are living in Hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen.If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can\u2019t have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about. And I just \u2014 again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.But I \u2014 Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It\u2019s probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And \u2014 and once we have accomplished all of that, which will \u2014 which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we\u2019ll deal with those that remain.But I have to tell you, I just \u2014 I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago. KAINE: These were Donald\u2019s \u2014 hold on a second, Governor.(CROSSTALK)I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you\u2019ve said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn\u2019t have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It\u2019s \u2014 she said they were irredeemable, they were not American.I mean, it\u2019s extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another \u201cism\u201d on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this \u2014 this insult-driven campaign, I mean...(LAUGHTER)Immigration. There\u2019s two plans on the table. Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform. Donald Trump believes in deportation nation. You\u2019ve got to pick your choice. Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.That\u2019s our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you\u2019re born here, but your parents don\u2019t have documents, they want to eliminate that. That\u2019s another 4.5 million people.These guys \u2014 and Donald Trump have said it \u2014 deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people. And I cannot believe...(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens. We just \u2014 we just had a conversation about law enforcement. We just had a conversation about the \u2014 the violence that\u2019s besetting our cities. The reality is that there\u2019s heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity. And we don\u2019t have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.Donald Trump has said we\u2019re going to move those people out, people who\u2019ve overstayed their visas. We\u2019re going to enforce the law of this country. We\u2019re going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that. And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we\u2019ve done all of those things, that we\u2019re going to reform the immigration system that we have...When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can\u2019t imagine how you could defend that.But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there\u2019s only one candidate who can do it, and it\u2019s Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That\u2019s seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism.And she\u2019s got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here\u2019s her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we\u2019ve got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she\u2019ll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.Second, we\u2019ve got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. That\u2019s the Hillary Clinton plan; she\u2019s got the experience to do it.Donald Trump. Donald Trump can\u2019t start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have a plan. He said, \u201cI have a secret plan,\u201d and then he said, \u201cUm, I know more than all the generals about ISIL.\u201d And then he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan.\u201d And finally he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fire all the generals.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have a plan.But he does have dangerous ideas. Here\u2019s four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCain\u2019s no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances. NATO is obsolete, and we\u2019ll only work together with Israel if they pay \u201cbig league.\u201dThird, he loves dictators. He\u2019s got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi...I\u2019d love to hear Governor Pence tell me what\u2019s so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war.We\u2019ve weakened America\u2019s place in the world. It\u2019s been a combination of factors, but mostly it\u2019s been a lack of leadership. I mean, I will give you \u2014 and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11. I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.(CROSSTALK)But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida. Our primary threat today is ISIS. And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it\u2019s overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009.But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I\u2019d give her a hug and tell her we\u2019re never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don\u2019t bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life.But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500...(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that\u2019s how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next. Alliances are critical.That\u2019s why Donald Trump\u2019s claim that he wants to \u2014 that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America \u2014 the greatest nation on Earth \u2014 just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins \u2014 look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We\u2019ve got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.There\u2019s a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it\u2019s clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don\u2019t know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.I\u2019ll tell you what offends me...So get this. On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\u2019s hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. Young men and women \u2014 young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism. Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight. It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn\u2019t support the fight against terror.(CROSSTALK)And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we\u2019re not having talks anymore. To answer your question, we just need American strength. We need to \u2014 we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm\u2019s way.But, look, this is very tough stuff. I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade. I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years. I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration...But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous. Donald Trump\u2019s idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea. Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s. He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that\u2019s who Governor Pence\u2019s running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia. And we\u2019ve done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we\u2019ve put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn\u2019t know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time. America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason. They should wonder \u2014 when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America\u2019s bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump\u2019s bottom line that he\u2019s going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do. And I know he\u2019s laughing at this, but every president...And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that \u2014 Syria is imploding. You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo. ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa. It is \u2014 ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier \u2014 I get all that \u2014 in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure. I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day...(CROSSTALK)When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I\u2019ve said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that\u2019s stating painful facts. That\u2019s not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That\u2019s an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...She\u2019s not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy. But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals. This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re not going to have the \u2014 the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power. We\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to go back to the days of peace through strength.But I have to tell you that \u2014 that all this talk about tax returns \u2014 and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up. It must have \u2014 must have...(CROSSTALK)Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff. Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process. They cannot make financial contributions. But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars. And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation. When you talk about all these \u2014 all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton \u2014 you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning \u2014 the reason...Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation. The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States. So the foundation does good work. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.But let\u2019s compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation. The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns. He\u2019s refused to do it.His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia. And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit. It\u2019s putting money into Donald Trump\u2019s pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won\u2019t share with the American public what he\u2019s doing and what those conflicts are.(LAUGHTER)You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea. I\u2019m on the Foreign Relations Committee. We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea. And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this \u2014 virtually the same package. Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that. They\u2019re starting to get worried about North Korea, too. So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.So we\u2019re working together with China, and we need to. China\u2019s another one of those relationships where it\u2019s competitive, it\u2019s also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate. Hillary understands that very well. She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d They didn\u2019t want her to say that, but she did.But she\u2019s also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take.The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China. I\u2019m not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don\u2019t believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don\u2019t raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that.When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I\u2019m not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn\u2019t feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don\u2019t feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine\u2019s sincere faith. I truly do.The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I\u2019m also very pleased at the fact we\u2019re well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you\u2019re going to be pro-life, you should \u2014 you should be pro- adoption.But what I can\u2019t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view \u2014 and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally \u2014 but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.And I cannot \u2014 I can\u2019t conscience about \u2014 about a party that supports that. Or that \u2014 I know you\u2019ve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to \u2014 wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn\u2019t use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.So let\u2019s talk about abortion and choice. Let\u2019s talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That\u2019s something we trust American women to do that.And we don\u2019t think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren\u2019t even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.I think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.(CROSSTALK)But here\u2019s \u2014 there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who\u2019s standing for the right to life. It\u2019s a principle that \u2014 Senator Kaine \u2014 and I\u2019m very gentle about this, because I really do respect you \u2014 it\u2019s a principle that you embrace.And I have appreciated the fact that you\u2019ve supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that\u2019s not Hillary Clinton\u2019s view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are \u2014 we\u2019re better for it. We can \u2014 like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...That\u2019s what we ought to be doing in public life. Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...But we do have to bring the country together. So here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state. And I served in the Senate. And I\u2019m really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton.She was on the Armed Services Committee. She was on other committees. She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon. She worked to get benefits for \u2014 TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen. And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record. I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses. And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.Because I think it\u2019s fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together. And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened America\u2019s place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it\u2019s going to take leadership to do it.The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback.And Donald Trump\u2019s entire career has been about building. It\u2019s been about \u2014 it\u2019s going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and \u2014 when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we\u2019re going to have a stronger America.When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. They\u2019re going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we\u2019ll have the kind of unity that\u2019s been missing for way too long.This concludes the vice presidential debate. My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching. Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.From Farmville, Virginia, I\u2019m Elaine Quijano of CBS News.

{"Headline": "I Crossed the World", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byWhen imagining a journey around planet Earth, I never pictured the part where I crossed the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in a Toyota Camry with a pink Lyft mustache on the dashboard. Yet that was how I embarked on an accidental circumnavigation of the globe one recent sunny morning, Annie Lennox singing \u201cI travel the world and the seven seas\u201d on the car stereo as the Camry hurtled through the E-ZPass lane.Because I was flying west out of Newark Liberty International Airport and arriving back at Kennedy Airport two weeks later, my trip had begun, and would end, rather prosaically, like my daily commute, on my doorstep in Brooklyn. At least that was how the experienced travelers of the Circumnavigators Club explained it to me. I had sought their counsel a week before as I tried to understand what, if anything, this inadvertent journey meant to me.The feat I was undertaking had once required a wealthy royal patron and a willingness to face the prospect of an early death. A few centuries later, I was doing it to solve a scheduling problem: a vacation with my wife, Rachel, in Japan overlapped with a family gathering in southern Germany. To avoid disappointing anyone, I decided to fly onward from Japan to Munich and then back home.I handled this rather substantial detour across Asia, Europe and the Atlantic Ocean on the website Kayak with a few clicks on my laptop track pad. The additional cost was just $600, less than what I\u2019ve paid for a lot of domestic flights. And the fact that I was about to circle the planet did not even occur to me until the following morning at the office, when I was complaining to a colleague about the inconvenience and multistage jet lag of the trip and she asked if I\u2019d bought a round-the-world ticket. Then it hit me.Before long, my wife and I were sitting in a Tokyo owl cafe, a moon-faced barn owl named Whitebait perched on my shoulder. In Kyoto we visited otherworldly mossy temples and calming rock gardens. In Munich I drank Augustiner beer and watched the inner-city river surfers slice back and forth in the pounding current of the Eisbach. And in Konstanz my grandmother, mother and I would find the gabled, green-shuttered apartment house where my great-great-grandmother once lived, just a few blocks from the Swiss border.But the longitudes of the world I had never traveled across, east of Kunduz, Afghanistan, and west of Bangkok, I would experience tucked inside the fuselage of a Lufthansa jet. The only suffering would be endured by Leonardo DiCaprio in \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d playing on the tiny screen embedded in the headrest of the seat in front of me.I did not brave the crush of people in Mumbai nor ride the trans-Siberian Railway as I had dreamed of doing since I was a child reading about the freshwater seals of Lake Baikal in an old National Geographic. The clouds and snatches of land I could see through the tiny window of the 747 were indistinguishable from other flights. What significance, if any, would this loop I was making have in an age of inexpensive air travel?To find answers I sought out the experts of the Circumnavigators Club. I knew from my research that Harry Houdini and Gen. Douglas MacArthur had been members and that William Jennings Bryan gave the club its treasured whale-tooth gavel, still in use by the president today. The composer John Philip Sousa had also been a member and even wrote a march in honor of the club.The certified circumnavigators gathered in May at the Penn Club in Midtown Manhattan. Straightaway I found myself talking to Charles Merkel of St. Louis, a fifth-generation piano tuner whose first around-the-world journey was in 1971. He worked for a year after graduation and managed to save $3,500 for his trip. When he returned to New York a year and a half later, he had just $17 in his pocket and had to borrow $80 from the Travelers Aid Society to make it home. He confided to me that he had never paid the money back.The attendees were bursting with enthusiasm, and rather than formally ending one interview with a handshake and introducing myself to someone to start the next, I would be carried from one person\u2019s reminiscence straight into the story of another member. In mid-discussion with Mr. Merkel, his friend Steve Fuller began telling me that he had run a marathon on every continent \u201cincluding Antarctica.\u201dWhen Mr. Fuller took a trip to run a marathon in Australia in October 2001, it was his \u201cfinal continent but first circumnavigation.\u201d He was in the midst of trying to visit every country in the world. He had thus far made a pretty good showing with a tally of 175, considering that the United Nations counts a mere 193 members.This urge to count, to tick off boxes and keep track, seemed part of what drove the members of the Circumnavigators Club: like philatelists or numismatists adding to their collections, but instead of stamps or coins, their quarry consisted of canceled visas and ticket stubs, digital photographs on camelback or yellowed Polaroids of themselves standing in the prows of ships.When she was working in the United States Embassy in Oslo in the early 1980s, she heard about the club from the ambassador, who was a member. She excitedly told him that she had been around the world already as a schoolgirl. Her father was the naval attach\u00e9 in South Vietnam in 1960, and she spent seventh and eighth grade there. She had sailed through the Suez Canal and across the Indian Ocean. Could she join?\u201cHe said, \u2018That\u2019s nice, Ellen, but we don\u2019t take girls,\u2019 \u201d she recalled, her tone more bemused than rueful. \u201cA year or so later he came back and said, \u2018Guess what? We are going to take girls.\u2019 \u201d He sponsored her for membership, and before long they had talked her into cofounding the Washington, D.C., chapter.I began to notice that more than just excitement, the rush to tell me stories that I would then scribble into my little OfficeMax pocket notebook was a form of one-upmanship. Brad Vogel was recounting his visit to Kathmandu as the Nepalese monarchy lost its grip on power in late 2007, when an older member named George Sanborn chimed in, announcing, \u201cI was there in 1970.\u201d\u201cWe always have to trump each other a little,\u201d Mr. Vogel said. \u201cLike, I\u2019ve been by ship or vehicle instead of flying over it.\u201dThe less glamorous, the rougher, the slower a journey was, the prouder the traveler. Buses packed with locals and stacked with luggage trumped rental cars; boats were superior to airplanes for crossing oceans; moving by foot and by bicycle occupied a special place in the hierarchy.Amid this fellowship of extreme travel I was more than a little ashamed of my simple airline itinerary through three of the four largest and most developed economies. My fraudulent feeling was accentuated by the fact that I had smuggled an even dirtier secret into the club.My internet research told me that my trip might not even count as a circumnavigation. Guinness World Records required the total distance of one\u2019s journey to exceed the circumference of the earth for certification, which mine would not because my flights were taking shortcuts over the narrow northern reaches of the globe.I feared that I wasn\u2019t worthy of being rapped on the knuckles with the whale-tooth gavel, much less lifting it as a member of the club. Thus it was with great relief that, as I stood in the buffet line, half a lox and cream cheese bagel on my plate and half a corned beef sandwich in hand, Howard Matson, a former president of the group, explained to me how the arctic explorer Rear Adm. Robert Peary had accomplished his circumnavigation simply by walking in a small circle around the North Pole.\u201cAre you giving him credit?\u201d I asked.\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. I told him about Guinness\u2019s rather stringent requirements. He shook his head. \u201cAdmiral Peary crossed every meridian,\u201d he said judiciously. \u201cThose are our rules.\u201dI could join the club but I still wasn\u2019t sure what the appeal of circumnavigating the globe was \u2014 of ticking this arbitrary box \u2014 versus a lifetime of interesting trips to intriguing or unusual destinations. I asked a British member named Peter Mosse, who started his trip in 1966 on a Greyhound deal for foreign travelers, $99 for 99 days unlimited travel in the United States and Canada.\u201cIt\u2019s not just to prove the flat-earth society wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the idea that you can get back to where you started from without turning around.\u201dI can remember the awe in which I held Sir Francis Drake, one of Europe\u2019s first circumnavigators and a kind of legally sanctioned pirate on behalf of England. I wrote a report about him in my shaky elementary school handwriting and illustrated it in colored pencil (he basically looked like Shakespeare with a little more hair and a frillier collar). I didn\u2019t know at the time about Drake\u2019s involvement in the slave trade. And I certainly didn\u2019t know that the first person to successfully make it around the world may have been an escaped slave.That expedition started out being led by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan from 1519 to 1522, but Magellan died on the way and his survivors are the first Europeans documented to have completed a circumnavigation. The first to accomplish the feat, though, might have been Enrique of Malacca, Magellan\u2019s slave. According to his will, Magellan had promised to free him at the end of the voyage. After the expedition leader died, the survivors decided not to honor his promise. So when he saw his opportunity, Enrique escaped, ditching the expedition a mere 1,000 miles from his likely birthplace in the Malay Peninsula. No one can say for certain whether he made it home. I\u2019m inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt even if the record books are not as kind.In terms of sheer intrepidness, it\u2019s hard to top the people who didn\u2019t know for certain that the earth was round or whether they could get around Cape Horn or the Straits of Magellan without sinking. From sea to air, many of the pioneers died pursuing their goals, including Amelia Earhart when her plane disappeared in 1937 as she tried to become the first woman to fly around the world. Once the feat itself was manageable, every mode of transport seemed to require a first: helicopter, submarine, amphibious jeep, solar boat as well as solar airplane.On my trip I took regular combustion-engine planes and several ferries, the fabled Shinkansen bullet trains of Japan (my Snapchat clocked it going 151.1 miles per hour at one point) and the speed-unlimited autobahn (where I pushed the rental car over 100 m.p.h. without my mother noticing). I took a streetcar through Munich\u2019s historic old town and even rode the limping, filthy A train from J.F.K.In Japan, we watched from a nearby mountaintop as snow-capped Mount Fuji coyly emerged from misty clouds, the sun a smear of white behind it. We saw a traditional wedding at the Meiji shrine, the bride and groom walking under a giant red umbrella. We had midnight ramen and an even later karaoke singalong.\u201cWe could probably learn to love a robot toy,\u201d Rachel observed, as we passed an animatronic Dalmatian with blinking yellow eyes and wheels for feet in the vast Bic Camera megastore.The brilliant chef Kotaro Hayashi cooked us one of the best meals of our lives at his namesake izakaya in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya district, from the classic sashimi to a rich Ib\u00e9rico ham marinated in miso to a simple but perfect bowl of udon noodles with lots of ginger at the end. Somehow he made us feel as if it was his privilege to host us even more than it was our privilege to eat there.Our guide in Osaka, Yuki Fujisawa of the Inside Osaka tour company, steered us to the tastiest octopus balls and the safest chicken sashimi. He told us about the Japanese tradition of eating KFC at Christmas and how a mini-series about a Japanese whiskey pioneer who studied distilling in Scotland had led to a surge of interest in local whiskey that resulted in a shortage of older vintages. And he took us to Osaka\u2019s neon-lit supermarkets, part Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s and part \u201970s Vegas casino, to show us the wagyu certificates in the meat aisle, describing each individual cow and stamped with an inky noseprint.It was gray and drizzling when I left our Airbnb in Kyoto\u2019s historic Gion district. The night before, I had seen three traditional geisha disappearing down an alleyway at the end of their shift. Now Rachel was still sleeping and the streets were empty. I was flying on to Germany by myself, going from somewhere totally foreign to a place that was completely familiar.I have been visiting Munich for more than two decades now. My mother was born there, and this birthday trip was mainly an excuse to bring my grandmother back to see her infirm brother. Hospital rooms and family dinners replaced museums and temples, schnitzel subbed for sushi.When I wasn\u2019t helping my grandmother over uneven cobblestones or going with my father to fetch the rental car, I puzzled over how to construct a narrative around these two tenuously connected halves of my journey. A friend joked that if I went to Italy I could call it my World War II Axis Powers circumnavigation.There were other obvious comparisons. Both Japan and Germany were clean and organized (though Japan was cleaner and more organized), had great train systems and made a lot of cars. These similarities were superficial and beside the point, arbitrary attempts to impose a structure onto a journey that was just an accident.I put off the question to enjoy my time with my grandmother. We found the house where she grew up in the tiny village of Markelfingen and the bakery across the street, Cafe Diener, where she worked as a girl. She recalled the horse that stuck its head through the window every morning, more or less demanding sugar cubes. \u201cA black horse, beautiful,\u201d she recalled, \u201cmean like hell.\u201dWe saw the St. Laurentius Church she attended in her childhood, built in 1462, 30 years before Columbus sailed to America and 60 before Magellan\u2019s stragglers finished their circumnavigation. \u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty,\u201d she asked, her voice echoing off the whitewashed walls, with frescoes of Jesus, Mary and the Apostles from the 17th century, \u201cfor a little town?\u201d We met cousins I never knew existed whose eyes teared up at the sight of this little white-haired woman, still cracking jokes and laughing her way through her 90s.On the drive back to Munich with my family, through green Bavarian hills, the day before my flight back to New York, \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads\u201d started playing on the radio. It wasn\u2019t such a surprise; the John Denver hit is an Oktoberfest standby, shouted with inebriated fervor and heavy German accents in the beer tents every year. But it always brought back to me trips with these same people to my summer camp in West Virginia, the melancholy bridge (\u201cdriving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday\u201d) evoking the mix of homesickness and excitement that traveling gave me.In German, homesickness and wanderlust are twinned words \u2014 heimweh, aching for home, and fernweh, aching to be away. In a sense there are two kinds of trips: leaving home and coming home. Circumnavigation is the only voyage that is both at the same time. When I arrived back on my Brooklyn stoop the next day I had circled the globe without turning around, gone away and come back, all at once. It felt like a lot more than ticking a box.Nicholas Kulish is an investigative reporter for The New York Times and the author of a novel, \u201cLast One In.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q. and A. With Eric Rosengren: The Danger of Low Unemployment", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byMonetary PolicyEric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, was one of the strongest proponents of the Fed\u2019s post-crisis economic stimulus campaign. Indeed, he was one of the few officials to vote for even stronger action.Now he once again finds himself in the minority, but this time it is because he wants the Fed to increase its benchmark interest rate.Mr. Rosengren\u2019s concern: We may not have enough unemployment.If that seems like an odd thing to worry about, read on. He\u2019ll explain.We spoke on the sidelines of a Boston Fed conference devoted to the many economic puzzles confronting policy makers. I began with the most immediate: Is the economy strong enough for the Fed to resume hiking interest rates?The problem is the dynamics of how firms and individuals start thinking about the tightening process. Those dynamics make it very hard to calibrate the monetary policy process. People understand tightening. But convincing them of how much you\u2019re going to tighten and that you\u2019re going to hit it exactly right \u2014 particularly given that you haven\u2019t hit it exactly right in the past, it\u2019s pretty tough to convince people of that. Not surprisingly, they start worrying about: \u201cWell, they\u2019re starting to tighten, they may tighten too much. What do I do? I start pulling in in terms of my own spending.\u201d Firms start pulling in, saying, \u201cWe want to be prepared in case they don\u2019t get this quite right.\u201d Those kinds of actions \u2014 which are very hard to predict, and individually everyone behaves a little differently \u2014 in aggregate, cause a problem where we sometimes slow down the economy more than we intend.So you don\u2019t see instances where we go from 4.2 percent to 4.7 or 5 percent and level off. What you actually see is when we start tightening we end up with a recession.I think also the inability of so many central banks to hit their 2 percent inflation target has caused some people to say, \u201cI want to actually see evidence that you can hit 2 percent, and since we\u2019ve just seen the consequences of hitting the zero lower bound, I want to take out some insurance against hitting the zero lower bound more quickly.\u201d I think both concerns are credible. My concern with those arguments would be that the very scenario that causes the next recession might be that we overshoot.We had an instance with Brexit where a vote went very differently than people anticipated. It\u2019s a little bit different than what we\u2019re experiencing now. People are already voting now, and so far it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re going to get an outcome dramatically different than what people are expecting. And so I\u2019m not expecting it to have a big impact on the overall economy. I could be wrong, and if conditions change then we\u2019ll have to factor that into our model.Now that argument also holds in the other direction. Right now the market has a pretty high probability for December. And the difference is only six weeks. No econometric model would say that time span would make that much of a difference.I don\u2019t think the fact that we\u2019re actually having an election \u2014 if that election were to change the way we\u2019re modeling the economy or thinking about the progress of the economy, that\u2019s something that should play a role. If we don\u2019t think the election is going to materially impact our forecast going forward, then it shouldn\u2019t play a large role. We should be doing it on the economic fundamentals. Now, some people may argue that the risk around that election is sufficient that it will affect economic fundamentals and it should be taken into account. We\u2019ll have to see as we get closer whether that seems like a likely outcome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Safe for Now, Canadian Dairy Farmers Fret Over E.U. Trade Deal", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byTHAMES CENTRE, Ontario \u2014 On both sides of the Atlantic, many of the people who are most upset about the new free trade deal between Canada and the European Union are dairy farmers. But they have opposite worries.The way the country\u2019s \u201csupply management\u201d system works now, Canadian dairy farms are almost guaranteed to prosper. Milk production is controlled by quotas, marketing boards keep prices high and stable, and import duties of up to 300 percent largely shut out competition from abroad.\u201cIt affords us a good income,\u201d said Rhonda Thompson, whose husband, George, comes from a family that has been dairy farming on its homestead in this rural Ontario municipality since 1837. \u201cIs there something wrong with that?\u201dThe Canadian dairy farmers have organized occasional protests against the trade deal, including parades of tractors and cows on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. But their opposition has been fairly muted, in part because the government has promised to compensate them if the deal hurts their business.Before the federal election last fall, the Conservative former government of Stephen Harper dangled a figure of 4.3 billion Canadian dollars, or $3.3 billion, for dairy farmers and others who enjoy special market protection, to cover both the agreement with Europe and the larger proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. The new Liberal government of Justin Trudeau has not committed to a specific figure, but it has backed the concept of subsidies, and may not have much political leeway to move too far from the original amount.At Caddedale Holsteins in Thames Centre, in a rolling stretch of southern Ontario countryside, Steve Caddey said he and other dairy farmers were not willing to see supply management abandoned.\u201cIt\u2019s the best system in the world, and it\u2019s definitely worth defending,\u201d Mr. Caddey said over the steady thrum of a mixer preparing feed for his 40 cows. \u201cIt really keeps the rural economy going.\u201dTo its critics, supply management \u2014 which is also used to control Canadian poultry and egg production \u2014 is a legalized price-fixing cartel that inflates Canadians\u2019 grocery bills and hinders exports for the benefit of an elite group of farmers.\u201cIt\u2019s not the best system for consumers; it\u2019s not the best system for the 92 percent of farmers who are not supply managed,\u201d said Martha Hall Findlay, a former Liberal member of Parliament and the chief executive of the Canada West Foundation, a policy research group in Calgary, Alberta.While supply management has come under criticism almost from its start in the 1970s, few politicians have dared to challenge it while in office, partly because of a widespread belief that dairy farmers can easily rally public support. All of Canada\u2019s previous trade agreements in recent decades have staunchly defended the system.But in a break from mainstream Canadian political tradition, Maxime Bernier, a Conservative lawmaker from a mainly rural part of Quebec, has been campaigning for the leadership of his party on a promise to scrap supply management.Under the system, only farmers who own a dairy quota \u2014 in effect, a license \u2014 can legally produce milk for sale. Dairy marketing boards set limits on production volume, and they sell the milk on the farmers\u2019 behalf at prices that the boards are allowed to fix, based on the farmers\u2019 average costs and with a markup.That means the average dairy farm operates at a profit margin of almost 23 percent, compared with 6.4 percent for beef farms and cattle ranches, according to Conference Board estimates.The system has placed Canada\u2019s dairy farmers among the haves in the global economy. The board estimates that the average dairy farmer has a net worth of about two million Canadian dollars, one-third more than the average for all types of farms. And with dairy quotas valued at about 30,000 Canadian dollars per cow, a farmer with a herd of 80 could expect to assemble a nest egg of 2.4 million Canadian dollars by selling the milk production rights at retirement.Many of the dairy farms in Thames Centre remain comparatively small, and are often still in the hands of families who settled the land 180 years ago. At Caddedale, Mr. Caddey, 51, is the third generation of his family to run the dairy operation at that site.The stable prices made possible by the supply management system make it easier for him to invest in new equipment, Mr. Caddey said, and most farmers in the area spend their investment capital at businesses in nearby towns and villages.Without supply management, Mr. Caddey said, smaller family dairy farms could not compete, and would be swallowed up by large corporate operations disconnected from the community.That consolidation already seems to be happening. Ms. Hall Findlay, one of Canada\u2019s most prominent critics of supply management, said that by her count there were 12,000 dairy farms in Canada, down from 145,000 when the system started. Indeed, a sprawling commercial dairy farm with several hundred cows lies just northwest of Mr. Caddey\u2019s farm.The Thompson family\u2019s tidy, well-kept Cavanaleck Farms is also nearby. Inside its long, low barn, George Thompson said he had noticed a different kind of consolidation.The number of companies buying the farm\u2019s milk has shrunk to a handful, he said, and none are local. He does not even know which companies own the two suburban Toronto dairies where his farm\u2019s milk is now trucked.Without supply management, Mr. Thompson warned, the large dairies and milk processors would control milk prices, and they would cut what they pay farmers, keep charging consumers high retail prices and pocket the difference.\u201cSupply management has been good for the Canadian dairy farmer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kept us on an equal footing with the processor.\u201dFor the moment, the system remains largely intact, and any direct harm from the new trade deal may not be great. Mr. Caddey said he thought that small cheesemakers in Canada might be hurt by new competition from Europe, but that dairy farmers would not see large losses and his farm would probably receive no more than $10,000 in compensation from the government.Still, in the long run, he said, pressure at trade negotiations will probably doom supply management.\u201cEventually, it will have to come to an end somehow, just for the reason that there\u2019s so much pressure from the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found ways to deal with changes in the past \u2014 that\u2019s part of doing business. We\u2019ll tread the rough waters and come out the other side on the smooth waters.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Toxic Masculinity", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSTATESBORO, Ga. \u2014 Growing up in a factory family in small-town Indiana, I led an uncertain life with only a few constants: fear of losing it all, frustration with a world out of our control and the ever-present need to \u201cbe a man,\u201d a phrase that always carried with it an air of responsibility and torment. To be a man was to maintain the appearance of toughness, to never let on that you were weak or in pain.It was a command I heard repeatedly at home and around town, handed down by my stepfather and role models. My stepdad was fond of saying, \u201cBoys don\u2019t cry \u2014 crying\u2019s for women.\u201d One of my high school football coaches gave injured players this choice: \u201cYou a football player or are you a little girl?\u201dDonald J. Trump, especially the Donald J. Trump we heard last week on tape, is nothing new to me. His macho-isms, his penchant for dividing the world into losers and winners, his lack of empathy for anyone but himself \u2014 it all reminds me of home, and the sense I had, even as a boy, of a system of privilege that has ailed this country since its beginnings, but now seems to be, and sees itself, fading away.Taking refuge in traditional masculinity is a coping mechanism that works only so much as it deadens a man and his emotions. In its most pure state, masculinity is a hardening shell meant to protect men from the disappointments and travails of life, a self-delusion that preserves them from feeling overwhelmed by the odds against them.Mr. Trump was not lying in this week\u2019s presidential debate when he called his offensive conversation \u201clocker room talk.\u201d I heard similar chatter among my teammates as they laced up their cleats and donned their pads for a big game. Young men brag about sexual conquests, demean those who have denied them and dehumanize their opponents, real and imagined. Fear precipitates this chatter \u2014 a fear of pain, a fear of mortality, a fear of rejection and, most of all, a fear of inadequacy.They\u2019re the fears of a child, and most men outgrow them. But for various reasons, not all do. Their masculinity, already a coping mechanism, becomes toxic.I\u2019ve heard men attack the character of women in the same tone that an uncle of mine once used to call for the nuclear annihilation of the entire Middle East and the murder of every last Arab man, woman and child. I\u2019ve heard men utter un-American things, things that directly contradict our country\u2019s highest ideals, and then excuse it all with one of Mr. Trump\u2019s pet phrases: \u201cWe live in the real world.\u201dBut the real world \u2014 complicated foreign policy questions, confusing social change, economic dislocation \u2014 is precisely what toxic masculinity is trying to avoid. It\u2019s bigger than any one person, which makes it a threat to men who cling to the belief that they alone control their fate.Though such masculinity might temporarily shelter men from the pressures of their daily lives, inevitably it robs them of their lives: Disturbing trends show that men, especially the white men who make up a majority of Mr. Trump\u2019s base, are suffering greatly for their posturing.From 2009 to 2014, while mortality rates fell for all other Americans ranging from ages 22 to 56, they rose for middle-aged whites, with most of the fatalities coming from what experts are calling \u201cdespair deaths,\u201d including drug overdoses, alcohol-related liver disease and suicide, all consequences of unhealthy coping mechanisms. More and more men are also suffering and dying from heart disease, cancer and diabetes, the disease that claimed my father, a man who was so proud and so concerned with upholding his masculinity that he refused to see a doctor for decades, until it was too late.That\u2019s why it\u2019s no surprise to see Mr. Trump\u2019s core supporters not only cling to him after the tape came out, but even tighten their grip, doubling down with misogynistic T-shirts and chants at rallies. He\u2019s the furthest thing from the working-class men of my childhood, but whatever his motives for demeaning women, these supporters hear in him an echo of their own desperation.I can still remember, as a child, listening to the same man who\u2019d told me to leave the crying to the girls as he sobbed alone in his room. My stepfather was a truck driver, and after he\u2019d left his rig and clocked out of his shift, he would often lock himself in his bedroom. I could hear him, though, and I could hear when my mother, a woman he\u2019d derided and belittled as being weak, came to him and did the heavy lifting for them both.Jared Yates Sexton is an assistant professor of creative writing at Georgia Southern University.Advertisement"}

In the lead-up to the first auction there focused specifically on contemporary art from Africa, planned for May, Ms. O\u2019Leary is spending as much time as possible in Lagos; in Accra, Ghana; and in Johannesburg and Cape Town, investigating the art scenes and how the work there might be seen in the art capitals of London, New York and Paris. (Generally, contemporary African art is defined as work created from the 1970s until now.)\u201cThere are many layers to the art world, and we all have our roles to play, and in my role at Sotheby\u2019s, I focus on the very top end of the market,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Leary said. \u201cBut I cannot do what I do in London, addressing a global audience, without being able to point to a lively local market on the ground in Africa, or to the acquisitions of major public institutions.\u201dWhile their goals and titles differ, the three professionals rely on overlapping skills to bring art and its audience together: They need an eye for groundbreaking work, a deep knowledge of art history and the resolve to trust their instincts, push boundaries and defend their decisions.\u201cWhen I was starting out over 10 years ago, a lot of these artists were dismissed,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Leary said. \u201cSotheby\u2019s and Bonhams and Christie\u2019s would have not even valued these works, because they weren\u2019t sellable.\u201d\u201cYou can buy major works by major contemporary African artists for only five figures, and that\u2019s not right,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case with any other part of the world. I think I could list on my hand the number of artists who fetch six figures at auction. That\u2019s a huge oversight. We hope to address that problem.\u201dMs. Silva, in a Skype interview, said her role was \u201cto engage with the artists, to support their artistic and curatorial practices, to empower them, if possible, and allow them to build their networks, to go out there and do.\u201dMs. Silva said, \u201cTwenty, 25 years ago, curators of contemporary art might have been completely and totally scared of going to \u2018the Dark Continent.\u2019\u201d\u201cNow it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, Bisi, I want to go to Lagos, I want to go to Ghana,\u2019 or they\u2019ve already been there,\u201d she said. She meets with artists who have labored in isolation for years and masters whose work she helps document and archive. She sees her role as a curator as linking the artist, the work and the public.Education takes up a lot more time for Ms. O\u2019Leary than it might if she worked in another market. She\u2019s organizing visits to exhibitions as well as talks with artists and other curators, so that collectors can learn about, understand and appreciate the field more fully.While works of African contemporary artists sold to a private buyer often sit in a house, works purchased as museum acquisitions help write a national narrative about art, a duty Mr. Dumouchelle doesn\u2019t take lightly.\u201cThere\u2019s an extent to which bringing an object into a museum is validating it, and saying: \u2018This has merit. This is something that should be thought about and considered, in its own time and decades and possibly centuries afterward,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of responsibility inherent in that. It\u2019s a deliberative process of trying to think about the artists that will stand up over time and the stories that are relevant today but are also important and relevant to talk about in the generations to follow.\u201d\u201cIt was really important for me because it allowed me to tell our visitors that African art is alive and receptive to ideas from around the world,\u201d he said, \u201cto tell the story that Africa is not sealed off from time, separate from the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

An expansion of the reviews could affect attempts by Chinese and other foreign companies to make a wide range of purchases and investments in the United States, including Hollywood studios and film production companies, venture capital funds and makers of renewable energy equipment.The letter acknowledged that Mr. Pittenger and other lawmakers had asked the office to examine whether the efforts by the committee, known as Cfius, \u201chave kept pace with the growing scope of foreign acquisitions in important economic sectors in the United States.\u201dThe study by the G.A.O. will not necessarily change government policy.

{"Headline": "Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: Nigeria\u2019s Failed Promises", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLAGOS, Nigeria \u2014 I was 7 years old the first time I recognized political fear. My parents and their friends were talking about the government, in our living room, in our relatively big house, set on relatively wide grounds at a southeastern Nigerian university, with doors shut and no strangers present. Yet they spoke in whispers. So ingrained was their apprehension that they whispered even when they did not need to. It was 1984 and Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari was the military head of state.Governmental controls had mangled the economy. Many imported goods were banned, scarcity was rife, black markets thrived, businesses were failing and soldiers stalked markets to enforce government-determined prices. My mother came home with precious cartons of subsidized milk and soap, which were sold in rationed quantities. Soldiers flogged people on the streets for \u201cindiscipline\u201d \u2014 such as littering or not standing in queues at the bus stop. On television, the head of state, stick-straight and authoritative, seemed remote, impassive on his throne amid the fear and uncertainty.And yet when, 30 years later, in 2015, Mr. Buhari was elected as a democratic president, I welcomed it. Because for the first time, Nigerians had voted out an incumbent in an election that was largely free and fair. Because Mr. Buhari had sold himself as a near-ascetic reformer, as a man so personally aboveboard that he would wipe out Nigeria\u2019s decades-long corruption. He represented a form of hope.Nigeria is difficult to govern. It is Africa\u2019s most populous country, with regional complexities, a scarred history and a patronage-based political culture. Still, Mr. Buhari ascended to the presidency with a rare advantage \u2014 not only did he have the good will of a majority of Nigerians, he elicited a peculiar mix of fear and respect. For the first weeks of his presidency, it was said that civil servants who were often absent from work suddenly appeared every day, on time, and that police officers and customs officials stopped demanding bribes.He had an opportunity to make real reforms early on, to boldly reshape Nigeria\u2019s path. He wasted it.Perhaps the first clue was the unusually long time it took him to appoint his ministers. After an ostensible search for the very best, he presented many recycled figures with whom Nigerians were disenchanted. But the real test of his presidency came with the continued fall in oil prices, which had begun the year before his inauguration.Nigeria\u2019s economy is unwholesomely dependent on oil, and while the plunge in prices was bound to be catastrophic, Mr. Buhari\u2019s actions made it even more so.He adopted a policy of \u201cdefending\u201d the naira, Nigeria\u2019s currency. The official exchange rate was kept artificially low. On the black market, the exchange rate ballooned. Prices for everything rose: rice, bread, cooking oil. Fruit sellers and car sellers blamed \u201cthe price of dollars.\u201d Complaints of hardship cut across class. Some businesses fired employees; others folded.The government decided who would have access to the central bank\u2019s now-reduced foreign currency reserves, and drew up an arbitrary list of worthy and unworthy goods \u2014 importers of toothpicks cannot, for example, but importers of oil can. Predictably, this policy spawned corruption: The exclusive few who were able to buy dollars at official rates could sell them on the black market and earn large, riskless profits \u2014 transactions that contribute nothing to the economy.Mr. Buhari has spoken of his \u201cgood reasons\u201d for ignoring the many economists who warned about the danger of his policies. He believes, rightly, that Nigeria needs to produce more of what it consumes, and he wants to spur local production. But local production cannot be willed into existence if the supporting infrastructure is absent, and banning goods has historically led not to local production but to a thriving shadow market. His intentions, good as they well might be, are rooted in an outdated economic model and an infantile view of Nigerians. For him, it seems, patriotism is not a voluntary and flexible thing, with room for dissent, but a martial enterprise: to obey without questioning. Nationalism is not negotiated, but enforced.The president seems comfortable with conditions that make an economy uncomfortable \u2014 uncertainty and disillusion. But the economy is not the only reason for Nigerians\u2019 declining hope.A few months ago, a young woman, Chidera, came to work as a nanny in my Lagos home. A week into her job, I found her in tears in her room. She needed to go back to her ancestral home in the southeast, she said, because Fulani herdsmen had just murdered her grandfather on his farm. She showed me a gruesome cellphone photo of his corpse, desecrated by bullets, an old man crumpled on the farm he owned.Chidera\u2019s grandfather is only one of the hundreds of people who have been murdered by Fulani herdsmen \u2014 cattle herders from northern Nigeria who, until recently, were benign figures in the southern imagination, walking across the country with their grazing cattle.Since Mr. Buhari came to power, villages in the middle-belt and southern regions have been raided, the inhabitants killed, their farmlands sacked. Those attacked believe the Fulani herdsmen want to forcibly take over their lands for cattle grazing.It would be unfair to blame Mr. Buhari for these killings, which are in part a result of complex interactions between climate change and land use. But leadership is as much about perception as it is about action, and Mr. Buhari has appeared disengaged. It took him months, and much criticism from civil society, to finally issue a statement \u201ccondemning\u201d the killings. His aloofness feels, at worst, like a tacit enabling of murder and, at best, an absence of sensitive leadership.Most important, his behavior suggests he is tone-deaf to the widely held belief among southern Nigerians that he promotes a northern Sunni Muslim agenda. He was no less opaque when the Nigerian Army murdered hundreds of members of a Shiite Muslim group in December, burying them in hastily dug graves. Or when soldiers killed members of the small secessionist pro-Biafran movement who were protesting the arrest of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu, a little-known figure whose continued incarceration has elevated him to a minor martyr.There is an ad hoc air to the government that does not inspire that vital ingredient for a stable economy: confidence. There is, at all levels of government, a relentless blaming of previous administrations and a refusal to acknowledge mistakes. And there are eerie signs of the past\u2019s repeating itself \u2014 Mr. Buhari\u2019s tone and demeanor are reminiscent of 1984, and his military-era War Against Indiscipline program is being reintroduced.There are no easy answers to Nigeria\u2019s malaise, but the government\u2019s intervention could be more salutary \u2014 by prioritizing infrastructure, creating a business-friendly environment and communicating to a populace mired in disappointment.In a country enamored of dark humor, a common greeting among the middle class now is \u201cHappy recession!\u201dChimamanda Ngozi Adichie is the author, most recently, of the novel \u201cAmericanah.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the king\u2019s heir apparent, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, seen by many as a jet-setting playboy, is not held in the same regard as his father.King Bhumibol spent most of his final years in a hospital, ensconced in a special suite. His portrait hung in almost every shop, and as his health declined, billboards proclaimed \u201cLong Live the King,\u201d signaling widespread anxiety about a future without him. In response, he openly fretted about the people feeling so insecure.King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand around 1960. An accidental monarch who was not born in the direct line of succession, he took the throne in 1946 at the age of 18 and became the personification of Thai nationhood.Thais came to see this Buddhist king as a father figure wholly dedicated to their welfare, and as the embodiment of stability in a country where political leadership rose and fell through decades of military coups.King Bhumibol (pronounced poo-me-pon) was an accidental monarch, thrust onto the throne at 18 by the violent death of his older brother in 1946. He fully embraced the role of national patriarch, upholding Thailand\u2019s traditions of hierarchy, deference and loyalty.Western stereotypes of his country irked him. He disdained the Broadway musical \u201cThe King and I,\u201d with its roots in his grandfather\u2019s court. And, like a stern father, he was quick to chastise his fellow Thais when he saw the need.If he was a people\u2019s king, Bhumibol was a quiet and somewhat aloof one. He was a man of sober, serious mien, often isolated in his palaces, protected by the most stringent of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws, which effectively prevent almost any public discussion of the royal family.But he had a worldly bent. Born in Cambridge, Mass., where his father was a student at Harvard, he was educated in Switzerland, spoke impeccable English and French, composed music, played jazz on the clarinet and saxophone, wrote, painted, took up photography and spent hours in a greenhouse at his Chitrlada Palace in Bangkok.Once he had returned from Europe, however, he stayed put. Never interested in a jet-set life, he stopped traveling abroad, saying there was too much to do at home. He was content to trudge through croplands in distant provinces in an open-neck shirt and sport coat, tending to the many development projects he encouraged and oversaw: milk-pasteurizing plants, dams that watered rice fields, factories that recycled sugar-cane stalks and water hyacinths into fuel, and countless others.In a political crisis, Thais admired him for his shrewd sense of when to intervene \u2014 sometimes with only a gesture \u2014 to defuse it, even though he had only a limited constitutional role and no direct political power.\u201cWe are fighting in our own house,\u201d he scolded two warring politicians he had summoned to sit abjectly at his feet in 1992. \u201cIt is useless to live on burned ruins.\u201dEleven years earlier, he had aborted a coup by simply inviting the besieged prime minister, Prem Tinsulanonda, to stay at a royal palace with the king and queen.Thailand was transformed during his reign, moving from a mostly agricultural economy to a modern one of industry and commerce and a growing middle class. He presided over an expansion of democratic processes, though it was halting. He witnessed a dozen successful military coups and several attempted uprisings, and in his last years, his health failing, he appeared powerless to stem sometimes violent demonstrations, offering only vague appeals for unity and giving royal endorsement to two coups.Meanwhile a strain of republicanism emerged as the country broke into two camps: on one side, the establishment, with the palace at its core; on the other, the disenfranchised, whose demand for a political voice threatened the traditional order.Between them was the king, a calming symbol of unity \u2014 so much so that at times he wanted to moderate the country\u2019s almost obsessive veneration of him.In his birthday speech in 2005, he said the belief that the king can do no wrong was \u201cvery much an insult to the king.\u201d\u201cWhy is it that the king can do no wrong?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis shows they do not regard the king as being a human. But the king can do wrong.\u201dBhumibol Adulyadej was born in Cambridge on Dec. 5, 1927, the son of Prince Mahidol of Songkhla, a founder of modern medicine in Thailand; the prince was studying public health at Harvard at the time.Bhumibol\u2019s mother, Princess Sangwalya Chukramol, was a Thai nurse studying on a scholarship at Simmons College in Boston when she met the prince. Bhumibol had an older brother, Ananda, and a sister, Galyani Vadhana.Bhumibol and his father were inheritors of the reformist tradition begun by King Mongkut in the 19th century and accelerated by his son King Chulalongkorn, Bhumibol\u2019s grandfather.Mongkut and Chulalongkorn were the king and prince in \u201cAnna and the King of Siam,\u201d Margaret Landon\u2019s 1943 novel, which was based on the autobiographical writings of Anna Leonowens. The novel inspired the musical \u201cThe King and I\u201d and its film adaptation.Bhumibol was 2 when his father died, and his mother, to whom he was very close, took her children to Switzerland for schooling. Their family life was interrupted in 1935 when Thailand\u2019s last absolute king, Prajadhipok, Prince Mahidol\u2019s half brother, abdicated after a military coup. The crown passed to Prince Mahidol\u2019s eldest son, Prince Ananda, then 10 years old.King Ananda was barely into his 20s when, on June 9, 1946, he was found dead in his private chambers with a bullet through his head. Bhumibol was the last family member to have seen him alive, but he never spoke publicly about the death or about rumors that the young king, a gun collector, may have committed suicide or killed himself accidentally.Bhumibol, though not originally in the line of succession, was anointed king. He soon returned to Switzerland for a few years and studied politics and history at the University of Lausanne.While on a trip to Paris, he met Sirikit Kitiyakara, whose father, a Thai prince, was serving as a diplomat in Europe. They married in 1950, the year King Bhumibol was formally crowned Rama IX of the Chakri dynasty.David K. Wyatt, the author of the classic 1982 book \u201cThailand: A Short History,\u201d credited King Bhumibol with turning the monarchy into Thailand\u2019s strongest social and political institution.Queen Sirikit, though often ill, apparently from depression or a nervous disorder, tried to keep up with her husband as he toured the country and visited the more than 1,200 development projects he fostered. She concentrated on reinvigorating Thai handicrafts.She and the couple\u2019s four children survive. The eldest is the daughter Ubol Ratana, who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, married an American and lived mostly in California until separating from him and returning to the fold in Thailand in 2006. The youngest, Princess Chulabhorn, has a degree in organic chemistry and was married to a Thai commoner. It was she who broke a royal silence about the health of her mother in the mid-1980s by saying that Queen Sirikit, an insomniac, suffered from exhaustion.The heir to the throne, Prince Vajiralongkorn, is the only royal son.Toward the end of the king\u2019s life, Prince Vajiralongkorn was moving to the center of public life. The military has recently sought to burnish the image of the prince, a partnership that may also have cemented the generals\u2019 power.King Bhumibol was nearing the end of a long day of visiting projects in eastern Thailand in the summer of 1988 when he and Princess Sirindhorn agreed to be interviewed by The Times in a Swiss-style chalet by a reservoir built by a donor in honor of the king. The subject turned to the legend of \u201cThe King and I,\u201d which had been banned in Thailand as being disrespectful to the monarchy, and to the West\u2019s image of the glittering life of a king of Siam, embodied in the musical most memorably by Yul Brynner.\u201cAt first it was all this rubbish about the half brother of the moon and the sun and master of the tide and all that,\u201d King Bhumibol said in his fluent English. He said he found it \u201cirking\u201d to have to live up to legends created by Western writers.\u201cThey wanted to make a fairy tale to amuse people,\u201d he said, \u201cto amuse people more than to tell the truth.\u201dIn reality, he said, his life revolved around his development projects.He said he did not care how history would remember him.\u201cIf they want to write about me in a good way,\u201d he said, \u201cthey should write how I do things that are useful.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Thailand\u2019s government in 1946. The country was in a brief period of civilian government at the time; it was not under military control. (The military seized power in Thailand in 1947 and has ruled off and on ever since.)FollowSeth Mydans and Thomas Fuller contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Populist Explosion\u2019 Dissects the History of the Anti-Elite Worldview", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In November, the fate of the Republic will turn on one question: How popular is the populism of Donald Trump? If aggrieved and motivated Trumpists turn out heavily, we could yet have our own Brexit moment. But before knowing whether a big white wave will break over the electorate, it helps to understand what \u201cpopulism\u201d means, where it comes from and why it is advancing on both sides of the Atlantic.These are the questions John B. Judis \u00adtackles in \u201cThe Populist Explosion,\u201d his cogent and exceptionally clarifying guide to a political phenomenon that is at once elusive and, yes, explosive. Judis is personally sympathetic to left-wing populism, but he keeps his analysis free of ax-grinding.In \u201cThe Populist Persuasion,\u201d published in 1995, the historian Michael Kazin described populism as \u201ca language\u201d that ordinary people \u2014 and the often-wealthy politicians who claim to speak for them \u2014 use to organize themselves against elites they see as \u201cself-serving and undemocratic.\u201d The fevered logic of this worldview frequently transcends the usual categories of left, right and center, as the sociologist Donald I. Warren argued in his 1976 study, \u201cThe Radical Center: Middle Americans and the Politics of Alienation,\u201d an obscure but important examination of George Wallace voters, many of whom went on to be known as Reagan Democrats.Judis extends this unified theory of populism to the present day, when stagnant wages, corporate desertions and widespread fear of being cast adrift in the global economy have brought Bernie Sanders and Trump together in their contempt for trade deals. But he is eager to distinguish the left-wing economic populism of Sanders and the anti-elite Podemos Party in Spain, which champion \u201cthe people\u201d against the 1 percent, from the right-wing cultural populism of Trump and the \u00adanti-Muslim Danish People\u2019s Party. The difference is that right-wing populists accuse the elite of coddling an ever-shifting third group \u2014 immigrants, blacks, terrorists, welfare recipients or all of the above. This demagoguing of the scapegoat du jour is what gives right-wing populism its current potency, especially in Europe, which is facing more severe economic, immigration and terrorism problems than the United States.Populism, Judis explains, is an American creation, with roots in the American Revolution and Andrew Jackson\u2019s fight against the Bank of the United States in the 1830s. The name dates back to the early 1890s, when Farmers Alliances across the West and South linked up with the Knights of Labor to form the short-lived People\u2019s Party. The goal was radical democratic reform, not class revolution. In 1896, the Democrats nominated the fiery William Jennings Bryan on a \u201cfree silver\u201d platform in opposition to Wall Street, the beginning of a long tradition of major parties co-opting populist ideas. With the help of middle-class progressives in both parties, much of the People\u2019s Party platform (monetization of silver, a graduated income tax, regulation of railroads, direct election of senators) became law. Similarly, the threat posed to Franklin Roose\u00advelt\u2019s re-election by Huey Long and his \u201cShare Our Wealth\u201d movement may have ended in 1935 with Long\u2019s assassination, but Roosevelt had already moved left in response to populist fervor by ramming through Social Security and other legislation. Long\u2019s base, like Trump\u2019s, was not the poor, but middle-class voters who feared slipping lower amid economic dislocation.When Barack Obama took office in 2009, many expected he would forge a new and enduring Democratic majority out of the wreckage left by an irresponsible financial elite. But instead of being pushed from the left, as Roosevelt was, Obama looked behind him and saw no one there. Even the auto bailouts, which the White House hoped would be popular with working people, were resented. Instead, within days of taking office, Obama felt pressure from a new populist movement on the right \u2014 soon to be called the Tea Party \u2014 that drew strength from voters who had once flocked to Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan in the 1990s.In his abbreviated account, Judis underplays how often left-wing economic populism has curdled into right-wing racist populism. Though he mentions Tom Watson, he ignores C. Vann Woodward\u2019s \u201cTom Watson: Agrarian Rebel\u201d (1938), which chronicles how the brilliant Georgia reformer \u2014 the foremost turn-of-the-century populist \u2014 became a bitter bigot. And while citing Alan Brinkley\u2019s \u201cVoices of Protest\u201d (1982) in his discussion of Father Charles Coughlin, the anti-Semitic \u201cRadio Priest,\u201d he ignores the fact that Coughlin was at first a strong supporter of the New Deal. Judis does better with Wallace, who railed against integration and \u201cpointy-headed intellectuals\u201d when he was governor of Alabama but was far less strident and racist in his presidential campaigns. Many of Trump\u2019s non-college-\u00adeducated white supporters are the direct political descendants of Wallace voters (just as Sanders\u2019s voters are connected to George McGovern\u2019s). In 1968, Wallace, running as a third-party candidate, seemed to threaten the Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, polling 21 percent to Humphrey\u2019s 28 percent at one point in September, an impressive performance for a populist candidate that far into the campaign season.After Richard Nixon won, he absorbed the Wallace base into the Republican Party by moving right on \u201claw and order,\u201d busing and other issues Wallace had stressed.Parliamentary systems offer a different role for populists. Judis offers a fresh survey of the 10 European countries where, after the Great Recession, populist candidates have either won elections or become part of governing coalitions. Northern tier nations, besieged by immigrants who are allowed freedom of movement by the E.U., have shifted right. The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) led Britain\u2019s exit from Europe with an older, less educated constituency that looks a lot like Trump\u2019s. But southern European nations like Spain, Italy and Greece, with economies mired in depressions every bit as bad as the one the United States experienced during the 1930s, went left, which nowadays means resistance to E.U. elites, not socialism.One quibble: Judis echoes left-wing political scientists who have twisted the word \u201cneoliberal.\u201d In the United States, it refers to Clintonian Democrats who believe in the old goals of liberalism but question some of the means of achieving them. In Europe, neoliberals are free-\u00admarket capitalists who impose rigid and \u2014 judging by the sluggish European economy \u2014 unsuccessful austerity measures on debtor nations. Using the word almost interchangeably is confusing, not to mention unfair to American neoliberals, who may have gone overboard on financial deregulation in the 1990s but have staunchly opposed Republican austerity measures.In the end, Judis has a surprisingly benign attitude toward even right-wing populism. He thinks Trump and the European right-wing populists are nasty nationalists, but not fascists, insisting that even those with authoritarian streaks believe in working within the democratic system and lack the territorial ambitions that were central to German and Italian fascism. Instead, Judis writes, Trump resembles the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the buffoonish media baron.While careful not to make predictions, Judis suggests that Brexit might be contagious on the Continent. And his description of how the presentable Marine Le Pen has sidelined the haters in the National Front (including the founder of the party, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who described the gas chambers of the Holocaust as a \u201cdetail\u201d) indicates that she may be elected the first populist president of France next year.At home, Sanders\u2019s success showed that some left-wing populist ideas \u2014 incubated in the failed but symbolically important Occupy Wall Street movement \u2014 are in ascendancy inside the Democratic Party. That means a President Hillary Clinton \u2014 like Roosevelt and Nixon \u2014 would most likely try to co-opt a few of them. But neither Clinton nor Trump wants to nationalize banks or greatly redistribute wealth (unless one includes Trump\u2019s plan to slash taxes again for the wealthy, further enriching the top 1 percent). So we won\u2019t see much classic economic populism in the White House next year, even as trans-\u00adAtlantic populist scapegoating continues apace.A review on Oct. 9 about \u201cThe Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European Politics,\u201d by John B. Judis, overstated George Wallace \u2019s performance in presidential polls when he was a third-party candidate in 1968. He drew close to the Democratic nominee, Hubert H. Humphrey, in late September (21 percent to Humphrey\u2019s 28 percent, according to the Gallup Organization), but he did not lead Humphrey in the polls \u201c until October\u201d (or at any time).Jonathan Alter, the author of two books on Barack Obama and one on Franklin D. Roosevelt, is now working on a biography of Jimmy Carter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Lean Years, Big Oil May Emerge Stronger Than Ever", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byBig Oil is clawing its way back.After a heart-stopping plunge in the price of crude over the last two years, along with slashed dividends and the elimination of tens of thousands of jobs, the biggest oil companies are proving surprisingly adept at again pumping profits, as well as oil, out of the ground.Indeed, with oil trading in a range of $40 to $50 barrel for most of the 2016, experts say the biggest energy producers are poised to rebound if prices remain stable.\u201cIt\u2019s a hunger games environment, but they are learning how to be more efficient,\u201d said Evan Calio, an equity analyst with Morgan Stanley. \u201cTwo years ago, nobody thought costs could drop as quickly as they did. It\u2019s staggering, and there\u2019s no doubt this has surprised people.\u201dNot that it has been easy.Over the last 12 months, drillers have eliminated nearly 20,000 jobs in the United States, according to the Labor Department, and Morgan Stanley expects domestic oil production to finish 2016 half a million barrels below where it started. Deepwater drilling has been curtailed in places like the Gulf of Mexico, as have multibillion dollar projects around the world.In the continental United States, once red-hot regions like North Dakota, where the fracking boom transformed the economy, have abruptly cooled. Individual companies that were especially aggressive about seeking new finds have been humbled.Besides being forced to cut its dividend, ConocoPhillips reduced its capital budget for exploration and production by more than $10 billion \u2014 or roughly two-thirds. Since late 2014, its shares have fallen from over $70 to around $40 recently.But if crude prices can stay above $40 a barrel, the dividends, and stock prices, of the big American oil companies should be secure. And if oil stays above $50, or even hits $60 in the coming months or years, Big Oil may well emerge from the recent lean years stronger than ever.\u201cWhoever survives this is going to win,\u201d said Michael Rothman, a veteran oil analyst who is president of Cornerstone Analytics, a New Jersey-based research firm. \u201cThey\u2019re going to come out smelling like roses.\u201dWhat is more, the big pullback in exploration has caused a steady drop in the cost of completing those projects that are still underway, as prices for steel, drilling rigs and other services have plunged. That should enable major energy firms to take advantage of economies of scale and increase their profit margins further.\u201cCapital spending has come down massively, and majors have taken a lot of the fat out of their organizations,\u201d said Neil Mehta, who tracks the North American integrated oil and refining industry for Goldman Sachs.Now, after investing tens of billions of dollars, many of these giant projects are set to come online in the next few years, and Mr. Mehta said he expected Big Oil to move from investment mode to what he termed \u201charvest mode.\u201d\u201cYou spend a lot upfront and the capital is sunk, but now free cash flow profiles are going to get better,\u201d Mr. Mehta said.For example, Chevron\u2019s large Gorgon natural gas project in Australia saw costs balloon to more than $50 billion from a projected $37 billion. That strained the company\u2019s budget, but as Gorgon\u2019s production finally increases, Chevron\u2019s bottom line will benefit, with Japanese and Korean customers lined up to take delivery of natural gas.Next year and 2018 \u201clook to be an inflection point for Chevron,\u201d said Phil Gresh, an analyst with JPMorgan, noting that as projects like Gorgon near the finish line, the company\u2019s free cash flow should rise, providing additional support for Chevron\u2019s 4.2 percent dividend.What if oil prices do, in fact, start tumbling again, or at least don\u2019t budge from their current level of about $50 a barrel? If benchmark oil prices dip below $40, sustaining dividends will be tough, according to Mr. Mehta. \u201cAt $50, American companies can make it, Europeans maybe not,\u201d he said. \u201cAt $60, it\u2019s likely everybody can sustain their dividends.\u201dAnd the oil bulls do have some long-term trends in their favor.Despite the push to reduce dependence on fossil fuels in many countries in the face of climate change, as well as the increasing popularity of electric cars in the United States, the global appetite for oil is still expected to rise.Mr. Mehta estimates oil will trade in the $50 to $60 range from 2017 to 2020, with global demand rising annually by slightly more than one millions barrels a day. \u201cThere are many countries that want to work their way up the economic ladder, and that means more demand for energy,\u201d he said.Indeed, even with slower growth than in years past, China continues to consume more crude as new drivers hit the roads. India, too, has a growing middle class that will need gasoline and other fuels to power new automobiles. Many American drivers, not to mention Detroit automakers, still favor gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and other large cars.At the same time, Middle East oil producers as well as Russia have been showing a bit more willingness to work together to maintain price stability after the volatility of 2014 and 2015.To be sure, there\u2019s no guarantee oil prices will rise \u2014 or even stay where they are.A little more than two years ago, when oil was trading higher than $100 per barrel, many experts, not to mention executives, had no inkling a crash was coming. With prices high, they borrowed \u2013 and drilled \u2013 as fast as they could.Some small exploration and production companies in the United States were forced to file for bankruptcy, unable to sustain debt payments as crude collapsed. But that weakness actually has provided an opening for bigger companies to scoop up assets, essentially drilling for oil on Wall Street by buying struggling firms on the cheap.Even if prices do drop again, the biggest energy companies that possess both upstream production capacity and downstream businesses like refining, chemicals and retail outlets will still fare better than smaller rivals, Mr. Rothman said.\u201cThere\u2019s an advantage to being an integrated oil company with both upstream and downstream operations and gas stations,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that retail gas stations make more money selling beer and cigarettes than gasoline.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Trashes Nafta. But Unwinding It Would Come at a Huge Cost.", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceWhen you buy an \u201cAmerican-made\u201d car, you are probably buying a car that has an immensely complicated mix of components that were also made in Mexico and Canada. The same is true for many electronics, and advanced textiles like carpeting. The beef in your grocery store might be from a cow that was fattened and slaughtered in the United States, but that was very likely born across the border in Mexico.That is the world that has evolved in the almost 23 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted. These deep economic interconnections show why trying to unravel what Donald J. Trump, in last week\u2019s debate, called \u201cthe single worst trade deal ever approved in this country\u201d would be no easy feat. It would risk disrupting the very underpinnings of industries that employ millions of Americans.The view among mainstream economists is that Nafta, over all, has raised incomes in the United States while also costing it thousands of manufacturing jobs. But whether you view the agreement as a net positive or a net negative for the country, the reality is that the United States, Canada and Mexico are now for all practical purposes a single integrated economy. That has wide-ranging consequences \u2014 especially if the next president tries to reshape or abandon the deal.At the border between Santa Teresa, N.M., and the Mexican town of San Jeronimo, up to 5,000 head of cattle a day amble across the border; they are less likely to become stressed and lose weight when they walk under their own power than when loaded into semis. After being bred in the hills of Northern Mexico, and after eating American corn, they become a key input for the American beef industry. It creates jobs in feedlots and slaughterhouses in the United States, where the animals are fattened, and produces less costly beef for consumers in the United States and in the global markets to which the beef is exported.A few miles away, Mexican workers in a Foxconn facility assemble Dell computers that were designed in Texas and will be sold all over the world. Low labor costs keep Dell on a competitive footing with global competitors like China\u2019s Lenovo. Because of that, Dell can employ thousands of highly paid engineers and salespeople in the United States.And American automobile companies have supply chains that are so thoroughly integrated across the Canadian and Mexican borders that when huge traffic backups developed on the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, because of intensive security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Michigan auto factories were at risk of having to shut down for want of supplies.The auto industry is so intertwined among the three countries that it\u2019s almost useless to think of a car as being \u201cmade in the United States,\u201d even if the final assembly takes place within America\u2019s borders.\u201cYou have what looks like an American car, with Mexican labor and materials that went into it and Canadian materials,\u201d said James Bookbinder, a professor of logistics and manufacturing at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. \u201cIt\u2019s really from the Nafta region, and in the process some of those jobs created are in Mexico, but there are also jobs in the United States because all these pieces fit together.\u201dAs a general rule, Mexican suppliers make parts that can be done with low-skilled labor and relatively simple assembly \u2014 plastic bumpers, seats or dashboards. More complex parts like engines, transmissions and electronics components are more likely to be made in the United States or Canada, where the workers and suppliers with more advanced skills are in greater supply.\u201cA transmission is a complicated piece of machinery and might go back and forth across the border three or four times as different components are added at different plants,\u201d said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.There are parallels elsewhere in the world. In Europe, German manufacturing is extraordinarily successful on the world stage \u2014 but many of the more labor-intensive, lower-value inputs for German cars and other manufactured goods come from lower-wage countries in the European Union like Poland and Hungary.It\u2019s true that there have been fewer auto-making jobs in the United States since the introduction of Nafta. The 926,000 jobs making motor vehicles and parts is down 15 percent since December 1993.But it\u2019s hard to untangle the impact of trade and the shifting of some work to Mexico from the advanced technology like robotics that reduces the man-hours it takes to build a car. Overall manufacturing employment in the United States is down 27 percent in the same span.\u201cThere\u2019s this tendency to say, \u2018It\u2019s all moving to Mexico,\u2019 \u201d said Bernard Swiecki, a senior analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. But the center\u2019s research finds that automakers have spent $77 billion on new or upgraded capital projects in the United States since 2010, compared with $26 billion in Mexico.The improved competitiveness of American companies in the global auto market since the 1990s has happened in part because they have built more efficient North American supply chains. Different parts of the car are made in the place where the local labor force and cost structure are the best fit.\u201cIf a product uses really sophisticated materials like high-strength steels and advanced composites, and more sophisticated processes,\u201d Mr. Swiecki said, there\u2019s a better chance you can find the people with the skills needed in the United States or Canada. Meanwhile, the lower price of labor-intensive parts imported from Mexico helps control the cost of the overall automobile and makes it more competitive with cars built in Europe or Asia.Since the 1990s, major automakers based outside the United States have built American factories to gain access to these local supply networks and get closer to American consumers. That has to do with a lot more than Nafta, but the connections between North American parts suppliers across borders surely helped speed the process.The North American auto industry is not the only sector where such a transformation has occurred, Mr. Hufbauer says. American textile companies make technologically advanced fabrics like those for carpeting, parachutes or the steel mesh inside tires. They are exported to Mexico, where the more labor-intensive work of turning those into finished goods is done. The same goes for many electronics.But even if you accept that these trends contribute to higher economic output, and to more high-income jobs and more competitive companies in the United States, it\u2019s not as if the anxiety about losing jobs that Mr. Trump describes doesn\u2019t have a realistic basis.In other words, the narrative promulgated by trade skeptics that a more integrated global economy has worsened job opportunities for certain workers isn\u2019t wrong. But it\u2019s also not a given that the trend will reverse itself if the next president does seek to renegotiate Nafta.We don\u2019t know exactly what a President Trump would do in seeking to renegotiate Nafta, or what exactly the consequences would be of a trade war between the United States and its partners. And a trade war could well erupt if he were to follow through on some of his aggressive statements.What we do know is that even relatively small tariffs can stand in the way of the kind of supply networks on which many modern industries are based. With these networks, goods can cross back and forth across national borders multiple times as part of the pipeline that leads to a finished automobile or a computer or even a side of beef. It\u2019s not that companies couldn\u2019t adjust; over time they could. It\u2019s that the networks evolved this way for a reason, and readjusting would come at a considerable cost.More fundamentally, trying to reject the free-trade deal with America\u2019s neighbors entirely would mean upending major industries and a generation\u2019s worth of economic integration. Nafta has had its flaws and downsides. But either major American industries would have to figure out how to restructure themselves to rely less on the movement of goods across borders, or the United States would find itself poorer and more of an island in the global economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Close Race for Darrell Issa, the House Mini-Trump", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byMODESTO, Calif. \u2014 For more than 15 years, Representative Darrell Issa has not so much as put out a yard sign. A Republican comfortably ensconced in his Southern California seat, he has blown by one challenger after another since being elected in 2000.But in this upside-down year, Mr. Issa finds himself suddenly in danger of defeat, a prognosis worsened by his decision to embrace Donald J. Trump.Democrats, who cannot contain their glee at the prospect of his defeat, are trying to make the case that Mr. Issa is not alone. \u201cIf Darrell Issa, a long-term member who is well known in his district and outside his district, who is the richest member of Congress, is on the cusp of losing,\u201d said Representative Xavier Becerra of California, a member of House Democratic leadership, \u201cthen it\u2019s not just Darrell Issa who\u2019s going down.\u201dWealthier, white voters in the suburbs dominate Mr. Issa\u2019s district, an idyllic stretch of mountains and coastline between Los Angeles and San Diego, including San Clemente, where a disgraced President Richard M. Nixon went to write his memoirs.About seven hours north, Representative Jeff Denham, a Republican who was first elected in 2010, is also facing a tough re-election fight. His district includes Modesto, a city of 205,000 that was depicted by the filmmaker George Lucas, a native son, in \u201cAmerican Graffiti.\u201d Today, the poverty rate hovers around 19 percent in a district where much of the economy depends on farming \u2014 particularly almonds, a crop greedy for water in the drought-stricken Central Valley of California where Modesto lies.President Obama won at least once in each incumbent\u2019s district \u2014 twice in Mr. Denham\u2019s, where some party-agnostic, regionally focused conservative Democrats are more likely to refer to themselves as \u201cvalleycrats.\u201d Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, a group that historically is less likely to vote but is expected to do so in this year of antipathy toward Mr. Trump.Mr. Denham, like Mr. Issa, has expressed support for Mr. Trump \u2014 or at least declined to push him away.California Republicans have no candidate for the Senate because the state\u2019s open primary left two Democrats vying for the seat of Barbara Boxer, who is retiring. Numerous ballot initiatives focused on progressive causes could also give Republicans few reasons to turn out.\u201cNormal people don\u2019t get motivated by congressional candidates,\u201d said Daniel Schnur, a professor at the University of Southern California, who was the communications director for Senator John McCain of Arizona in his 2000 presidential bid. \u201cThey get motivated by the top of the ticket, and then they stick around to vote down ballot.\u201dThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC, a Democratic \u201csuper PAC,\u201d have invested more than $4 million to defeat Mr. Issa and Mr. Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, recently gave more than $1.6 million to Mr. Denham as part of a nationwide investment to shore up Republican candidates.Mr. Issa, who endorsed Mr. Trump after previously backing Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, has signed on to the Republican nominee\u2019s national security advisory board. When a 2005 recording surfaced in which Mr. Trump talked about sexually assaulting women, Mr. Issa\u2019s campaign released a statement condemning the remarks as \u201cwholly inappropriate, offensive and unfitting of anyone seeking to lead our nation,\u201d but the congressman did not rescind his support.But he has tried an even more surprising move: embracing Mr. Obama. The former chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Mr. Issa so relished his position as the chief interrogator of the Obama administration during hearings on the Internal Revenue Service scandal and the attacks on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that he used a stick figure in a police officer\u2019s cap as his Twitter avatar. Yet he recently distributed campaign mailers promoting a bill for which he was one of 40 co-sponsors that included a photograph of Mr. Obama signing it into law.\u201cThat is the definition of chutzpah,\u201d Mr. Obama said of Mr. Issa during a fund-raiser on Sunday in the San Diego enclave of La Jolla.Mr. Issa also dallied on investing in his race, waiting until October to start running ads, Mr. Wasserman said.Mr. Issa\u2019s opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel who served in Iraq, has run ads with the help of significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\u201cYou have to look at the first person who responded to those really baseless allegations: It was my ex-wife,\u201d Mr. Applegate said in an interview. \u201cShe was offended at the attacks, said that she supported me and was going to be voting for me in November.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Issa is spending money \u201cin a targeted and data-driven way to ensure the best bang for the buck,\u201d Calvin Moore, Mr. Issa\u2019s spokesman, wrote in an email.Like many endangered Republican incumbents, Mr. Denham has danced around whether he supports Mr. Trump, saying he will work with whoever wins in November. \u201cI\u2019ve not weighed into this because I think it\u2019s not my place to weigh into it,\u201d he said.His opponent, Michael Eggman, a beekeeper, has staked his campaign on tying Mr. Denham to Mr. Trump. Walking along the rows of droning bees and almond trees on the farm he inherited from his father, Mr. Eggman gave few policy specifics but did offer a forceful denunciation of Mr. Denham, who beat him by 12 percentage points in 2014.\u201cTo prove the fact that he\u2019s so disconnected from this district, he\u2019s endorsing Trump for president,\u201d Mr. Eggman said. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t represent the valley values that I know.\u201dJoseph Kieta, the paper\u2019s editor, said that Mr. Denham had been motivated by fear of political backlash more than his constituents\u2019 best interests.\u201cI cannot believe that he, in his heart of hearts, thinks that Donald Trump, who wants to deport Latinos, is good for his district,\u201d Mr. Kieta said.\u201cIt exposed something about Denham that we didn\u2019t know before,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberals Hope Elizabeth Warren Will Serve as Clinton\u2019s Scrutinizer in Chief", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported bySenator Elizabeth Warren delivered a blistering rebuke of Donald J. Trump on Monday, warning him that \u201cnasty women vote\u201d and imploring a crowd to cast ballots for Hillary Clinton.\u201cI don\u2019t know about you,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said as she flashed a thankful smile and seized the microphone from Ms. Warren at a rally in Manchester, N.H. \u201cBut I could listen to Elizabeth Warren go on all day.\u201dShe might have to.With polls and early voting data signaling that Mrs. Clinton is likely to prevail against Mr. Trump in two weeks, liberal Democrats are already looking past Election Day \u2014 and relying on Ms. Warren to become the thorn in chief in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s side, scrutinizing her appointments and agenda.Mrs. Clinton has vowed that if elected she will work across the aisle with congressional Republicans, but relations with liberals, including Ms. Warren of Massachusetts and Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, could prove quite contentious.Some Democrats are not waiting for Nov. 8. With Mrs. Clinton\u2019s transition team considering applicants to fill as many as 15 cabinet positions and about 200 subcabinet positions, the left has begun to exert pressure over her potential choices.\u201cPersonnel is policy,\u201d said Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor during the Clinton administration who supported Mr. Sanders during the nominating fight. Mr. Reich said he anticipated intense resistance to any appointees with ties to Wall Street. \u201cAs far I can tell, those discussions have already begun,\u201d he added.Asked on Saturday whether she had thought about her cabinet appointments, Mrs. Clinton told reporters onboard her campaign plane: \u201cNo, I really haven\u2019t. I\u2019m a little superstitious about that.\u201dBut that has not stopped liberals from voicing concerns. \u201cWe need a secretary of the Treasury who is prepared to take on the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, not someone who comes from Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Sanders wrote in an email on Monday.Democrats frequently point to Ms. Warren as a model for how to gain the public\u2019s attention in effectively blocking appointments. Last year she foiled President Obama\u2019s appointment of Antonio Weiss, a senior investment banker at Lazard, to a top Treasury Department post, a coup that thrilled the left when Mr. Weiss withdrew his name. If she is elected, Mrs. Clinton will face similar pressures filling cabinet positions.Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said that her singular focus was winning in November and that speculation about personnel in her potential Clinton administration \u201cis entirely premature.\u201dBefore she became a senator, Ms. Warren, who has taken aim at the financial deregulation of the Bill Clinton era, criticized Mrs. Clinton, then a New York senator, for shifting positions to support bankruptcy legislation that would have made it more difficult for families to receive debt relief.But the two Democrats have since formed a warm alliance. Ms. Warren was vetted as a possible running mate and has proved a potent surrogate, bringing her populist appeal and quirky straight talk to a campaign that has struggled to connect with young voters and liberals.On Monday, Ms. Warren took furious aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about women and the sexual assault allegations against him.\u201cHe thinks that because he has a mouthful of Tic Tacs that he can force himself on any woman within groping distance,\u201d she said, alluding to Mr. Trump\u2019s mention of the breath freshener in a 2005 recording in which he boasted about forcing himself on women.Ms. Warren has directed her singular brand of venom at the Obama administration, in which policy negotiations often include aides raising the caveat of \u201cWhat would Elizabeth Warren say?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a very powerful ally to have on your side, but it\u2019s well known that she\u2019s a very formidable opponent to have working against you,\u201d said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.\u201cYou should resign!\u201d Ms. Warren said in a fiery exchange with Mr. Stumpf that quickly became a YouTube sensation. Mr. Stumpf has since resigned.\u201cSome of the best TV you can see is on C-Span when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or a regulator,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on Monday.Though Mrs. Clinton earned an enthusiastic reception on Monday, Ms. Warren remained the more powerful draw for a number of more left-leaning voters. Some attendees had traveled from her home state to see her speak.Haydee Bembenek, 75, of Massachusetts, said it was healthy that the pair would \u201ckeep each other in check\u201d as partners in government should Mrs. Clinton win.Then Ms. Bembenek offered a prediction. \u201cShe\u2019ll be good to run for the presidency,\u201d she said of Ms. Warren, 67, \u201conce Hillary is done with her eight years.\u201dMrs. Clinton won over many liberals when she adopted Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan for free in-state college tuition for middle-class families and when she turned against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Obama\u2019s 12-nation trade pact. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton said she looked forward to \u201cworking with\u201d Ms. Warren \u201cto rewrite the rules of our economy.\u201dBut many on the left remain skeptical of whether Mrs. Clinton would push liberal policies or adopt a more centrist agenda, like that of her husband.\u201cI\u2019m going to vote for Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 \u2014 and on Nov. 9, I am going to demand the platform we wrote be implemented,\u201d said Jonathan Tasini, a labor activist who challenged Mrs. Clinton for her Senate seat in New York in 2006 and supported Mr. Sanders in the primary.Asked on Sunday whether Mrs. Clinton would pursue an Asian trade agreement if elected, her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, said they had not directly discussed the topic.\u201cLook, we aren\u2019t against trade,\u201d Mr. Kaine told Chuck Todd of NBC. \u201cYou never close the door if you can get a deal that\u2019s going to be good for American workers and our economy.\u201dThose kinds of comments sent a shudder through liberals who regret their initial hesitancy to antagonize the current Democratic administration.\u201cObama had a very lengthy honeymoon when there wasn\u2019t much pressure on him from the left,\u201d said Dan Cantor, the national director of the Working Families Party. \u201cThat won\u2019t be the case with Hillary Clinton.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spaniards, Exhausted by Politics, Warm to Life Without a Government", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byMADRID \u2014 For the past 288 days, Spain has plodded along without an elected national government. For some Spaniards, this is a wonderful thing.\u201cNo government, no thieves,\u201d said F\u00e9lix Pastor, a language teacher who, like many voters, is fed up with the corruption and scandals that tarnished the two previous governing parties.Mr. Pastor, a wiry, animated 59-year-old, said Spain could last without a government \u201cuntil hell freezes over\u201d because politicians were in no position to do more harm.That has produced an unprecedented public spectacle: Politicians scheme and plot but reject the difficult compromises needed to form a government. Voters watch ruefully with a mix of fascination and contempt.But while the Socialists\u2019 revolt could break the deadlock, it may do little to heal Spaniards\u2019 frustration with a crisis that has further eroded their faith in politicians.Spain\u2019s leaders warned that having no government would mean chaos and deprivation. Instead, more than anything, the crisis seems to have offered a glimpse of life if politicians simply stepped out of the way. For many here, it has not been all that bad.\u201cSpain would be just fine if we got rid of most of the politicians and three-fourths of government employees,\u201d Rafael Navarro, 71, said inside his tiny storefront pharmacy in Madrid. Too little government is better than too much, he said.In some ways, this is a phantom crisis for ordinary Spaniards. There has been no United States-style government shutdown. There are no mounds of uncollected garbage, no unpaid police officers, no shuttered ministries, no public trains or buses halted.Budget money is still flowing. Government ministries are functioning. Social service recipients and civil servants are being paid. Even if no new government has been formed when the 2016 national budget expires this fall, the old budget will simply become the new budget for 2017.But government is paralyzed in other ways. Nobody is proposing legislation, debating international affairs or even rotating Spain\u2019s ambassadors. Funding for many infrastructure and government projects is frozen. And nationalist movements in Catalonia and the Basque region continue to roil national politics.The stalemate has come at an opportune moment. After a severe recession ended in 2013, Spain\u2019s economy rebounded. Growth is forecast to be 2.9 percent this year, almost twice the 1.6 percent eurozone average expected by the European Commission. Interest and energy rates are at historic lows.Spain, a tourism superpower, expects 74 million visitors this year, six million more than last year, as terrorism fears elsewhere send visitors here. Cafes and museums are crowded, and hotels are booked solid.But after trudging to the polls twice already in the last year, weary voters are in no mood to vote again. The political calendar dictates a vote on Christmas if no agreement to form a government can be reached by Oct. 31.The impasse has dragged on so long that \u201cit\u2019s like \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 every day,\u201d said Pedro Rodr\u00edguez, an assistant professor of international relations at a private university in Madrid.\u201cPeople are exhausted,\u201d Mr. Cardero said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear one more thing from these politicians.\u201dSpaniards were hopeful for better government in December, after two new parties, for the first time, won a third of the seats in Parliament. That set off a political free-for-all because no single party has been able to muster a majority.The two traditional parties \u2014 the conservative Popular Party and the Socialist Party \u2014 could have agreed on a new government, but they refused to talk to each other.\u201cNegotiating or giving concessions is perceived as weakness,\u201d said Antonio Rold\u00e1n, a lawmaker from the upstart Ciudadanos party.Manuel de la Rocha V\u00e1zquez, an economic adviser in the Socialist Party, said Spain was so polarized that politics had turned almost into a brawl. \u201cThere are only insults and blame and arrogance,\u201d he said.In one survey by the polling company Metroscopia, respondents chose the same few words to describe their feelings about the political deadlock: disappointment, indignation, shame, weariness and deception.In the same survey, Spaniards blamed politicians rather than the party system for the impasse, 58 percent to 20 percent.Other surveys suggest that a December election would produce the same result as the previous two: a Popular Party victory but no majority, according to Metroscopia\u2019s president, Jos\u00e9 Juan Toharia.Angela Jover Pascual, 26, a waitress and mother of two, said she could not even remember which small party she had voted for in June. She said she had voted only as a protest against the bigger parties.Asked whether she would be ready to vote for a third time in one year, Ms. Jover Pascual replied: \u201cNo. It\u2019s useless.\u201dMr. Rajoy, the caretaker prime minister, has been able to sit back as the Socialist Party tears itself apart. His party\u2019s powerful political machine and reliable conservative and elderly voters confer an advantage, especially if other frustrated voters stay home.While still a low-grade fever for now, however, the crisis could yet flare into a debilitating illness.Some economists warn that a day of reckoning is coming. Spain\u2019s debt and unemployment rates, for instance, are among the highest in Europe.Madrid faces a fine of 5 billion euros, about $5.6 billion, if it fails to comply this year with its agreed deficit target from the European Commission of 4.6 percent of gross domestic product.\u201cWe have really painted ourselves into a corner,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Areilza, a law professor in Madrid.For now, things are fairly stable in part because Spain grants considerable powers to its 17 regional governments. They have continued to provide health care, education and other pillars of daily life.\u201cFor a Spanish citizen, the most relevant government is the regional one,\u201d said Santiago Lago Pe\u00f1as, an economics professor in the Galicia region in northwest Spain.But deep within government institutions in Madrid, the crisis is inflicting pain.Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1nchez Sanz, the director of a nuclear fusion lab for the government agency Ciemat, said he spent about 40 percent of every day dealing with cutbacks imposed by the caretaker government.Just five days before a contract was to be signed to supply cooling equipment to a lab in Japan, the project was canceled, Mr. S\u00e1nchez Sanz said. Moreover, every agency contract not already signed was canceled.He does not blame the government crisis for every cutback, but it has created a climate of uncertainty.\u201cIf you cannot honor your contracts, next time they want collaboration, they might look somewhere else because now we are not credible,\u201d Mr. S\u00e1nchez Sanz said.Many voters in outlying regions view the political fight in Madrid as a constant but distant irritant.\u201cWe already knew that politicians were corrupt, but now we also see that they can\u2019t even make politics work,\u201d said Ana Cancela, a civil servant who voted on Sept. 25 in Galicia\u2019s regional elections in Santiago de Compostela, 370 miles from Madrid.Nationwide, wrangling over how to form the next government has many voters wondering: What is the point?\u201cA lot of people said we would go to hell if we didn\u2019t form a government,\u201d said Ignacio Escolar, the editor of the news website eldiario.es. \u201cBut we\u2019re still here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tough Talk but Little Action From Lieberman as Israel\u2019s Defense Minister", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byMemo From JerusalemJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel has been challenged by land, sea and air in recent weeks, as security officials have braced for a wave of violence around the Jewish High Holy Days and the anniversary of the outbreak of Palestinian stabbing, shooting and automobile attacks that began a year ago.Some of the West Bank villages from which assailants have come were closed temporarily, and Israel has continued to strip attackers\u2019 family members of their permits to work in Israel, and demolished their homes. But this did not start with Mr. Lieberman.\u201cPart of what Lieberman said is already the Israeli policy, which includes collective punishment,\u201d said Ghassan Khatib, the vice president of Birzeit University in the West Bank. \u201cThis is not new; it is 60 years old.\u201dThe military has long said its strategy has been to try to differentiate between the perpetrators of violence and the rest of the Palestinian population.An Israeli military official working in the West Bank, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity because of army rules amid the recent resurgence of violence, said that if anything, that policy had been \u201cenhanced.\u201dWhen rockets fired by militants from Gaza exploded in Sderot in August, and again last week, causing panic but no injuries, the Israeli retaliation was broader than usual. The first time, Israel retaliated overnight with about 50 airstrikes against militant targets in Gaza, not the expected two or three. The second time, Israeli forces hit fewer targets but did so in broad daylight, rather than in the more customary dark of night. In both cases, the target sites appeared to be empty, and nobody was killed.Mr. Lieberman accused Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government of pursuing a \u201cdefeatist\u201d policy designed to buy quiet instead of overthrowing Hamas.After last week\u2019s strikes, Mr. Lieberman warned publicly that any fire from Gaza would be met with a powerful response. But he added: \u201cWe are a responsible and judicious leadership. We are not seeking adventures, and nobody is pushing for an escalation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\u201dA senior Israeli military official in the southern command, which includes the Gaza front, recently said that the 50-strike blitz was intended \u201cto test our own capabilities\u201d and \u201cto send a message to the other side.\u201d By hitting Sderot, the official said, speaking on the usual condition of anonymity, the militants had crossed \u201ca red line.\u201dThe response was not calculated to set off an escalation, he said. \u201cThe directive I have is to lengthen for as long as possible the period of calm.\u201dAnd when the Israeli Navy intercepted the women\u2019s flotilla, it tried a less belligerent approach by sending female combat soldiers to board the yacht.In August, Mr. Lieberman unveiled his plan for combating terrorism and dealing with the Palestinians, describing it as a \u201ccarrots-and-sticks\u201d approach. His staff refused to discuss details of the policy, but provided a transcript of a briefing about it that Mr. Lieberman gave to Israeli reporters.The carrots being offered to those not involved in attacks against Israelis include infrastructure improvements and economic opportunities. \u201cIf somebody wants a soccer pitch or a kindergarten, or somebody wants to talk about the economy, trade, business, we are certainly prepared to,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, we understand that we are destined to live side by side.\u201dMr. Lieberman, himself a West Bank settler, also spoke about increasing the number of permits for Palestinians to work in Israel and easing the roadblocks.At a September meeting at the United Nations, Israeli officials presented more sweeteners, including an upgrade to the Allenby Bridge between the West Bank and Jordan, a children\u2019s hospital near Bethlehem, and master plans for building in some Palestinian hamlets in the 60 percent of the West Bank that Israel fully controls, and where almost no Palestinian construction has been allowed. There was also talk of allowing a gas pipeline to Gaza to ease the energy crisis there, as well as selling more water to the Palestinians.\u201cThese are the kinds of common-sense steps that, if implemented, will take us forward in a positive way,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry said at the meeting at the United Nations. \u201cNobody denies that. But there\u2019s no political horizon in any of it.\u201dThe incentives have not generated much enthusiasm among Palestinians who want to see the end of Israeli occupation and the creation of a Palestinian state.\u201cIt should not be a favor to provide a kindergarten to a community, nor a playground,\u201d he said. \u201cTo win hearts and minds \u2014 you are not going to buy that with a soccer field, for goodness sake. This should go without saying.\u201dAs for what sticks he would use beyond the usual toolbox of demolishing houses, canceling work permits and stripping certain Palestinian officials of their V.I.P. passes, Mr. Lieberman has been vague.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Accuses Clinton of Guiding Global Elite Against U.S. Working Class", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump on Thursday accused Hillary Clinton of guiding a \u201cglobal power structure\u201d that has rigged the economy against the working class, language that some suggested echoed anti-Semitic themes.Mr. Trump made the accusation in a speech in West Palm Beach, Fla., in which he also defended himself against several accusations of sexual harassment, published by The New York Times and others.Early in the speech, he said that a global elite had \u201cstripped\u201d the United States of its wealth in order to line the pockets of corporate and political interests. \u201cThe Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors,\u201d he said, referring to the group that has, most recently, published thousands of hacked emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.The remarks drew criticism from some who said they resembled prejudicial language used by anti-Semites.\u201cWhether intentionally or not, Donald Trump is evoking classic anti-Semitic themes that have historically been used against Jews and still reverberate today,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, a group that fights discrimination, said in a statement.Mr. Greenblatt said the group feared that white supremacists might see the comments as tacit encouragement.\u201cMr. Trump focused on the very issues and themes that obsess conspiratorial anti-Semites: They believe that there is an elite group of Jews who control the media, the government, and banking, and who are trying to destroy white America,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also believe that most of Hillary Clinton\u2019s donors are Jewish.\u201dThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Others drew a more direct comparison between Mr. Trump\u2019s words and those of anti-Semites.In the speech, Mr. Trump also accused the \u201cClinton machine\u201d of wielding control over the news media, as well.\u201cThe most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press,\u201d he said to jeers from the audience.While the allegations were aimed at Mrs. Clinton, who is a Methodist, Jews have long been accused of conspiring to control institutions like banks and the media in order to amass wealth and power.Advertisement"}

Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We\u2019re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you\u2019ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?QUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel you\u2019re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth?CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals \u2014 and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.TRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\u2019s in business and trade, where we\u2019re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable.You say who\u2019s making these deals? We\u2019re going the make great deals. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.But I want to do things that haven\u2019t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\u2019s called make America great again.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today\u2019s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?TRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t say that at all. I don\u2019t think you understood what was \u2014 this was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have \u2014 and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven\u2019t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what\u2019s going on.Yes, I\u2019m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it\u2019s locker room talk, and it\u2019s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We\u2019re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.COOPER: So, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.COOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?TRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.COOPER: So, for the record, you\u2019re saying you never did that?TRUMP: I\u2019ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.COOPER: Have you ever done those things?TRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe. We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.We\u2019re going to make America safe again. We\u2019re going to make America great again, but we\u2019re going to make America safe again. And we\u2019re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don\u2019t do that, it just \u2014 it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they\u2019re taking our wealth.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: And that\u2019s what I want to talk about.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?CLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is.But I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\u2019ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\u2019s not only women, and it\u2019s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\u2019s why \u2014 to go back to your question \u2014 I want to send a message \u2014 we all should \u2014 to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.CLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president.RADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online...TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.RADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.TRUMP: It\u2019s just words, folks. It\u2019s just words. Those words, I\u2019ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.I\u2019ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I\u2019m going to help the African-Americans. I\u2019m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.She\u2019s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump \u2014 I want to get to audience questions and online questions.TRUMP: So, she\u2019s allowed to do that, but I\u2019m not allowed to respond?Reporters for The New York Times fact-checked the statements made by Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump during Sunday\u2019s presidential debate.RADDATZ: You\u2019re going to have \u2014 you\u2019re going to get to respond right now.TRUMP: Sounds fair.RADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it\u2019s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \u201cTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\u201d So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.TRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it. But that was something that happened.If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\u2019s done to women. There\u2019s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.So don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely \u2014 I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice.When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.CLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \u201cMexican.\u201dHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.TRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.Number two, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\u2019ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.And I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor.When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.So we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: I\u2019m going to let you talk about e-mails.CLINTON: ... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised.TRUMP: Oh, really?CLINTON: In the first debate...(LAUGHTER)RADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.CLINTON: ... I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I\u2019d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we\u2019re going to really make lives better for people.So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump \u2014 you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we\u2019ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.TRUMP: Because you\u2019d be in jail.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton...COOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You\u2019re just wasting time.RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You\u2019ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \u201cextremely careless.\u201d The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don\u2019t call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say \u2014 and I\u2019ve said before, but I\u2019ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it \u2014 that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I\u2019m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.But I think it\u2019s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all \u2014 anyone who says otherwise has no basis \u2014 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.RADDATZ: OK, we\u2019re going to move on.TRUMP: And yet she didn\u2019t know the word \u2014 the letter C on a document. Right? She didn\u2019t even know what that word \u2014 what that letter meant.You know, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m watching Hillary go over facts. And she\u2019s going after fact after fact, and she\u2019s lying again, because she said she \u2014 you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don\u2019t think so.She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter\u2019s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we\u2019ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she\u2019s saying there wasn\u2019t anything wrong.And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\u2019t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\u2019ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did \u2014 and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.COOPER: We have to move on.TRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.RADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.TRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you\u2019d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.CLINTON: Look, it\u2019s just not true. And so please, go to...TRUMP: Oh, you didn\u2019t delete them?COOPER: Allow her to respond, please.CLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.TRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.CLINTON: Not \u2014 well, we turned over 35,000, so...TRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t talk while you talked.CLINTON: Yes, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t.TRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.CLINTON: I didn\u2019t in the first debate, and I\u2019m going to try not to in this debate, because I\u2019d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.Here\u2019s how we analyzed in real time the second presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.TRUMP: Get off this question.CLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let\u2019s at least focus...TRUMP: Let\u2019s see what happens...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Allow her to respond.CLINTON: ... on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let\u2019s get to their questions.COOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?TRUMP: I\u2019d like to know, Anderson, why aren\u2019t you bringing up the e-mails? I\u2019d like to know. Why aren\u2019t you bringing...COOPER: We brought up the e-mails.TRUMP: No, it hasn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t. And it hasn\u2019t been finished at all.COOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.TRUMP: It\u2019s nice to \u2014 one on three.QUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?COOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.CLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.TRUMP: No, I\u2019m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.(LAUGHTER)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he\u2019s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.But here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.Number three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before.So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.CLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: It is such a great question and it\u2019s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care.It\u2019s only getting worse. In \u201917, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.Obamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want \u2014 and President Obama and whoever was working on it \u2014 they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways.But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\u2019s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it.COOPER: Mr. Trump, your time...TRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \u201cthe craziest thing in the world,\u201d saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?CLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it\u2019s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care.And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...COOPER: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: ... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...COOPER: Your time is up.CLINTON: ... you may not be able to have insurance because you can\u2019t afford it. So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That\u2019s not going to work.COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want \u2014 just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything\u2019s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.COOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare...TRUMP: By the way...COOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare. You\u2019ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you\u2019re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?TRUMP: We\u2019re going to be able to. You\u2019re going to have plans...COOPER: What does that mean?TRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it means. You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out \u2014 once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...COOPER: Are you going \u2014 are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?TRUMP: President Obama \u2014 Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said \u2014 he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work.But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we\u2019ll also be able to help people that can\u2019t get \u2014 don\u2019t have money because we are going to have people protected.And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We\u2019re going to block grant into the states. We\u2019re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: ... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.RADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.QUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I\u2019m one of them. You\u2019ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re first.TRUMP: Well, you\u2019re right about Islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that \u2014 because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.And, you know, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. If they don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible \u2014 these are radical Islamic terrorists.And she won\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name. But the name is there. It\u2019s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I\u2019ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.I want to say just a couple of things. First, we\u2019ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\u2019ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.CLINTON: My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.It\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see.It\u2019s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.Mr. Trump, in December, you said this. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\u201d Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?TRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me..RADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe... TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.RADDATZ: I do.TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her?RADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?TRUMP: It\u2019s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That\u2019s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children \u2014 think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\u2019d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\u2019re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he\u2019s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It\u2019s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.TRUMP: That\u2019s not been debunked.CLINTON: So, please...TRUMP: That has not been debunked.CLINTON: ... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.TRUMP: I was against \u2014 I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn\u2019t have. Well, I just want to say...RADDATZ: There\u2019s been lots of fact-checking on that. I\u2019d like to move on to an online question...TRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.RADDATZ: She did not.TRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?RADDATZ: Very quickly, please.TRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\u2019t want them. In some cases, they\u2019re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don\u2019t want them.And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that\u2019s OK, we can\u2019t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to force them right back into their country. They\u2019re murderers and some very bad people.And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen.ICE just endorsed me. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn\u2019t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It\u2019s a horrible thing she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.CLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great \u2014 I thought a great display of presidential leadership.But, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out.We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.CLINTON: Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\u2019t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...RADDATZ: We\u2019re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re out of time.CLINTON: ... with the Russians and other foreign powers.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because \u2014 so ridiculous. Look, now she\u2019s blaming \u2014 she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things \u2014 WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t...(LAUGHTER)OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\u2019s the good thing. That\u2019s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\u2019s a big, big difference. We\u2019re talking about some difference.But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\u2019t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\u2019t know Putin.But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are \u2014 she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know \u2014 I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have \u2014 first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her \u2014 took massive deductions.I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But \u2014 but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great.RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.COOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?QUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, one thing I\u2019d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States \u2014 she was a United States senator.She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.But \u2014 and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.We\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving \u2014 massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.But we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important \u2014 one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?CLINTON: Well, everything you\u2019ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do.But I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.Now, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year \u2014 and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know \u2014 will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.CLINTON: And we\u2019re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.COOPER: Thank you. I want to give you \u2014 Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she\u2019s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You\u2019ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?TRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.COOPER: So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?TRUMP: A lot of my \u2014 excuse me, Anderson \u2014 a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she\u2019ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That\u2019s why.See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that\u2019s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and it\u2019s extremely complex \u2014 Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest.But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won\u2019t mention their names, because they\u2019re rich, but they\u2019re not famous. So we won\u2019t make them famous.COOPER: So can you \u2014 can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?TRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it\u2019s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she\u2019s given it to us.Hey, if she had a problem \u2014 for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She doesn\u2019t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it\u2019s all talk and no action.COOPER: In the past...TRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She\u2019s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they\u2019re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.COOPER: Secretary \u2014 I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, here we go again. I\u2019ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that\u2019s not the point here.TRUMP: Why didn\u2019t you do it? Why didn\u2019t you do it?COOPER: Allow her to respond.CLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.TRUMP: Oh, really?CLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That\u2019s exactly right.TRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective \u2014 if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t interrupt you.CLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \u201c30 years this and 30 years that.\u201d So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I\u2019m very glad to do so.Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.COOPER: Thank you, secretary.CLINTON: I\u2019ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I\u2019ve produced results for people.COOPER: Thank you, secretary.RADDATZ: We\u2019re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.TRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...RADDATZ: No, we can \u2014 no, Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to go on. This is about the audience.TRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world\u2019s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.So this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn\u2019t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.CLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.Russia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...CLINTON: No, I wasn\u2019t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...TRUMP: OK. But you were in contact \u2014 excuse me. You were...CLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.TRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore.Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\u2019ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\u2019re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\u2019m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\u2019s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\u2019s been a disaster.But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\u2019t there, but possibly she\u2019s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\u2019s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\u2019s only one problem. You don\u2019t even know who the rebels are. So what\u2019s the purpose?RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.TRUMP: And one thing I have to say.RADDATZ: Your two minutes is up.TRUMP: I don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president...(LAUGHTER)... what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.TRUMP: OK. He and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.RADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?TRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it\u2019s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn\u2019t.RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?TRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?TRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can\u2019t they do it quietly? Why can\u2019t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we\u2019ve knocked out the leaders, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we\u2019re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they\u2019re saying? How stupid is our country? RADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.TRUMP: I can\u2019t think of any. I can\u2019t think of any. And I\u2019m pretty good at it.RADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.TRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have \u2014 look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can\u2019t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How \u2014 why would these people stay there? I\u2019ve been reading now...RADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.TRUMP: ... for weeks \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it\u2019s the harbor of where \u2014 you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying \u2014 they\u2019re not staying there anymore. They\u2019re gone. Because everybody\u2019s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can\u2019t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we\u2019re doing in the Middle East.RADDATZ: I\u2019m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?CLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don\u2019t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is a smart strategy.I do think the use of special forces, which we\u2019re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...RADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?CLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I \u2014 if I\u2019m fortunate...TRUMP: Everything.CLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn\u2019t.There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders \u2014 and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones \u2014 made a difference. So I think that could help.I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there\u2019s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.RADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to move on...TRUMP: You know what\u2019s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her. When I go one second over, it\u2019s like a big deal.RADDATZ: You had many answers.TRUMP: It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really very interesting.COOPER: We\u2019ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?QUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?COOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I\u2019ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn\u2019t say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she\u2019s lied about a lot of things.TRUMP: I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what\u2019s happening to our inner cities. She\u2019s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn\u2019t get it done.Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don\u2019t get it done. You go into the inner cities and \u2014 you see it\u2019s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, and I\u2019ve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can\u2019t get any worse. And she\u2019s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing\u2019s going to ever happen.Let me tell you, if she\u2019s president of the United States, nothing\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She\u2019s not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others\u2019 favors, she\u2019s doing me favors.COOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.TRUMP: But I will tell you, she\u2019s all talk. It doesn\u2019t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.COOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?TRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.COOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos \u2014 one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have a place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s 10 years old now. This is the only one country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear \u2014 in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.COOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president.COOPER: Your two minutes is up.CLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are, quote, \u201cdeplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\u201d You later said you regretted saying half. You didn\u2019t express regret for using the term \u201cdeplorables.\u201d To Mr. Carter\u2019s question, how can you unite a country if you\u2019ve written off tens of millions of Americans?CLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It\u2019s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he\u2019s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said \u2014 I\u2019m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.COOPER: Thank you.CLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.TRUMP: ... but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.COOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.TRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that\u2019s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her \u2014 and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they\u2019re irredeemable, you didn\u2019t mention that, but when she said they\u2019re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.COOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.TRUMP: She\u2019s got tremendous \u2014 she\u2019s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting with her.COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn\u2019t have it, quote, \u201che or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?TRUMP: No, there wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.COOPER: You mentioned sex tape.TRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn\u2019t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...COOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?TRUMP: ... 600 \u2014 wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But she said she\u2019ll be awake. Who\u2019s going \u2014 the famous thing, we\u2019re going to answer our call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens \u2014 Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that.Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?CLINTON: No.TRUMP: I\u2019m shocked to hear that.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Well, it\u2019s not only my opinion. It\u2019s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it\u2019s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it\u2019s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent.And it\u2019s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you\u2019ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.And I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.COOPER: We have to move along.CLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to...CLINTON: Five million homes were lost.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re moving.CLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We\u2019re almost out of time. We have another... TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929.RADDATZ: We\u2019re moving to an audience question.TRUMP: It is \u2014 our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you.(LAUGHTER)We have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.QUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?RADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Thank you. Well, you\u2019re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\u2019t agree with that.I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\u2019t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.I want a Supreme Court that doesn\u2019t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\u2019re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\u2019t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\u2019ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You\u2019re out of time. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I\u2019m looking for judges \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They\u2019ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in \u2014 of my money, meaning I\u2019m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she\u2019s doing. What I ask is this.So I\u2019m putting in more than \u2014 by the time it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We\u2019re raising money for the Republican Party, and we\u2019re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.I ask Hillary, why doesn\u2019t \u2014 she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn\u2019t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don\u2019t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?It\u2019s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\u2019t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You\u2019ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you\u2019ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren\u2019t you putting money into your own campaign? I\u2019m just curious.CLINTON: Well...(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to get on to one more question.CLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you.RADDATZ: We have \u2014 we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.CLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.COOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?QUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?COOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?TRUMP: Absolutely. I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our \u2014 buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.We are killing \u2014 absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\u2019m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable \u2014 we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.I will bring our energy companies back. They\u2019ll be able to compete. They\u2019ll make money. They\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.You take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace.COOPER: Your time is up. Thank you.TRUMP: It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.CLINTON: And actually \u2014 well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.You know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business \u2014 you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition.We\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.But I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them.COOPER: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.COOPER: Your time is up.CLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.COOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more...RADDATZ: We have...COOPER: One more audience question.RADDATZ: We\u2019ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.QUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?CLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that\u2019s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.So I believe that this election has become in part so \u2014 so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had.And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of my children. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job, and they\u2019ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.I will say this about Hillary. She doesn\u2019t quit. She doesn\u2019t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She\u2019s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she\u2019s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.RADDATZ: Thanks to both of you.COOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.RADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Auto Shop Owners Forced Out of Willets Point Struggle to Rebuild in the Bronx", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byMario Chasi stood in the middle of one of the 45 corrugated steel stalls that line the former warehouse in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx where he hopes to re-establish his body shop.Mr. Chasi, a heavyset auto mechanic, is a refugee from Willets Point, Queens, a ramshackle colony of auto repair, muffler, glass and tire shops next to Citi Field. In 2013, he was among a group of business owners and mechanics evicted from the area, with its broken streets and potholes as big as a bathtub, to make way for a planned redevelopment.While the project has been stalled in court, Mr. Chasi and more than three dozen other former inhabitants of Willets Points have struggled for more than two years to convert the warehouse where he was standing last week into an auto mart of sorts called the Sunrise Cooperative.But with the construction nearly complete, Sunrise ran out of money, and filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 23. The cooperative\u2019s last, best chance is that New York City will come to the rescue with additional financing.\u201cI find it hard to think about what will happen if Sunrise doesn\u2019t open,\u201d said Mr. Chasi, who immigrated from Ecuador 15 years ago and started Cuenca Auto Body, with three employees. \u201cI want to open as fast as possible. I\u2019m ready to work. It\u2019s the last hope.\u201dCity officials said that Sunrise, which has already received more than $7 million in relocation funds, had asked for another $3 million to pay old bills, finish construction and cover its initial operating costs. But the officials were noncommital about whether more money would be forthcoming.\u201cWe have worked in good faith for years to help the co-op get onto firm footing,\u201d said Anthony Hogrebe, a spokesman for the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. \u201cWe are staying in close contact with them to understand their needs, and the cause of the overruns.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that the city\u2019ll continue to work with Sunrise to have a worker-owned cooperative in the Bronx,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will set the model for keeping low wage businesses together, even after their neighborhood has been rezoned.\u201dCity officials regarded the 62-acre auto repair enclave as an eyesore whose dusty streets flooded when it rained, but Willets Point was home to about 225 mostly Latino-owned businesses and 1,700 workers who earned anywhere from $80 to $140 a day.Those kinds of industrial, blue-collar jobs have not fared well amid the city\u2019s rising tide of luxury housing and gentrification over the past 20 years.\u201cThere\u2019s no institutional commitment in the city to preserving industry,\u201d said Tom Angotti, a professor of urban affairs and planning at Hunter College. \u201cBut it\u2019s been shown time and again that diverse economies are more resilient.\u201dThe Sunrise Cooperative also sued the city, settling in 2015, after the city agreed to provide the group with $5.8 million to move collectively to the Bronx warehouse.Marco Neira, president of Sunrise, said the group wanted to replicate the critical mass of auto-related businesses at Willets Point that had attracted customers who knew they could find a good deal by hunting from shop to shop for the best price.Mr. Neira said he wanted to avoid what happened to printers in Manhattan, many of which failed after being forced to leave the printing district around Canal and Hudson Streets in the 1990s. Some relocated to Long Island City, where they are being forced out by development again.\u201cAll the printers in the buildings around me have been told to get out in the next year,\u201d said Howard Weinstein, president of Candid Litho Printing, which moved to Long Island City 10 years ago and is moving again, possibly out of the city. \u201cThe number of apartment buildings going up here is out of control.\u201dMembers of the Sunrise Cooperative said that their building in Hunts Point \u2014 and industrial section close to the Interstate 278 that is home to the city\u2019s produce and fish markets \u2014 is unlikely to face the same sort of gentrification.The price of converting the property has soared because of delays and the cost of constructing in accordance with building and fire codes. Sunrise has exhausted its own money as well as $7.6 million in city relocation financing. Sunrise estimates that it needs another $2 million to pay outstanding bills and finish construction and $1 million more for operating costs in the first year.Former Willets Point business owners like Mr. Chasi and Jorge Molina, who owned the House of Shocks, often set up shop in front of the now-vacant Iron Triangle shops with compressors, tool bags and spare parts piled into the back of pickup trucks or vans.\u201cI have some customers, maybe 100, waiting for the shop to open,\u201d said Robert Aguilar, who immigrated to New York from Mexico and owned Veterans Auto Repair. \u201cIn a good year, I made $70,000. I had been looking to buy a house. But now: nothing. What money there is goes for food and rent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuelans Take to Streets to Oppose President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans dressed in white and chanting \u201cThis government will fall!\u201d poured onto the streets of Caracas and other cities on Wednesday to demand a referendum to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.Opposition leaders, addressing protesters massed along the capital\u2019s broad main highway, promised to increase the pressure on Mr. Maduro\u2019s left-wing government with a 12-hour general strike on Friday.\u201cThis government has lost the most important thing, and that is what we have today: the people,\u201d said Henrique Capriles, a two-time presidential candidate and leader of the Primera Justicia Party. \u201cGentlemen of the government, we are giving you a deadline.\u201dThousands of demonstrators rallied in many other Venezuelan cities. In M\u00e9rida, 73 people were injured during a clash between protesters and the police, M\u00e9rida\u2019s mayor, Carlos Garc\u00eda, said. Armed groups created to protect the government were also involved in the fighting.A police officer was shot and killed during a protest in the state of Miranda, the interior minister, N\u00e9stor Reverol, said Wednesday night.If the government does not allow the referendum to go forward, the opposition parties said they would lead a march to the presidential palace next Thursday.The protest was a powerful display of unity from the opposition, which has responded with fury to the decision last week by Venezuela\u2019s Electoral Council to suspend the process for organizing a recall referendum.The council\u2019s ruling, which halted the collection of voters\u2019 signatures needed to initiate the referendum, was a sharp break with the government\u2019s commitment until now to holding elections.\u201cThis is a dangerous new phase,\u201d said David Smilde, a scholar of Venezuela at Tulane University and a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cI think the government last week really changed the game.\u201d\u201cApparently they see this as a safer line of resistance than going forward with the referendum,\u201d he added.Mr. Maduro has described the referendum drive as a coup against his elected government. Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Venezuelans, scrambling to find food and medicine in a collapsing economy, would vote to remove Mr. Maduro.\u201cThe right does not want dialogue because they want a coup and foreign intervention,\u201d Mr. Maduro said before a small crowd of red-shirted supporters gathered outside the presidential palace on Wednesday. \u201cBut here there will be no coup nor intervention.\u201dMr. Maduro has responded to the opposition\u2019s activism with calls for dialogue, which opposition leaders believe is a bid to wait them out. Mr. Maduro met on Wednesday with leaders of the different branches of government, which are all firmly under his party\u2019s control, with the exception of the National Assembly.Photos in a Twitter message by Mr. Maduro\u2019s spokesman highlighted the empty chair reserved for Henry Ramos Allup, the opposition president of the National Assembly, who was at the protest instead of at Mr. Maduro\u2019s meeting.\u201cI am not going to attend this theater, this farce,\u201d Mr. Ramos said.The opposition has instead unified around street protests. The challenge will be to \u201ctake this outpouring and channel it into a sustained movement on the streets,\u201d Mr. Smilde said. In the past, rivalries among opposition leaders have made it difficult for them to come together on a strategy. \u201cThey are underperforming given the level of discontent,\u201d he said.That discontent was on full display as people streamed to the protest on Wednesday morning.\u201cEnough of this regime, which puts obstacles to everything,\u201d said Vanessa Furtado, 45, a schoolteacher from the poor neighborhood of Las Minas de Baruta. \u201cThere is no security, no economic or work stability. Maduro is scared. The solution here is electoral, it\u2019s all we have.\u201dElliot Manuel P\u00e9rez Medina, a college student, was disappointed that the opposition put off marching to the presidential palace on Wednesday. As he spoke, a group of armed government supporters began to surround his group of protesters. \u201cWhy are we going to talk with people who always put a gun to our head and always repress us?\u201d he asked.But not everybody who wanted to attend the protest could do so.Miurka Castillo, 47, said she suffered from seizures; this year the shortages were so severe that she cannot find the medicine she needs; she spent the morning bartering flour for three pills. \u201cNobody wants to go more than me,\u201d she said. \u201cI need this government to leave. I think that would change things.\u201dAna Vanessa Herrero reported from Caracas, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "MailChimp and the Un-Silicon Valley Way to Make It as a Start-Up", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtATLANTA \u2014 The typical start-up fairy tale goes something like this: You begin with young entrepreneurs from Stanford or Harvard who have come up with some novel idea for disrupting restaurants or dog walking or whatever else.After creating a prototype, the guys (they are almost always men) enter start-up boot camps like Y Combinator, recruit a group of early investors, and perhaps launch a Kickstarter with a slick video. If the initial plan succeeds, the founders go into heedless expansion mode, which usually means selling off huge chunks of their company in exchange for gobs of money from venture capitalists. Then, after a few years, if all goes according to plan, they hit the big time \u2014 an initial public offering and a chance to be the next face of the future.Well, sometimes. What\u2019s often left out of the start-up dream story is any mention that there\u2019s another way.In fact, it\u2019s possible to create a huge tech company without taking venture capital, and without spending far beyond your means. It\u2019s possible, in other words, to start a tech company that runs more like a normal business than a debt-fueled rocket ship careening out of control. Believe it or not, start-ups don\u2019t even have to be headquartered in San Francisco or Silicon Valley.Under the radar, slowly and steadily, and without ever taking a dime in outside funding or spending more than it earned, MailChimp has been building a behemoth. According to Ben Chestnut, MailChimp\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, the company recorded $280 million in revenue in 2015 and is on track to top $400 million in 2016. MailChimp has always been profitable, Mr. Chestnut said, though he declined to divulge exact margins. The company \u2014 which has repeatedly turned down overtures from venture capitalists and is wholly owned by Mr. Chestnut and his co-founder, Dan Kurzius \u2014 now employs about 550 people, and by next year it will be close to 700.As a private company, MailChimp has long kept its business metrics secret, but Mr. Chestnut wants to publicize its numbers now to show the road less traveled: If you want to run a successful tech company, you don\u2019t have to follow the path of \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d You can simply start a business, run it to serve your customers, and forget about outside investors and growth at any cost.There are downsides to this approach. MailChimp\u2019s path was circuitous, and it came without the glory of enormous funding rounds. But it is also suffused with a basic common sense.\u201cOne of the problems with raising money is it teaches you bad habits from the start,\u201d said Jason Fried, the co-founder of the software company Basecamp, who has written frequently on the perversions of the venture capital industry. \u201cIf you\u2019re an entrepreneur and you have a bunch of money in the bank, you get good at spending money.\u201dBut if companies are forced to generate revenue from the beginning, \u201cwhat you get really good at is making money,\u201d Mr. Fried said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a much better habit for a business to work on early on, to survive on their own rather than be dependent on money people.\u201dFor MailChimp, these lessons didn\u2019t have to be learned \u2014 they were simply a necessary part of running the business. \u201cThe whole point of this business is to prove to small businesses that you can do this, because we did it,\u201d Mr. Chestnut said.MailChimp is run out of two sprawling floors in the Ponce City Market, a massive complex in Atlanta\u2019s Old Fourth Ward neighborhood that was originally built as a Sears Roebuck warehouse. \u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s cool and vintage, but it\u2019s actually a neat reminder of disruption,\u201d Mr. Chestnut said. \u201cSears used to be the biggest thing, and then it went away.\u201dOn a recent visit, I found all the trappings of start-up life seen in countless offices in the Bay Area: Stylish d\u00e9cor, kitschy accents (there are paintings and sculptures of MailChimp\u2019s logo, a chimp named Freddie, all over), and zany conference room names. The walls of MailChimp\u2019s boardroom are covered from floor to ceiling in vintage skateboards, which Mr. Kurzius collects. Get it? It\u2019s a \u201cboard room.\u201dMailChimp wasn\u2019t always this fancy. Mr. Chestnut and Mr. Kurzius founded the company in 2000, at the crest of the dot-com bubble, after they had gotten laid off from corporate web design jobs. They used their small severance checks to start a firm they called the Rocket Science Group, which offered design consulting for large and small businesses in Atlanta.Late in 2000, some of those customers started asking for ways to reach their customers by email. Mr. Chestnut thought he could repurpose some old code he had used to create a failed online greeting card business. One of his old greeting cards featured a drawing of a chimp, so he thought he would call the new email service ChimpMail, but the domain name was taken. So he went with MailChimp.For years, the pair ran the email service as a side project to the main web design gig. Around 2006, they began to grow wary of web design; the business was growing, but not very quickly, and they weren\u2019t passionate about it.What Mr. Chestnut and Mr. Kurzius were passionate about was helping small businesses grow. They had both been raised in entrepreneurial families \u2014 Mr. Chestnut\u2019s mother ran a salon out of her kitchen, and Mr. Kurzius\u2019s father was a baker whose business was forced to close after Wonder Bread moved into town \u2014 and they thought that maligned as it was, email presented a low-cost marketing channel for companies on small budgets. In 2007, they stopped doing web design and focused exclusively on MailChimp.At the time, MailChimp faced a host of larger and better-capitalized rivals, including Constant Contact, which went public late in 2007. But Mr. Chestnut said MailChimp had a proximity to its customers that its competitors lacked. Because MailChimp was itself a small business, it understood what those businesses wanted out of their marketing tools. Its offerings were cheaper, it added features more quickly, and it allowed greater customizations to fit customers\u2019 needs.Though Mr. Chestnut insists that he isn\u2019t worried about the longevity of email \u2014 people have been predicting its death for years, and email just keeps getting more important \u2014 the company is also pushing into other channels, including social media. The next phase of MailChimp, he said, is to become a one-stop shop for the entirety of a small business\u2019s marketing needs.Its future is far from assured \u2014 new modes of communication like voice and text messaging could undermine email, and there is always the threat of some large platform like Facebook or Google building a rival to MailChimp. Still, to Mr. Chestnut, MailChimp\u2019s future is more secure if he and Mr. Kurzius control the company, rather than run it at the behest of outside investors.\u201cEvery time we sat down with potential investors, they never seemed to understand small business,\u201d Mr. Chestnut said. Venture capitalists always wanted MailChimp to serve \u201centerprise companies,\u201d large businesses with thousands of employees and, potentially, thousands to spend.\u201cEverybody we talked to said, \u2018You\u2019re sitting on a gold mine, and if you pivot to enterprise, you could be huge,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chestnut said. \u201cBut something in our gut always said that didn\u2019t feel right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rare New Jersey Swing District, House Race Becomes a Brawl", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byRIDGEWOOD, N.J. \u2014 With a barrage of negative ads and copious outside spending, the congressional race in a crescent of Norman Rockwell-style suburbs and tidy rural villages in northern New Jersey represents one of the region\u2019s most bare-knuckle political fights.The Fifth Congressional District, extending across North Jersey from the Delaware River to the Hudson River, is the state\u2019s one potential swing district, with roughly the same number of voters registered in each party, making it a tempting target for Democrats hoping to cut into or even overcome the Republican majority in the House of Representatives in a topsy-turvy political year.In the past, Mr. Garrett, who wields considerable influence as a member of the Financial Services Committee and the chairman of its Subcommittee on Capital Markets, has handily dispatched Democratic challengers, repelling their attacks on his conservative positions and mores.But he has never faced a rival as well financed as Mr. Gottheimer, who has been helped by his deep connections within the Clinton circle and his experience in the corporate and technology worlds.Through the end of September, Mr. Gottheimer had received contributions of almost $4 million, roughly double the nearly $1.9 million in contributions to Mr. Garrett\u2019s campaign.And perhaps more than in other years, Mr. Garrett has provided plenty of ammunition to his opponent.Last year, Politico reported that Mr. Garrett had irked fellow Republicans when he refused to pass on donations to the National Republican Congressional Committee because of its support for gay candidates.Mr. Garrett, a conservative Christian, is also a longtime opponent of same-sex marriage, and takes a strict stand against abortion.Mr. Gottheimer has hammered him over those positions and a series of seemingly ideologically motivated votes in Congress, many of them reflecting a strong fiscal conservatism.He points to, among others, Mr. Garrett\u2019s vote against an enormous spending bill that contained funding to assist emergency medical workers who fell ill after the Sept. 11 attack at the World Trade Center.The charges have resonated and forced Mr. Garrett onto the defensive.In a telephone interview, Mr. Garrett said that he supported assistance to the emergency medical workers but objected to other elements of the huge spending bill it was included in, leaving him the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote against it.And he called the reports that he had opposed gay candidates \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u201cI support anyone\u2019s right to run for public office,\u201d he said. \u201cI support my fellow Republican candidates.\u201dHe faulted Mr. Gottheimer for raising the issue, saying it distracted from other topics important to voters, including job creation, the economy and security issues.\u201cThis is something that came up over a year ago and my opponent has used it just to lie,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cThis lie and other lies and they just continue to be spread, whether he advertises on TV or billboards or hires an airplane to spread his lies. It\u2019s really outrageous.\u201dMr. Gottheimer said that his opponent\u2019s votes and positions are fair game.\u201cThe Tea Party extremism does not reflect the values of our district,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said. \u201cIf you want to get things done we\u2019ve got to get rid of the obstructionists.\u201dMr. Gottheimer has benefited from hefty spending by super PACs, fueled partly by reaction to Mr. Garrett\u2019s conservative positions. They include the Democratic Party-aligned House Majority PAC and the National Association of Realtors Political Action Committee. Mr. Garrett has pushed to end the federal government\u2019s role in supporting the mortgage market through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants, a stand opposed by the Realtors group.Voters have been bombarded by ads, mailings and campaign phone calls.\u201cAt least 50 percent of the time my phone rings it\u2019s something related to the election. Gottheimer. Garrett. And I get Trump calls all the time,\u201d said Karen Abraham, who was watching her two children play in a school playground in this suburb. Most of the television ads were negative, Ms. Abraham said, adding, \u201cIt makes you glaze over after a while.\u201dThe harshest salvo has come from Mr. Garrett, in a television ad that resurrects a 2007 lawsuit, filed by a woman in Washington, who claimed she was mistreated in the condominium building where she lived, and where Mr. Gottheimer was on the board.The ad accuses Mr. Gottheimer of assaulting the woman, harassing her and forcing her to move.Court papers and interviews with two of the lawyers involved in the case tell a different story. The lawsuit, which was eventually withdrawn without a settlement, describes an episode in the building\u2019s lobby in which Mr. Gottheimer allegedly raised his voice and wagged his finger in the woman\u2019s face, an encounter described as an \u201cassault.\u201d\u201cThere was nothing to any of these allegations,\u201d said Richard F. Silber, a lawyer who represented another person named in the lawsuit. \u201cThe allegations were that he wagged his finger at her. Who brings a lawsuit about that?\u201dThe district is the only one in the state with relative parity between the two political parties. It has roughly the same number of registered Democrats and Republicans among voters, about 140,000 in each party, according to the New Jersey Division of Elections. About 216,000 registered voters in the district do not have a party affiliation. Here, as elsewhere, the outcome of the undercard may depend in part on how voters react to the bitter presidential contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.While some Republican leaders have rejected Mr. Trump, Mr. Garrett has not wavered; he has said he will vote for him, including after hearing Mr. Trump\u2019s recorded statements about groping women\u2019s genitals.\u201cAs a father, as a husband, I said at the time that I\u2019m outraged by the statements and disagree with him vehemently,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cAt this point in time, though, we have to look at the issues and we cannot have a continuation of failed foreign policy and failed economic policy and that\u2019s what Hillary Clinton will bring about.\u201dMr. Gottheimer has received some surprising endorsements.Meg Whitman, a Hewlett-Packard executive and Republican fund-raiser who has been outspoken in her opposition to Mr. Trump, endorsed Mr. Gottheimer. Ms. Whitman backed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey for president before he dropped out of the Republican nomination contest and endorsed Mr. Trump.Mr. Gottheimer has also received the endorsement of the New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association, a response to Mr. Garrett\u2019s vote against the budget that included aid for World Trade Center emergency medical workers.Mayor Harry Shortway of Vernon Township, a Republican, said that he had previously voted for Mr. Garrett, but that after meeting with both candidates he had decided to endorse Mr. Gottheimer, who seemed to him more responsive to the township\u2019s needs. It was turned down when it sought a federal grant to pay for a new fire truck, he said, and Mr. Gottheimer had pledged to help get the financing.\u201cI don\u2019t see the federal tax dollars coming back into the area,\u201d Mr. Shortway said.Advertisement"}

The Mechelse Cemani is commingling in one section with American Wyandotte hens, named for a Native American tribe that once populated the lower Great Lakes.Their offspring make up the 20th generation of the Cosmopolitan Chicken, what Mr. Vanmechelen calls the Mechelse Wyandotte, on view in another part of the coop. Surrounding the animals are mixed-media works by the artist, including a family tree of the Cosmopolitan Chicken.Until now, Mr. Vanmechelen\u2019s chickens have been raised solely as art. They die natural deaths, and then some are transformed by taxidermy into sculptural objects, as in the rooster poised at the hilt of a 12-foot-long steel sword at the entrance to the Detroit show. But the artist and the gallery\u2019s founder, Gary Wasserman, wondered how they could justify taking chickens only as art to Detroit, a city of such enormous economic and nutritional need.Addressing these real-life issues, they have started a collaboration, the Planetary Community Chicken, a mating of the 20th-generation Cosmopolitan Chicken with an industrial hen to produce food for sale.Some of their chicks are running around a pen in the backroom of the gallery and will start producing eggs next spring in their future home at the nearby Oakland Avenue Urban Farm. It is one of some 1,400 agricultural ventures that have sprung up in the empty lots of Detroit, where foreclosed homes have been torn down. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the installation project and delivering it into the hands of the community, where we\u2019re actually doing something that is not a token activity,\u201d Mr. Wasserman said. \u201cIt is art meeting agriculture meeting science meeting social science meeting economy.\u201dWilliam and Jerry Hebron, the married couple who run the farm and sell food to their neighbors from their backyard, as well as at farmers\u2019 markets, have never dealt with livestock but were game to try. \u201cIt\u2019s another way of making money for us, and the community is going to love it,\u201d said Mr. Hebron, who helped his wife start the farm in 2008 because the area \u201cdidn\u2019t have a place to buy a tomato or cucumber.\u201dWill the Planetary Chicken lay good eggs? Olivier Hanotte, a livestock geneticist and professor at the University of Nottingham in England, said, \u201cIt will, of course, and I hope Koen will give me some to taste.\u201dFor several years, Mr. Hanotte has used genetic samples from the artist\u2019s birds for his research into the diversity of local chickens versus wild ones. With the Cosmopolitan Chicken\u2019s more diverse immune system, \u201cwe can predict they will be better fit to respond to a large spectrum of pathogens,\u201d he said. \u201cInbreeding is never good when you\u2019re talking about disease resistance.\u201dMr. Vanmechelen has achieved what scientists have not, he added. \u201cThis continuous experiment, doing years and years of breeding, would have been impossible to put into practice in a world where scientific grants run from three to five years at the most,\u201d he said. \u201cKoen wasn\u2019t constrained by those things.\u201d In 2011, Mr. Vanmechelen founded the Open University of Diversity, which invites specialists from different fields to exchange ideas.Jill Silverman van Coenegrachts, former managing director of the Lisson Gallery in London, discovered Mr. Vanmechelen during his first living art installation in 2000 at Storm Centers in Watou, Belgium, for which he crossbred the Mechelse Koekoek, native to Belgium, with the French Poulet de Bresse. She then arranged for him to breed this first-generation Cosmopolitan Chicken with the English Redcap in an exhibition at her gallery that year. \u201cKoen doesn\u2019t see the borders between anything,\u201d she said.In 2014, Ms. van Coenegrachts, now an independent curator, took Mr. Vanmechelen\u2019s work back to London in \u201cDarwin\u2019s Dream\u201d at St. Pancras Church. There, along one corridor, she installed a kind of fashion show of blown-up portraits of generations of the Cosmopolitan Chicken. \u201cYou were confronted with very beautiful six-foot-tall chickens looking at you in the eye, the way a chicken looks at another chicken,\u201d she said. \u201cKoen\u2019s work creates a big shift in your head, in how we position ourselves with other things that are alive around us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementOctober 25, 2016Matthew RojanskyKathryn StonerDonald Trump, defending his peculiar admiration of Vladimir Putin, has declared as though it were his own idea, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if actually got along, as an example, with Russia?\u201d In fact, it has been nice \u2013 for the United States and for Russia, and it has happened many times over the last 30 years. The United States and the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev signed the most sweeping arms reduction agreements in history. Under Russia\u2019s first president, Boris Yeltsin, Russia entered the Group of 8 with American support and joined peacekeeping forces in Kosovo, while the United States supplied aid to the Russian economy. When Yeltsin\u2019s successor Vladimir Putin came into office in 2000, the relationship between Russia and the United States continued to be relatively close, although relations soured over NATO expansion and the invasion of Iraq. Still, in his first administration, Putin was the first foreign leader  to express condolences to President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks, and vowed to help the United States in its war on terrorism. Under Putin\u2019s successor (and then predecessor), Dmitri Medvedev, and the tenure of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, a \u201creset\u201d in relations resulted in the New Start Treaty, further reducing nuclear weapons, and on the Northern Distribution Network, which enabled supplies to flow through Russia into Afghanistan for U.S. efforts there, and the American support of Russia\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization.But when Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, cooperation with the U.S. ended. It was not the U.S. that declared game over, it was Trump\u2019s friend. As the long history of cooperation demonstrates, there is no structural reason Russia and the U.S. cannot get along. They have and did for over 30 years. It was Putin\u2019s offer of asylum to rogue U.S. security contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, followed by his unanticipated demand that the U.S. Agency for International Development leave Russia the same year, harassment of the U.S. ambassador and other embassy officials since, and finally his seizure of Crimea in Ukraine in 2014 and support of a low boil conflict in eastern Ukraine that ended cooperation. The next U.S. president will inherit not a \u201cRussia problem\u201d but a Putin problem, which makes Trump\u2019s position not only odd, but dangerous. The current U.S. approach to Russia has failed.  Moscow is ostensibly isolated and subject to sanctions.  Yet it has not appreciably changed its course on Ukraine or Syria; instead it is escalating and broadening the conflict via nuclear saber rattling, cyber attacks and information warfare.  Meanwhile it has re-established considerable influence throughout the Middle East, the former Soviet region, and even East Asia and Latin America.  What is to be done?First, we need to stop obsessing over Putin.  Our problem is with Russia.  Putin stands in the mainstream of a centuries-old Russian foreign policy tradition and worldview and he enjoys broad elite support and popular consent for his policies.  Any approach premised mainly on \"being tough\" with Putin (as Hillary Clinton promises) or on charming him into making a deal (as Trump does) misses the point entirely. Second, we need to stop pursuing policies with the expectation either that Russia will change into a friendly democracy or that it can be fully defeated and sidelined.  Neither is remotely likely in the foreseeable future.  Instead, we need an approach to engaging Russia that extracts the best balance of cooperation and competition from across a web of interrelated issues.  How we deter Russia in the Baltic will influence how hard Russia pushes in Syria, just as how we frame a deal on Ukraine and sanctions relief will shape Russia\u2019s options for energy and economic engagement, whether with China and Iran, or with U.S. allies in Europe and East Asia.Finally, we need to re-establish dialogue.  Not for its own sake, but as an indispensable tool for advancing our national interests.  Closing the door on previously established bilateral channels was a mistake, yet another case of the \"we talk to reward good behavior and don't talk when we disagree\" syndrome in U.S. diplomacy.  When Washington declares it will no longer talk to Russia about Syria, that doesn't change the reality that Russia holds the keys to stopping the humanitarian catastrophe and re-launching negotiations aimed at a durable settlement.  When we seek to impose diplomatic isolation, it creates an incentive for the Russians to raise the risk level \u2014 such as with near-miss incidents at sea and in the air \u2014 until we are forced to talk.Most of all, we need coordination and consistency on our side.  The worst kind of policy is the kind that every official, politician and analyst understands differently.  The next president will need a trusted senior figure to serve as the main channel between the White House and the Kremlin.  That job is needed when relations are going well just as much as when they are going badly.Matt raises some important issues, but the problem isn\u2019t structural and isn\u2019t, therefore, about Russia, as much as it is about Russia\u2019s current leader and the situation in which he has put himself and his countrymen. As the past examples of U.S.-Russia cooperation I provided initially demonstrate, working together to mutual benefit has not always been the problem that it is now. The relationship has, of course, been troubled at times, but there is lots of blame to go around. It is a mistake to point the finger exclusively at the United States and a purported misunderstanding on the part of American policy makers of Russia\u2019s vital \u201chistorical\u201d interests. We have understood those interests pretty well over time and often supported them \u2013 including supporting Russian membership in the World Trade Organization and the G-8, and working closely with Russia to come to an agreement with Iran over its nuclear program even as it helped the brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad stay in power in Syria.Focusing on Putin is not \u201cobsessing,\u201d as Matt puts it. Gennady Zyuganov, the longtime head of the Russian Communist Party recently noted in a meeting of newly elected parliamentarians that the current Russian president can exercise \u201cmore power than that of the general secretary of the Soviet Union.\u201d That was not true of any previous presidents of Russia \u2013 not Boris Yeltsin, whom the Russian Duma attempted to impeach; and not Medvedev, who was reliant for his support and legitimacy on his prime minister, Putin. Thus, the authority within his country that Putin has amassed is not structural; it is personal. Civil society organizations are effectively banned from political expression. Therefore, the next U.S. president must focus on Putin since our best information is that he has made his own interest in staying in power and maintaining the system he has built in the last 16 years is what dominates Russia\u2019s foreign policy choices at the moment.\nWould it be \u201cnice\u201d if Russia and the United States could cooperate?  Maybe.  It depends entirely on the purpose of that cooperation, and how it fits into a broader balance of interactions that advances our national interests.  Cooperation itself is not a valid foreign policy goal, just as friendship between the leaders in Moscow and Washington is not an end in itself.So, while it is absolutely true that Vladimir Putin has declared \u201cgame over\u201d on U.S.-Russia cooperation, what matters far more is that U.S. policy toward Russia is now preoccupied with shaming, pressuring and outmaneuvering Putin, instead of addressing the fundamental drivers of an increasingly dangerous conflict with Russia.  No U.S. policy can effectively decide for Russians whether Putin stays or goes, nor can U.S. pressure predictably influence what Putin, or any other Russian, thinks and says.  So it makes sense to deal instead with the concrete problem of what must be done where U.S. interests and Russian interests interact.Where Washington and Moscow\u2019s goals are complementary, as on nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism, cooperation is clearly desirable.  Yet, as Russia\u2019s recent withdrawal from the Plutonium Disposition Agreement and its skipping of President Obama\u2019s Nuclear Security Summit illustrate, the overall balance of relations may be such that one or both sides prefer not to cooperate, even when it might be in their interest to do so.One way not to solve the problem is to continue our focus on cooperation as a search for good conversations with Russia about areas of ostensible agreement, while putting off hard but necessary conversations about our persistent disagreements.  Unfortunately, the Obama Administration\u2019s \u201creset\u201d succumbed to exactly this pattern.  There should be no doubt that by 2012, Vladimir Putin had embraced harsh anti-Americanism as a central theme of his orchestrated return to the Kremlin.  But by that same time, positive conversations about cooperation on Afghanistan, arms control and trade had also run out of steam.  What remained were persistent disagreements over NATO, Russia\u2019s treatment of its own citizens and the post-Soviet space, especially Georgia and Ukraine.  These disputes had been left to fester, often developing into domestic political wedge issues, so that their champions on both sides had an easy time derailing and displacing what remained of the cooperative \u201creset\u201d agenda.Rather than marshaling reasons why the collapse of U.S.-Russia cooperation is mostly Vladimir Putin\u2019s fault, we should ask whether applying a different mix of diplomatic, economic and security instruments in our disagreements with Russia, such as over Ukraine and Syria, might produce a different outcome \u2014 one in which both Russians and Americans saw their interests advanced through cooperation.Russia is enabling the slaughter in Syria, occupies part of Ukraine and threatens action in the Baltic region. But would it still make sense for the United States to try to deal more closely with Russia?"}
{"Headline": "Granting Shares for Fares: An Uber Rival\u2019s Play for Drivers", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byPrototypeWhen Kathleen Boylan walked into an orientation meeting last spring for a new ride-hailing company called Juno, held at its 1 World Trade Center office, she liked what she heard. Ms. Boylan, a New Jersey mother of two teenagers, had been driving for Uber and Lyft since last year, and while she appreciated the flexibility of the work, she wanted to earn more money.So when she learned that Juno would take only a 10 percent commission on her fares, as opposed to the at least 20 percent collected by Uber and Lyft, and that she would be able to receive tips through the Juno app, she signed right up. (Currently, Lyft allows for tipping through its app, and Uber, which says tipping is optional, does not.)Another big draw for Ms. Boylan was Juno\u2019s promise of equity ownership. Its founders have set aside a pool of restricted stock for drivers that they say is equal to their own shares.This means that the more fares Ms. Boylan picks up, the more Juno shares she might be able to earn. Bonus shares go to drivers who pull in the most in fares.Gett came out against surge pricing, an Uber practice in which fares rise during periods of high demand. Curb lets riders hail taxis either by hand or via its app, and then pay for them with the app. Lyft is perceived as a less corporate option, using the tagline \u201cLyft is your friend with a car, whenever you need one.\u201d And Juno\u2019s approach is to promise drivers a supportive corporate culture and a larger cut of its business.The founders had conducted informal research, hitting the streets of New York to talk to Uber drivers about their experiences. They said they detected a morale problem. \u201cIf somebody can treat them better, they\u2019ll jump ship,\u201d Mr. Marco concluded.Their next step was to ask riders whether they, too, would be amenable to hopping over to a new company. The answer was yes, Mr. Marco said. \u201cAs long as the ride-sharing company can provide a quality of service, there\u2019s no problem,\u201d Mr. Marco said he and his Juno co-founders discovered.Then they spent a month devising what he refers to as a \u201cmini constitution,\u201d a philosophy and a set of principles the company would apply to its drivers. These include respect, kindness, fairness and transparency. Their theory was that happy drivers would make for satisfied customers.Mr. Sundararajan sees Juno\u2019s equity offer as a message of inclusiveness to its drivers. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u201cYou are one of us. You\u2019re a part of us,\u201d he says.Every quarter, Juno allocates restricted stock units to its drivers. The first allocation was in July, and the company announced on its Facebook page that its top-rated driver earned 29,673 stock units. (\u201cFinally drivers are getting some respect,\u201d one commenter wrote.)The stock units vest when drivers accept fares for 120 hours a month for 24 out of 30 months. They can cash in the units if the company is sold or goes public.\u201cThousands of drivers are asking me, \u2018When is Juno coming to my city?\u2019\u201d Mr. Campbell said.But the equity possibility aside, Juno\u2019s strategy may not be drastically different from that of Lyft, which has always been driver-focused, according to Alexandra LaManna, a Lyft spokeswoman.\u201cWhen we launched it was all about the driver because normal everyday people were driving,\u201d Ms. LaManna said. \u201cWe try to treat people better. It\u2019s not something we\u2019re doing to respond to another company. It\u2019s just what we do.\u201dLyft drivers have long been able to retain their full fares if they pick up a certain number of rides a week, in that way increasing their earnings. One new Lyft initiative, instituted at its drivers\u2019 behest, is an instant-pay option that lets drivers cash out their earnings at any time rather than waiting a week for payment.Uber, which says it is committed to its drivers, introduced a similar program a few months later.\u201cCompetition means that we have to demonstrate Uber offers more stable, reliable opportunities to earn money than the alternatives,\u201d Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman, wrote in an email. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we are focused on: ensuring that Uber is the best experience for drivers across the world.\u201d (The company would not comment further on the record.)Uber and Lyft recently opened help centers in some cities where drivers can ask questions of company representatives. At Lyft, they can also use the restroom and congregate during breaks.And last month Uber started a retirement savings account program for its drivers.One of Uber\u2019s major advantages is its huge corps of drivers. In New York alone, Uber has 35,000; worldwide, there are 1.5 million. More drivers means shorter wait times for riders, stoking a cycle of demand for Uber cars.Yet some drivers remain optimistic that Juno can compete. Even though Ms. Boylan is frustrated that the company doesn\u2019t yet do airport pickups and wonders what the value of the stock units will actually be, she is willing to be patient because she thinks drivers eventually will get paid more than they are now.Until Juno ridership increases, Ms. Boylan says she will often need to travel long distances to pick up passengers, typically an undesirable prospect for drivers. But she can live with that.\u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018O.K., this is my business,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMy ability to suck it up is going to make this business work better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When It Comes to Tax Avoidance, Donald Trump\u2019s Just a Small Fry", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byDealBookNot paying taxes \u201cmakes me smart,\u201d Donald J. Trump said last week. His surrogates called him \u201ca genius\u201d for his recently revealed tax avoidance strategies.Well, if they are right, the executives running corporate America are absolute virtuosos.And, yes, it is all legal.The immediate response from many readers may be ire for the companies avoiding taxes \u2014 or for Mr. Trump. But that\u2019s not the goal of this particular column. In this case, that kind of thinking may even be counterproductive.Instead, the study \u2014 which notes that 58 Fortune 500 companies would owe $212 billion in additional federal taxes, \u201cequal to the entire state budgets of California, Virginia and Indiana combined,\u201d if they were taxed properly \u2014 should be a five-alarm call to voters and lawmakers to finally fix the tax system. If all the attention on Mr. Trump\u2019s tax bill (or lack of one) isn\u2019t enough to inspire a complete rewrite of the tax code, this study may be.Maybe it is to be expected. Companies and individuals complain bitterly that taxes are too high and the rules too complicated, but many corporations and the wealthiest members of our society have found ways to make the tax code work for them.If all the Fortune 500 companies paid taxes on their sheltered profits, the researchers tallied, the government would receive a whopping $717.8 billion windfall. To put that number in context, the 2015 federal budget deficit was $438 billion. However, fixing our corporate tax system alone isn\u2019t the answer to reducing our red ink; it might only be a drop in the bucket given that our total federal debt is nearing $20 trillion.The researchers reported that Apple holds $214.9 billion offshore and would owe $65.4 billion in taxes if that money came back to the United States; Nike holds $10.7 billion offshore and would owe $3.6 billion in United States taxes; Goldman Sachs holds $28.6 billion offshore, and the report says the company \u201creports having 987 subsidiaries in offshore tax havens, 537 of which are in the Cayman Islands despite not operating a single legitimate office in that country, according to its own website.\u201dRather than moralize about whether it is patriotic to pay taxes \u2014 which seems to be a rather polarizing question these days \u2014 let\u2019s focus on understanding exactly how companies keep money offshore and find an appealing way to bring back that money to help spur our economy and create jobs for those without them and higher incomes for those who do.In the absence of any disclosures from Mr. Trump, The New York Times and other news outlets have attempted to fill in the gaps.Perhaps not surprisingly, it\u2019s hard to figure out exact numbers for money stored abroad because there is so little transparency in how offshore profits are reported. So, the first element of making a better tax system is simply creating a more transparent way to report offshore profits so policy makers aren\u2019t in an information vacuum.Here\u2019s just one example of the problem: The Securities and Exchange Commission \u201conly requires that companies report all \u2018significant\u2019 subsidiaries, based on multiple measures of a subsidiary\u2019s share of the company\u2019s total assets. By only requiring significant rather than all subsidiaries, this allows companies to get away with not disclosing many of their offshore subsidiaries and creates the potential for gaming because avoiding disclosure simply requires splitting a significant subsidiary into several smaller subsidiaries,\u201d the report says.It also points out that \u201cthe penalties for not disclosing subsidiaries are so light\u201d that it is very likely that companies choose to muddle the numbers and consider the potential for being fined simply the cost of doing business.The challenge of transparency is exemplified by this finding: \u201c27 companies reported 16,389 total subsidiaries and 2,836 tax haven subsidiaries to the Federal Reserve, while only reporting 2,279 total subsidiaries and only 410 tax haven subsidiaries to the S.E.C.\u201dHow is that possible?It isn\u2019t because these companies are lying to the S.E.C. (at least, not that we know about). It is because the S.E.C. has been so vague about the definitions of a subsidiary that it\u2019s almost laughable. All agencies should require the same definitions; the Federal Reserve, for example, is much tougher.Once we have the actual information, we need to figure out what to do with it. No doubt, companies in the United States \u2014 and frankly any business that benefits from our markets \u2014 should pay some form of taxes. (Having said that, there are some economists who argue that corporate taxes should be very little or nothing at all \u2014 assuming that individuals and shareholders then pay more.)Citizens for Tax Justice advocates a litany of rules to end the deferral of foreign income, stop tax inversions and remove loopholes like inconsistent guidelines that allow companies to tell \u201cone country that a subsidiary is a corporation while telling another country the same entity is a partnership or some other form.\u201dThese are laudable goals. How we resolve the disgraceful patchwork of tax rules and loopholes remains an open question. Democrats want policies that create more revenue, and Republicans want policies that create less revenue in the immediate term (they want lower tax rates and suggest that such rates would spur the economy and therefore ultimately create more revenue).Whatever the ultimate resolution, whoever ends up being the next president has the chance to be considered a true \u201cgenius\u201d if he or she tackles the issue in a meaningful and sensible way.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about tax avoidance, using information from a study by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund and Citizens for Tax Justice, misidentified the location where Goldman Sachs was reported to have 537 offshore subsidiaries. It is the Cayman Islands, not Bermuda.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election May Be a Turning Point for Legal Marijuana", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 To the red-and-blue map of American politics, it may be time to add green. The movement to legalize marijuana, the country\u2019s most popular illicit drug, will take a giant leap on Election Day if California and four other states vote to allow recreational cannabis, as polls suggest they may.The map of where pot is legal could include the entire West Coast and a block of states reaching from the Pacific to Colorado, raising a stronger challenge to the federal government\u2019s ban on the drug.In addition to California, Massachusetts and Maine both have legalization initiatives on the ballot next month that seem likely to pass. Arizona and Nevada are also voting on recreational marijuana, with polls showing Nevada voters evenly split.The passage of recreational marijuana laws in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington over the past four years may have unlocked the door to eventual federal legalization. But a yes vote in California, which has an economy the size of a large industrial country\u2019s, could blow the door open, experts say.\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, it\u2019s the beginning of the end of the war on marijuana,\u201d said Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California and a former mayor of San Francisco. \u201cIf California moves, it will put more pressure on Mexico and Latin America writ large to reignite a debate on legalization there.\u201dThe market for both recreational and medicinal marijuana is projected to grow to $22 billion in four years from $7 billion this year if California says yes, according to projections by the Arcview Group, a company that links investors with cannabis companies.\u201cThis is the vote heard round the world,\u201d said Arcview\u2019s chief executive, Troy Dayton. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen before has been tiny compared to what we are going to see in California.\u201dAnd yet scholars who have studied these legalization measures say that to a large extent they are very much a shot in the dark, a vast public health experiment that could involve states that hold 23 percent of the United States population \u2014 and generate a quarter of the country\u2019s economic output \u2014 carried out with relatively little scientific research on the risks. In addition, there are 25 states that already permit medical marijuana.To hear proponents of legalization in California tell it, a yes vote here would allow the same benefits seen in Colorado \u2014 a sharp reduction in drug arrests and a large increase in tax collection \u2014 but on a scale many times larger.After years of resistance, proponents say their long-sought goal is finally within reach.\u201cMy ultimate objective is to get this plant into the hands of every single human being on the planet who needs it \u2014 and in my view that\u2019s everybody,\u201d said Steve DeAngelo, the founder of Harborside, a medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland that bustles with clients taking advantage of a medical marijuana law that has been in place for two decades.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a religious spiritual thing,\u201d Mr. DeAngelo said. \u201cMother Nature gave us this healing plant.\u201dJennifer Tejada, the chairwoman of the law and legislative committee of the California Police Chiefs Association, says she is not against legalization but argues that the measure is ill thought out.California should first develop laws to determine when a marijuana user is too impaired to drive, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s like putting a 12-year-old behind the wheel of a car and saying, \u2018Go for a drive!

But Ms. Tejada says the police in California no longer make arrests for possession or use of small amounts.\u201cGo to any county jail and find someone who is in there for possession of marijuana,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened for two decades.\u201dThe ballot initiatives in California and elsewhere are written \u201cin a way to maximize business potential without seriously considering the public health impact,\u201d Professor Glantz said. Legalization lowers arrests, but \u201cthis is exchanging a criminal justice crisis for a public health crisis,\u201d he said.A number of recent studies, while acknowledging the limits of research under the federal ban, warn that marijuana\u2019s harmful effects \u2014 especially on adolescent development, to the cardiovascular system and to fetuses \u2014 have been understated.Proponents of legalization play down the potential dangers of marijuana, saying generations of people have used it in what they describe as a real-time experiment for harmful effects. \u201cPeople die from alcohol every day,\u201d said Adam Bierman, a co-founder and the chief executive of MedMen, a cannabis investment firm. \u201cPeople don\u2019t die from marijuana.\u201dMr. Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, concedes that legalizing marijuana has many challenges, among them staving off the prospect of powerful marijuana monopolies and keeping what he termed a \u201cdangerous drug\u201d out of the hands of children.\u201cIt\u2019s on us to prove we can do this responsibly,\u201d he said. \u201cI grant that there are those who don\u2019t believe we are up to it.

{"Headline": "12 Questions We\u2019d Like to Hear at the Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byThe questions New York Times correspondents would like to hear:Do you favor increasing or reducing Social Security benefits? If so, how would you do it?More than 60 million people each month receive Social Security benefits totaling more than $74 billion. Polls show that retirement security is a top concern for Americans. Fewer people can count on traditional pension benefits, and some people do not have retirement savings.Mr. Trump has said he would not cut Social Security benefits. Mrs. Clinton wants to make Social Security more generous for widows and for those who take time out of the paid work force to care for a child or a sick family member. She has said she would require the wealthiest Americans to pay higher taxes.But an aging population is a driver of rising government debt and of a budget deficit that climbed last fiscal year after several years of decline.What three steps would you take to improve Medicare?The aging of baby boomers and the increase of medical costs will squeeze the health insurance program, which now covers 57 million older Americans. Medicare trustees say the hospital insurance trust fund could be exhausted in 2028 if no changes are made to existing law.Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump say Medicare should be able to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies. Mrs. Clinton has proposed allowing people ages 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare, but has not said how the government or the new beneficiaries would pay for the coverage. ROBERT PEARSince 2012, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children have registered with the government under President Obama\u2019s executive order that gives them work permits and guarantees they will not be deported. Will you honor those guarantees? Frustrated by Republicans\u2019 refusal to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system, Mr. Obama used executive authority to provide opportunities for millions of law-abiding immigrants who are in the country illegally. But the Supreme Court has blocked some of his plan, and the next president will have the power to reverse the rest.The war in Syria has created a huge migrant crisis. What is the appropriate level of migration from Syria that the United States should allow, and how would you guarantee that those coming into our country from a region struggling with terrorism do not mean us harm?The United States has confronted these questions throughout its history: How open should its borders be to those fleeing oppression and violence? Mr. Trump dramatically proposed barring all Muslims, and later amended his idea to propose \u201cextreme vetting\u201d for anyone from countries like Syria or Libya, where extremism is rampant. Mrs. Clinton has accused her rival of xenophobia. She has said the United States should expand the number of Syrians allowed entry. The future flows of migrants from Syria and other hot spots will probably be determined by the outcome of the presidential contest. MICHAEL D. SHEARThe economy has grown slowly in recent years, and one reason is a prolonged slump in productivity growth. What steps would your administration take to encourage innovation and investment?Modern prosperity was created by a huge increase in worker productivity. As the output of the average worker increases, so does the standard of living. But in recent years, that engine has been sputtering. Since the deep recession of 2008, labor productivity in the United States has increased by just 1 percent a year \u2014 less than half the annual pace since 1947. At the current pace, our standard of living will double once every 70 years, instead of doubling once every 30 years.Around seven million men ages 25 to 54 are neither working nor looking for work. How would you help prime-age men who are sitting on the sidelines of the American economy?In an earlier generation, they might have found jobs in factories or other blue-collar occupations. Now they spend, on average, almost six hours a day watching television.Economic growth is an incomplete corrective. Many nonworking men are ill equipped for the jobs that are available. Federal regulations, or restrictions on immigration, might induce employers to offer better pay and benefits. Restrictions on the availability of federal benefits might induce men to look for work. BINYAMIN APPELBAUMAnd the next president will very likely face additional vacancies, as Justice Stephen G. Breyer is 78, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is 80 and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83.Mrs. Clinton, if you are elected, will you urge the Senate to confirm Mr. Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, in its lame-duck session? Will you renominate him?Mrs. Clinton\u2019s statements may reflect a strategic calculation in a game of constitutional chicken. By hinting that she would nominate someone more liberal and younger than Judge Garland, who is 63 and generally viewed as a moderate, she may be prodding the Senate to act.How would you respond to Russia\u2019s recent aggression, from Ukraine to Syria to the hacking of the Democratic Party?The United States and the European Union have already imposed significant economic sanctions on people and businesses close to President Vladimir V. Putin in retaliation for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its role in destabilizing Ukraine. Mr. Obama gambled that Mr. Putin\u2019s adventurism in Ukraine and Syria would eventually backfire for Russia. But there is little evidence that Russia\u2019s military entanglements have eroded Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity.Mr. Obama has argued, with some justification, that confronting Russia militarily in Ukraine would be a losing battle, since Ukraine means much more to Russia than it does to the United States. In Syria, a more aggressive American military presence would risk a clash with Russian warplanes. The Obama administration has hinted that it will respond to Russia\u2019s hacking with covert action, potentially a cyberattack of its own. But it is not clear that this would be enough to stop the Russians from a strategy they believe has produced dividends.How would you differ from Mr. Obama in your handling of the Syrian war?Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s inaction in Syria, although they differ radically on the proper prescription for a war that has lasted more than five years and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Part of the problem is setting priorities: Should the United States continue to call for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad when it is also trying to uproot the Islamic State from Iraq and Syria?Syria has become a proxy war for a multitude of players \u2014 Russia, Iran, Turkey and the Persian Gulf states \u2014 each with its own competing and overlapping interests. The trick for the next president is to find a solution that will end the killing and somehow win the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the many actors with interests in Syria. MARK LANDLERMr. Trump, you have repeatedly made false claims during the campaign. Mrs. Clinton, you have been less than forthright about classified emails. How do you assure Americans that you will be honest and truthful?Many Americans have already concluded that both candidates are liars. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton need to show that they have strategies for moving beyond that deeply held impression.Both of you have a demonstrated record of putting your personal financial concerns first \u2014 Mrs. Clinton, with your speaking fees and accusations over suspect commodities trades, and Mr. Trump, with your trail of business failures that left others with the bill. How can people be assured that you can separate your own interests from the decisions a president must make?Both candidates are extremely wealthy, with a web of family finances that could be influenced by executive branch decisions. They need to explain to the public how they can separate the two and make decisions without consideration to themselves. CARL HULSEAdvertisement"}

Although the opposition controls the country\u2019s congress, Mr. Maduro and his allies dominate all the other institutions of government, including the courts and the electoral commission.Mr. Maduro, blamed by many Venezuelans for the country\u2019s economic collapse, has described the recall effort as a coup attempt.\u201cWe put up with abuses and we asked the people for patience, but they have crossed the line,\u201d said a furious Mr. Capriles, who is typically more measured in his public remarks. In a show of unity, he was surrounded by the leaders of other opposition parties.The electoral commission based its decision, announced late Thursday, on rulings by four regional courts that had accepted challenges to the validity of signatures that were collected earlier in the referendum process.At the same time, a court ordered eight opposition leaders, including Mr. Capriles, to remain in the country.The opposition was preparing a three-day campaign beginning Wednesday to gather the nearly four million signatures required to trigger the referendum, roughly 20 percent of voters.Instead, Mr. Capriles called on Venezuelans to begin a \u201cnational mobilization\u201d that day. \u201cWe said it, if they take away the right of the people, we were going to take Venezuela,\u201d he said.But he was short on specific proposals, promising only a special legislative session on Sunday.There was urgency to the referendum schedule. A majority vote, if the referendum to remove Mr. Maduro had been held this year, would have forced a new presidential election. Delaying it until next year would mean that Mr. Maduro\u2019s vice president would serve as president until 2019.As the electoral commission announced its decision, Mr. Maduro left for a Middle East tour to bolster support for oil production cuts that could raise prices.Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, a researcher at the Center for Development Studies at the Central University of Venezuela, said the commission had heightened the country\u2019s political conflict.\u201cThe government kicked the chessboard over, and now we\u2019re in another game,\u201d she said.Patricia Torres reported from Caracas and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great American Stagnation", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byYou\u2019ve probably heard the notion that Americans are no longer confident their children will enjoy better living standards than they themselves do.

Education isn\u2019t a perfect dividing line, but it\u2019s a meaningful one: People with a four-year college degree have generally enjoyed rising living standards.They make more money and have a larger net worth on average than their parents. They live longer. They get divorced less often. They enjoy access to information, culture and entertainment that would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Unless they are a straight white Protestant man, they suffer less discrimination.Some of this same progress applies to less educated, lower-income families. But much of it does not. They are poorer than they were a few decades ago. They are less likely to be part of a family with two parents under one roof. They are far more likely to face criminal charges at some point.

{"Headline": "Next Big Tech Corridor? Between Seattle and Vancouver, Planners Hope", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Seattle and Vancouver are like fraternal twins separated at birth. Both are bustling Pacific Northwest coastal cities with eco-conscious populations that have accepted the bargain of dispiriting weather for much of the year in exchange for nearby ski slopes and kayaking and glorious summers.Yet 140 miles of traffic-choked roads and an international border divide the two cities, keeping them farther apart than their geographic and cultural identities would suggest.Now the political, academic and tech elite of both cities are looking for ways to bring them closer together, with the aim of continuing the growth of two of the most vibrant economies in North America.\u201cVancouver has a lot more in common with Seattle than we do with Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, anywhere else in our country,\u201d Christy Clark, the premier of British Columbia, said in an interview. \u201cWe should make the most of those cultural commonalities.\u201dWhether their grand vision of a \u201cCascadia innovation corridor\u201d \u2014 which borrows its name from the region\u2019s Cascade mountain range \u2014 ever materializes, leaders on both sides of the border have motives for getting cozier immediately. American tech icons like Microsoft, with voracious needs for global engineering talent, are expanding their Vancouver offices, partly because of Canada\u2019s smoother immigration process.For its part, Vancouver wants to bring more American technology companies to the city in hopes of spinning out future entrepreneurs who will expand its comparatively small base of technology companies.\u201cWe have San Francisco real estate prices with the incomes of somewhere between Reno and Nashville,\u201d said Andy Yan, acting director of the city program at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.On the thrumming streets of downtown Vancouver, signs of the Seattle region\u2019s growing economic ties to the city are hard to miss. A rectangular glass and steel office building with a large Microsoft sign occupies nearly an entire city block, sitting atop a large Nordstrom store (another Seattle brand).Microsoft says it invested $120 million in its new offices in Vancouver, which opened in June, and expects to spend $90 million more annually on wages and other operating costs. It plans to employ nearly 750 people in the city.Microsoft is hiring Canadians for the facility, but the country\u2019s more open immigration policies were an important factor in its investment, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in an interview. Microsoft and other tech companies have long complained that the United States education system does not produce enough computer science graduates, forcing them to rely on immigrants from India, China and elsewhere.Foreign workers in the United States can wait about three times as long for a work visa as those in Canada do, the Boston Consulting Group estimates. And the prospect of Donald J. Trump winning the presidency has raised concerns among tech companies, because of the Republican candidate\u2019s comments about further restricting immigration to the United States.\u201cRight now, there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty about open immigration,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Last month, officials and executives from both cities huddled in a Vancouver hotel to discuss how to enable people, ideas and capital to flow more freely between them, as heedless of the international border separating the cities as a pod of orcas swimming in the sea.At the Cascadia conference, Ms. Clark and Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, signed an agreement to deepen the ties between Vancouver and Seattle, including more research collaboration between the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and Satya Nadella, its current chief executive, talked about globalization and education.One proposal to deal with traffic between Vancouver and Seattle was for a high-speed rail line that would whisk travelers at more than 200 miles an hour between the cities in 57 minutes (it can take four hours or more by car). The details on financing the project \u2014 which could cost an estimated $30 billion or more \u2014 have not been worked out.With roots in timber and shipping, Vancouver\u2019s economy has diversified in recent decades with the growth of film and video game production. The city claims a tech \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 a start-up valued at over $1 billion \u2014 in Hootsuite, which makes social media tools.But Vancouver remains a relative small fry in tech, with about $1.78 billion in venture capital flowing into local tech start-ups in the last decade, compared with about $8.9 billion in Seattle, the research firm Pitchbook estimates.The housing market is showing signs of cooling off, though it is not yet clear how much of that is because of the tax. The total number of homes sold in the area in August dropped 26 percent from a year earlier and price growth has slowed, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.Dennis Pilarinos, chief executive of Buddybuild, a Vancouver maker of developer tools for mobile apps, says affordability has been less of a problem for young tech workers, who may be willing to rent smaller apartments and live with roommates. But when start-ups get bigger, many struggle to recruit senior executives with families, said Mr. Pilarinos, who previously worked for Microsoft and Amazon in Vancouver.\u201cCompanies tend to run into scaling issues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou end up with fewer Microsofts or Amazons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He knew he needed out.\u201cI didn\u2019t hate it with a burning passion,\u201d Mr. Schickel, 26, said of his white-collar days, which he left in November 2015. \u201cI was good at my job. I did very well. But it didn\u2019t really excite me. The question was, \u2018When I die, do I want to have spent 50 years of my life sitting in an office?\u2019 The answer was no.\u201d\u201cThere are some people who are perfectly happy working in the office,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you see that for others, the morning walk to the office felt like a boulevard of broken dreams.\u201d\u201cThe most important distinction, whether you work with your hands or in an office, is whether the job involves using your own judgment or not,\u201d said Dr. Crawford, who fabricates parts for custom motorcycles when he is not writing or researching. \u201cYou can\u2019t have this separation from thinking to doing.\u201cIn the assembly line, you dumb the work down to where everyone can do it. And the logic of separating thinking from doing has seeped into a lot of white-collar work, too. To remain engaged, you have to be using your mind, and that\u2019s certainly true when you\u2019re diagnosing a machine like a mechanic does. Nothing is really routine.\u201dBy all measures, Evan Lundy was a success. After earning an undergraduate degree and a law degree at the University of Mississippi, he started working at the Jackson, Miss., office of a national firm handling bankruptcy cases for large banks.The hours were long. Worried about deadlines, he said he rarely slept through the night.\u201cThe repetitive practice of anything in the extreme leads to dissatisfaction,\u201d Mr. Lundy said. \u201cI think that is the killer for someone who is career minded \u2014 doing the same thing over and over, without hope of moving up to something bigger.\u201dIn his dwindling spare time, he built things; for instance, a toy chest. Almost immediately after he posted a photo of it on Instagram, he sold it. He found himself spending more time making furniture and selling it on Etsy or around Jackson.Mr. Lundy, 33, who had a wife and two children to support, believed he didn\u2019t have the luxury to turn his hobby into something more until he ran into a childhood friend who built furniture and made custom curtain rods. After learning of Mr. Lundy\u2019s passion and his longing to escape the office, the friend offered a solution: If Mr. Lundy could install drapery 50 percent of the time, he could earn enough money to devote the other half to building furniture.Mr. Lundy made the break this past May. While his close friends and especially his wife understood, many at the law firm did not.\u201cI hang drapes,\u201d Mr. Lundy said. \u201cI make service calls. I go back and I build furniture. In high school, I would have never said that was what I would want to do, down the road. But as you mature, your priorities change.\u201dIn the late 1990s, Kevin Tyschper heard the call of the \u201cnew economy.\u201d He held positions in areas like \u201cnetwork planning\u201d and \u201cinventory management\u201d at a series of corporations.In 2007, Mr. Tyschper started going to culinary school in the evenings. This meant driving an hour from his home in suburban Naperville, Ill., to Chicago three nights a week for a year. The class lasted from 6 until midnight.By 2009, he was spending more and more time baking. At first, he did it for family and friends. Then came a Facebook page and a website, and a business developed through word of mouth. Just when it seemed he would have to make a choice between his day job and his passion, the company that employed him left town.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like to work long hours, this is not the business to be in,\u201d Mr. Tyschper, 43, said. \u201cIt\u2019s constant movement. We make everything by hand here, too. It\u2019s not like we pull something out of the freezer and bake it. You are kneading it, scaling things out, mixing things, deep-panning things, sheeting things. There are times at 6 or 7 at night when you finally sit down and you realize you haven\u2019t sat down in 15 hours.\u201cBut there are tangible results,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen I developed a fiscal forecast, I didn\u2019t always see those results. When I make a loaf of bread, I see the results. I can firmly taste those results.\u201dLandscaping, furniture building and baking can offer a counterpoint to the alienation that may come with many office jobs. Endless days at the computer often leave cubicle workers who were once go-getters giving into the cry of that clerk of yore, Melville\u2019s Bartleby, whose motto was \u201cI prefer not to.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s blue collar, but so what?\u201d said Shawn Kelley, a 42-year-old stonemason in Portland, Ore. He had studied at the University of Hartford and worked as a graphic designer in Northampton, Mass., before being driven mad by the monotony of moving fonts around on a screen and designing restaurant menus.\u201cI was giving myself up all those years to this idea that graphic design was my only choice,\u201d Mr. Kelley said. \u201cI went to college for it. And it really emotionally brought me down.\u201dDuring a long drive in the New England countryside, Mr. Kelley stopped to admire a series of stone walls. He saw the effort that went into them. He liked the idea of taking heavy objects of different shapes and sizes and forming them into a cohesive whole. Soon after that epiphany, he began calling stonemasons, seeing if he might find work.They warned him about the intense physical labor involved with carving stone and fitting it into place. But in 2005, he moved west for a full-time job in the field. Now his workday often begins at a quarry, where he selects what he needs to build stairways, walls and backyard sanctuaries.\u201cI stopped her and said, \u2018Lady, I built this wall,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kelley said. \u201cI had to explain to her that just because I have a broom in my hand right now doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t go to college. The assumption there is that you didn\u2019t have opportunity at some point so you are stuck in a blue-collar situation, that you aren\u2019t smart enough.\u201dMr. Schickel, the landscaper, knows that conversation, that look. But he said it stopped bothering him. \u201cIf I cared what everyone else thinks, I would still be at a blue-chip company and feeling unfulfilled,\u201d he said.Mr. Schickel allowed that there are challenges, both physical and financial. And because his job is seasonal, he\u2019ll have to work construction over the winter.\u201cThere are hard days when you are working labor and you hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way around it, and anyone who has ever worked labor will tell you that. But sometimes it\u2019s nice to come home and your body is aching. You take a shower. You eat food as quickly as you can and you pass out. You wake up sore, and it\u2019s nice. It really is.\u201cYou will be working on a crisp fall day, and the leaves are changing, and you are outside and working hard, and then it\u2019s lunchtime, and you grab your lunch and are lying in the grass, looking at the trees, and it\u2019s a beautiful day and you think, \u2018It\u2019s worth it.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

The German government said flatly that it would not bail out the bank, leading to what some called market \u201cpanic\u201d that Deutsche Bank could face a messy Lehman Brothers-style collapse and set off a global financial crisis.Those fears seem wildly overblown. \u201cThe bottom line is, I think the Deutsche Bank issues will be resolved and there won\u2019t be any contagion episode,\u201d said Hal S.

By the end of September, they had dropped below $12 before recovering slightly. In an ominous reminder of the loss of confidence that plagued Lehman Brothers before its demise, some hedge funds pulled billions in assets from the bank and moved their trading activities to rivals. (The bank noted that this represented a tiny fraction of its more than 20 million clients.)It didn\u2019t help that widespread investor skepticism remained about the health of the European banking system, where many banks are still exposed to high concentrations of sovereign debt from Europe\u2019s weakest economies, or that Deutsche Bank is just the first of several large European banks facing a day of reckoning with the Justice Department.For United States banks, the problems are largely behind them: They have paid over $56 billion since 2010 to settle similar suits.In his letter, Mr. Cryan emphasized that the bank\u2019s balance sheet was more \u201cstable\u201d than it had been \u201cin decades,\u201d and pointed to the bank\u2019s liquidity reserves of 215 billion euros, about $241 billion. Deutsche Bank has already set aside \u20ac5.5 billion for potential settlements and is expected to add a billion or more from the proceeds of sales of the British insurer Abbey Life and its stake in a large Chinese bank.Even if the Justice Department has an exceptionally strong case, it would surely pause before demanding a fine that imperils the viability of Deutsche Bank, let alone the fragile European banking system, which would surely spill over into global markets and the United States economy. Deutsche Bank is far larger and more systemically important than Lehman Brothers was.\u201cThe goal really shouldn\u2019t be to destroy financial institutions,\u201d said Brandon L. Garrett, a law professor at the University of Virginia and author of \u201cToo Big to Jail.\u201d \u201cIt should be to reform them. The proper way to punish corporations is to hold the individuals and executives responsible. Huge fines just punish the shareholders even more and won\u2019t stop the recidivism we\u2019ve seen at Deutsche Bank.\u201d\u201cI think the Justice Department could afford to be a little more lenient with the fine as long as individuals are held accountable,\u201d Mr. Garrett said.A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.Even if the United States maintains an aggressive posture, few think the German government would allow Deutsche Bank to fail, even though it has ruled out any bailout.Should Deutsche Bank precipitate a financial crisis, it\u2019s not clear how it would be resolved. It\u2019s a European bank, so the Federal Reserve\u2019s powers would be limited.\u201cI hope there\u2019s a global game plan,\u201d Professor Scott said, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what it would take. If Deutsche Bank set off contagion, it would start in Europe. Who would be next? This would require global coordination.\u201dShould such a crisis spread to American nonbank institutions, like money market funds, the government has even fewer tools at its disposal than it did after Lehman Brothers failed, thanks to congressional efforts to limit future bailouts. In his book, Professor Scott argues that Congress should give the Fed and other regulators more \u2014 not less \u2014 power to stop runs at banks and nonbanks alike by coming to their assistance and extending deposit guarantees, if necessary, as they did after Lehman Brothers.Despite widespread nervousness about Deutsche Bank\u2019s ultimate fate, nothing so dire seems imminent \u2014 yet.\u201cI don\u2019t think this will develop into anything serious,\u201d Professor Scott said, \u201cbut we need a deal for Deutsche Bank that\u2019s $5 billion or less and not $14 billion, and we need this to happen within a short time frame. The longer this goes on, the more uncertainty there is, and the more nervous the markets get.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Richer but Not Better Off", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisSo it was hardly surprising that the Census Bureau\u2019s report last month of rising family incomes and declining poverty was received as solid proof that the United States has finally pulled through.But the question remains: best for whom? Poorer households did get a bigger raise, proportionally, than the rich did last year. But that looks like a bug, not an enduring feature of the American economy. The data does little to suggest that the American economy has managed to overcome its perhaps most debilitating weakness: inequality.Despite last year\u2019s gains, the bottom 60 percent of households took a smaller share of the income pie than four decades ago. The bottom 20 percent took in only 3.4 percent of all income \u2014 compared with 5.6 percent in the mid-1970s. The richest 5 percent of Americans, by contrast, have done much better for themselves \u2014 taking in about 22 percent of the nation\u2019s income, 6 percentage points more than they did in 1975.America\u2019s inequities can be sliced in different ways. For instance, champions of the nuclear family will underscore the report\u2019s finding that married couples in which both spouses work saw incomes rise by nearly $4,000 last year \u2014 to almost $104,000 at the median, the highest ever.The problem is that the two-earner family is not as iconic as it once was, falling as a share of all families over the past two decades. The families that have been growing are those headed by a single woman. Last year their incomes rose sharply \u2014 to $34,126. Sure, that was a big jump on 2014. But they were still making less than they were 15 years before.How does this count as shared prosperity?Fans of the American flavor of capitalism will surely argue that such inequities are irrelevant now that the floor seems to be rising for everybody. But income isn\u2019t the only way to measure prosperity; by many other metrics, Americans\u2019 well-being remains pretty low. Whether it is life expectancy or infant mortality, incarceration or educational attainment, countless statistics offer a fairly dark picture of the American experience. It is a picture of prosperity that consistently leaves large numbers of Americans behind.The United States suffers the highest obesity rate among the 35 industrialized countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In terms of life expectancy at birth, it ranks 10th from the bottom. America\u2019s infant mortality rate has dropped by half since 1980. Still, today Turkey and Mexico are the only countries in the O.E.C.D. to report a higher share of dead babies. Infant mortality fell faster in almost every other industrialized country.It is worth noting that, if you look only at how much money they make, the citizens of virtually all of these industrialized nations are poorer than Americans.Canadians are 19 percent poorer, but Canadian teenagers easily outscore their American peers in tests of math, reading and science. The French take home 33 percent less. But a French baby born today will be expected to live three and a half years more, on average, than an American one. Income per person in Japan is only two-thirds of what it is in the United States. But Japan\u2019s infant mortality rate is only one-third of America\u2019s.They found that the United States looks substantially less prosperous than when it is ranked by money alone. Americans may be 50 percent richer than the French. But by the new metric they are only 9 percent better off. Income per person in Britain is only 75 percent what it is in the United States. But using the composite indicator, the British are in fact almost as prosperous as Americans.I would argue that even this metric overstates American prosperity. It misses many dimensions of health and the quality of the environment. And, to my mind, it falls way short of accounting for how much damage rampant inequality can inflict on society. Ranked by inequality, the United States surpasses every other advanced nation. The Klenow-Jones approach incorporates it by thinking about how much people would pay to avoid the risk of living in an unequal society, if they might end up on the wrong side of the divide. But inequality could deeply affect well-being in other ways.The United States has perhaps the smallest middle class in the industrialized world: In 2013, just 70 percent of non-elderly American households had disposable incomes between one-half and twice the income of the typical household. In Norway it was 87 percent.This kind of polarization is behind the obesity, the shortened life spans and the dead babies. These are the ills of the Americans left behind.This is not to knock a good year\u2019s worth of income growth. But the prosperity of the United States can hardly be called such when it leaves so many behind. America\u2019s rich are richer than the rich almost anywhere else. Its poor are still poorer than the poor of its peers in the developed world. Can we claim prosperity without closing these gaps?Eduardo Porter writes the Economic Scene column for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sweet-Toothed Egypt Endures a Sugar Crisis: \u2018People Are Going to Snap\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported bySo a weekslong sugar shortage has plunged people into a panic. The sugar crisis, as it is known, has quickly become shorthand for the brewing anger against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s management of the economy and his overall rule.\u201cThe people are going to snap,\u201d Ahmad el-Gebaly said as he turned away customers seeking sugar he did not have at his subsidized-goods store in Bulaq, a working-class neighborhood of Cairo.\u201cNobody can stand him anymore,\u201d he added of Mr. Sisi. \u201cSugar is like rice and oil and wheat. You can never run out of it. You can never mess with it. Who can live without sugar?\u201dSugar is not the only scarce staple, as the plummeting pound has slashed Egypt\u2019s import-purchasing power. Cooking oil disappeared from shelves for a time this year, residents said, as did baby formula, and rice is in low supply. Some people complained that they could not find certain medicines, or that the prices had skyrocketed.These cuts and other actions were \u201cinevitable to save the economic situation,\u201d Mr. Sisi said in a recent interview with a state-owned newspaper. He described the current situation as a \u201cbottleneck\u201d and promised, \u201cWe are on our way out.\u201dBut people are not patient. They are desperate. The official price for sugar is more than 15 cents per pound, up from 6 cents per pound two years ago, and on the black market it goes for triple that. Small shops ran out of sugar weeks ago, and upscale markets are rationing it to one kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, per person.\u201cIt is the worst shortage I can remember in my lifetime,\u201d said H. A. Hellyer, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a research organization based in Washington. \u201cI think what everybody is worried about is a repeat of the 1977 bread riots.\u201dDr. Hellyer was referring to the nationwide protests that followed attempts by Anwar el-Sadat, then the president, to dismantle the subsidy system.It was the only attempt, said Amro Ali, an associate professor of sociology at the American University in Cairo. The subsidies, he added, were untouchable. \u201cIt\u2019s kryptonite,\u201d he said.Ahmed Kamal, an aide to the minister responsible for the subsidies, blamed the private sector, a scarcity of Egyptian hard currency and rising global prices for the sugar shortage. He said that private importers were expected to bring in some of the 800,000 tons of sugar that Egypt must purchase from abroad annually, about a quarter of the nation\u2019s yearly demand for 3.2 million tons, but that the country had fallen short of its goal this year.Mr. Kamal said the problem had been exacerbated by business owners hoarding supplies and by the news media whipping up angst. He added that the government still had a four-month supply of sugar.But little of it was available in Bulaq, the Cairo neighborhood where Mr. Gebaly\u2019s shop was the only subsidized grocery reliably open \u2014 and he mostly turned people away.\u201cAll I say, all day, is: \u2018There\u2019s no sugar, there\u2019s no sugar, there\u2019s no sugar, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Gebaly said, before he was interrupted by a call of another customer asking for sugar. An older man waiting nearby gave up, grumbling: \u201cYou keep saying, tomorrow! Tomorrow!\u201dResidents said that the other six shops in the neighborhood that were licensed to sell subsidized goods had closed to avoid a police crackdown, but that they sometimes opened after hours to sell sugar illegally to small-time confectioners, cafes and people. The subsidy police have already arrested two neighborhood sugar traders, residents said.Sumaya Oweis, 37, said she had stopped making her beloved sweet rice pudding and had cut down on tea. On a recent morning, she smacked her 4-year-old son after he stuck his hand in the sugar bowl. But what was she to do about her husband?\u201cMay God destroy his mother\u2019s house!\u201d Ms. Oweis groaned, slapping her palms to her face. \u201cHe has sugar in everything!\u201dFor Ms. Oweis, like many residents, the sugar shortage came after months of growing hardship. Her husband, an itinerant worker, struggled to make $2 a day, she said. They are eating less because they cannot keep up with rising prices for food, like potatoes, which cost about 26 United States cents a pound now, up from about 5 cents several weeks ago.\u201cI\u2019m losing weight,\u201d she said, pointing to her skinny arms. Her subsidized birth-control pills had disappeared off the shelves for a few weeks this year. When they returned to the market, Ms. Oweis said, the price for a month\u2019s supply had increased to $2 from $1.30.Perhaps the shortage of sugar is somewhat of a blessing, given Egypt\u2019s problems with obesity and diabetes, wrote Mohammed Nosseir, a liberal politician.A teenager tried to make a similar point at Mr. Gebaly\u2019s shop. \u201cI found out why there\u2019s no sugar!\u201d he called out. \u201cSo nobody gets diabetes!\u201d Everybody ignored him.Videos about the crisis have been shared widely on social media.\u201cThey go on TV and they say Egypt is rising,\u201d Mr. Abdou said. \u201cAnd the poor citizen cannot find a kilo of rice on the street.\u201dIn another video, a man set himself on fire in Alexandria, screaming after he set himself alight: \u201cI can\u2019t afford to eat.\u201dMr. Ali, the sociologist, said it was the first public self-immolation since the uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.\u201cIt shows you that the core problems have yet to be resolved,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the United States dollar equivalent of the Egyptian pound on the black market. The pound is worth 6 cents, not 0.06 cents.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Thriller Hinges on an Operative\u2019s Shady Dealings", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Louise Doughty\u2019s excellent new novel is a character study, a glimpse at midcentury American civil rights, a thriller, a meditation on the effects of foreign policy on individuals, a modern love story and a portrait of Indonesian unrest in the 20th century. And throughout it\u2019s an attempt to explain in dramatic terms how someone lacking the zeal of patriotism might choose a life in the detached, pitiless and barely understood profession we call intelligence. If that sounds like a handful, it is. But Doughty has found an ideal vehicle for her wide-ranging interests: a laconic, aging man, born Nicolaas Den Herder but known to colleagues and strangers alike as John Harper.We\u2019ve seen his type before \u2014 the world-weary spook, half-broken by a lifetime of regrets \u2014 but Harper is more than he appears at first glance. He\u2019s also less, which is much to the benefit of the novel. When we\u2019re introduced to him, he\u2019s living in a hut on a hillside with a view of Mount Agung and a misty forest of palm trees, near the Balinese town of Ubud. Other than daily visits from his housekeeper, he speaks to no one and spends hours excoriating himself for some recent professional mistakes in Jakarta. Those mistakes, he believes, have a cost: Once the monsoon rains arrive to cover their tracks, young men with machetes will climb Harper\u2019s lonely hill and butcher him. So he waits. But the skies remain clear \u2014 his life stretches on for another day \u2014 and he makes a fateful trip into town, where he meets Rita, a teacher escaping her own demons. Though he introduces himself as an economist, Harper is in fact a risk analyst, a contractor for Western governments and corporations, and his recent missteps have made him question both his abilities and the course his life has taken.By the time he and Rita develop a romantic relationship, the reader knows that this kind of connection is a rarity for \u00adHarper. He overthinks everything. When she eventually says, \u201cJohn, what happened to you?\u201d we know that the story he tells her is one he might not have ever shared with anyone. The fact that he\u2019s spilling it to someone he barely knows suggests how deep his self-doubt lies.Harper\u2019s personal history, it turns out, is tied closely to Indonesia\u2019s. He was born to a Dutch mother in an internment camp during the brutal Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. Before his birth, his half-Dutch, half-Indonesian father was beheaded by Japanese soldiers \u2014 a story young Nicolaas later used to impress xenophobic schoolmates. As the adult John Harper, he returned to Jakarta in 1965, just before the failed coup against the autocratic president Sukarno, and in time to witness and play a hand in the beginning of the counter-coup against the Communists, which killed hundreds of thousands of people \u2014 many of whom were targeted by lists supplied by the C.I.A. Now, in the late 1990s, after decades behind a desk in Amsterdam, he has been sent back to Indonesia as Sukarno\u2019s successor, Suharto, tries to keep his grip on power during the debilitating Asian financial crisis.\u201cIf you\u2019re an economist,\u201d Rita asks Harper, \u201ccan you explain why the I.M.F. has put $40 billion into this region but the families of my students are still having to mix hard old corn kernels with their rice every morning, so that their stomachs won\u2019t rumble in my class?\u201d\u201cI could,\u201d he answers, \u201cbut you wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201dIt brings to mind a conversation Harper had back in 1965, before the purge, when an Indonesian colleague told him that a bag of rice that would feed a man like him for about two weeks cost 1,000 rupiah.\u201c\u2009\u2018Want to know what the schoolteachers here get paid a month?\u2019\u201cHarper nodded again.\u201c\u2009\u2018Five hundred rupiah.\u2019\u2009\u201dHarper\u2019s response: \u201cWhen rice is that expensive, human beings are cheap.\u201dThirty years later, as Rita insists that times change, Harper has little reason to believe her.In the global economy, these crises spell risk and opportunity. The last thing Western C.E.O.s want is to wake up to discover that the mineral resources their companies have been mining for the past generation have been nationalized. So they hire fortunetellers like Harper, who put their feet on the ground, drink with the locals, bathe in their waters and, sometimes, sleep with them. They go into unstable countries to answer questions. How secure is the president\u2019s position? Will the recent ethnic conflict endanger local staff? Will the rising price of rice undermine gains in the real estate market? And sometimes they do more than answer questions.Harper\u2019s employer, based in Amsterdam, is known only as \u201cthe Institute.\u201d It\u2019s represented by the occasional charming white man whose friendliness Harper \u2014 not quite white enough to blend in with them \u2014 never fully trusts. He\u2019s worked for this operation since he was a young man, and that bloody Indonesian tour in 1965 was his first long-term field mission. That time, however, his client wasn\u2019t a multinational; his client was the C.I.A.Though it deftly navigates the subject, the focus of \u201cBlack Water\u201d isn\u2019t really American hegemony. It\u2019s a boy named Nicolaas, who grows up to become John Harper, a cog in the machine of political and economic domination, a man who will find himself doing things in Indonesia that will haunt him, things whose violent aftereffects will echo down the years. In the novel\u2019s evocative middle section, he takes us back to that man\u2019s beginnings, from his prison-camp birth through his early childhood in 1950s Los Angeles, where he develops an intense love for his adopted grandfather, Poppa, a black civil rights lawyer. Then, after a grim personal tragedy, it\u2019s off to the Netherlands to live with his erratic, alcoholic mother. Here \u00adDoughty seems to be asking another question: What leads a person to choose the kind of life Harper has led?To dive into a culture while spying on it is to have a false sort of life, one that will only be half of what it could be. Your friendships are functional facades, your lovers temporary respites, your home whatever fits into your carry-on bag. The people around you become assets, tools for getting the job done. And the job in Jakarta will take Harper to dangerous \u00adplaces \u2014 places where innocent lives will be violently lost.Doughty allows Harper to give a rich accounting of his childhood scars. And this magnificent portrayal of a childhood perpetually interrupted goes a long way toward excusing the complex, self-\u00adinterested adult who springs from that past. But the reader might wonder (as this one did) if it involves one excuse too many. Does a person need so many tragedies to grow into a man who expects to be murdered as penance? Or could any of us end up being a John Harper?The most virtuous character in \u201cBlack Water\u201d is Nicolaas\u2019s beloved Poppa, who risks everything to save those in need, even strangers. Is he not the one who requires explanation? As much as we pay lip service to helping others, few of us act on our own words. We move through our days preoccupied by our own priorities, self-preservation our North Star. No, the Harpers of the world make sense. The saints among us \u2014 those are the ones who are the hardest to understand.Olen Steinhauer\u2019s latest novel is \u201cAll the Old Knives.\u201d He is the writer and producer of \u201cBerlin Station,\u201d a TV drama that will begin on Epix this month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Economy Was Resilient After \u2018Brexit.\u2019 Its Leaders Learned the Wrong Lesson.", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byPound Foolish?The British pound fell to about $1.24 on Friday from $1.30 a week earlier and continued edging down Monday. Even if you treat a \u201cflash crash\u201d in the pound on Asian markets Thursday night as an aberration \u2014 it fell 6 percent, then recovered in a short span \u2014 these types of aberrations seem to happen only when a market is already under severe stress. (See, for example, the May 2010 flash crash of American stocks, during a flare-up of the eurozone crisis).Sterling, as traders refer to the currency, is acting as the global market\u2019s minute-to-minute referendum on how significant the economic disruption from Brexit will end up being. So what does the latest downswing represent? It\u2019s worth understanding why British financial markets and the country\u2019s economy stabilized quickly after the Brexit vote to begin with.The vote set off a chaotic time of political disruption, especially the resignation of the prime minister, David Cameron, who had advocated for the country\u2019s remaining part of the E.U. Theresa May won the internal battle to become the next prime minister, which was to markets and business decision makers a relatively benign result.Ms. May, the former home secretary, is temperamentally pragmatic. She reluctantly supported remaining in the union. And while she pledged to follow through on leaving it (\u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d she said), she seemed like the kind of leader who would ensure that some of the worst-case possibilities of how Brexit might go wouldn\u2019t materialize. Exporters would retain access to European markets. London could remain the de facto banking capital of Europe. All would be well.Meanwhile, the Bank of England sprang into action to cushion the economic blow of Brexit-related uncertainty. Despite the inflationary pressures created by a falling pound, the bank, projecting loss of jobs and economic output, cut interest rates and started a new program of quantitative easing to try to soften the blow.All of that \u2014 the prospect of \u201csoft Brexit\u201d and easier monetary policy \u2014 helped financial markets stabilize and then rally, and kept the economic damage mild, as the purchasing managers\u2019 surveys show.But in the last couple of weeks, the tenor has shifted.That sets up confrontational negotiations between the British government and its E.U. counterparts. European leaders will be reluctant to allow Britain continued free access to its markets, which the May government wants, without similarly free movement of people across borders.And beyond the substance of the negotiations, the British government has signaled in recent days that it is looking inward, and will be hostile to those who are not British citizens.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.In essence, the confidence that Brexit will not mean Britain is shutting itself off from Europe and the world is starting to dissipate.Then there\u2019s monetary policy. At the same party conference, Ms. May indicated skepticism of the role the Bank of England and other central banks have played in the economy in recent years, saying that while low interest rates and quantitative easing provided necessary help after the financial crisis, \u201cwe have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects.\u201dIn short, after Mr. Carney helped foam the economic runway after the Brexit vote, Ms. May\u2019s comments were the equivalent of complaining about the mess created by all that foam.There\u2019s always going to be some jockeying on both sides in advance of a difficult negotiation, and the sympathetic view to the British government is that it is merely trying to maximize its advantage in hammering out a deal to execute its Brexit.The problem is that staking out that ground means risking the very economic damage that a conciliatory tone and easy money helped avoid over the summer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Hyundai Santa Fe\u2019s Updates Deserve a Look", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byDrivenPITY the shopper considering an S.U.V. or crossover these days. With so many excellent choices, knowing where to begin is vexing.How many rows? Front-wheel or all-wheel drive? How fuel-thirsty is it? Stay brand loyal or get adventuresome?Who gets to choose the paint color?A look at Hyundai Santa Fe is as good a place as any to begin. Yet, even here, Hyundai starts you off with some confusion. There\u2019s the Santa Fe (a three-row rig) and the Santa Fe Sport (a two-row affair with a different design profile that\u2019s powered by a choice of 4-cylinder engines).Both have been updated for 2017, and some 25 percent of the parts have been refined. Most notable are new wheels and fresh fascias front and rear. The interior\u2019s center stack and many under-hood components are new, too.I\u2019m focusing on the Santa Fe, not the Sport.My tester is the luxed-up Limited Ultimate edition that sounds as if it should come with its own chauffeur. It doesn\u2019t. But, in addition to having an extra row of chairs, all of the larger models are powered by a 290-horsepower, 3.3-liter V6 with 252 pound-feet of torque.Choose between front-wheel drive and a $1,750 automatic all-wheel-drive system with lockable center differential. The 6-speed automatic transmission gets manual control on the console shifter.The V6 gives Santa Fe a tow rating of 5,000 pounds and enough pep off the line to set a poor example to any children on board. It\u2019s not Buick-quiet, but road noise is hushed enough that you can overhear the children commenting on your driving style.Those wanting a corner-slaying machine (relatively speaking) should look to Mazda CX-9. Santa Fe is controlled enough with a suspension oriented toward comfort.Steering effort \u2014 which is on the numb side \u2014 can be adjusted, as can throttle tip-in and transmission mapping. The damping rate is fixed to please passengers. This is a good compromise. If you seek thrills, buy a used Miata.Packing all-wheel drive, the Limited Ultimate Santa Fe has an E.P.A.-rated fuel economy of 17 miles per gallon in the city, 22 on the highway, which is pretty much what I saw. Lower trim levels and front-drive models are more fuel-efficient.Other than its $31,695 base price, there\u2019s another reason to choose the base SE model: It seats seven. All other Santa Fe models stop at six, which is only one passenger seat more than in the two-row Sport model.Its moniker of Limited Ultimate might lead you to expect instrument panel stitching and real wood trim. Nope. While the simulated matte finish bark pieces appear real, they don\u2019t look as luxurious as the CX-9 Signature\u2019s planks.All Santa Fes \u2014 yes, Sport, too \u2014 get a standard backup camera. My tester had a surround-view system. Leather chairs are climate-controlled, the steering wheel is heated and the glass roof is expansive. A $2,100 Tech Package includes lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and auto braking with pedestrian detection.It\u2019s easy to overlook the user interface. Big mistake. Hyundai\u2019s is one of the easier ones to master (including those in premium brands). And Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are along for the ride on all three-row Santa Fes.Seats in the middle slide fore and aft, so there\u2019s little issue with space or comfort. Limited Ultimate gets seat warmers and sunshades in Row 2. Ingress to the third row is snug for large adults, and they won\u2019t want to spend much time there. My 5-foot-9 frame has just enough room with knees near my chest. I\u2019m curious how often the climate zone in the far back will be used.There\u2019s room for three carry-on suitcases behind the last row. Drop the split seats and a lot of kit can be swallowed up. Seat releases for the second row near the hatch opening make stuffing very large items into Santa Fe a breeze. Party animals will appreciate both 12- and 115-volt outlets in the back.At about $41,000 when options are added, the Limited Ultimate is a good value. Hyundai\u2019s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty is reassuring.

{"Headline": "Hammond Addresses \u2018Brexit\u2019 Turbulence With Hints of Policy Shift", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byBIRMINGHAM, England \u2014 Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, on Monday promised investment in infrastructure projects and pledged to step in to mitigate \u201cturbulence\u201d resulting from the country\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union, a significant shift in British economic policy.Mrs. May\u2019s speech intensified worries in the financial markets about the economic impact of Britain\u2019s decision to exit the European Union, a process known as Brexit. On Monday, the pound fell to its lowest level against the euro since 2013, reflecting concerns in the currency markets about the terms of the withdrawal, for which negotiations will start by the end of March.\u201cThroughout the negotiating process, we are ready to take whatever steps are necessary to protect this economy from turbulence,\u201d Mr. Hammond told delegates gathered in Birmingham. \u201cAnd when the process is over, we are ready to provide support to British businesses as they adjust to life outside the E.U.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.He said that economic data since June had been encouraging, but he argued that, \u201cfiscal policy may also have a role to play\u201d in the coming months.Since becoming chancellor of the Exchequer in July, Mr. Hammond has lost little time in jettisoning the fiscal targets of his predecessor, George Osborne, whose six years in government were dominated by spending cuts and efforts to balance the budget.Mr. Osborne had aimed to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020. But that objective has now been discarded, with Mr. Hammond signaling his willingness to borrow for investment.In essence, Mr. Hammond\u2019s job description appears to be to mitigate the possible negative impacts from the vote that many analysts expect, at least in the short to medium term.Those fears were compounded by Mrs. May\u2019s speech on Sunday, which was widely interpreted as a sign that Britain\u2019s membership in the European single market of around 500 million consumers would come to an end. Countries fully integrated into that market currently accept free movement of people across European borders, a right that Mrs. May has pledged to end.The economic costs of such a move could be significant. In an analysis, two economists at Berenberg Bank in London wrote that a \u201cso-called hard Brexit, in which the U.K. places heavy restrictions on inflows of E.U. economic migrants, risks doing the most damage to the U.K. economy in the long run.\u201dIn such a situation, Holger Schmieding and Kallum Pickering of Berenberg wrote, the right of Britain-based banks to offer financial services across the bloc would most likely be lost and \u201ca hard Brexit could also put free access to the E.U. market for goods at risk.\u201d\u201cSince a large proportion of U.K. voters who opted for the popular-Brexit vote may have done so for economic reasons such as low pay, poor job prospects etc.,\u201d they added, \u201ca hard Brexit would only worsen these circumstances and could eventually entail negative domestic political consequences.\u201dIn his speech, Mr. Hammond acknowledged that because of the referendum, \u201cmany businesses which trade with the E.U. are uncertain about what lies ahead.\u201dHe said that the country\u2019s long-term fiscal plans, which are expected to be announced in November, would address the consequences of short-term uncertainty while recognizing \u201cthe need for investment to build an economy that works for everyone.\u201d\u201cOur stock of public infrastructure \u2014 like our roads, railways and flood defenses \u2014 languishes near the bottom of the developed-countries\u2019 league table after decades of underinvestment,\u201d Mr. Hammond said, promising \u201ctargeted public investment in high-value infrastructure.\u201dThat, he added, could create the \u201cmost outward-looking, most dynamic, most competitive, high-wage, high-skilled, low-tax economy in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Land at Stake Is in Australia, but the Focus Is on China", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY \u2014 Gina Rinehart, a mining magnate, is very rich \u2014 and very Australian.On Friday, Ms. Rinehart added further to her local bona fides as she became the sole remaining bidder for iconic Australian grazing land bigger than Portugal. But her apparent victory will probably add to unease among some Australian leaders over a major foreign buyer: Her partners in the bid are from China.While critics of that stance say fears of China buying crucial Australian assets are largely unfounded, some Australian leaders have begun to act.The Australian government in August blocked bids by a Chinese and a Hong Kong company for Ausgrid, an electricity company and one of Australia\u2019s largest infrastructure assets, with Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s treasurer, saying such a deal would be \u201ccontrary to the national interest.\u201d Instead the government approved giving majority control of Ausgrid to two Australian pension funds in a $12.3 billion lease deal that valued the company at less than what the earlier bidders had offered.Steven Ciobo, the trade minister, said in September that the government would consider updating its foreign investment guidelines so Australians could be sure that proposed investments were \u201cgood for the country.\u201d Mike Smith, the former chief executive of Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, a major lender, went further. Last Monday, he said Australia should make a list of \u201cno-go assets.\u201dBefore their retreat, the landowners criticized Ms. Rinehart\u2019s bid as not Australian enough. While Ms. Rinehart controls the group bidding for Kidman, the Chinese property company Shanghai CRED owns a one-third stake.The bid from the landowners did not rely on \u201cgetting money out of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d said Sterling Buntine, one of the landowners, in comments that came days before his group bowed out. Instead, he told lawmakers, it \u201cwill see Kidman 100 percent Australian-owned.\u201dThe Kidman properties account for 2.5 percent of Australia\u2019s farmland and include a pastoral lease across a weapons range classified as sensitive by the Australian government. The Rinehart group\u2019s bid excludes the areas abutting the weapons range.Mr. Morrison, the treasurer, had already rejected bids for Kidman from two Chinese companies. When Ms. Rinehart emerged with her Chinese partner, Mr. Buntine and his fellow cattle ranchers quickly countered.\u201cMy father carted cattle for Kidman for many years,\u201d Mr. Buntine said. Other consortium members, the Oldfield family and the Brinkworths, were cattlemen on Kidman properties or drovers. Malcolm Harris, the fourth member, runs cattle farms in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.Ms. Rinehart\u2019s camp dismissed the idea that the presence of a Chinese partner would take valuable Australian land out of the hands of locals.\u201cYou don\u2019t get much more Australian than fourth-generation Australian Gina Rinehart,\u201d said Garry Korte, the chief executive of Hancock Prospecting, Ms. Rinehart\u2019s investment vehicle.Shanghai CRED did not respond to requests for comment.Ms. Rinehart, who is well known in Australia for her strong conservative political views and legal fights with other members of her family, has stressed her connections to the Kidman properties. Her grandfather, she says, ran several businesses with the company\u2019s founder, Sidney Kidman. \u201cThey respected each other and were friends,\u201d she said.In a poll before national elections, which were held on July 2, the Lowy Institute, an independent research center, found that 87 percent of Australians were against foreigners\u2019 owning Australian farms and that 59 percent did not approve of Chinese investment.\u201cMost Australians have little or no direct connection with Kidman,\u201d said Simon Venus, a lawyer acting for the landowners. \u201cBut culturally, it is very significant. There\u2019s a romantic nostalgia around the properties.\u201dSo far Chinese investors hold only modest amounts of Australian land. Investors from Britain are the largest foreign holders, with 68 million acres, followed by those from the United States, according to Australian trade officials. Investors from China ranked fifth, holding 3.7 million acres.Critics of the growing anti-China stance from some politicians say it amounts to pandering. Indeed, many Australians believe homeownership is out of their reach because Chinese investors are pushing prices higher.\u201cThe process for the sale of big-ticket assets is utterly politicized,\u201d said Jeffrey Wilson of the Asia Research Center at Murdoch University in Perth.But the government is grappling with rising discontent among junior and independent lawmakers who are uneasy about foreign investment. Two lawmakers, Nick Xenophon, a senator from South Australia, and Bob Katter, a lower-house lawmaker from Queensland, said last Monday that the government should stiffen the rules governing the entry of foreign buyers.Mr. Xenophon said he supported foreign investment but was considering pressing for new laws that would give tax breaks to Australian pension funds to help them buy Australian assets. \u201cIt means profits stay here, jobs are created here,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 31 about bids for land in Australia characterized incorrectly efforts by a Chinese and a Hong Kong company to purchase Ausgrid, an Australian electricity company. The companies bid separately to buy Ausgrid, not jointly. (The error was repeated in an article on Tuesday.)Emily Feng in Beijing contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Voters, Aghast at Trump, Find a Place of Food and Comfort", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byAnxious in AmericaPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Natalie Solomon was always an early riser. Back in her days at a Ford-owned auto electronics plant, managing production schedules and bringing in $60,000 a year with overtime, she would be behind the wheel of her Ford Explorer by 4 a.m. \u2014 in time to grab coffee at Wawa, swing by her locker, grab her smock and get on the factory floor before 5.\u201cBut that part of my life is closed now,\u201d she said. Still, at 60, car or no car, she needs a morning routine.So twice each week at 5:30 a.m., earbuds in and listening to a motivational speaker \u201cto get myself together,\u201d she pads down the steps of her stone house and heads for the No. 18 bus.Her destination: Mount Airy, a tidy neighborhood of brick homes where she volunteers at one of Philadelphia\u2019s busiest food pantries, the Kitchen of Love. By the time Ms. Solomon arrives, the line for free groceries is growing, populated with proud retirees and struggling working-class people like herself.It is a poignant scene in an election year filled with snapshots of Americans whose grievances have fueled the rise of Donald J. Trump. But this part of Mount Airy is largely blue-collar and black, not white. And far from being animated by Mr. Trump\u2019s angry campaign, people here are terrified by it \u2014 and are mourning the departure of Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first (and, some fear, its last) black president.\u201cI wish he was a dictator,\u201d Calvin Gardner, 64, a retired construction worker, said, expressing longing for a third Obama term.There is the same rage at an economy that has sent jobs overseas. \u201cRich people have enough doggone money, and we need to bring our jobs back,\u201d Ms. Solomon said.There is the same disgust at the whole campaign spectacle, the same frustration at a system that benefits society\u2019s extremes. As Tony Morse, 49, a behavioral health specialist who uses the pantry to feed foster children in homes he supervises, said, \u201cPolitics is for the very rich and the very poor.\u201dBut after that, the race is a study in, well, black and white.When Mr. Trump says America needs to be made great again, people here see a nation that Mr. Obama pulled back from the brink. When Mr. Trump vows to take on the Islamic State, they envision their children and grandchildren being sent to war.\u201cWhat the hell have you got to lose? You live in poverty! You fools ain\u2019t no good!\u201d Yvonne Hilton, 66, a Jamaican-born nurse, exclaimed, angrily mimicking Mr. Trump.And in her impression is perhaps what separates those at the Kitchen of Love from many whites in similar economic circumstances. In an anxious time, in a needy place, everyone seems fixated on what they have to lose.The volunteer-run Kitchen of Love, open on Thursdays and Fridays, serves 500 to 700 people each week, roughly half of them older than 65. That it thrives in such a stable corner of Philadelphia tells a deeper national tale, about what the Urban Institute in Washington calls the \u201cstalled, struggling black middle class.\u201dBlacks have less equity in their homes and are less likely than whites to inherit money, and were thus hit harder by the foreclosure crisis. They are more likely than whites to be raising grandchildren or supporting needy relatives. In tough times, they have less to fall back on.All of this is playing out here in East Mount Airy, once a heavily white and Jewish neighborhood in northwestern Philadelphia, just across the border from suburban Montgomery County. Sandwiched between Chestnut Hill, with its upscale boutiques, and less affluent Germantown, where Ms. Solomon lives, it has long stood for upward black mobility.Marlene Trice, who founded the Kitchen of Love, bears witness to these changes.A no-nonsense woman with a booming voice and a penchant for T-shirts with sayings like \u201cKeep Calm and Love Jesus,\u201d Mrs. Trice, 69, and her husband, Clarence, 73, bought their home in East Mount Airy in 1969. He details cars; she worked at the prepared food counter at Pathmark \u2014 \u201cI fried the chicken, made the hoagies, did the party trays\u201d \u2014 until its parent company filed for bankruptcy last year.\u201cI thought I would work until I was 75,\u201d she said.In 1996, Mrs. Trice opened the food pantry in North Philadelphia, the poor neighborhood where she grew up. In 2010, a new recreation center was built in East Mount Airy. Ms. Parker suggested that Mrs. Trice move the pantry to the old center, in a boxy cinder-block building next to a playground and school.\u201cI said, \u2018No, the people are not going to come out like they do in North Philly,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Trice recalled. \u201cBut now, let me tell you something: They made a liar out of me.\u201dMs. Solomon turned up at the Kitchen of Love four years ago, frightened and sick. \u201cI was hoping it would help me to eat better,\u201d she said.A daughter of a factory worker and a Philadelphia police officer, Ms. Solomon is a private woman, and not as financially secure as some of the people she now serves. She inherited her house from her mother, raised five children and lost two sons to violence. She was engaged once, but never married; in a quiet moment, she wondered if \u201cmaybe I should have, because I would have a husband to help me out.\u201d\u201cI blame Ford,\u201d she said.She was too young for early retirement, and the Affordable Care Act had not yet become law. She declined coverage under the Cobra program; she needed the money, she said, to buy heating oil for her house. When her unemployment compensation ran out, she dipped into her pension, agreeing to benefits at a vastly reduced rate: roughly $5,000 a year.\u201cI wasn\u2019t really eating,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe twice a week I would go to the cafeteria and eat half a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes on, but most of the time I drank Mountain Dew and Pepsis and coffee and cakes to keep myself alert, for the sugar. I would wake up at 3 in the morning, trying to do homework.\u201dThen the fainting spells started. She spent five days in the hospital getting blood transfusions. Mrs. Trice later helped her find a doctor. Today, Ms. Solomon has health coverage through Medicaid, expanded in Pennsylvania under the Affordable Care Act.\u201cShe came to me asking for help,\u201d Mrs. Trice recalled. \u201cAnd after maybe six months, she asked me, \u2018Could I volunteer?\u2019\u201dParked outside Mrs. Trice\u2019s home is a rusty white pickup truck, with 172,000 miles on it and a creaky driver\u2019s-side door that needs to be slammed several times before it will shut. Stepping off the bus, Ms. Solomon pulled the key out of her purse: Her volunteer duties include driving to local grocery stores to pick up their castoffs.As much as food, the Kitchen of Love offers comfort in an uncertain world. It is a place to debate whether the new Powerball lottery is a good value or a scam; to get tips on which programs help with home heating costs; to watch the schoolchildren, in uniforms of khaki and blue, scamper around the playground \u2014 and maybe get a kiss from a grandchild passing by.It is also, lately, a place to vent about a presidential race that feels too horrible to watch, yet too compelling to avoid.In Mr. Trump\u2019s statements, people here concede, there is a tiny kernel of truth. Yes, there is violence in their community; Ms. Solomon, in her quiet grief, knows this. Yes, many people here lost their jobs, even under an African-American president, but some of Ms. Solomon\u2019s friends from the factory are now employed.When people here watch Trump rallies, some see imagery that reminds them of their childhoods in the Deep South; some go so far as to wonder if Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have been planted by the Ku Klux Klan. Their feelings about Mrs. Clinton are mixed, but those who are voting for president will vote for her.They hold Republicans in disdain. But their reaction to Mr. Trump is especially deep and visceral.\u201cBack to slavery days,\u201d Ms. Solomon said gravely. \u201cDo as master say.\u201dBut if Mr. Trump has brought racial animus to the fore, some see that as a blessing. \u201cIt kind of pulled a blindfold off of America,\u201d Inez Muhammad, 54, a disabled federal worker, said.Like many here and across the nation, Ms. Solomon is looking past Election Day: She fears that Washington \u201cwill be a mess,\u201d with Mr. Trump kicking up a fuss if he loses. She has been working on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and intends to re-enroll in college, to prove to her grandchildren that \u201cif Nana can get a degree, you can too.\u201dIn the meantime, she has volunteered to help Democrats register voters and pushing everyone she knows to go to the polls, especially her grandson, who is 18. \u201cI told him, that\u2019s not a given right for black people,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many people died for you to give up that right.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a picture caption on Monday with an article about the concerns of voters in Philadelphia misstated the given name of a woman who volunteered at the Kitchen of Love food pantry in the Mount Airy neighborhood. She is Natalie Solomon, not Deborah. And also because of editing errors, a second picture caption misstated the surname of a founder of the food pantry and a third caption referred incorrectly to Raymond and Eric Melton, who were shown playing ball in the neighborhood. The founder of the pantry is Marlene Trice, not Price. And while the brothers live near the Kitchen of Love, they are not fed by the pantry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Minutes See Rate Rise \u2018Relatively Soon\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byThe Federal Reserve expects to increase its benchmark interest rate \u201crelatively soon\u201d if the economy continues to advance at a reasonable pace, according to an account published Wednesday of the bank\u2019s most recent policy meeting.The account strengthened expectations that the Fed may raise rates at its final meeting of the year, in December. But it also underscored that a majority of Fed officials did not see sufficient economic evidence to warrant an increase right away. And some expressed doubt that the economy would be strong enough for the Fed to move this year.But the account also cautioned that the decision would depend on the continued progress of the economic recovery. Some officials were \u201cconcerned that the new sentence might be misread as indicating that the passage of time, rather than the accumulation of evidence, would be the key factor\u201d in the Fed\u2019s December deliberations, it said.The September meeting was a contentious affair. Seven Fed officials voted to leave rates unchanged while three voted for an increase, the largest bloc of dissents in several years. The account, released after a standard three-week delay, said some of the officials who voted to wait viewed the decision as a \u201cclose call,\u201d underscoring the momentum for a rate increase.\u201cIt was noted that a reasonable argument could be made either for an increase at this meeting or for waiting for some additional information on the labor market and inflation,\u201d the September meeting account said.The Fed raised rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis, but it has not moved this year. The economy continues to grow, but officials see little sign of overheating. The labor force continues to expand as people who gave up on finding work in the years after the recession return to the job market. And inflation remains sluggish.\u201cWe\u2019re at a point where the economic expansion has plenty of room to run,\u201d William C. Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said on Wednesday. \u201cI think we can be quite gentle as we go in terms of gradually removing monetary policy accommodation.\u201dThe minutes underscored that most Fed officials feel relatively little urgency about raising interest rates.Many officials \u201cexpressed the view that recent evidence suggested that some slack remained in the labor market,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cWith inflation continuing to run below the committee\u2019s 2 percent objective and few signs of increased pressure on wages and prices, most of these participants thought it would be appropriate to await further evidence of continued progress toward the committee\u2019s statutory objectives.\u201dFederal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.Despite the split over the timing of the next rate increase, there is broad agreement among Fed officials that the pace of rate hikes is likely to remain slow. The Fed raised rates once in 2015. It may raise rates once in 2016. And most officials expect no more than two increases next year.Among those who voted to wait, moreover, there remains a further divide. Some described the decision not to move in September as a \u201cclose call,\u201d the account said, while others saw less of a case for higher interest rates.\u201cSome participants believed that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon if the labor market continued to improve and economic activity strengthened,\u201d the account said. \u201cSome others preferred to wait for more convincing evidence that inflation was moving toward the committee\u2019s 2 percent objective.\u201dAmong the minority of Fed officials who were ready to raise rates in September, there is a growing sense of impatience. The Fed entered the year predicting four rate increases, only to back off in March, and again in June, and again in September.The Fed\u2019s next meeting is in November, but the group is viewed as unlikely to act at that meeting because it is scheduled just a few days before the presidential election. The Fed, already the target of repeated attacks by the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, is viewed as likely to avoid drawing attention to itself.That leaves the December meeting.                        Advertisement"}

He had a question for the owner: How was he going to tell his daughter that she would never see her mother again?His wife, Fabiola Bittar de Kroon, had been killed by falling debris after a commuter train barreled into Hoboken Terminal during the Thursday morning rush. She was the one fatality.Now, hours later, her husband, Adrianus de Kroon, was at Smart Start Academy, a day care center not far from the train station. He met with its owner, Karlos Magner, outside.\u201cHe said, \u2018What should I tell her? How should I handle this?\u2019\u201d Mr. Magner said.Mr. Magner had known children who had lost a parent to illness, he said, but never a death as sudden and violent as this. \u201cI told him honestly: \u2018I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no book. Life, we\u2019re not trained. We don\u2019t know. So just stand strong,\u2019\u201d Mr. Magner recalled during an interview on Friday.Ms. de Kroon, 34, had dropped her daughter, Julia, at the center on Thursday morning about an hour before the crash. Her life ended just as she was paving a new beginning in the United States with her husband and her daughter, whom they had 20 months ago in her native Brazil.Mr. Magner said Ms. de Kroon left Julia at the center and picked her up every day, sending a flurry of kisses in her daughter\u2019s way.\u201cHer daughter is attached to her,\u201d he said. The girl grew restless on Thursday as the hour that her mother normally arrived to get her came and went, Mr. Magner added.\u201cShe knew something was off,\u201d Mr. Magner said.Ms. de Kroon moved to Hoboken in April. She had planned to look for a bigger place for her family on the day she died. \u201cMaybe a house in Brooklyn,\u201d she had told a close friend, Roberta Lima.Ms. de Kroon and Ms. Lima had communicated through cellphone messages over WhatsApp, a messaging app, on Tuesday, as they often did. Ms. Lima, 35, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, asked Ms. de Kroon when she would return to Brazil for a visit. Ms. de Kroon told her that she had planned a trip for December, in time to celebrate Julia\u2019s second birthday.Ms. de Kroon was \u201ca bit apprehensive to be living far from her family now that she had a child,\u201d Ms. Lima said, but living away from family was nothing new to her. She and her husband, whom everyone knows as Daan, spent four years in Miami before moving to Brazil in 2011, where he led global business development for a Jamaican beer and a Brazilian cacha\u00e7a brand owned by an international distributor, Diageo.Mr. de Kroon, who is Dutch, was working in the Brazilian city of S\u00e3o Paulo when he met his wife. Ms. de Kroon had grown up in Santos, on the Atlantic Coast, but moved to S\u00e3o Paulo for law school, Ms. Lima said. The couple moved to Miami in 2007, and they both studied business at Florida International University.\u201cThey were very focused on their careers and very much in love,\u201d Ms. Lima said.Four years later they were back in Brazil. According to Ms. Lima, as the country\u2019s economy sputtered, Mr. de Kroon moved to Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, to lead Diageo\u2019s expansion there. Ms. de Kroon was pregnant at the time and decided to stay in S\u00e3o Paulo, close to her mother, Sueli Bittar. Mr. de Kroon would travel home on weekends, Ms. Lima said. Ms. de Kroon told her that moving to the United States would give the couple and their daughter a chance to spend more time together.In April, Ms. Lima helped organize a farewell gathering for the couple in Santos. They went out dancing, had some drinks, had fun, she said.\u201cThey were both very happy, full of plans, really excited about the move,\u201d Ms. Lima said.Now, Mr. de Kroon will have to be \u201cboth mom and dad,\u201d Mr. Magner said. The only advice he could think of offering the widowed father was not to broach what had happened with his daughter until he felt the timing was right.\u201cOnly the parent will know what is the right time and when to disclose it,\u201d he said. \u201cChildren are like a sponge, they absorb so much, but they understand.\u201dOf Mr. de Kroon, Mr. Magner said, \u201cHe was strong, as strong as you can be in this situation.\u201dMs. Lima and Ms. de Kroon were both 14 when they met, through a mutual friend.

{"Headline": "Infiniti\u2019s VC-Turbo S.U.V.: A \u2018Leap Ahead\u2019 in Efficiency", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 A few years back, I asked Robert A. Lutz, who was then vice chairman of General Motors, why the auto industry seemed slow to ditch old-fashioned gasoline engine technology in favor of ideas about exciting new means of propulsion like electric motors.\u201cI believe the old internal combustion engine still has a few tricks up its sleeve,\u201d he said. \u201cSome big improvements \u2014 big leaps forward \u2014 in efficiency could be ahead.\u201dOne of those \u201ctricks\u201d may have surfaced here at the 2016 Paris Motor Show.The technology, displayed by Nissan\u2019s Infiniti luxury brand and called VC-Turbo, would make it possible for the first time in a production-ready vehicle to vary the compression ratio in the engine\u2019s combustion chambers while the car is being driven.So what? the layperson may ask.It matters because the compression ratio \u2014 the relationship between the smallest and largest volume in an engine cylinder during the piston stroke \u2014 is among the factors that determine the fuel efficiency and the power of an internal-combustion motor.A lower compression ratio is desirable when the goal is to use less fuel and to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions. A higher ratio is what you want when the purpose is to drive fast, temporarily ignoring fuel economy and environmental concerns.Engine experts consider Infiniti\u2019s breakthrough a potential big deal.\u201cThe ability to vary an engine\u2019s compression ratio has been a holy grail quest of engine engineers for decades,\u201d said Frank Markus, an automotive engineer and technical editor at Motor Trend magazine.Mr. Markus is among those who say the new technology, if the cost comes down below luxury-car levels, could help the auto industry meet its fuel economy and emissions targets in coming years without necessarily sacrificing engine performance.Alongside the engine was a muscular-looking QX Sport Inspiration S.U.V. concept vehicle that was also on display here. Infiniti said the S.U.V. could be the first to come equipped with the new engine, in a production version scheduled to go on sale in 2018.The VC part of its nomenclature refers to variable compression.In today\u2019s fixed-compression engines the most common ratios are in the range of 8:1 to 14:1 \u2014 although they might go as low as 6:1 for economy cars, or up to 17:1 for Formula 1 beasts.Heretofore, engine designers have had to choose what kind of performance they wanted from an engine. Then a design has been created around that ratio. That is why some vehicles are racecars, while others are grocery-getters.Until now.In the VC-Turbo technology, the engine is designed with articulating, multilink moving parts to facilitate operation at different \u2014 variable \u2014 compression ratios, depending on throttle demand.In the case of the Infiniti engine, this is a range of 8:1 to 14:1 (and every ratio in between). The variable design gives the engine management system a choice of the optimal range of operation at all times.This explanation is a huge oversimplification. But the point is easy to grasp: power when you need it, and economy when you don\u2019t.Besides offering the range of performance, the VC-Turbo technology fits in a smaller engine size \u2014 just two liters \u2014 but it churns out about as much power as Infiniti\u2019s own much-larger 3.5-liter V6.Because it is smaller, it also saves weight: The 2.0 turbo here is 25 kilos, or 55 pounds, lighter than the V6.That is the type of weight savings that auto engineers dream of. Many advances in vehicle weight are measured in mere ounces.Infiniti says the little 2.0-liter turbo here, which produces 268 horsepower and 288 foot-pounds of torque, is 27 percent more efficient in terms of fuel economy and operation than a V-6 of similar output.That would be the equivalent of a gasoline engine that gets 40 miles to the gallon improving to a 62 m.p.g. rating. That is efficiency equivalent to a similarly powered four-cylinder diesel engine, Infiniti said, although with extremely low emissions \u2014 especially compared with soot-spewing diesels.More than 300 key patents, and many more lesser ones, have been granted over the two decades that it took to develop this engine, Infiniti said. The company said final performance and durability testing was carried out in cooperation with the Renault and Infiniti Red Bull F1 teams, using their rigorous testing regimens.The chief engineer for the Infiniti VC-Turbo project, Shinichi Kiga, was not sure how to define it when asked whether the VC-Turbo was an engine, or a technology.\u201cBoth,\u201d he said, after some thought. \u201cSome of both. But it is the technology inside this engine.\u201dThe technology is scalable, Mr. Kiga said, so it could be built into other engine architectures.Infiniti did not say what the price of the QX Sport with VC-Turbo would be. The S.U.V. that Infiniti now sells in which the 3.5-liter V6 engine is standard, the QX60, has a base price of $42,600.Mr. Markus, the Motor Trend editor, says that the complex engines incorporating variable-compression technology will be costly to build in the early going. But he predicts it will prove to be a cost-effective way for the auto industry to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas in vehicle exhaust that matters most to regulators.People have been trying to get patents on variable-combustion technologies since at least 1932. And more recently, other automakers including Lotus and Saab have designed prototypes.Mr. Markus said he was aware of at least one other company, MCE-5, a firm based in Lyon, France, that had built a working variable-compression engine.But Infiniti, he said, seemed to be further along. \u201cThey\u2019re probably ahead of the game.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Grew 2.9% in 3rd Quarter, Picking Up the Pace", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byThe American economy moved into a higher gear last quarter, expanding at an annual rate of 2.9 percent and riding continued strength among consumers and a better performance in global trade.The Commerce Department\u2019s report on the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, released Friday, is the next-to-last snapshot of the overall economy before voters go to the polls on Nov. 8. Americans will also get to gauge the economic fortunes of the nation from the monthly unemployment figures to be released on Nov. 4.While the pace of economic growth in the third quarter fell well short of previous achievements, the latest data represented a significant improvement from the first half of 2016 and the best quarterly advance in two years. Economists also said the gains were probably strong enough to reassure Federal Reserve policy makers that it was safe to raise the benchmark interest rate when they meet in December.\u201cThis is a good, solid number,\u201d said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. \u201cThe economy is growing at a decent clip. Consumer spending will continue to lead growth, and the fundamentals there remain positive.\u201dFor all the quarterly blips, the ups and downs on Wall Street and the back and forth between political parties, the American economy remains more or less on the same trajectory since the recovery began more than seven years ago: modest but consistent growth.The bigger picture has remained remarkably steady, with yearly growth in the range of 1.75 percent to 2.75 percent. From 2010 to 2015, the economy grew at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent.Economists like Michael Gapen of Barclays expect gross domestic product to expand 2.5 percent in the current fourth quarter, and then advance about 2 percent in 2017.\u201cThe consumer is fine, and there is evidence that the industrial side of the economy is stabilizing and the big drags from inventories and weak investment are abating,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. \u201cManufacturing, trade and energy may no longer be significant headwinds, as they have been over the last year.\u201dThe 1.1 percent growth rate from January to June this year was the slowest first half since 2011, and it was well below what economists expected when 2016 began.Much of that weakness was a result of an inventory buildup on store shelves and in warehouses that has only slowly been worked off. The lingering effects on business investment from the collapse in the price of oil and other commodities have also dragged down the economy.Many experts initially forecast another subdued performance in the third quarter, but estimates crept higher this week after a report on Wednesday showed better-than-expected exports and lower imports in September.Unlike some recent periods, which showed uneven gains, the growth in the third quarter was broad-based, with most industries advancing. For the second quarter in a row, trade was a net positive, adding nearly a full point to growth on a big jump in exports.Consumer spending slowed from its barnburner pace earlier in the second quarter, but at 2.1 percent, it was healthy enough to suggest that shoppers remained optimistic. Other sources of slack, like a drop in spending on residential construction, were more than made up by businesses as they restocked shelves and began investing again in the energy industry and elsewhere.The comparatively good economic news was welcomed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, which has repeatedly made the case that the economy is in better shape than Donald Trump and other Republicans claim.\u201cToday\u2019s G.D.P. release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years,\u201d Jacob Leibenluft, a senior policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we\u2019ve made real progress coming back from the crisis.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign noted that growth during President Obama\u2019s time in office has fallen well short of 3 percent on an annual basis, and claimed that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s stewardship of the economy would not be any better.\u201cThe growth numbers are catastrophic,\u201d Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement. \u201cHillary\u2019s tax, spend, borrow and regulate policies will cause an outright depression.\u201dIn a separate report Friday, the University of Michigan revised its final reading on consumer sentiment in October down slightly to 87.2. Oxford Economics attributed the decline to the fierce rhetoric that has characterized the final days of the presidential race.\u201cConsumers often feel less optimistic in election years, and 2016 is no exception,\u201d said Gregory Daco, head of United States macroeconomics at Oxford. \u201cWe anticipate that a reasonably solid macroeconomic backdrop will underpin a rebound in sentiment once the election has concluded.\u201dThe recent rebound in oil prices could also spur more economic activity among drillers and other energy producers in the months ahead, even if slightly higher gas prices won\u2019t please consumers.Underscoring just how quirky economic data can be on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the Commerce Department noted that a big chunk of the export gains came from a surge in soybean exports that was unlikely to repeat itself in future quarters. Friday\u2019s release was the first of three estimates of quarterly growth that could be revised upward or downward by government number-crunchers; the next batch of data on G.D.P. is expected on Nov. 29.Since joblessness hit a peak of 10 percent in 2009, the unemployment rate has been cut in half. Still, growth in the current recovery has fallen well short of previous rebounds in the 1980s and \u201990s.But now there are signs that wages are finally beginning to increase, as the steady drop in unemployment forces businesses to compete for new hires. With that in mind, the Federal Reserve is considered likely to raise interest rates when it meets in December; it would be the first increase in a year.Policy makers at the Fed will gather next week, but most experts say there is little chance the central bank will act to tighten monetary policy so close to the presidential election.While growth could rise above the 2 to 3 percent range for a quarter or two in the next year, it is unlikely to rise to the level last seen in the late 1990s, when economic activity was in the 3 to 4 percent range.\u201cThe labor force is growing more slowly than it was in the 1990s, and productivity growth is slower,\u201d Mr. Faucher of PNC Financial said. \u201cThere are things we can do \u2014 like improve the tax structure, implement regulatory reform and spend more on infrastructure \u2014 but those are longer-term projects.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The residents call it Copacabana Palace, after a famous five-star hotel. They also call it Jambalaya, after a popular TV show, or Carandiru, after a notorious prison in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo. The people he met were mostly honest, hard-working people, he said. Some had lost their jobs or could not afford rising rents because of inflation. Others were born on the street and never had a home. Some were fleeing problems with drug gangs.Some residents worried that Mr. Bauza, 57, was trying to take advantage of them, so he spent weeks just talking with them. He couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t promise that their lives would change because of his photographs, but he told them that he would treat them with dignity and show the reality of their daily lives. Not only the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpain, misery and needs but also joy and happiness and dreams,\u201d he said.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he moved in, staying with families or living inside a tent that he pitched in one of the buildings. He shared \u00e2\u0080\u009cbarbecues and siestas on sofas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and grew close to several families.There was a vibrant economy in the development, including hairdressers, food vendors and a candy store. Some residents worked as day laborers, while others existed on meager social welfare payments. There was not much drug dealing, but some young women worked as prostitutes outside of the development, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are average people, like us, who at times are forced to do certain things to survive,\u201d he said.When construction stopped at the development decades ago, scavengers swooped in and stripped the buildings clean of pipes and cables, leaving the structure vulnerable to corrosion and water damage. The development lacks the basic infrastructure for sewage or electricity, Mr. Bauza said, and a partial roof collapse led to the evacuation of one of the buildings.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, bad or good, it is a shelter and better than the street,\u201d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can always be better, but it can always be worse.\u201dThe police are rarely seen there, but neither are drug gangs. Security is provided by a militia, made up largely of former police officers, firefighters and soldiers who charge for protection, Mr. Bauza said. Residents who do not follow the militia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules \u00e2\u0080\u009crisk merciless retribution,\u201d he added.Mr. Bauza has been a serious amateur photographer since he was a teenager in Germany, but he worked for much of his adult life as a manager for international chemical companies, mostly in South America. A business trip to rural Uganda in 2012 brought him in contact with survivors of attacks by the violent Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Resistance Army.  He stayed longer, and his photos of them were published widely. The experience made him keenly aware, he said, of the global disparity between the rich and the poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfrica changed me and opened my mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bauza said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI realized that I needed to defend the rights of poor people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is what led him to stay at the Copacabana Palace, even though he could afford the real five-star hotel by the beach.

Few taxes would be needed to fund the government in that case. Social insurance against poverty and tragedy could be covered by charities, they argue; the stock market, for instance, could take care of Social Security.While voluntary charitable organizations doled out most of the social insurance before the New Deal, they constituted a threadbare network that quickly snapped under the pressure of the Great Depression. The same happened during the Great Recession: Private charitable giving from individuals, corporations and foundations fell as the economy faltered; it was the government that stepped in to cushion the worst of the blows.Advertisement"}

She also unveiled two new policies to protect workers, including curbing the use of \u201cforced arbitration\u201d clauses in contracts that prohibit workers and consumers from bringing legal action against companies that have harmed them.\u201cWe are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine-print \u2018gotchas\u2019 to escape accountability,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\u201cWe should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need these drugs,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.Early voting begins next week in Ohio, and the Clinton campaign has roughly 300 staff members and an army of volunteers working to register voters. On Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton plans to embark on a two-day bus tour through the state largely focused on kitchen-table economic issues.Recent polls have shown that Mrs. Clinton has gained an advantage on Mr. Trump when voters are asked who will best handle the economy. Ever since the Democratic nominating fight, Mrs. Clinton has called out specific corporate players for criticism, trying to demonstrate to voters how she would approach corporate misbehavior as president.The same day Mrs. Clinton fought to present herself as a champion of hard-hit Rust Belt voters, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the Clinton family\u2019s finances. In the years since Mr. Clinton left the White House, the Clintons have amassed in excess of $125 million delivering paid speeches to Wall Street and other special interests.\u201cHillary Clinton hasn\u2019t made an honest dollar in her entire life,\u201d he said in Pueblo, contrasting his private-sector experience to her profiting off her career of public service by making speeches.\u201cHillary Clinton left the White House dead broke,\u201d he said. \u201cNow she and her husband have made more than $200 million without building a company or creating a single thing of value.\u201dAlthough the data has shown steady job growth under President Obama, voters in states like Ohio have not felt that the economy has come back, said Nina Turner, a former state senator from Ohio who supported Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary race.\u201cThey feel like, \u2018My quality of life hasn\u2019t gotten much better, and I need somebody to speak to those issues,\u2019\u201d Ms. Turner said. \u201cInstead,\u201d she said of the two major-party nominees, \u201cwe have two wealthy people battling back and forth.\u201dAshley Parker contributed reporting from Pueblo, Colo.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump was being booed at a charity dinner.So it went at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in Manhattan, a presidential campaign ritual of levity and feigned warmth \u2014 upended, like so much else in this election season, by the gale-force bid of Mr. Trump.Breaking with decades of tradition at the gathering once he took the microphone, Mr. Trump set off on a blistering, grievance-filled performance that translated poorly to the staid setting, stunning many of the well-heeled guests who had filed into the Waldorf Astoria hotel for an uncommon spectacle: an attempted d\u00e9tente in a campaign so caustic that the candidates, less than 24 hours earlier, declined to shake hands on a debate stage.Relations did not much improve.Mr. Trump\u2019s set began typically enough. He joked about the size of his hands and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comparatively small crowds. He even very nearly poked fun at himself \u2014 insofar as a zinger about his wife, and her partly plagiarized Republican convention speech, qualifies \u2014 when discussing the \u201cbiased\u201d news media.\u201cYou want the proof? Michelle Obama gives a speech, and everyone loves it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMy wife, Melania, gives the exact same speech and people get on her case.\u201dSome sharper jokes about Mrs. Clinton seemed to edge just to the line.\u201cJust before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me. And she very civilly said, \u2018Pardon me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said, as murmurs filled the room. \u201cI very politely replied, \u2018Let me talk to you about that after I get into office.\u2019\u201dMrs. Clinton, seeming to get the joke before some others, chuckled hard before the punch line.But quickly, his remarks took a more menacing turn.Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton was merely \u201cpretending not to hate Catholics,\u201d an allusion to hacked correspondences from Clinton aides that appeared to include messages criticizing Roman Catholic conservatism.He wondered aloud how someone like Mrs. Clinton \u2014 \u201cso corrupt,\u201d he said \u2014 could sell herself to the American people. \u201cWhat\u2019s her pitch?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe economy is busted, the government\u2019s corrupt, Washington is failing. Vote for me.\u201dHe fake-griped that \u201call the jokes were given to her in advance.\u201dAs for Mrs. Clinton, she began with some easy self-parody.\u201cI took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cUsually, I charge a lot for speeches like this.\u201dBut she soon turned to more cutting satire, joking that Mr. Trump was \u201ctranslating from the original Russian\u201d on his teleprompters and wondering just how President Obama might be able to visit the White House for a reunion of former presidents under a Trump administration.\u201cHow is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?\u201d she asked.Noting that she was speaking second, she riffed: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing I\u2019m up here after Donald. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be O.K. with a peaceful transition of power.\u201dShe also spoke of the Statue of Liberty, recounting how for most Americans, the green lady of freedom represents a shining beacon of hope and a welcome symbol for immigrants arriving on the nation\u2019s shores. But Mr. Trump, she added with a glint of steel, \u201clooks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a 4\u201d \u2014 a not-so-veiled reference to his comments rating the physical appearance of women.\u201cMaybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,\u201d she continued, before making an explicit, if subtle, pitch for becoming the nation\u2019s first female president.\u201cYou know, come to think, know what would be a good number for a woman? 45,\u201d she concluded triumphantly.At the dinner before the remarks, the pair could be seen chatting, at least briefly, perched two seats apart, with only Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, between them. (Perhaps only a man of God could, for a night, soothe a campaign that has included an F.B.I. inquiry, overnight Twitter binges, multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and an international feud between the Republican nominee and Pope Francis).Before the candidates spoke, Alfred E. Smith IV, the chairman of the dinner, which benefits Catholic charities, seemed to offer a preview of what may await Mr. Trump as he tries to return to New York society life should he not win the White House in November.\u201cBefore the dinner started, Trump went to Hillary and asked, \u2018How are you?\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith said, waiting a beat. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m fine \u2014 now get out of the ladies\u2019 dressing room.\u2019\u201dEven under the best of circumstances, Mr. Trump is not known for an eagerness to laugh at himself. A veritable roasting at Washington\u2019s annual \u201cnerd prom,\u201d the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association\u2019s annual dinner, in 2011 may have hastened \u2014 or even catalyzed \u2014 his bid for the Oval Office. And now a flagging presidential campaign \u2014 most polls place him several percentage points behind Mrs. Clinton nationally \u2014 has done little to help.Then there was the guest list, which included Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor who has vocally opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s bid, and Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, whose office has opened an investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation.Mrs. Clinton, perhaps lifted by her rising poll numbers, seemed exultant in her fuchsia dress, often laughing first and loudest, before being greeted by well-wishers as she left.Mr. Trump even reached out to shake her hand as guests stepped off the dais.

{"Headline": "In Japan, More Women Fight to Use Their Own Surnames", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byMemo From TokyoUnder a Japanese law that dates back to the Meiji era, more than a century ago, all married couples must use one surname. In theory, a couple may choose either the husband\u2019s or the wife\u2019s last name, but in practice, 96 percent of women assume their husband\u2019s.Advocates for women, including lawmakers across the political spectrum, say they simply want women to make their own choices about their names. But recent court rulings indicate that the law is unlikely to be softened anytime soon, despite rising criticism.Yoko Uozumi is happily married with a 4-year-old daughter. Two months ago, she took a job in the photo framing business where her husband also works and decided to use only the surname that she was given at birth.Ms. Uozumi, 36, said she did not want customers to confuse her with her husband, Shigeru Otsuka, since most employees are known primarily by their last names in Japan.Using her birth surname went beyond convenience. It was also a declaration of empowerment. \u201cI feel more independent,\u201d Ms. Uozumi said. \u201cI feel more who I am.\u201dThe marital naming law, supported by many conservatives who believe that women belong predominantly in the home supporting their husbands and families, is seen by some as another vestige of discrimination against women in Japanese society.The plaintiff, who has remained anonymous in the publicly available court documents, declined an interview request through her lawyer. In court filings, the teacher, described as recently married, said students and colleagues knew her by her given surname. She asked to be allowed to continue to use it on letters home to parents, attendance records and report cards.Makiko Terahara, one of the lawyers for the plaintiff, said the teacher, now in her 30s, had worked for 15 years using her birth surname.\u201cWe have to work on changing the law so that couples can choose their names when marrying,\u201d Ms. Terahara said. \u201cA name represents a person. It\u2019s a matter of personal rights.\u201dHidehisa Takase, the principal of Nihon University Daisangakuen, the school where the plaintiff works, said he had offered a compromise in which the teacher could continue to be called by her birth name publicly but use her married name for official documents, including student report cards.\u201cWe don\u2019t think we denied her individual identity,\u201d Mr. Takase said in an interview. In court documents, the school argued that the teacher\u2019s married name was \u201cthe best way to identify an individual.\u201d\u201cThe desire of the plaintiff to use her commonly known name, which is different from her legal name, is not legally protected,\u201d the school said.Critics also say the law trails the private sector, which has been accommodating more women who prefer to use their birth surnames professionally. According to a 2013 survey of large firms by the Institute of Labor Administration, a think tank in Tokyo, nearly two-thirds of the respondents allowed women to use their given names at work, up from fewer than 20 percent in 1995.Some advocates say it is fundamentally about choice.\u201cI don\u2019t want to make a law where every couple has to use two different names,\u201d said Kimie Iwata, president of the Japan Institute for Women\u2019s Empowerment and Diversity Management. \u201cBut I want the society to make a law that is generous to everyone and accepts diversity.\u201dSeiko Noda, a member of the House of Representatives from the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said she had advocated the right to separate surnames for a quarter-century. \u201cWe lawmakers have to destroy this wrong practice,\u201d Ms. Noda said, lamenting that many of her fellow Liberal Democrats did not care about overturning the law.Ms. Noda\u2019s husband, formerly Fuminobu Kimura, took her last name.\u201cWhenever he has bad luck, he always complains, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s because my surname changed,\u2019\u201d Ms. Noda said. She said he now supported an overhaul of the marital naming law. \u201cHe understands how much burden women had to go through,\u201d she said.Public opinion polls show a significant shift in views on married couples using a single surname. In 1976, close to two-thirds surveyed by the Ministry of Justice said the law was fine as is; that had dropped to just over one-third in 2012.In the absence of legal reform, some couples choose not to legally register their marriages, even though women in such relationships have fewer legal protections.Mizuho Fukushima, 60, a member of the upper house of Parliament from the Social Democratic Party who has repeatedly proposed a revision of the single-surname law, said she had remained in a common-law marriage for nearly four decades with Yuichi Kaido, a lawyer with whom she has a daughter.\u201cWhen I met him, I was Mizuho Fukushima, and my identity is Mizuho Fukushima,\u201d she said.A younger generation of working women say their original surnames carry professional clout that they do not want to lose when they marry.\u201cMy name is my brand,\u201d said Miyuki Inoue, 28, who works in sales at a human resources consulting firm. She married three years ago but continues to use her original surname at the office.\u201cI don\u2019t want to waste the trust and good reputation that I\u2019ve built in my career,\u201d she said.Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Venezuelan Lawmakers Vote to Put President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Trial", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuela\u2019s opposition-led National Assembly voted on Tuesday to put President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on political trial, but the legislature\u2019s dwindling power means the decision will likely have no practical effect.The vote was an attempt to put new pressure on Mr. Maduro a day before the opposition planned a show of force on the streets.The legislature charged Mr. Maduro with abandoning the presidency and carrying out a coup against the Constitution.\u201cLet him respond for the actions that have destroyed, broken, denied the right to choose in a democracy,\u201d said Julio Borges, the leader of the Assembly\u2019s opposition bloc.In response to the vote, Edwin Rojas, a lawmaker from Mr. Maduro\u2019s Socialist Party, said, \u201cThis is a cheap copy of impeachment.\u201d Referring to the impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, he added, \u201cWe are not Brazil.\u201dVenezuela\u2019s political turmoil has grown more intractable by the day, with the opposition reacting furiously to a decision by the Electoral Council last week that blocked a drive for a referendum to recall Mr. Maduro.Despite winning control of the Assembly in elections in December, the opposition has been effectively sidelined by a series of rulings in the courts, which are controlled by Mr. Maduro\u2019s leftist government.Any vote in the legislature against Mr. Maduro is likely to be rejected by the courts.The referendum had been seen as the most effective legal avenue to challenge Mr. Maduro\u2019s increasingly autocratic rule, which many Venezuelans blame for the collapsing economy.Polls have shown that an overwhelming majority of Venezuelans would vote to remove him.Addressing a crowd outside the presidential palace on Tuesday, Mr. Maduro disregarded the Assembly vote. Instead, he blamed President Obama for Venezuela\u2019s political standoff.\u201cThese attacks from the right are an attack by Obama because he is close to leaving,\u201d Mr. Maduro said.He also invited the opposition president of the National Assembly, Henry Ramos Allup, to meet with him and other members of the government.As he spoke, the crowd chanted, \u201cDissolve the Assembly!\u201dBut leading opposition figures said they would not take part in the session, suggesting instead that the government wanted to buy time by agreeing to discussions.\u201cIn a possible dialogue, the opposition has nothing to offer, only to demand,\u201d Mr. Ramos said.As the crisis mounted, the army came down squarely in support of Mr. Maduro. A statement signed by Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez declared that the opposition\u2019s \u201ctrue purpose\u201d is create \u201cchaos and anarchy\u201d to overthrow Mr. Maduro, \u201cto whom we reiterate our unconditional loyalty and unbreakable commitment.\u201dAna Vanessa Herrero reported from Caracas, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberal Economists Think Big Companies Are Too Powerful. Hillary Clinton Agrees.", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThat\u2019s what makes Hillary Clinton\u2019s new comments about corporate power and antitrust law important.Her campaign has embraced an emerging line of thought in left-of-center economic circles: that a big part of what ails the United States economy are policies that have allowed the biggest companies to become too big and too powerful, resulting in less competition, less opportunity for entrepreneurship, and lower levels of investment and compensation for workers.Notably, this is an area of economic policy in which the president has great leeway to act. If you want huge spending on public infrastructure or subsidies for college, Congress needs to agree; if you want more aggressive antitrust enforcement, you need only appoint the right people to key jobs at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.The campaign frames her efforts as being all about giving smaller companies a better shot against the big guys \u2014 \u201crewarding innovation and entrepreneurship in the private sector,\u201d as the fact sheet puts it. Besides aggressively questioning proposed mergers, Mrs. Clinton intends to appoint antitrust officials who will retrospectively analyze past deals and potential \u201cexploitation of excessive market power where it already exists.\u201dIn other words, she wants even companies that have already attained enormous market share to know that the government will be watching how they use that power.With the proposal, Mrs. Clinton taps into a stream of research from left-leaning economists and lawyers over the last few years, including the Obama White House, that frames excessive market power for large companies as a key culprit of many of the United States\u2019 economic problems.It\u2019s not a given that these shifts are entirely, or even mostly, because antitrust enforcers turn a blind eye to industry consolidation. These trends may be connected to technological shifts that create \u201creturns to scale,\u201d or major competitive advantages that accrue to being the biggest company in an industry. They can relate to the \u201cnetwork effects\u201d that mean a product becomes more valuable the more people use it.Those arguments might help explain why Boeing and Airbus are the only makers of commercial jumbo jets, or why Facebook has such a huge share of the social networking market. But those arguments are harder to mount in some sectors, and that\u2019s where Mrs. Clinton has aimed her fire.Of course, companies seeking to merge would fight in court against more activist regulators who try to stop them. And some mergers can create companies that are more efficient and can produce a broad range of consumer benefits.But it\u2019s now evident that a Clinton administration would embrace the idea that the biggest companies shouldn\u2019t get any bigger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chavismo Full Circle", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Venezuela\u2019s opposition movement is promising to follow its huge march last week with a march this week to the Presidential Palace to demand the restitution of the recently shut down recall referendum. The government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has mobilized its followers to defend the revolution in the streets. It is a confrontation unlikely to have a happy ending.I first visited Venezuela in 1992, eight months after Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s failed coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. It was a desolate period. Not only was an economic crisis grinding at the spirits of the people, there was a sense that Venezuela\u2019s political elite was irremediably out of touch with the population, and doing what it could to prevent change.I never considered myself a Ch\u00e1vez supporter \u2014 I\u2019m too much of a classical liberal for that. From the beginning I thought his style of social policy was unsustainable, his critique of liberal democracy simplistic, and his campaign against corruption misconceived. But I greatly admired the ability of a \u201cpoor people\u2019s movement\u201d to use electoral democracy to turn the tables on Venezuelan society. Through 2012 the data is clear. Poverty and inequality declined and people rewarded Chavismo with large electoral majorities.I last visited Venezuela this month. I was struck by how many people I have known for decades had suddenly lost weight. In normal circumstances, an adult dropping 20 or 30 pounds generates congratulations and admiration for exercising self-control. But in the current context such weight loss prompts silence and quiet admiration for someone who is prioritizing their children at mealtime.But apparently even this limited access was too threatening. On Oct. 20, the Electoral Council indefinitely postponed the signature collection, on the most dubious of grounds. The government appeared to fear the optics of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans being turned away from the voting centers, and the mass protests that could have generated.Hence Chavismo has come full circle. From a movement that showed how nonelite actors could use the instruments of electoral democracy to upend an entrenched elite, Chavismo has itself become an entrenched elite preventing those same instruments from upending it.This is not only a violation of Venezuela\u2019s Constitution, it is a violation of one of the most basic of human rights, the right of people to choose their leaders.Effective international engagement must be multilateral, preferably working through existing institutions. While Venezuela has long dismissed the Organization of American States as an imperialist tool, Secretary General Luis Almagro\u2019s invocation of the Democratic Charter in June seriously got their attention. That initiative needs to be taken up again. The Union of Southern Nations does not have the institutional strength the O.A.S. has, but it has the government\u2019s ear. Venezuela has embraced its role in the United Nations and would find it difficult to deflect a special envoy. Perhaps the only thing the opposition and the government have agreed on this year is the desirability of Vatican mediation in Venezuela.Any dialogue that occurs should not be seen as an alternative to the referendum but should focus primarily on restoring the people\u2019s right to choose their leaders. Debate regarding the economy, education and crime would serve only as a red herring for a government that is doing whatever it can to prevent change.David Smilde is a professor of sociology at Tulane University and a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Behind a Rise in Ethnic Nationalism? Maybe the Economy", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewGlobal economic weakness and a rise in inequality appear to be causing a disturbing growth in ethnic nationalism.Leaders today often do not openly declare themselves to be ethnic nationalists \u2014 in which identity is defined by perceived genetic, religious or linguistic heritage rather than democratic ideals or principles. But political appeals to such forms of identity are nevertheless widespread.In the United States, despite his attempts to woo minority voters, Donald J. Trump appears to derive support from such sentiment. In Moscow, Vladimir V. Putin has used Russian nationalist sentiment to inspire many of his countrymen. And we see growing ethnic political parties inspired by national identity in other countries.It is natural to ask whether something so broad might have a common cause, other than the obvious circumstantial causes like the gradual fading of memories about the horrors of ethnic conflict in World War II or the rise in this century of forms of violent ethnic terrorism. Economics is my specialty, and I think economic factors may explain at least part of the trend.In the United States, while the unemployment rate is relatively low, the Federal Reserve has so far had to keep interest rates near zero to keep unemployment down. It\u2019s the same or worse in many other countries.But the modest slowdown could be a big part of the explanation for the apparent rise of ethnic nationalism, if combined with another factor: rising inequality, along with considerable fear about future inequality.The numbers are stark. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, earnings have been basically static. In the bureau\u2019s language, \u201cmedian usual weekly earnings \u2014 in constant (1982-84) dollars (employed full time)\u201d has hardly grown in a generation. The total increase since this data series began in 1979 has been only 1.2 percent, or 0.03 percent a year. The increase has been less than 1 percent since 2007. Even such paltry economic growth is going to the very top, not to the median wage earner. That means that roughly half of full-time wage earners are doing less well in real terms than their parents were.Ethnic nationalism creates an ego-preserving excuse for self-perceived personal failure: Other groups are blamed for bad behavior and conspiracies. Often, ethnic, racial or religious conflict follows. Among the horrific examples are the atrocities committed in the name of nationalism during World War II \u2014 not coincidentally following the Great Depression. Mr. Friedman provides other such instances from the last two centuries in which ethnic conflict followed slow economic growth.He does point out many exceptions to these generalizations: Some poor and unequal societies experience very little violence. But it appears that a sense of falling behind economically among a substantial segment of a population does encourage ethnic nationalism and conflict.The rise in inequality in our time represents a seismic shift in economic power away from the working class. Its cause is many-faceted, including globalization, the decline of labor unions, changes in political alignments and advancing information technology that is replacing jobs.Even those who have not lost out yet in terms of economic power are fearful that they might. The causes of inequality, particularly advances in information technology, are not going away soon. These perceptions have damaged people\u2019s sense of economic security, even beyond what economic data reveal to be objectively true.Both were accompanied by increases in borrowing by low- to middle-income people, who tried to maintain their standards of living. High-income people, described by the authors as desiring wealth for its own sake, did the lending. The loans attracted investors because high rates of interest compensated them for the risk of default.Linking these causes to the rise of ethnic nationalism is imprecise; these factors reflect a long-term loss of confidence. Such fears are often vague and ill formed, but their effects are powerful.There are some remedies, even if they are not popular or easily executed.Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposals to raise taxes on those with the very highest incomes to fund programs for lower-income people, for example, may not generate much enthusiasm from those whose incomes have not grown as expected and who may be doing less well than their parents. That is because many people do not like the sound of a proposed handout even if it might help them; they aspire to prove their own worth by earning a good income, and yet that prospect eludes them.But something has to be done about the two trends of rising inequality and weak economic growth, for if they continue we may see more unhappiness, discontent and political disruption. Substantial fiscal stimulus might be helpful, but it has been blocked. Making the tax system progressive enough to break the trend toward ever greater income inequality has also been beyond our grasp, yet it may be the best option we have.ROBERT J.

{"Headline": "SoftBank and Saudi Arabia Partner to Form Giant Investment Fund", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 SoftBank of Japan has already earned a reputation as one of the most ambitious technology companies around, unafraid to strike huge deals.Now the conglomerate is aiming to become one of the world\u2019s biggest investors in tech \u2014 potentially with the help of Saudi Arabia.SoftBank will invest at least $25 billion into what\u2019s provisionally called the SoftBank Vision Fund over the next five years, while Saudi Arabia is weighing putting in at least $45 billion. They may draw in other partners who could eventually push the fund\u2019s size to its maximum.It is an ambitious effort by SoftBank and its billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son, to expand the company\u2019s footprint worldwide. The Japanese company, best known for its ownership of a telecommunications network in its home country and Sprint in the United States, has also made investments and acquisitions around the world.\u201cWith the establishment of the SoftBank Vision Fund, we will be able to step up investments in technology companies globally,\u201d Mr. Son said in a statement. \u201cOver the next decade, the SoftBank Vision Fund will be the biggest investor in the technology sector.\u201dSaudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which is leading the investment in the SoftBank Vision Fund, has been looking to diversify its portfolio beyond oil assets. The kingdom\u2019s fund is expected to swell to more than $2 trillion after the country\u2019s state-owned oil producer, Aramco, goes public in the next several years.\u201cThe Public Investment Fund is focused on achieving attractive long-term financial returns from its investments at home and abroad, as well as supporting the kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030 strategy to develop a diversified economy,\u201d Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince and chairman of the Public Investment Fund, said in a statement.The SoftBank Vision Fund will be led by Rajeev Misra, SoftBank\u2019s head of strategic finance, and will be based in Britain.

Can Britain leave the European Union and still be a part of the single market, or just have \u201caccess\u201d to it, and of what kind?Simply put, the single market is the zone of free movement that the European Union created, where goods, services, capital and people can flow from place to place and nation to nation without impediment at internal borders. It began as a duty-free \u201ccommon market,\u201d but it has become much more.The single market means that a citizen of any of the (still) 28 member states has the right to travel to and live and work in any other member nation, and to buy, sell and invest there without paying any more taxes than the locals do. It encompasses some 500 million people and 21 million small- and medium-size enterprises, worth more than $11.5 trillion.At least, that\u2019s what it is in principle.In fact, considerable barriers still exist that make it harder to take advantage of the single market than one might expect. For example, car prices are often fairly low in Slovakia compared with other European states, but local taxes of various kinds tend to make a car bought there no great bargain by the time you get it home.Creating a single digital market has proved particularly difficult. Take major televised sports events like Premier League or Bundesliga soccer matches. National networks pay big fees for the rights to broadcast them, and they don\u2019t want their viewers to be able to see them more cheaply through a foreign subscription. In another example, everyone living in Britain must pay a license fee to support the BBC and watch it on any device, but they cannot connect outside Britain. Why not? And should Europeans living outside Britain have to pay, too?Even so, duty-free access to such a huge market is a boon, and it was a large part of why many big non-European companies like Nissan and J. P. Morgan chose to locate in Britain. Once Britain leaves the European Union, those companies\u2019 British operations will probably lose that easy access.Senior politicians who favored Brexit insisted that Britain could continue to enjoy the single market\u2019s free movement of goods, services and capital while restricting immigration and the free movement of people. But an \u00e0 la carte membership like that appears to be very unlikely.So some, like David Davis, the minister heading Britain\u2019s new Department for Exiting the European Union, favor a \u201chard Brexit,\u201d forgoing any effort to stay in the single market. Others, though, like the powerful chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, still seek a \u201csoft Brexit,\u201d hoping to negotiate at least partial access to the single market \u2014 whatever its flaws.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Global Trade War, Trump Edition", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byLet\u2019s take Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies at face value.As the world knows, Trump\u2019s rhetoric has found a receptive audience among angry white working-class voters who have lost well-paying jobs to automation and outsourcing.Trade comes with no assurances that the spoils will be shared equitably. Across much of the industrialized world, an outsize share of the winnings has been harvested by people with advanced degrees, stock options and the need for accountants. Ordinary laborers have borne the costs and suffered from joblessness and deepening economic anxiety.Policy makers and politicians, Goodman writes,failed to plan for the trauma that has accompanied the benefits of trade. When millions of workers lost paychecks to foreign competition, they lacked government supports to cushion the blow. As a result, seething anger is upending politics in Europe and North America.Along these lines, Trump has successfully appropriated an issue \u2014 the distributional impact of free trade \u2014 that was, in recent years, the turf of Democrats.The story of Trump\u2019s amazingly successful movement is also the story of how Democrats turned their backs on their working-class roots and sided with the elites on the crucial economic question of our times: Who would win from globalization, and who would lose?Gordon Hanson, an economics professor at the University of California, San Diego, emailed me his analysis of Trump\u2019s economic scheme:Trump\u2019s strategy is essentially one of withdrawal from the world economy. He wants less trade and less outward foreign investment. He offers no plans for how to improve our export performance. This is protectionism, pure and simple.Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at M.I.T.\u2019s Sloan School of Management, was more forceful:No nation can succeed by trying to protect the past from the future. We will succeed by having the confidence to embrace competition, and leveraging our comparative strengths, which are numerous. We have the largest, most productive and most technologically advanced economy that\u2019s ever existed on this planet. The more open the world economy is, the more we have an opportunity to leverage our many strengths.Looked at this way, Trump\u2019s stance is an implicit admission that he and his followers do not \u201cbelieve in America\u201d \u2014 an argument that the United States cannot compete successfully in the world arena unless protected by the imposition of high tariffs and punitive taxes on foreign production and foreign competitors.Robert Reich, an economist at Berkeley, former secretary of labor under Bill Clinton and a leading supporter of Bernie Sanders during the primaries, agrees.Trump\u2019s trade proposals, Reich argues,assume the U.S. can\u2019t compete and must erect trade barriers lest other countries flood America with better and cheaper products. That\u2019s the opposite of believing in America.I don\u2019t want you to do that. And if you do it, you\u2019re not going to have any cars coming across the border unless you pay a 35 percent tax.I\u2019m going to tell the head of Carrier: \u201cI hope you enjoy your stay in Mexico folks. But every single unit that you make and send across our border, which now will be real, you\u2019re going to pay a 35 percent tax.\u201dAndrew McAfee, a director of M.I.T.\u2019s Initiative on the Digital Economy and co-author of \u201cThe Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies,\u201d was sharply critical of Trump. In an email, McAfee wrote:There\u2019s a reason that all good economists support free trade, and that none of them are supporting Trump\u2019s proposals. The reason is that trade gives us more and better access to goods and services than we could produce on our own. It also provides jobs for exporters, people working in airports and ports, and so on.Free trade is not surrender, and not something that only suckers do. In fact, just the opposite. Closing our borders would be surrender to a nonexistent enemy. It would make us poorer without bringing back the jobs.Smoot-Hawley raised tariffs across the board, with every trading partner. The results were disastrous for the world economy, let alone for the U.S. at the opening stage of the Great Depression. A worldwide trade war commenced, and international trade was shattered. Trump so far has proposed only sharp tariff hikes with Mexico and China \u2014 but these are two of the three largest sources of U.S. imports.The general shift on the left and right toward contesting free trade agreements poses substantial dangers to the American economy.Once the advances in robotics are achieved, Acemoglu wrote,many of the tasks now offshored to China or other low-wage economies can be performed even more economically by robots in the United States. This won\u2019t bring back the semi-skilled jobs that have left (and gone for good whatever Trump says he will do) but might just ensure that a whole slew of non-production jobs and supporting production jobs surrounding these tasks locate back to the United States.how we need to adjust in the face of the next wave of technologies of automation, robotics and artificial intelligence, which will likely increase our productivity but require huge adjustments on the labor side.this adjustment will take the form of large declines in employment and pervasive joblessness. If we are prepared, we have a chance of turning it into more impressive productivity improvements and shared gains.That said, Rodrik has no enthusiasm for Trump\u2019s proposals. In an email, Rodrik wrote:Trump has a vastly exaggerated sense of the contribution of trade and trade policy to the decline of manufacturing in the U.S. In terms of real manufacturing output, the U.S. has actually done pretty well.In the case of manufacturing employment, however, Rodrik argues thatthere is virtually nothing you can do with trade policy \u2014 short of stopping technological change \u2014 that is going to bring substantial manufacturing employment back to the U.S.He noted that every time Trump\u2019s poll numbers have gone up, the value of the Mexican peso has gone down. As a result, imports from Mexico have grown, while exports from the United States to Mexico have fallen, putting thousands of Americans out of work:The inadvertent consequence has been that we are today running a trade deficit that is tens of billions of dollars worse because of the destabilization of the Mexican peso.If the United States were to impose a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports, according to Summers, the economies of both countries would suffer:It would be one of the best things that ever happened for Asian and European competitors.Globalization isn\u2019t going away. The first thing to realize is that, despite Trump\u2019s nostalgia for a bygone era when the United States was insulated from global trade, stopping or slowing trade is not at issue.Worldwide, trade has \u201cgrown from 25 percent of global G.D.P. in the mid-1960s to 60 percent today,\u201d Wallach and Bernstein write, and in the United States, it has grown from 10 percent to 30 percent.Instead of trying to halt globalization, Bernstein and Wallach call for new \u201crules of the road\u201d that protectthe economic needs of low- and middle-income families while preserving the democratic, accountable policy making processes that are essential to creating and maintaining the environmental, consumer, labor, and human-rights policies on which we all rely.Trump\u2019s trade proposals reflect his bullying style and his technologically uninformed approach to tackling America\u2019s competitive vulnerabilities.This is not the only area where the danger of his utter incomprehension lies. But it is the one on which he has staked his claim to the presidency. With his trade policies, as with pretty much everything else, his backward-looking, intellectually bankrupt agenda will take us very far from the promised land.Advertisement"}

Goldman is expected to lay off a significant number of its bankers in Asia. (Mr. Schwartz\u2019s plans were unrelated to those issues.)He has catered to some of the firm\u2019s biggest clients, including the Alibaba Group of China and SoftBank of Japan. Mr. Schwartz was one of Goldman\u2019s point men on Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion initial public offering, the biggest on record, and was on hand at the New York Stock Exchange when the Chinese e-commerce behemoth began trading.Over his career, Mr. Schwartz became an influential member of Goldman\u2019s inner circle, spearheading some of the firm\u2019s biggest businesses. He joined Goldman in 1979 and later founded the firm\u2019s high-yield debt department. He was made partner in 1988. He later led its global debt capital markets business from 1991 to 1997.Mr. Schwartz later moved to Asia, becoming president of Goldman Sachs Japan and then assuming the chairman role for the Asia Pacific region from 1999 to 2001. He then left the firm in 2001 to work for George Soros\u2019s hedge fund, later becoming its chief executive from 2003 to 2004.The banker then co-founded MissionPoint Capital, an investment firm focused on clean energy, before returning to Goldman as chairman of the Asia Pacific region, but moved the position to Beijing.\u201cMark\u2019s leadership, expertise and focus on client service have been invaluable in further integrating our activities across Asia Pacific, building on previous successes and advancing our leading franchise in the region,\u201d Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chief executive, and Gary D. Cohn, the firm\u2019s president, wrote in the internal memo.\u201cOver the years, Mark has demonstrated an unwavering focus on supporting and enhancing Goldman Sachs\u2019 culture, reminding us that the caliber of our people, combined with our history of serving clients, has differentiated us in our efforts to build successful businesses across geographies.\u201dUpon retiring, Mr. Schwartz will become a senior director.After 27 years of distinguished service, Mark Schwartz, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific and vice chairman of the firm, has decided to retire at the end of the year. We are pleased that he will become a senior director at that time. Ken Hitchner will remain president of Goldman Sachs in Asia Pacific Ex-Japan and Masa Mochida will continue to serve as president of Goldman Sachs Japan.Throughout most of his tenure at Goldman Sachs, Mark played an instrumental role in shaping our strategy in Asia Pacific, first as president of Goldman Sachs Japan from 1997 to 1999, based in Tokyo, and later as chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific, a role he held until 2001. He reprised that role in 2012 and relocated to Beijing.

{"Headline": "What Happened to North Carolina?", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byNotebookIn late September, the skies opened over North Carolina. The remnants of Tropical Storm Julia crashed into Bertie County, on the Albemarle Sound inside the barrier islands of the Outer Banks, sending cascades of muddy water into homes and stores and forcing officials to release a herd of bison kept at a local zoo. Gov. Pat McCrory diverted his increasingly struggling re-election campaign to tour the soggy town. He had barely had time to do so before another storm, 130 miles inland, sent several feet of water from the Cape Fear basin racing through Fayetteville.Among southern states, North Carolina would have seemed to be the least likely to find itself a flashpoint in the national debate over tolerance and inclusion. The state has long traded on a reputation of relative political moderation, or at least balance. From 1999 to 2003, voters sent both the archconservative Jesse Helms and the then-Democratic darling John Edwards to the United States Senate. The state went narrowly to Obama in 2008 and narrowly to Mitt Romney in 2012.But it is also Exhibit A of the partisan self-sorting that has defined national politics in recent decades; a trend that has produced violent mood swings. Its population is divided between the predominantly Democratic metropolitan areas surrounding powerful research universities, corporate centers and high-tech industries on one hand, and majority Republican voters in emptying towns struggling to survive the shuttering of once-dominant furniture, textile and tobacco industries on the other.The resulting Republican majority immediately moved to impose drastic abortion restrictions and curbs on same-sex marriage, along with new limits on voter access \u2014 disproportionately and, according to the federal courts, intentionally affecting black voters \u2014 and police accountability. These policies have predictably sharpened the state\u2019s partisan divide, but they have also more unexpectedly created a rift between what used to be the Republican Party\u2019s most durable bases: social conservatives and business. The man most clearly caught in the middle is Governor McCrory.Although McCrory made his national debut defending one of his state\u2019s radical new laws, until a few years ago North Carolinians knew him as the moderate mayor of Charlotte. A longtime employee of utility giant Duke Energy (he remained on the company\u2019s payroll throughout his 14 years as mayor), the Ohio native, raised outside Greensboro, N.C., was regarded as a business-boosting pragmatist. He was devoted to deregulation and corporate tax cuts and generally eschewed ideological fireworks. His signature issue was championing a light rail system, the first built in the state.When I met with McCrory on a porch at the executive mansion in late June, he did his best to distance himself from the recent activities of the state legislature. \u201cI\u2019m my own guy and that\u2019s my priority,\u201d he said, leaning back on a bench in his shirt sleeves. But the governor, for all of his efforts to project laid-back confidence, was in a maelstrom. The trouble had started in March, a few weeks after Charlotte\u2019s City Council revised its existing nondiscrimination ordinance to ensure businesses and public facilities such as hotels, restaurants and taxis couldn\u2019t discriminate against gay, lesbian or transgender customers. As widely understood, that would allow transgender people to enter the public restroom of their choice under the protection of the law.The irate conservative leaders of the state legislature, convinced this represented a threat to public safety, convened a one-day emergency session to overrule the ordinance. But the bill they drafted, the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act \u2014 better known as House Bill 2 \u2014 went much further than regulating bathrooms. H.B. 2 revoked every local nondiscrimination ordinance in the state, replacing them all with a single policy that explicitly excluded sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. It then expressly made it illegal for people to enter bathrooms in publicly funded facilities such as airports, schools and arenas that did not correspond to their \u201cbiological sex,\u201d which the law defined as the gender on their birth certificate.McCrory signed the bill that night. When I asked him why, he told me he had thought about Mike Pence, the Indiana governor who has since become Donald J. Trump\u2019s running mate. Pence courted national controversy in 2015 when he took three days to sign a bill that allowed Indianans to ignore some nondiscrimination protections on grounds of \u201creligious freedom.\u201dUnder threats of boycott from corporations, as well as the N.C.A.A., Pence signed an amendment granting limited protections based on race and sexual orientation, which made no one happy. Decisive action, McCrory thought, would keep L.G.B.T. rights groups like the Human Rights Campaign from turning H.B. 2 into a liability for his re-election bid against the longtime Democratic state attorney general, Roy Cooper. \u201cI knew it was a political setup,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m no fool.\u201dMcCrory also knew that, while he had to appeal to the conservative base that supported the bill, he had to keep the backing of suburban moderates who pushed him to victory in 2012. So he attempted some political tap-dancing, defending the controversial law as \u201ccommon sense\u201d even as he strongly implied that he had nothing to do with its creation.Throughout our interview, McCrory took pains to contrast himself with the social conservatives in the Statehouse down the street and highlighted his opposition to other conservative legislation including a \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill that more closely resembled Indiana\u2019s. McCrory also noted his refusal to call the special session in which H.B. 2 was passed. He stopped just short of suggesting his own party should lose seats in the fall. \u201cYou know a supermajority gives more power to the legislature than the executive branch,\u201d he said. \u201cYou talk to any governor and we\u2019re all going through the same thing.\u201d But Republican strategists in the state, as well as other officials and lobbyists who have talked with McCrory and his staff about the issue, told me the governor\u2019s office did take a leading role in pushing for the bill.Before McCrory signed the legislation, a lobbyist under contract with Apple tried to set up a phone call between the governor and an Apple executive to discuss it, said Darren G. Jackson, a Democratic state legislator who later met with the company\u2019s representatives. Apple is a major investor in North Carolina, operating a $3 billion iCloud data center and solar farm in Maiden. Tim Cook, its openly gay C.E.O. who went to business school at Duke University vehemently opposes the law.McCrory\u2019s office never responded to the request. (Apple declined to comment for this story.) Instead, McCrory\u2019s chief campaign strategist, Chris LaCivita \u2014 who organized the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against John Kerry in 2004 \u2014 wrote the contract lobbyist, who represents several firms opposed to the bill, and others trying to persuade legislators to vote against the law, to let them know he was watching them. \u201cPressure was being put on lobbyists and the business community to stay out of it,\u201d Jackson said. (LaCivita declined to comment on the emails.)One thing that does seem clear is that the business backlash took McCrory by surprise. \u201cNo one could have predicted the consequences\u201d of supporting H.B. 2, said Theresa Kostrzewa, an influential Raleigh-based Republican lobbyist who spoke with the governor while the bill was being debated. Not so long ago, business interests had usually been compatible with the social conservative agenda. But the politics of the business world have changed as power has moved away from industries like manufacturing into socially liberal centers like New York and Silicon Valley \u2014 a change reflected in North Carolina\u2019s own shifting economy.Most embarrassingly, the N.B.A. pulled its 2017 All-Star Weekend from Charlotte, canceling an event local leaders had spent years trying to attract, along with its expected influx of more than $100 million. The N.C.A.A. and Atlantic Coast Conference followed suit, pulling tournament games out of the state including the A.C.C. football championship.Behind the scenes, McCrory and some Republican lawmakers scrambled to undo the damage \u2014 trying to keep the NBA All-Star Game by promising a partial repeal and a process to address the \u201cbathroom issue.\u201d McCrory also issued a limited executive order extending L.G.B.T. protections to state employees. But small-town legislators weren\u2019t interested in negotiating. Neither they nor their constituents had much use for the big corporations and tech firms attracting new jobs to cities. They laughed off Charlotte\u2019s loss of what the president pro tempore of the Senate, Phil Berger, dismissed as an \u201cexhibition basketball game.\u201d Other legislators threatened to take back millions of dollars in tax breaks for American Airlines, a signatory of the Human Rights Campaignletter, which the governor had just lobbied for.\u201cWe want those companies here if they want to be part of North Carolina. If they want to turn North Carolina into California, they should go to California,\u201d Dan Forest, McCrory\u2019s separately elected and more conservative lieutenant governor, told me. Several efforts at repealing the bill fell apart as Republicans insisted Charlotte rescind its L.G.B.T.-friendly nondiscrimination ordinance first.With the state\u2019s economy and reputation in the balance, McCrory changed tactics. He began embracing the bill more strongly in public, joining legislative leaders in trying to shift blame to the Charlotte City Council for passing protections in the first place. He even started doing something that would have been unthinkable just four years ago: lashing out at his former corporate allies.He blasted the N.B.A. for being a member of the \u201cthe sports and entertainment elite\u201d and accused them of banding with Cooper and the \u201cliberal media\u201d to impose \u201ctheir political will.\u201d When investors led by Trillium Asset Management issued their warning about the economic consequences of the state\u2019s politics, McCrory mocked them as \u201cNew York hedge fund billionaires\u201d and said they had \u201chosed everyday working North Carolinians.\u201d (There were no hedge funds involved in the statement, Trillium spokeswoman Caroline White said. Trillium has an office in Durham.)North Carolina also found itself defending H.B. 2 in federal suits brought by the Justice Department, the American Civil Liberties Union and several transgender plaintiffs, who won a limited injunction in late summer. The full trial is scheduled for mid-November, after the presidential election.The costs of the backlash are becoming politically obvious. Polls consistently find that a majority of North Carolinians believes H.B. 2 has hurt the state\u2019s economy and reputation, even though slight majorities also still oppose letting transgender people use the bathrooms of their choice. In a late August poll from Monmouth University of likely voters, the approval rate for H.B. 2 had fallen to 36 percent. Cooper got the support of 72 percent who disapproved of the law. In an early September trip to Charlotte, Hillary Clinton used the opportunity to hit McCrory with the specter of H.B. 2, saying, \u201cDiscrimination is not only wrong, it\u2019s bad for business.\u201dNorth Carolina\u2019s state government is a liability on many fronts \u2014 even the weather. When Cooper refused to defend H.B. 2 in court, lawmakers voted to pull half a million dollars from the state disaster relief fund to pay legal fees. McCrory refused to sign that bill, which became law without his signature. The floods hit a few weeks later. Yet another law the state legislature passed in 2012 prohibited state coastal planning officials from taking into account the effects of sea-level rise because of climate change. When I contacted McCrory\u2019s press office this week, a spokesman told me the governor was extremely busy trying to preparing for the possibility of more floods; Hurricane Matthew was advancing up the Atlantic Coast.Jonathan M.

What specific action will you take in the next four years?\u2022 What would you do to reduce the extreme income inequality in this country?\u2022 What would your administration do to reduce gun violence and mass shootings?The Times\u2019 Editorial Board posed these three questions to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. Here are the answers from their campaigns.1. It is widely accepted scientific fact that climate change is real and potentially catastrophic. What specific action will you take in the next four years?Some nation is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. It\u2019s either going to be Germany, China or us, and I want to make sure that it\u2019s us. And we can do it in a way that means no one gets left out or left behind.I\u2019ve laid out specific plans to modernize our electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in America within a decade, including 500 million solar panels by the end of my first term. I want to launch a Clean Energy Challenge to partner with cities, states, and rural communities that are ready to lead on clean energy, clean transportation, and energy efficiency, and help them go further.We\u2019ll invest in resilient infrastructure that will protect communities like those in North Carolina, Iowa, and Louisiana that have seen terrible floods just this year. We know that low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately affected by pollution and by extreme weather, and climate change is only going to make that worse. So I will make environmental and climate justice a priority, including eliminating lead as a major public health threat within five years.We\u2019re already less dependent on foreign oil than we have been in decades, but we can go further, reduce oil consumption by a third, and do more to power America with home-grown wind, solar, and advanced biofuels.And I have a real plan to invest in creating jobs and building stronger economies in coal country. America\u2019s coal communities have kept our lights on and our factories running for generations, and I won\u2019t let them be left in the dark.Finally, I believe the United States needs to continue to lead the global effort to combat climate change. I will fulfill the pledge President Obama made in the Paris Climate Agreement and seek to go further by cutting emissions up to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. We need to implement the breakthrough we achieved just last week in the Montreal Protocol to phase down super-polluting HFCs and avoid as much as half a degree of warming.Not only does America need to lead, we need to do more to work with our neighbors. We trade more energy with Canada and Mexico than with the rest of the world combined. That\u2019s why I want to negotiate a North American Climate Compact to cut emissions and accelerate the clean energy transition across the continent.I won\u2019t let the climate deniers stand in the way of progress, or let us give in to the climate defeatists who say this challenge is too big to solve. We can and will take on climate change, build a clean energy economy, and leave our kids and grandkids a safe and healthy world\u2014because there is no Planet B.2. What would you do to reduce the extreme income inequality in this country?But the majority of the income growth since the Great Recession has gone to people at the top. Working people haven\u2019t gotten a raise in 15 years. Right now, the top one-tenth of one percent of Americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent combined. We haven\u2019t seen this level of wealth inequality since right before the Great Depression.Even after the first debate, many issues haven\u2019t been adequately addressed. Which are most important to you?We need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. For starters, I\u2019ll raise the federal minimum wage and guarantee equal pay for women. And we\u2019ll promote profit-sharing\u2014the workers who help make their companies profitable should be able to share in that success the way executives do.We need to create more good jobs that pay enough to raise a family. So we\u2019ll make the biggest investment in good jobs since World War II\u2014jobs in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and clean energy. We need to make sure that jobs in home health care, child care, and other fields provide good pay and good benefits, and make it easier for workers to organize and bargain collectively in all industries. We need to do more to support small businesses that create so many new jobs. And we need to make it easier for people to be good employees and good parents by guaranteeing 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for every worker.We also need to go after intergenerational poverty. Every child in America should be able to live up to his or her God-given potential, no matter who your parents are or what ZIP code you grew up in. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to make pre-school universal for every four-year-old in America.It\u2019s also why we\u2019re going to embrace approaches like South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn\u2019s 10-20-30 plan, where 10 percent of federal investments are made in communities where 20 percent of the people have been living in poverty for the last 30 years. Let\u2019s address the systemic problems that have kept too many in poverty for far too long.Lastly, we need more fairness in our tax system. By closing the loopholes and requiring those at the top to pay their fair share in taxes, we can help cover the cost of vital investments that will create jobs and opportunity for middle-class families and help lift millions out of poverty. Around two-thirds of the burden of my tax plan falls on the highest earning 0.1 percent of taxpayers.Here\u2019s what we won\u2019t do. We won\u2019t raise taxes on people making less than $250,000. And we won\u2019t spend trillions of dollars giving huge new tax breaks to the wealthy and big corporations. They\u2019ve seen the gains in recent years\u2014they should pay their fair share to make the investments that will grow the economy for everyone.3. What would your administration do to reduce gun violence and mass shootings?I\u2019ve met some of their families, and countless others whose lives have been forever changed by gun violence. I\u2019ve traveled the country with mothers like Lucy McBath, whose 17-year-old son Jordan was shot and killed for playing music. I\u2019ve been inspired by advocates like Erica Smegielski, whose mother Dawn died trying to protect her students at Sandy Hook School. And I\u2019ve prayed with residents in cities like Charleston, one of the many communities across our country that have been devastated by this epidemic.For decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But as I\u2019ve listened to the stories in every corner of our country, one question has stayed at the front of my mind: How can we just stand by and do nothing?That simple answer is: We can\u2019t.So here\u2019s what I think we need to do. First, we need to expand background checks to include more gun sales, like those at gun shows and over the Internet. There\u2019s no reason a domestic abuser should be able to go online and buy a gun with no questions asked. And we need to close other loopholes, like the so-called \u201cCharleston Loophole\u201d that allows dangerous people to buy guns without a background check if that check isn\u2019t completed within three days.Second, we need to hold the gun industry accountable, and end laws that shield them from liability when they break the law. We saw that just this month, when one of those laws was used to block the families of the Sandy Hook shooting from having their day in court.Finally, we need to keep military-style weapons off our streets. They are a danger to law enforcement and to our communities.By taking these common sense steps, we can keep our children safe and respect the Second Amendment. The vast majority of Americans support measures like these. So our challenge isn\u2019t finding common ground. It\u2019s getting politicians to listen to their constituents rather than the gun lobby.For that to happen we need to say, loudly and clearly, that gun violence is an issue that matters. And we need to vote accordingly.This article has been updated since its initial publication to include Donald Trump\u2019s responses. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pizzas, Pony Rides and Dolphin Shows: Balms for North Korea\u2019s Elite", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byPyongyang JournalPYONGYANG, North Korea \u2014 Towering apartment blocks line the gleaming, six-lane avenue known as Future Scientists Street, their boldly colored facades leaping from the drab hues that dominate the rest of Pyongyang\u2019s skyline.At street level, there are electronics stores, a movie theater and a new pizzeria, where visitors are welcomed by young waitresses in bright red uniforms.A pizza costs about $8, and a pasta entree less than half that. There is a bright aquarium near the entrance, but it is devoid of life \u2014 much like the restaurant, which was eerily quiet the night I visited.There are cafes and bars, tennis courts and gyms. There is a bowling alley and a fancy supermarket, a new dolphinarium and a water park. A half-hour\u2019s drive from downtown Pyongyang, the Mirim Riding Club boasts 120 horses \u2014 including Orlov Trotters sent as a gift by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 and charges $8 to ride them for an hour outdoors, $10 indoors.(Foreign visitors are generally first taken to the Revolutionary Site Education Room, a gallery that includes a giant photograph of Mr. Kim at age 4, in a pink cap and red mittens, playing with a horse. \u201cOur Grand Marshal Kim Jong-un always possessed a special gift with animals,\u201d a guide told me.)At the Rungna Dolphinarium, part of a larger amusement park on an island in the Taedong River, I joined an audience of more than 1,400 people who cheered as they watched spotted dolphins swim on their backs and jump through hoops.After the show, I tried to take a photograph of the performance area, but a guide assigned to me by the dolphinarium grabbed the camera and deleted the picture. \u201cYou can see the workers cleaning the stage, and they are not dressed smartly enough,\u201d she said before walking off.Later, I was taken to the Munsu Water Park, where families basked in sunny weather and children frolicked in pools that generate artificial waves. The staff members, dressed in svelte aquamarine uniforms, said about 5,000 people come every day, paying a 25-cent entrance fee and about $2.50 for every hour they spend in the facility\u2019s 26 pools.One of the park\u2019s hosts eagerly noted that Mr. Kim had inspected it while it was under construction to offer on-the-spot guidance. \u201cThe grand marshal insisted the park be managed for the people\u2019s convenience,\u201d she said with a smile.North Korea tentatively began introducing market forces into its economy more than a decade ago, but experts say the push appears to have accelerated since Mr. Kim, believed to be 32, succeeded his father in 2011.For the youngest scion of the Kim dynasty, introducing new amenities for the public is a way of highlighting the country\u2019s development under his rule and distinguishing himself from his predecessors, while also catering to an elite that is a key constituency for the regime.\u201cPyongyang\u2019s leisure infrastructures are populated by a m\u00e9lange of the traditional higher echelons of party and military, along with newer entrepreneurial social sectors, not of course forgetting their offspring,\u201d said Robert Winstanley-Chesters, who studies North Korean leisure spaces at Australian National University.Some observers estimate that as much as 15 percent of Pyongyang\u2019s population are members of the privileged class described by Mr. Winstanley-Chesters.\u201cThe best way to make money is to work for a large state company and demonstrate your capability and worth,\u201d said Andray Abrahamian of Choson Exchange, which conducts entrepreneurship workshops in North Korea. \u201cDemonstrating you can run or help run a spinoff subsidiary on your own is even better.\u201dSuch subsidiaries include real estate developments and projects in a limited number of special economic zones, as well as restaurants.My group of visitors had invited our minders and translators for a meal at Italy Pizza, and I sat next to a young man who identified himself, in fluent English, as a lecturer at the Pyongyang University of Foreign Languages. He told me he had been intrigued by pizzas ever since seeing them in English-language movies as a student.\u201cEven better than I expected!\u201d he exclaimed, beaming, after his first bite of a margherita slice.As we dined, a karaoke machine projected a slide show on a big screen with just two images, the name of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party and \u201c1950-1953,\u201d the years of the Korean War, both set against a background of the party seal. No one got up to sing.\u201cThere is an increasing demand among residents of Pyongyang for a wider range of dining options,\u201d said Calvin Chua, an architect based in Singapore who conducts design workshops in North Korea.Recently built establishments aiming to meet that demand include a trendy hamburger joint near the Tower of Immortality, built to commemorate the country\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung; a few cafes with varying d\u00e9cor and coffee quality; and several bars, including the Taedonggang Beer Bar No. 3, on the eastern bank of the Taedong.With dark wood finishing and a painting of Mount Paektu on its exposed brick walls, Taedonggang is a gaudy interpretation of a European pub. The bartender offered six varieties of local beer on tap but said he was out of a seventh \u2014 my guide\u2019s favorite, which he said had a hint of coffee flavor. I ordered No. 3, a dark ale that went down smoothly with French fries.When I visited the hamburger place on a weekend afternoon \u2014 the menu said it was owned by the Sogwang High-Tech Corporation but did not advertise a name for the restaurant \u2014 the only other patrons were young couples who looked like students.\u201cKim Il-sung University is nearby, so this has become a popular dating spot,\u201d my guide said. The couples, using their Arirang smartphones, made in North Korea and running a version of the Android operating system, snapped photos of their burgers before eating.The centerpiece of the North\u2019s efforts to impress outsiders is Future Scientists Street, where the showstopper is a curvaceous blue-and-white skyscraper, 53 floors high, topped with a golden orb.The apartment towers here are said to house professors and employees of the Kim Chaek University of Technology, but few buildings seem occupied \u2014 and even fewer seemed to have electricity when I walked by one evening.Asked why so many windows of the apartment blocks were dark while the building exteriors glittered from streetlights, my minder whispered, as if sharing a secret, that the residents were trying to conserve energy for the nation.At the end of another day, as we returned to the hotel, she pointed out the window of our bus and said, \u201cLook! It\u2019s Future Scientists Street.\u201d She noted how the street could be seen from afar because of its bright lights.The bright lights definitely made the street stand out. But that was because it was surrounded by darkness.Reporting for this article was facilitated through the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom Win Nobel in Economics for Work on Contracts", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byDr. Holmstrom, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has had a particular influence on executive pay practices. Dr. Hart, a professor at Harvard, has contributed to the debate about the outsourcing of public services like prisons and garbage collection.\u201cModern economies are held together by innumerable contracts,\u201d the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the prize, said Monday morning. \u201cTheir analysis of optimal contractual arrangements lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions.\u201dThe prize committee in recent years has shied away from grand economic theories, instead rewarding economists who develop careful insights about smaller questions. Macroeconomics, the field devoted to those broader questions, has fallen into something of an existential crisis in recent years. There is, for now, greater certainty about the value of work on a smaller scale.\u201cMuch of economics from the noneconomist perspective is about how governments run fiscal policy and monetary policy,\u201d said Patrick Bolton, an economist at Columbia University. \u201cThis is really thinking about economics from the ground up, from the small to the large.\u201dDr. Holmstrom\u2019s work has focused on employment contracts. Companies would like managers to behave as if they owned the place: working hard and minding costs while taking smart risks. Employees, on the other hand, would like to be paid as much as possible while working no harder than necessary. And performance is difficult to assess.Economists since Adam Smith have grappled with the conflicts inherent in the relationship between owners and employees. Dr. Holmstrom\u2019s work, beginning in the late 1970s, presented evidence that companies should tie pay to the broadest possible evaluation of an employee\u2019s performance. In later work, he focused on the benefits of simple contracts that mixed base pay with limited incentives.Dr. Hart\u2019s work begins from the observation that contracts are incomplete instruction manuals. They cannot specify what to do in every case. Instead, they must stipulate how decisions should be made.Dr. Holmstrom, speaking via an audio connection to a news conference hosted by the academy, said he had been \u201cvery surprised and very happy\u201d to get the news. Asked how his day was going, he said there was \u201ca sense of things being surreal.\u201dDr. Hart said he had hugged his wife, roused his son from sleep and spoken by phone with Dr. Holmstrom, a close friend whom he has known for years.\u201cI woke at about 4:40 and was wondering whether it was getting too late for it to be this year, but then fortunately the phone rang,\u201d Dr. Hart said.One implication of Dr. Holmstrom\u2019s work is that it makes sense to withhold some compensation for a time, to evaluate the results of a manager\u2019s work.Companies have turned increasingly to this kind of deferred compensation, particularly for senior executives.But his influence on compensation practices is limited. He has argued, for example, that companies should tie such evaluations to the stock market performance of their industry rather than focusing solely on the company\u2019s own stock price. It makes little sense to reward an executive for gains that reflect a broader change in the industry\u2019s fortunes, or to punish executives for setbacks beyond their control. But such advice has not become common practice.How eight winners got the word.Dr. Hart, in his own work, has explored the limits of contractual relationships.Consider the case of an electric company that needs to rewrite its contract with a coal mine because its needs have changed. Under some circumstances, Dr. Hart has shown, the utility would have been better off owning the mine from the beginning, to control the relationship.In other cases, contracts make more sense than ownership. Cities should outsource garbage collection, for example, Dr. Hart said in an interview on Monday.There is always a balance, he said, between saving money and losing control. The critical issue, he said, is often the extent to which a contract can account for unexpected challenges.\u201cA government wouldn\u2019t contract with a private company to carry out its foreign policy because it\u2019s just too difficult to specify in a contract how to carry out foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be crazy.\u201dDr. Holmstrom, 67, was born in Helsinki, Finland, and speaks Swedish well enough to answer questions in that language at Monday\u2019s news conference.In the early 1970s, he was working for a Finnish company that wanted to use computers to improve productivity. Dr. Holmstrom, sent to Stanford on a one-year fellowship, concluded that the real challenge was not programming but providing employees with proper incentives.He stayed to earn a Ph.D., and has been a professor at M.I.T. since 1994.\u201cHe will not let go until he\u2019s understood what you have to say,\u201d Dr. Bolton said. \u201cAnd most of the time, your argument fails. Which is an unpleasant experience as a student. But when you succeed, it gives you an incredible confidence.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the professor who said he was \u201cvery surprised and very happy\u201d to get the news of the Nobel award. It was Dr. Holmstrom, not \u201cDr. Holt.\u201d (There is no Dr. Holt among the winners.) Also because of an editing error, the article misidentified the developer of rules for executive pay. It was Dr. Holmstrom, not the other winner, Dr. Hart.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Haiti and Africa Projects Shed Light on Clinton\u2019s Public-Private Web", "Date": "2016-10-16", "News": "Supported byAs chief of staff and counselor to Hillary Clinton at the State Department, Cheryl D. Mills worked ceaselessly to help a South Korean garment maker open a factory in Haiti, the centerpiece of United States government efforts to jump-start the island nation\u2019s economy after the 2010 earthquake.Mr. Kim would later become important to Ms. Mills in a far more personal way \u2014 as a financial backer of a company she started after leaving the State Department in 2013. The company, BlackIvy Group, is pursuing infrastructure projects in Tanzania and Ghana, the only African nations in the \u201cPartnership for Growth,\u201d an Obama administration initiative that Mrs. Clinton helped introduce that promotes investment in developing countries.During Ms. Mills\u2019s tenure at the department, Mr. Kim\u2019s company, Sae-A, became a donor to the Clinton Foundation, through its Clinton Global Initiative, and Ms. Mills remained involved in foundation matters. According to emails hacked from the accounts of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, and released by WikiLeaks, Ms. Mills helped draft memos and consulted on internal organizational issues at the foundation, though she used her personal Gmail account and not her government email.Ms. Mills, 51, declined to be interviewed for this article, but Mr. London, a BlackIvy spokesman, said she had consulted with the State Department ethics office before accepting Mr. Kim\u2019s investment \u201cto ensure it was consistent with any rules that applied to her because of her service.\u201d\u201cMs. Mills and Mr. Kim met during her work for the State Department in Haiti during earthquake reconstruction,\u201d Mr. London said. \u201cShe had no personal business ventures and no discussions about any prospective business with Mr. Kim while she was at State.\u201dKaren Seo, a spokeswoman for Sae-A, said the State Department\u2019s assistance in Haiti played no role in Mr. Kim\u2019s decision to invest in BlackIvy. His discussions about making the investment began in \u201clate 2014,\u201d she said, more than a year after Ms. Mills had left the government.Ms. Seo said that Sae-A \u201ccurrently has no plans to invest in garment and textile manufacturing facilities in Africa,\u201d and that Ms. Mills had no business relationship with Sae-A outside of BlackIvy, adding that her appearance with Mr. Kim at the Sae-A factory opening in Costa Rica was of a social nature. \u201cMs. Mills was invited and came to the Costa Rica event as a friend, as did many others,\u201d she said.While at the State Department, Ms. Mills took the lead on a number of projects important to Mrs. Clinton, perhaps none more so than Haiti.Even before the January 2010 earthquake, the impoverished Caribbean nation was the focus of attention from the Clintons. Mr. Clinton, whose foundation is active there, had been named a United Nations special envoy to Haiti, and as early as April 2009, just a few months after becoming secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton was being forwarded emails from Ms. Mills containing economic development ideas.Some of those ideas were from Jean-Louis Warnholz, an economist whose consulting business provided \u201cintelligence on African markets.\u201d In emails and meetings with the Clintons and Ms. Mills, he advocated investment in textiles and agriculture as a way to create jobs, a theory that was fast-tracked in Haiti after the earthquake with a proposal for an industrial park anchored by a major garment factory.Ms. Mills soon hired Mr. Warnholz as her own adviser at the State Department \u2014 he would later join her at BlackIvy \u2014 and the two worked closely to push the industrial park concept. After overtures to another South Korean garment company fell through, Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Mills met with Sae-A Trading executives during a trip to Seoul to pitch the idea.Sae-A supplies clothing to some of the largest American retailers, including Walmart and Kohl\u2019s, and has been accused of illegal tactics against union organizers at a plant in Guatemala, charges the company disputes.Ultimately, the United States provided about $124 million to develop a power plant, housing and other improvements for the Haiti industrial park, while an international development bank contributed $100 million and the Haitians provided the land. Sae-A agreed to invest $78 million. Sae-A was blunt about the need to make the deal worth the money.\u201cThis is business,\u201d a company spokesman said at the time. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s about making a profit.\u201dIn addition to being good for Sae-A, the Haiti project recast the low-profile Mr. Kim as the sort of enlightened global capitalist the Clintons favor, earning him appearances at the Clinton Global Initiative and other international forums. When the industrial park opened for business in October 2012, the Clintons were on hand for the celebration. Mrs. Clinton thanked Mr. Kim \u201cfor everything that you and the leadership of Sae-A is doing,\u201d and she praised Ms. Mills for being the \u201creal driver of our government\u2019s support for everything that we see here today.\u201dSix months after she resigned from the State Department in February 2013, Ms. Mills incorporated BlackIvy Group. She has described it as a \u201cprivate operating company that builds commercial enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201dMr. Kim was among a handful of prominent investors in BlackIvy, according to a description that was once on BlackIvy\u2019s website but has since been removed. The deleted page carried the heading \u201cOur Team\u201d and listed, in addition to Mr. Kim: Continental Grain, a multinational agribusiness with operations in Haiti; Steve Case, the founder of AOL; the Wall Street financier John Mack; the hedge fund founder Raymond Dalio; and Beck, Mack & Oliver, an investment firm.The executive chairman of BlackIvy is Anthony Welters, a retired health insurance executive and longtime friend and mentor to Ms. Mills who has raised money for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. His son, Bryant, works for BlackIvy, and his wife, Beatrice Wilkinson Welters, was the American ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago from 2010 to 2012.In July, two BlackIvy representatives, including Bryant Welters, met with government leaders in Trinidad, part of what the prime minister\u2019s office there said was a visit to explore \u201cavenues for doing business with Trinidad and Tobago.\u201dAsked why BlackIvy was in the Caribbean, far outside its stated market areas in Africa, the company\u2019s spokesman, Mr. London, said it had nothing to do with Ms. Welters\u2019s connections as a former ambassador.BlackIvy, he said, was not actually seeking business in Trinidad, but met with companies there \u201cto learn about their successes in the region and to explore opportunities for them to establish operations in Ghana and replicate those successes.\u201dWhat BlackIvy has accomplished so far is not clear. It signed an agreement with officials in Tanzania to develop a transportation hub, but media reports there suggest it is progressing slowly.A Tanzanian government audit in March questioned how BlackIvy was chosen, saying \u201cthere was no evidence\u201d it was through a competitive bidding process. Mr. London said competitive bidding was not needed because BlackIvy\u2019s project is privately funded and there is no financial risk to the government.In Ghana, where BlackIvy has been pursuing an industrial park project, a PowerPoint presentation prepared by BlackIvy cited the country\u2019s low minimum wage as one of several competitive advantages that made Ghana \u201can ideal entry point to the West African market.\u201dDefending the model of attracting investment with promises of cheap labor, Mr. London offered an argument very similar to the one American officials made when explaining why Sae-A\u2019s factory would be good for Haiti.\u201cThe industrial park will increase manufacturing in Ghana \u2014 creating jobs and catalyzing growth \u2014 which benefits the country and investors,\u201d he said. \u201cWages usually rise when manufacturing sectors expand and produce higher-value goods, which is what we want to see in Ghana.\u201dBlackIvy\u2019s rationale did not sway labor advocates like Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, who had criticized the Haiti project as a misguided American relief effort that glossed over Sae-A\u2019s labor-relations history.\u201cWhen you urge garment manufacturers producing in countries like Bangladesh, where wages are far too low for workers to adequately support their families, to move production to countries with even lower wages, it undercuts the efforts of apparel workers across the Global South to persuade governments, employers and major apparel brands to lift wages to a decent level,\u201d Mr. Nova said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Specter of Trump Loosens Tongues, if Not Purse Strings, in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-10-16", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 After years of scorning the political process, Silicon Valley has leapt into the fray. The prospect of a President Donald J. Trump is pushing the tech community to move beyond its traditional role as donors and to embrace a new existence as agitators and activists.Getting involved in politics used to be seen as clashing with Silicon Valley\u2019s value system: You transform the world by making problems obsolete, not solving them through Washington. Nor did entrepreneurs want to alienate whatever segment of customers did not agree with them politically.Such reticence is no longer in style here.\u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of nerds not used to having a lot of limelight,\u201d said Dave McClure, an investor who runs a tech incubator called 500 Startups. \u201cBut to quote Spider-Man, \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019\u201dAn initial group of donors pledged $50,000; the goal was to ask the \u201cnerdz\u201d for small donations to match that sum. They have not come through yet. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of optimistic we\u2019ll get the other $50,000 in a few weeks,\u201d Mr. McClure said.That relatively slow pace reflects Silicon Valley\u2019s shifting position: Even as it becomes increasingly free with its opinions, it has been less free with its checkbook. The most recent data, from late August, shows Mrs. Clinton taking in $7.7 million from the tech community, according to Crowdpac, a start-up that tracks donations. By that point in 2012, Crowdpac says, President Obama had raised $21 million from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of the business networking site LinkedIn, offers a snapshot of Silicon Valley\u2019s evolving approach to politics.Mr. Hoffman\u2019s outright donations, however, have been smaller this election cycle. In May, he gave $400,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Asked if there was more recent giving that had not shown up in federal election records, Mr. Hoffman cryptically responded in an email, \u201cLooking at some PACs, etc.\u201d He declined several opportunities to elaborate.Even as Priorities USA has raised $133 million this election cycle, far exceeding its total in 2012, its tech contributions have dwindled. The only familiar tech name this time around is John Doerr of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, who gave $500,000.When he wrote the op-ed, he was uncertain about donating money to Mrs. Clinton, saying only that it was \u201cprobable.\u201d A spokeswoman said Sunday that Mr. Case gave $25,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund.Mason Harrison, Crowdpac\u2019s head of communications, offered a possible reason for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s less-than-robust support. \u201cDonors give to support candidates they love, not to defeat candidates they fear,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton is not as enthusiastic toward Silicon Valley and its disruptive ways.

Warns of Anti-Trade Sentiment Amid Weak Global Growth", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The International Monetary Fund has warned that sluggish economic growth throughout the world could bolster an anti-trade backlash that has become a feature of politics in both the United States and Europe.As part of the release of its October World Economic Report at the fund\u2019s semiannual meetings here, the fund forecast global growth to be 3.1 percent this year, rising to 3.4 percent in 2017.\u201cIt is vitally important to defend the prospects for increasing trade integration,\u201d said the fund\u2019s chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld. \u201cTurning back the clock on trade can only deepen and prolong the world economy\u2019s current doldrums.\u201dTwice a year, government officials, central bankers and financiers from around the world come together for a week of official and unofficial meetings in which they ponder the state of the global economy.The presidential election in the United States will be a talking point, but a weak global economy and the rise of anti-trade and anti-global sentiment are also expected to be popular subjects for discussion.The fund\u2019s outlook for growth in developed economies was particularly gloomy, with a 1.6 percent expansion expected for this year, compared with 2.1 percent last year.Emerging economies, expected to grow at a 4.1 percent clip, were largely driving global growth now, the fund\u2019s economists said.Highlighting concerns that many have about the United States economy\u2019s ability to attain a robust level of growth, the fund slashed its forecast for economic growth in the United States to 1.6 percent this year, from 2.2 percent in July.Coming eight years after the financial crisis and after a wave of aggressive policies by central banks around the world, these growth figures were disappointing, said the fund, which highlighted an inability of global policy makers to address fundamental economic weaknesses.Ms. Lagarde gave a speech in Chicago where she took an indirect swipe at the anti-trade language that has become a central part of the presidential campaign, calling policies that discouraged trade liberalization \u201ceconomic malpractice.\u201dIn its study, the fund took note of how figures for global trade have been on the wane of late.For example, the volume of world trade has expanded barely 3 percent a year since 2012, half of the growth it has seen over the last 30 years.A reluctance by companies and countries to invest significant sums in this period is a main culprit, the fund concluded. But economists also pointed to a sharp increase of all types of anti-trade measures in recent years, with last year recording the largest number of restrictions.As it always does, fund economists pushed for a globally coordinated strategy to increase output, with the focus being on open trade, economic reform and government investments.\u201cGrowth has been too low for too long,\u201d Mr. Obstfeld said at a news conference on Tuesday. Mr. Obstfeld said that across all regions, economies were underperforming their \u201clong term growth potential\u201d and that as a result, consumers and investors were stuck in a mode of excessive caution.In his comments, Mr. Obstfeld urged countries with the capacity to invest in large infrastructure projects to do so, a not-so-indirect reference to Germany, which has been frequently criticized by fund leadership for not doing enough to stimulate growth in Europe.\u201cThe policy response has been unbalanced, relying too much on central banks,\u201d he said.Asked what the impact would be on the global economy if the Republican presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, won the election, Mr. Obstfeld parsed his words carefully but suggested that some of Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-trade commentary had been cause for concern.\u201cThere has been a lot of discussion about changes to trade policies,\u201d Mr. Obstfeld said. \u201cThis introduces an element of uncertainty to the mix, and uncertainty is not great for investors.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As China Shifts From Exporter to Importer, Fortunes Change", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Zhou Bo was a born oilman.His parents work for a state oil company in the northeastern Chinese city of Daqing, and during at least one summer break when he was a child, he tagged along with his father, an oil engineer, on an exploration mission. Humming oil pumps stood near his school\u2019s playground, and propaganda posters stressing steady production were ubiquitous. By the age of 10, he could reel off the complicated crude extraction process.Now 22, Mr. Zhou is finishing a bachelor\u2019s degree in applied chemistry at a university in nearby Harbin. His parents had hoped it would land him a job in the oil sector back home. But now, with domestic oil production declining and the Daqing oil field exhausting its supply, he and his parents are having second thoughts.\u201cThe oil field will perhaps support the livelihood of my parents\u2019 generation, but it can\u2019t keep pumping out oil forever,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cEven my parents are telling me not to come back to find work.\u201dDaqing is home to China\u2019s biggest oil field, and the city\u2019s troubles reflect a broader reality for the country: Once a major exporter of oil, China is now one of the world\u2019s biggest net oil importers. Fields like Daqing are aging and becoming more expensive to pump, and buying oil elsewhere is often cheaper \u2014 and necessary to keep up with rising demand.The country is already the world\u2019s biggest auto market, and car sales continue to rise, driving gasoline sales higher. Demand for jet fuel is also strong as incomes advance and air travel becomes more affordable to a larger number of people.In many ways, Daqing epitomizes the changes.A provincial leader named the city Daqing, which means big celebration in Chinese, after the discovery of the oil field there in 1959 created a swell of national exuberance.In the decades since, the youths of Daqing followed in the footsteps of their forefathers. Destined for jobs in the petroleum industry, they are often nicknamed \u201cthe children of the oil field.\u201dThe workers were treated as national heroes, their stories widely celebrated in textbooks, plays and songs. The city itself became a national symbol of endurance and industrial advancement, with Mao Zedong famously declaring, \u201cIn industry, learn from Daqing.\u201dAnd the city wants that legacy to live on.Today, sleek oil museums stand to remind visitors of the glorious past, a former Chinese premier\u2019s calligraphy praising the Daqing spirit hangs in the city\u2019s petroleum university, and private tutoring schools post ads about courses tailored to job seekers in the oil industry.But with oil prices at less than half of their multiyear peaks, Daqing\u2019s oil boom has largely turned to dust.The oil field\u2019s production peaked about 20 years ago and has since been in a slow decline. The China National Petroleum Corporation, the Chinese oil company that runs the field, reported a 98 percent drop in net profit in the first half of the year compared with a year ago.At Daqing in particular, the situation is dire.In just the first two months of the year, the field had lost more than 5 billion renminbi, or around $750 million, Mr. Jiang said, and production costs were almost equal to prices on global markets, leaving a razor-thin profit margin.If current levels of oil output were maintained, the field would be completely depleted in about five years. Energy Aspects, a market research firm based in London, predicted that output at Daqing would decline 7.2 percent this year, its fastest pace in the last 20 years.And with oil revenues responsible for about half of Daqing\u2019s economy, that poor performance has hit hard. The city\u2019s gross domestic product contracted 2.3 percent last year, its first fall in economic growth in 30 years, the state-run China News Service reported, citing government data.A spokesman for Daqing oil field declined to comment.To make up for the falling domestic production, China has stepped up crude imports to unprecedented levels.Imports of crude rose 14 percent in the first half of the year compared with the period in 2015, according to customs data, pushing China\u2019s oil foreign dependency rate to a high of 64 percent.Those purchases have largely been driven by a group of private refiners who were granted crude import quotas last year. The move was part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to dilute the monopoly on the market held by state-owned energy companies.These refiners \u2014 known as teapots because of their small size \u2014 had been struggling because of limited market share, but with the crude import licenses, they quickly capitalized on low global oil prices. Having access to higher quality crude also meant they could compete with the state-owned behemoths on a more equal footing.The rise of the teapots has had consequences domestically and further afield.Global oil producers could benefit because they would have new ways to access the Chinese market, according to Michal Meidan, an analyst at Energy Aspects.\u201cIt\u2019s a boost to the global oil market because you have all these new buyers,\u201d she said.And within China, the changes pile further pressure on already beleaguered state oil companies.For the Zhou family, that means a life built around the Daqing oil field may no longer be viable, and soon the phrase \u201cthe children of the oil field\u201d will be a thing of the past.Mr. Zhou says his parents\u2019 salaries have already been cut in half, and when he graduates from university, he is considering jobs at internet companies in Shanghai, about 1,400 miles from home.\u201cMy grandfather joined the struggle to discover oil back in the day,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cHe has now passed away, but he would never have thought it would come to this one day.\u201dOwen Guo reported from Beijing and Neil Gough from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Malaysian Art Scene, Under the Radar", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Mahathir Mohamad \u2014 who transformed this country of paddy fields and rubber plantations into a modern economy of factories, highways and skyscrapers \u2014 is known as much for his bold economic vision as for his intolerance of anybody who got in his way.While he was prime minister of Malaysia between 1981 and 2003, Mr. Mahathir detained opponents, fired top judges, controlled the media, clipped the power of Malay royalty, fired one deputy and pushed another to resign.Yet the visual arts mostly escaped his attention.\u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d a show of 48 works by 28 artists at Ilham Gallery here that is on view until Nov. 20, is evidence of that inattention. Despite their critical nature, many of the pieces in the show appeared in state-funded institutions such as the National Art Gallery; some won national awards.Art was seen as a concern of the urban elite, with no influence on the masses. \u201cIt was not really on his radar,\u201d said Valentine Willie, the curator of \u201cEra Mahathir\u201d and the creative director of Ilham Gallery. \u201cIn a way, it was a saving grace for us. He didn\u2019t take us seriously.\u201dMr. Mahathir\u2019s policies created a growing wealthy class who were looking for ways to spend its money. \u201cIf you have a million-dollar apartment, what are you going to put on the wall? Not your grandmother\u2019s portrait,\u201d Mr. Willie said.Around Asia, artists who have criticized government through their works have struggled for funding and, in some cases, for their freedom. In the 1960s Indonesia, Hendra Gunawan, one of the archipelago\u2019s most celebrated artists, was imprisoned for years under Presidents Sukarno and Suharto for his alleged association with communists. More recently, the Chinese government detained the artist Ai Weiwei and prevented him from traveling abroad. In Malaysia this year, the artist Fahmi Reza was charged \u2014 twice \u2014 under cybercrime laws for posting a caricature of Prime Minister Najib Razak with a clown face on Instagram and Facebook.But in Mahathir\u2019s Malaysia in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, even as art took a decidedly sociopolitical turn, galleries flourished, as did theater.The show, which features works on loan from the national art gallery, private collections and the artists, opens with a panel by Mohd Nor Khalid, better known as Lat, whose cartoons ran in the pro-government New Straits Times.In the panel, the late Singapore prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, is drawn clutching a newspaper and asking Mr. Mahathir why he allows cartoonists to get away with such unflattering depictions of him. \u201cLook what they do to your nose!\u201d Mr. Lee says. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Mahathir (with a giant nose) agrees, \u201ctoo much freedom.\u201d It\u2019s funny, and makes a point: even among autocrats, there are degrees of autocracy.\u201cEra Mahathir\u201d also includes a politically charged work by Ahmad Fuad Osman. In 1998, the artist joined thousands in the streets protesting Mr. Mahathir\u2019s firing of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who was later charged with corruption and sodomy \u2014 a crime in this country. Then he went home and picked up his brush.Until then, Mr. Ahmad Fuad had been known for his studied, symbolic pieces. He ended up producing four vigorous self-portraits, in oil, each over two meters high. Three were based on the old proverb \u201csee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,\u201d to which he added a fourth portrait, of him holding his nose.\u201cThere are times we have to scream,\u201d Mr. Ahmad Fuad said in a phone interview from his current base in Bali. \u201cWe can\u2019t whisper anymore. We have to let our voices out.\u201dMr. Ahmad Fuad\u2019s self-portraits were shown at Galeri Petronas, owned by the national oil company. It is one of these four pieces \u2014 titled \u201cShhh!\u201d and showing the artist with finger to lips \u2014 that is included in \u201cEra Mahathir.\u201dAnother work, \u201cNEP\u201d by Roslisham Ismail, is a wall-sized collage forming the acronym for the New Economic Policy, an affirmative-action plan for the country\u2019s majority Malays that Mr. Mahathir wielded to a greater degree than any leader before him. Look closer and the three giant letters are made up of posters and calling cards for loan sharks, a comment on the abuses of the policy and the growing chasm between rich and poor Malays.Liew Kung Yu\u2019s \u201cProposals for my country\u201d features a photo montage of the Greek and Roman columns that mushroomed during the building boom, adorning everything from mansions to office buildings to wooden stilt houses \u2013- a sign of new money gone mad.Mr. Liew, in an interview, decried Mr. Mahathir\u2019s obsession with showy construction; the Petronas Twin Towers, briefly the world\u2019s tallest buildings, were erected during his time.Kathy Rowland, a Malaysian arts researcher who wrote an essay for the show\u2019s catalog, noted that it was during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s time that the state built a national theater, a national art gallery \u2014 both planned under earlier administrations \u2014 and a home for the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra at the base of the Petronas Twin Towers. \u201cI suppose a rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d she said.The show comes at a time when Mr. Mahathir, 91, is starting a new political party and forging a once-unthinkable alliance with the opposition to try to oust the current prime minister, Najib Razak, who is implicated in a billion-dollar scandal involving a state fund named 1MDB. That the gallery, as well as the skyscraper it\u2019s located in, is owned by Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister and one of Mr. Mahathir\u2019s closest allies, only adds to the intrigue.Mr. Willie, the curator, said that he had the idea for the show for a while and that the timing with current events is coincidental. Mr. Daim, a longtime art collector, provides the space for Ilham \u2014 12,000 square feet over two floors, in a building designed by Foster + Partners on the edge of the central business district. He pays Mr. Willie, who used to own five galleries across Southeast Asia, a fee to run it, but does not interfere in curatorial decisions, Mr. Willie said. Entry is free and none of the works are for sale.Ilham\u2019s ownership has perturbed some in the arts community, who fear that artists are being co-opted in some larger political tussle. Ray Langenbach, an American who worked in Malaysia for years and is now a theater professor at the University of the Arts Helsinki, said he rejected a request from the gallery to include his 1994 video documenting a performance piece by another artist.The piece was based on one of Mr. Mahathir\u2019s most severe crackdowns, 1987\u2019s Operation Lalang \u2014 \u201clalang\u201d is a hardy local weed \u2014 when 106 activists, politicians, intellectuals, students and others were detained for allegedly stoking racial tension. \u201cAllowing criticism of his past acts makes Mahathir stronger now,\u201d Mr. Langenbach said in an email. (The gallery used news clippings about the performance piece instead.)Still, the gallery has attracted the participation of many independent voices.\u201cIt\u2019s a relevant art show, and you see a lot of anger from the time he was in power,\u201d said Jahabar Sadiq, a Malaysian journalist who also wrote an essay on Mr. Mahathir\u2019s legacy for the show\u2019s catalog. In it, he described the former leader\u2019s biggest fault as bringing an over-concentration of power to the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201cOf course there\u2019s an agenda,\u201d Mr. Sadiq said. \u201cThe agenda is I want you to talk about it!

{"Headline": "For Better Citizenship, Scratch and Win", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byFixesChina, with its largely cash economy, has a huge problem with tax evasion. Not just grand tax evasion, but the everyday \u201cno receipt, please\u201d kind, even though there have been harsh penalties: Before 2011, some forms of tax evasion were even punishable by death.The country needed a different approach. So what did it do to get people to pay sales tax?When a receipt is a lottery ticket, people ask for a receipt. They hope to get money, but just as important, they like to play games. Those axioms apply around the globe.What else could lotteries do?What effect did Voteria have? (More than one can apply)The answers are A and B.Guerra told a local radio program that Voteria was unique among nonpartisan efforts to increase turnout. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s been as successful as this, at least that political science literature has been able to capture,\u201d he said.A counterargument is that millions of dollars are spent in elections \u2014 including public money in many places \u2014 in ways that alienate and misinform voters. Why is a lottery worse?Sweden\u2019s Speed Camera Lottery, instead of just ticketing speeders, also rewarded drivers going at or below the speed limit. They could enter a lottery with a grand prize of $3,000 \u2014 prize money culled from the proceeds of speeding tickets.What were the results?It\u2019s B.But even though the average speed dropped while the camera was up, the effect quickly vanished when the experiment ended. Sweden tried the camera in five other places. On average, speed was reduced by 8 percent, which would cut fatal accidents by 32 percent. Swedish traffic officials concluded that while the lottery was effective, it would have to be in use continuously.But Sweden didn\u2019t expand or continue the speed lottery, and no one else has used it. Richardson has a theory about why: \u201cSweden was very open to it because their goal is to achieve zero traffic deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile in the U.S.A. and other countries, giving tickets is a revenue-generating thing and the idea of getting rid of it would be abhorrent to somebody.\u201dLike any scheme to pay people to do things they should be doing anyway, lotteries have their critics.One fear is that enforcing norms with money could make things worse: if people are rewarded for good behavior, they tend to think of it as an economic choice and not a moral one. That can weaken the social norms that are often a more powerful enforcer of rules.On the other hand, people are fined for bad behavior all the time. Rewarding them for good behavior is essentially the same action, in reverse. Insurance companies have good driver discounts, for example. That\u2019s just a more pleasant way to say that they charge bad drivers more.One big market for lotteries is in promoting health. Such lotteries have been used to get people to:It\u2019s D, of course.More than 50 years later, researchers set up a lottery among young adults in Lesotho, designed to promote safe sex practices. Every four months the subjects were tested for two sexually transmitted diseases, syphilis and trichonomiasis. A negative test got them entered into a lottery to win either $50 (equivalent to a week\u2019s average salary) or $100. The idea was to see if incentives to reduce the spread of syphilis would also protect against HIV.Back in America, almost every medical clinic has a big no-show problem. All patients suffer, because to compensate for no-shows, clinics book multiple patients for the same slot \u2014 hence the 12-minute doctor\u2019s appointment.OfferCraft worked with one clinic where the no-show rate was 50 percent, said Ezra. The clinic had tried fining people when they didn\u2019t come to their appointments. This increased attendance slightly, but patients hated it, and it was very difficult to collect the fines.So the clinic set up a lottery. When patients checked out and made their follow-up appointment, they were invited to play a Spinning Wheel game. A prize was certain, but they didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d won a $10, $50 or $150 gift card. To find out and receive their prize, they had to keep their appointment.The no-show rate dropped to below 30 percent.Games can provide powerful incentives for just about any behavior. (And perhaps the quizzes in this column kept you reading to the end.) So let\u2019s play one more game: Tweet your best ideas for using a lottery, using #GameMyFix.Could a lottery for graduates reduce school dropout? Would a chance at a big prize get people into the gym? Could it keep ex-offenders from falling back into crime? How about a lottery for carpoolers?

So we\u2019ll choose the best ideas, publish them, and put them in front of people who might use them.

I wrote down these notes.\u2019\u201dThe bill also stipulates that freelancers who do not receive full payment on time are to receive double damages if they win in court. So, for example, freelancers who previously would have been awarded $5,000 in damages from a company that failed to pay them would collect $10,000 if they prevailed. On top of that, the court would automatically require the company to pay their legal fees and would award an additional amount if there were no contract or an incomplete contract.\u201cIt starts us looking at a new form of enforcement \u2014 now it\u2019s worth a lawyer\u2019s time to start taking cases, you\u2019re building up a marketplace,\u201d Ms. Horowitz said. \u201cOnce you start to see the market function, companies start to know they can\u2019t do this.\u201dNew York City\u2019s corporation counsel could also initiate lawsuits against repeat offenders, which could result in civil penalties of up to $25,000.Alli Rice, a video editor who lives in Manhattan, said companies often took six to 10 weeks to pay her, which sometimes made it difficult to pay her rent on time, pay bills or buy Christmas presents. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really stressful,\u201d Ms. Rice said. \u201cOn a daily basis, I have to contact companies. I\u2019m constantly hounding them.\u201dMs. Rice said that three clients owed her a combined $16,085 at the beginning of October and that she hoped added leverage in court for workers like her would push companies to make more timely payments.Under the new measure, freelancers would file complaints with the city\u2019s Office of Labor Standards, which would tell companies of the complaints and seek a response. The office could not assess fines or award damages. That would be left to the courts.Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, is expected to sign the law, which would take effect 180 days later. It would cover workers who live in New York City; there is some ambiguity about whether it would apply to workers who live outside the city but work for companies based in the city.Carlo A. Scissura, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, which supported the legislation, said he felt most companies that failed to pay freelancers on time were well-intentioned but simply had a poor system for following through, which he hoped the measure would change. \u201cThe way you pay a vendor who catered your lunch or breakfast, you should now pay a freelancer who maybe did some work for you on a website or project,\u201d he said. \u201cIt levels the playing field for everyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A champion was declared, only to be usurped moments later by organizers who had made a mistake and overlooked another competitor.\u201cThe key to winning is just to have determination,\u201d said Elizabeth Braimoh, 13, the official winner and a student at Topfield College.But playing Monopoly is appealing for another reason: It mimics the chaos of the real estate market in Lagos. Buying property is a tangled affair, plagued by bribery, scams and even machete-wielding gangsters.\u201cIt\u2019s a true reflection of what is on the ground in Lagos,\u201d said Tarba Fatai Oladele, a physical education teacher at Ipakodo Senior Grammar School.Monopoly began to take off about four years ago here, when Lagos got its own version of the game. The new board replaced staples of the American game, like Park Place and Boardwalk, with local properties like Bourdillon Road, a street in the Ikoyi neighborhood lined by luxury apartments, and Agege, an area near the main airport that is home to a government affordable housing project.The commission hopes to host more tournaments, with the added aim of teaching children strategies for saving money and making good investments.\u201cReal estate is an asset class that everyone should aspire to have,\u201d said Nimi Akinkugbe, chief executive of Bestman Games, which distributes the Lagos version of Monopoly and helped organize the tournament.Yet outside the gymnasium, on the streets of sprawling and hectic Lagos, the actual real estate market rivals the chaos of 1,200 raucous teenagers rocking tables and screaming, \u201cPay, pay, pay!\u201dNigerians, like many people around the world, dream of owning property. In a country that has one of the biggest economies on the continent and brags of a nascent middle class, the staple of owning real estate should seem within reach.But the country is struggling through a recession. Inflation is at levels not seen in 11 years. Interest rates are so high that most home loans are unaffordable for average buyers.The real estate market operates on a buyer-beware system starkly visible across the metropolis, where spray-painted signs on numerous homes shout warnings: \u201cThis house is not for sale.\u201d The messages try to thwart a longtime con game in which scammers sell homes they don\u2019t actually own to unsuspecting buyers.Buyers must also navigate corruption even at official levels. Government workers have long demanded bribes in order to obtain official documents needed for buying property.Even once a deal is done, problems emerge. Armed with machetes, criminal gangs so well established they have a name, omo onile, roam Lagos building sites looking to extort money before allowing construction to begin.Officials razed part of a slum near the city\u2019s main port in 2013, forcing 9,000 people from their homes. The year before, the state cleared part of Makoko, a waterside slum, which appears on the Lagos version of the Monopoly board as the cheapest property.The Nigerian judicial system offers little relief from scams and property takeovers; dockets are so clogged that land disputes take years to resolve. Petitioners\u2019 homes in Lagos are sometimes flattened before judgments can be handed down.Matthew Ottah, a top property rights lawyer in Lagos who specializes in detecting land scams, estimated that this year alone he investigated more than 200 deals for clients hoping to buy property and found less than a quarter of them to be legitimate.\u201cThere\u2019s one story or the other that makes it impossible for us to approve it,\u201d said Mr. Ottah, adding that he sometimes gets calls from omo onile gang members who threaten his life.Mr. Ottah himself was once a victim of a land scam, losing the equivalent of about $25,000 after handing over cash for a piece of property from a seller who turned out to be a fraudster.During the Monopoly tournament, the haphazard nature of real-life real-estate transactions was lost on the students who focused on the top prize, which amounted to about $2,000. Playing the board game was chaotic enough.Players had only an hour to snap up as much property as they could. The game grew more pitched as the minutes ticked by, with students rolling the dice so fast that the teachers and state officials who were acting as volunteer bankers had trouble keeping track.The student landlords shook their hands in opponents\u2019 faces and demanded payment while harried bankers tried to keep up with the cries for cash.\u201cFast, fast, give me two naira,\u201d one student demanded of another who had landed on his property. (Naira is the local currency.)For most students, a strategy emerged: hoarding.\u201cOn this table,\u201d complained Adeleke Olayinka Bello, a student at St. Jude, a private school, \u201cno one wanted to sell their property.\u201dThe organizers appealed to the students to negotiate with one another, a staple ability in Nigeria\u2019s haggling-centric economy.The champion, 13-year-old Elizabeth, bargained her way to control of the yellow properties: Silverbird Cinemas, 35 Marina and Falomo Shopping Center.With two houses on each property and seven other players orbiting the board, Elizabeth sat back and watched her fortune grow to more than 17,000 naira.\u201cUsing that,\u201d she said, \u201cI can win the game.\u201dChris Stein reported from Lagos, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economy, Showing Resilience, Added 156,000 Jobs Last Month", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byAmid a presidential campaign marked by fears about the country\u2019s economic future, the American jobs machine keeps chugging.For all the anxiety at home and turmoil abroad, like the vote in Britain to withdraw from the European Union, the current expansion shows little prospect of ending abruptly.Average hourly earnings rose by 0.2 percentage point last month, bringing the wage gain over the last 12 months to 2.6 percent, well above the pace of inflation. The typical workweek also grew slightly in September, after a pullback in August.\u201cIt was solid, not spectacular,\u201d said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. \u201cThe good news is that participation went up, even though the unemployment rate did, too. Regaining that ground is very important.\u201dBefore the report was released, economists on Wall Street looked for the economy to add 172,000 jobs in September. Revisions for July and August showed that 7,000 fewer jobs were created in those months than the Labor Department first estimated.Given the latest figures, the Federal Reserve is still expected to delay raising interest rates until late this year, and there was little in the report to suggest that the job gains might lead to significantly higher inflation.\u201cThere are still plenty of unemployed people out there, enough for employers to continue to hire at a substantial pace,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.\u201cThe expansion will end before you run out of labor,\u201d added Mr. Gapen, who estimates that the unemployment rate could drop to 4 percent by the end of 2017. The overall participation rate inched up to 62.9 percent, above the low point of 62.4 percent last September, but well below the most recent peak of 66.4 percent in early 2007.With many prime-age workers still available to be hired \u2014 what economists and policy makers at the Federal Reserve blandly term \u201clabor market slack\u201d \u2014 the current pace of hiring should be able to continue with little threat of overheating the economy.Moreover, the labor force itself jumped by nearly half a million, a bright spot in an otherwise steady picture of the economy.The nation has added an average of 178,000 jobs a month this year, less robust than the average monthly gain of 229,000 in 2015 but still a healthy reading given the longevity of the recovery and the slowdown in population growth among adults of working age.Mr. Gapen attributed most of September\u2019s dip in job creation, which was below the consensus forecast and the annual average, to an unexpected 11,000 drop in government payrolls.The public sector added more than 50,000 positions in July and August, and Mr. Gapen said the private sector\u2019s relative strength was what counted, not a slowdown in government hiring.\u201cIt\u2019s not a negative signal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see the miss as mainly a one-off government issue.\u201dDespite the robust hiring in the last couple of years, tens of millions of workers have barely felt the benefits of the recovery, and notable pockets of economic weakness remain more than seven years after it began.Both candidates\u2019 critiques of the economy contain kernels of truth. Friday\u2019s report, while generally strong, contained fodder for both.The jump in participation, and healthy gains in higher-paying professional services fields, bolster Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case that the economy is growing steadily and creating decent-paying jobs. The drop in manufacturing jobs by 13,000 will underscore fears among blue-collar voters that their livelihoods are imperiled, a main factor in Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal.In addition to strong gains in services, the closely watched construction industry added 23,000 jobs. The housing market has been booming in many parts of the country, and like manufacturing, construction remains an important source of middle-class jobs for workers with just high school diplomas.\u201cI\u2019m heartened to see that we have an unmistakable trend toward good-quality jobs,\u201d said Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez. \u201cI know there\u2019s a doom and gloom caucus out there, but they\u2019re on a collision course with the facts.\u201dAnother encouraging development was a slowdown in the huge round of job cuts in the mining and logging industries prompted by falling prices for oil and other commodities.After falling for 23 consecutive months, with 223,000 jobs slashed during that time, employment in the sector was flat last month.\u201cInstead of declining, jobs may start coming back to the sector,\u201d Ms. Swonk said, noting that the recent rebound in oil prices may spur new investment in exploration and drilling after a two-year drought.Although Wall Street watches every jobs report, this one drew less attention because the Federal Reserve is not expected to raise rates until December at the earliest. The Fed will meet in November, but it is not expected to raise rates so close to the election.Moreover, waiting until December to decide whether to tighten monetary policy would allow policy makers to consider the October and November jobs reports.Mr. Gapen said December remained the most likely target for the Fed\u2019s next interest rate increase, but he added that it was hardly certain.\u201cWe think there\u2019s a 60 percent chance the Fed will act, or slightly better than even,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a little something for everyone in this report from a policy-making perspective.\u201dThe 2.6 percent increase in wages in the last 12 months is better than the 2.3 percent annual increase in 2015, but it is still less than many recession-ravaged workers would hope to see at this point in the recovery.As the more modest gain in payrolls for September suggests, some big employers have slowed the pace of recruiting slightly, but they continue to add to payrolls.Ernst & Young, the giant accounting and consulting firm, plans to hire 15,200 people in the United States in the 2017 fiscal year, which began July 1.In the 2016 fiscal year, Ernst & Young hired 16,375 people, said Dan Black, Ernst & Young Americas recruiting leader. \u201cIt\u2019s not a put-the-brakes-on moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a maintain-and-sustain scenario.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The exterior facade is a combination of stucco and carob wood. A small pond surrounds the base of the house, near the entrance. A bridge of wooden steps leads to the front door.The large open living room immediately off the entrance has Spanish marble floors and two-story windows. From the living room, glass doors open onto a teak deck. There is a separate TV room and office on the ground floor, as well as a space the current owner uses as a fitness room. The furniture is not included in the price, but is available to buy, Mr. Holman said.The living room connects directly to the kitchen, which has an island counter for casual dining. All the appliances are Italian, including a steam oven and a range on the island. The current owner uses the balcony off the living room for formal dining.A wood spiral staircase leads to the second floor, where there are three bedrooms and three bathrooms and the floors are made of carob wood.The master bedroom has a dome-shaped roof with indirect lighting and two balconies. The bathroom features natural stone walls, a double shower, two sinks and a Jacuzzi; circular windows offer views of the city. There is also a large walk-in closet. A guest bathroom is on the ground floor, along with another bedroom and bathroom.The backyard has a large lawn with banana, lemon and avocado trees. The current owners tend a small garden with cilantro, carrots, onions and tea plants. There is a carport-style garage with room for two cars.The house is about a five-minute drive to hiking and biking trails, as well as an off-road track for trucks, ATVs and dirt bikes. The stores, restaurants and nightlife of Envigado are less than a 10-minute drive, and local buses connect to the center of Medellin. The house is about 30 minutes from the Medellin international airport.MARKET OVERVIEWAs a result of that perception, Medellin homes sell at a steep discount compared to those in Bogot\u00e1 and Cartagena, Mr. Holman said. High-end properties in Medellin are priced at about $190 a square foot; those in Bogot\u00e1 are around $318 a square foot.But sales in Medellin have been steadily increasing in recent years, and prices have risen an average of 7 percent a year since 2003, Mr. Holman said.This year the local market is on pace to sell more than 74,000 homes, a record number, the Real Estate Association of Medellin reported a few weeks ago. Prices in the area rose 8 percent in 2015, according to the association\u2019s data.The market has been aided by an improving economy, a growing middle class and increasing tourism, agents said.The property market \u201cis booming,\u201d said Brad Hinkelman, the owner of Casacol Medellin, a real estate agency. \u201cColombia is a classic emerging market economy.\u201dThe affluent neighborhood of El Poblado, adjacent to Envigado, is the most popular area for foreign buyers, agents say. Prices in some areas of El Poblado have risen more than 15 percent in the last year, Mr. Hinkelman said. And \u201cthere is very little new construction coming on to the market in the most coveted area of the city,\u201d he added.The second most popular area in Medellin for sales and rentals by foreigners is Envigado, agents say. It is seen as an alternative to the higher-priced central neighborhoods, said Mr. Hinkelman, who lives in Envigado: \u201cIf you are trying to get more for your money, you go to Envigado.\u201dMedellin neighborhoods are rated by the government on a scale of one to six based on social and economic conditions, with six signifying the wealthiest neighborhoods and one the poorest. (The ratings are used to determine property taxes, utility fees and other charges.)Most parts of El Poblado are rated six, while Envigado ranks between two and five, depending on the area, Mr. Holman said. This house is in a neighborhood rated five.WHO BUYS IN MEDELLINThe domestic market is driving home sales in Medellin, which is a popular vacation and second-home destination. \u201cA lot of investors from Bogot\u00e1 are coming to Medellin,\u201d Mr. Hinkelman said. \u201cThere is huge rental demand.\u201dThe number of foreign buyers in Medellin is also growing, especially with the strength of the dollar against the Colombian peso, agents say. But international buyers still make up less than 5 percent of the market, Mr. Hinkelman said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Colombia. Agents recommend hiring a lawyer to handle the paperwork and research the title.And while regulations are strict and there is a lot of paperwork, \u201cColombia protects ownership,\u201d said Diana Pizano, a partner in the Medellin law firm of Colombia Legal Partners.Down payments are usually 10 percent to 20 percent of the purchase price. Colombia does not use escrow accounts, but the purchase agreement is \u201clegally binding to the parties and enforceable,\u201d Ms. Pizano said. If there are no problems with funding or the title deed, deals can close within 45 days of an accepted offer, she said.The majority of transactions are all-cash. Even for locals, mortgages are very expensive, with interest rates of around 12 percent, Mr. Holman said, and they usually require 30 to 40 percent down payments.WEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYSpanish; Colombian peso ($1 = 2,922 pesos)TAXES AND FEESBuyers\u2019 closing costs are usually about 1.4 percent of the purchase price, Ms. Pizano said. Agent commissions are typically 3 to 4.5 percent of the price, and are paid by the seller, she said, and the legal fees are typically $1,000 to $2,000 on top of closing costs.Property taxes on this house are about $1,700 a year, Mr. Holman said.CONTACTAn article on Oct. 23 about a house for sale in Colombia described incorrectly the town of Envigado, near Medellin. It was the hometown of the drug lord Pablo Escobar, not his birthplace.Advertisement"}

He will give $1.25 million through a combination of super PAC donations and funds given directly to the campaign, a person close to the investor said on Saturday.Mr. Thiel, who spoke at the Republican National Convention, apparently is unfazed by the storm around the candidate in the last week following the broadcasting of lewd conversations recorded by the syndicated program \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d The source, who requested anonymity, said the investor feels the country needs fixing, and Mr. Trump can do it.A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment.

{"Headline": "Those Who Don\u2019t Understand Trump Are Doomed to Repeat Him", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byConservatives are deeply split over the rise of Donald J. Trump. Some see it as apocalyptic; others as refreshing. But two pieces of conventional wisdom are largely unchallenged by either side.First, Mr. Trump\u2019s populist takeover of the Republican Party was shocking and unforeseeable. Second, love Trump or hate him, he has revealed important realities about the electorate, and Republicans must move toward more populist positions on issues such as trade and immigration or be left behind.Both of these beliefs are mistaken.The first false assumption is that Trumpist populism is unprecedented. In truth, what we see today has happened many times before. Indeed, political populism has often followed economic meltdowns like the one America has endured over the past eight years.Financial crises have occurred throughout history, and they follow predictable patterns. The economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, whose 2010 book, \u201cThis Time Is Different,\u201d offers a comprehensive study of financial crises around the world, find that they often take much longer to resolve than ordinary recessions \u2014 about eight years on average.In Japan, the financial crisis of 1992 touched off the \u201clost decade.\u201d Smaller crises such as Black Monday in 1987 or the dot-com collapse in 2001 generally rebound in just two or three years.Census Bureau data show that from 2009 through 2014, only about the top fifth of the population saw any income growth while the bottom 80 percent have averaged no income growth at all.Some scholars like Robert Barro, my colleague at the American Enterprise Institute, see the malaise not as the inevitable result of the crisis, but as the product of bad public policy. Whichever account you find persuasive, the financial crisis and the long, uneven recovery sowed the seeds for the current populism.In an article in The European Economic Review, German economists look at the effect of financial crises on politics, reviewing 800 elections over 140 years across 20 advanced economies. They found that, after a financial crisis, nationalistic populist parties and politicians, using language that often attributes blame to minorities and foreigners, typically increase their vote share by about 30 percent. There is no such effect after ordinary recessions.Consider moderate, tolerant Sweden, where a 1991 parliamentary election came amid a financial crisis. Swedish voters rewarded a brand-new \u201cNew Democracy\u201d party that focused heavily on law and order issues and proposed stringent restrictions on immigration.With no simple solution for reviving equal opportunity, conventional politicians struggle with increasingly angry voters. Into this gap walk populists who specialize in identifying culprits: rich elites who are ripping you off; immigrants who want your job; free trade that\u2019s killing our nation\u2019s competitiveness. Their proposed solutions usually involve some combination of increased redistribution, protectionism and restrictionism.Today, some conservative leaders take these populist claims at face value, leading to the second piece of incorrect conventional wisdom: No matter what one thinks of Mr. Trump personally, one must concede that mainstream positions on issues such as trade and immigration must be fundamentally rethought. Right?Wrong. Trade and immigration are the lightning rods, but these issues are not the real triggers of our political moment. The illegal immigrant population was 8 percent lower in 2014 than in 2007, and our trade deficit was lower in 2015 than before the Great Recession.The real issue is weak, unevenly shared growth. If we addressed this issue, and if people felt their lives improving, the appetite for invective on secondary issues such as trade and immigration would dissipate. So walking away from free enterprise principles on trade and immigration is not the solution.But merely returning to the narrow economic strategies of past decades will not work, either. Conservatives love to emphasize the need for higher economic growth, but have often missed the importance of more widely distributed growth. Leaders should set their focus on a system with more opportunity in the middle and bottom of the economy.This requires a generational strategy to build an education system based on innovation, school choice and an emphasis on vocational training. It means rewriting tax and regulatory law to stop discouraging domestic investment and squelching job creation, while also attacking the corporate cronyism that gives special treatment to wealthy and entrenched interests. It demands authentic compassion for people on the periphery of society.These should be the core positions of conservative reformers. Throwing away free enterprise will neither solve our nation\u2019s problems nor create enduring political victories. Only strong growth, evenly distributed, will do the trick.Arthur C. Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can You Be Black and Republican?", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byNonfiction\u201cThe African-Americans love me,\u201d Donald Trump said back in January. Nine months later, evidence of that love is exceedingly rare. Polls put Trump\u2019s black support in the low single digits, smaller in several samples than the margin of error. In 1964, Barry Goldwater, who had voted against the Civil Rights Act in the summer and won the enthusiastic endorsement of the Klan in the fall, received 6 percent. Ronald Reagan received 12 and then 9 percent. Even John McCain, running against Barack Obama, received 4.Whether because of those numbers or despite them, the academic study of black Republicans is booming. Last year, Leah Wright Rigueur, a historian at Harvard, published \u201cThe Loneliness of the Black Republican,\u201d a spirited study of conservatism, politics and race. Now we have Joshua D. Farrington\u2019s \u201cBlack Republicans and the Transformation of the GOP\u201d and Corey D. Fields\u2019s \u201cBlack Elephants in the Room.\u201d Other books have been published, and more are on the way. We may soon have more books on black Republicans than actual black Republican voters.To understand the decline since the 1960s does not require an advanced degree. Richard Nixon followed Goldwater. As vice president, he had been strong on civil rights and in his first term as president he worked with movement veterans, including Black Power advocates, to promote \u201cblack capitalism.\u201d His appointments included Arthur Fletcher, \u201cthe father of affirmative action.\u201d Alas, by the end of his first term Nixon had decided that the \u201creal majority,\u201d North as well as South, was, as two journalists put it, \u201cunyoung, unpoor and unblack,\u201d and long before that he had contributed mightily to making the words \u201claw and order\u201d code for \u201cblack crime.\u201d Reagan kicked off his 1980 campaign championing states\u2019 rights in the Mississippi county where the civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman were murdered in 1964, and regaled audiences with stories of \u201cstrapping young bucks\u201d and \u201cwelfare queens.\u201d George H.W. Bush accused Michael Dukakis of being soft on black rapists.Before Goldwater, the choice was not so clear, and Farrington, who teaches history at the University of Kentucky, starts by reminding us that the great migration from the \u201cparty of Lincoln\u201d did not happen all at once \u2014 or once and for all. A significant minority of African-Americans resisted the appeal of the New Deal, and many of those who embraced Franklin Roosevelt continued to vote Republican in down-ballot races. National politics provide Farrington with a sturdy frame, but what makes his book special is his painstaking re-creation of scores of little-known state and local activists and a lost world of two-party competition.Black people had many good reasons for sticking with the Republicans. In the South, the few who voted and the many who aspired to had no choice. The Democratic Party, which by terror and state law had overthrown Reconstruction and then annulled the 14th and 15th Amendments, was for whites only. Only through alliances with the national Republican Party could black Southerners and (what racists labeled) their \u201ctan\u201d allies participate in politics at all. In the North, the Democrats\u2019 emphasis on bread-and-\u00adbutter issues drew enormous numbers of new black voters, but many middle-class blacks remained skeptical of the big-city political machines.Others had objections to the New Deal itself. Black conservatives feared its programs would stifle initiative and contribute to dependency. Many liberal blacks considered it a Raw Deal because many relief programs discriminated against black people or excluded them altogether. Then, too, in the middle decades of the century, Republicans like Everett Dirksen, Jacob Javits and Margaret Chase Smith were dependable allies in the cause of civil rights while many Democrats, including some of the most powerful men in Congress, were massive resisters. In the 1940s, for example, the Republican Party pushed hard for a federal fair employment law. They failed, but 11 states subsequently passed their own versions. Eight of those states were governed by Republicans. Twenty years later, Republican support for the Civil Rights Act prevented a Democratic filibuster from killing it.Whatever their reasons or political differences, virtually all black Republicans agreed that the struggle against disfranchisement, segregation and discrimination (a struggle they believed the federal government had a legitimate role in) came first. And they agreed that black Americans would do best when both parties were competing for their votes. For evidence, they pointed to the 1948 presidential race, when the Republicans nominated two liberals, Thomas Dewey and Earl Warren, who (way ahead in the polls) took the black vote for granted. President Truman, meanwhile, integrated the armed forces and supported fair employment and \u00adanti-lynching laws. Black votes contributed enormously to Truman\u2019s upset victory.Corey D. Fields, a sociologist at Stanford, knows the history, but his subject is the political experience of black Republicans today. He wants to understand how their sense of themselves as black people and their ideas about black people shape their politics and how their politics shape their identity and ideas. Fields makes great use of interviews, observation and survey data to argue that a majority of black Republicans are race-conscious, seeing their positions on social and economic issues in racial terms. If that seems surprising, it is because white Republicans prefer colorblind black conservatives \u2014 Fields opens with Ben Carson \u2014 and are much likelier to grant them power and authority. Or as Fields puts it, with characteristic economy and wit, explaining why he chose to focus on rank-and-file Republicans: \u201cOnce black Republicans become famous, they all start to look alike.\u201dFields finds that the conflict among the colorblind and color-conscious black Republicans and between black Republicans and white Republicans impedes outreach and political action. And though we tend to think about the ways in which race (and myriad other forms of identity) shape politics, Fields shows that the current runs both ways. Black people who want to make it in the Republican Party have to conceal their sense of themselves as black. Here \u2014 and Fields suspects elsewhere \u2014 politics shape the public expression of identity, narrowing and flattening vital debates. I could not help wondering if among Democrats it is the less color-conscious who do the concealing.It is no fault of the authors, both of whom are terrific writers, that these books make painful reading. In Farrington\u2019s book, we encounter one black person after another who believes in both Republican principles and racial equality. Consider George W. Lee, a Republican leader in Tennessee since the 1920s. \u201cI am afraid of Ronald Reagan,\u201d he wrote shortly before his death in 1976. \u201cHe represents the extreme ideas of conservatism.\u201d Yet Lee urged blacks to infiltrate the Republican Party and fight from within for \u201ca free society, a sound fiscal policy and civil rights.\u201d In Fields\u2019s account, we meet black Republicans struggling today, in a party far to Reagan\u2019s right, to convince other black people that they are black and other (white) Republicans that they are Republicans. The whites say they want black support, but only on their terms, which include agreeing that pathology is the primary cause of black poverty, mass incarceration and racial inequality.\u201cI didn\u2019t leave the Democratic Party,\u201d Reagan liked to say \u201cthe party left me.\u201d In truth, Reagan moved right long before the Democratic Party moved left. But the Republican Party did leave African-\u00adAmericans, and this year especially it is hard to imagine when and how it will come back.James Goodman, a professor of history and creative writing at Rutgers University, Newark, is the author of \u201cStories of Scottsboro,\u201d \u201cBlackout\u201d and \u201cBut Where Is the Lamb?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hungary Votes Against Migrants, but Too Few to Clear Threshold", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byThe referendum \u2014 on which the government spent at least 10 billion Hungarian forint, or about $36 million \u2014 included no specifics about legislation or government action.\u201cWhat will happen after the referendum will depend partly on the results themselves, but also on what is happening on the international scene,\u201d said Zoltan Kovacs, Mr. Orban\u2019s chief international spokesman, who declined to provide any more details.With 99 percent of the vote counted Sunday night, 98 percent of voters had chosen to refuse to allow the European Union to force the country to accept refugees. But the turnout was 43 percent, well below the 50 percent required for a referendum to be considered valid under Hungarian law. (Three percent of the votes cast were invalid, and did not count toward the turnout threshold.)Despite the failure to meet the turnout threshold, Mr. Orban said he considered the vote a mandate for the government to pursue its anti-immigrant policies.\u201cWe can be proud to be the first E.U. state to let its people express their own views on the issue of immigration,\u201d Mr. Orban said in a speech at his victory party on Sunday night. \u201cWe are facing the most important question for years to come: It\u2019s about the future of Hungary, with whom we live, what will be our culture, our lifestyle and our Christian roots.\u201dLeaders across the Continent were closely watching the outcome of the vote and what actions Mr. Orban would take afterward.Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, recently echoed Mr. Orban\u2019s call for restructuring the European Union to return more power to individual nations. \u201cOur proposals are quite radical,\u201d Mr. Waszczykowski said.\u201cFar-right movements are on the rise everywhere, and there are reasons for that,\u201d said Gabor Fodor, the head of the Hungarian Liberal Party. \u201cThe E.U. is very slow. Look at the 2008 financial crisis, the subsequent euro crisis and now the refugee crisis. People can feel it. There is nothing happening.\u201dFurther fueling populist leaders, Mr. Fodor said, is the reality that Europe\u2019s economy is less robust than it was in the 1990s.\u201cThe middle class doesn\u2019t have as much. The economy is not as strong,\u201d Mr. Fodor said. \u201cThe welfare state is on the way down, and this has an impact on people\u2019s lives.\u201d\u201cWe are in the midst of a backlash against globalization, and it is a widespread phenomenon,\u201d said Stefan Lehne, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels. \u201cThe general perception is that things have spiraled out of control. There is an increasing resistance to international business agreements. And this phenomenon has led to renationalization of individual states and rediscovery of national identity.\u201dMarta Pardavi, a chairwoman of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a refugee rights group, said Mr. Orban insisted that \u201che needs the demonstrated support of the Hungarian people in the referendum so he can take courageous and bold steps.\u201dBut Mr. Orban has not been specific about what those steps will be. Instead, rumors swirl: There is talk of an amendment to Hungary\u2019s Constitution preventing the European Union from imposing rules on the country without the approval of Parliament. Some say Mr. Orban is likely to hold early elections to take advantage of the referendum\u2019s momentum.Mr. Orban wants more autonomy from the European Union, but he also does not want to threaten the flow of desperately needed aid from the bloc\u2019s headquarters in Brussels.Whether Mr. Orban will storm up the Danube and lay siege to Brussels, or whether this was just a very expensive exercise in rallying domestic support, is the subject of much debate here.\u201cMost of the effort, I would say, is for domestic political purposes,\u201d said Csaba Toth, the director of strategy for the Republikon Institute, a research and advocacy group that has been critical of the government. \u201cWhenever the migration issue is on the table, the government\u2019s popularity goes up. When something else is on the agenda, the government\u2019s popularity goes down.\u201dRight-wing parties have been achieving electoral success in a growing number of nations.But as the flow of migrants into Hungary has slowed in recent months \u2014 largely because of Mr. Orban\u2019s border fence \u2014 the issue has slipped from public consciousness.\u201cLast year, it was easy to keep the migration issue on the agenda,\u201d Mr. Toth said. \u201cWe had a real refugee crisis. It was evident everywhere. Now, we don\u2019t, so they have to make it a political initiative to keep the migration issue in the public\u2019s mind.\u201dMr. Orban was aided by a lack of unity among the opposition, mainly because there is little popular support anywhere for admitting more migrants.Most left-wing parties had urged their supporters to stay home on Sunday, hoping to deny Mr. Orban the turnout he needed for a valid vote \u2014 although there remained questions about what that meant for a referendum that demanded no specific actions by the government other than opposing European Union refugee policies.Amid a migrant crisis and discontent with the European Union, many far-right parties have achieved electoral success. Here are eight of the most noteworthy.\u201cWhen a question doesn\u2019t make sense, why take part?\u201d Timea Szabo, a chairwoman of the left-wing Dialogue for Hungary Party, said before Sunday\u2019s voting. \u201cOrban is purposely misleading the Hungarian people in a villainous way. All of this focus on migrants takes attention away from government corruption cases, the terrible state of public health and education.\u201dIn failing to meet the legal threshold, Mr. Orban\u2019s government found itself hoisted by its own petard. In 2011, the government raised the level of voter turnout necessary for a referendum to be considered valid to 50 percent, from 25 percent. Critics said the move was intended to stifle popular efforts to overturn Mr. Orban\u2019s policies.The prankster Two-Tailed Dog Party, which has fought the government with irreverent humor, had urged people to purposely cast an invalid ballot, which, in sufficient numbers, they hoped would deny the government its 50 percent threshold.Voting on Sunday morning in Budapest, Mr. Orban said that while a valid result was certainly better than an invalid one, there would be \u201clegal consequences\u201d in either event, as long as there were more \u201cno\u201d votes than \u201cyes\u201d votes.\u201cAccording to us, only the Hungarian Parliament can decide with whom Hungarians want to live,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make sure this is enshrined in our legal system if it is valid or invalid.\u201dJobbik, a far-right party, had reluctantly urged its members to support the government and vote \u201cno.\u201dOnly Mr. Fodor\u2019s tiny Liberal Party urged citizens to vote \u201cyes,\u201d arguing that the referendum should be seen as a measure of support for the European Union.Helene Bienvenu contributed reporting from Budapest, and Joanna Berendt from Warsaw.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Beach Boondoggle", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCULLOWHEE, N.C. \u2014 Hurricane Matthew was not a megadisaster like Superstorm Sandy or Hurricane Katrina, but if precedent holds, simply rebuilding the beaches may cost federal taxpayers billions of dollars.Data from the United States Geological Survey show that more than half of beaches on the East and Gulf Coasts are eroding. We seem to be to trying to hold every shoreline in place forever by pumping sand onto them, largely at federal expense. But this is folly. As sea-level rise continues, and if storms intensify as predicted, the projects will require more sand, and more dollars. We are going to run out of both.You may think that taxpayers dodged a bullet after Hurricane Matthew because the damage to roads and buildings was less than expected. But the Federal Emergency Management Agency considers engineered beaches \u2014 in which sand is added to beaches and dunes largely to protect coastal investment property \u2014 to be part of the infrastructure of a community. This means that even in places where there has been no property damage at all, taxpayers may still be on the hook for tens of millions of dollars to restore the beaches.Named storms like Hurricane Matthew can even turn locally funded beach \u201cnourishment\u201d projects into federally funded ones. That\u2019s right: If your community pays for its own beach, and a storm comes along and removes that beach (as we know storms do), then FEMA can come in and have the beach rebuilt. Coastal engineers often use this little-known benefit to sell a beach-nourishment project to a community that is balking at the price of moving sand: \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2014 if a named storm takes away your beach, the federal government will pay and you won\u2019t have to.\u201dFor example, the United States Army Corps of Engineers completed a $30 million beach project in Folly Beach, S.C., in 2014. Hurricane Matthew appears to have removed the last vestiges of the recreational beach from that project. The town will now expect the Corps to put it back again.Why would coastal resort communities expect that it is the federal government\u2019s responsibility to maintain their beaches? Precedent. The Corps is using billions of dollars from the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013, passed in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, on recovery projects, including what is essentially one giant beach and trapezoidal \u201cdune\u201d from Delaware to the tip of Long Island. Even more startling, the Corps envisions that these artificial beaches will be maintained for 50 years (although who will pay is still to be determined).The states hit by Hurricane Matthew are going to expect exactly the same.It is true that beach and dune engineering projects benefit local communities. They can protect oceanfront homes and roads while providing a recreational beach for tourists to play on. But the benefits are temporary and localized. The Corps plan for the newly constructed and proposed New Jersey beaches predicts they will need more sand at least every four to six years. In addition, numerous studies report that the primary beneficiaries of beach stabilization projects are oceanfront property owners.To be clear, I am not saying that we shouldn\u2019t be doing beach nourishment anywhere. Local governments may decide that these beaches are important to their economy, and worth paying for. Nationally, we may decide that there are certain areas where the federal government should take the lead in coastal protection.But a 2014 report by the National Research Council concluded that we have no national vision for how federal dollars should be spent to deal with coastal hazards and coastal risk. When federal taxpayers assume all of the risk of developing and rebuilding vulnerable coastal communities, it encourages the wrong behavior. In New Jersey after Superstorm Sandy, they essentially rebuilt the entire oceanfront.At some point, coastal resort communities will need to assume the risk of storm damage themselves. I would venture to guess that, when this happens, they will be quite a bit more interested in the hazards to which they are exposed.We need to have a conversation about when it is in the federal interest to pay for shoreline protection, and when the local economy should be left to cover the costs. We can\u2019t hold every shoreline in place forever. But, for the moment, we sure are trying.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Referendums Aren\u2019t as Democratic as They Seem", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterEach of these moves was determined by a national referendum. Though voters upended their governments\u2019 plans, eroded their own rights and ignited political crises, they all accomplished one thing: They demonstrated why many political scientists consider referendums messy and dangerous.When asked whether referendums were a good idea, Michael Marsh, a political scientist at Trinity College Dublin, said, \u201cThe simple answer is almost never.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve watched many of these in Ireland, and they really range from the pointless to the dangerous,\u201d he added.Though such votes are portrayed as popular governance in its purest form, studies have found that they often subvert democracy rather than serve it. They tend to be volatile, turning not just on the merits of the decision but also on unrelated political swings or even, as may have happened in Colombia, on the weather.Voters must make their decisions with relatively little information, forcing them to rely on political messaging \u2014 which puts power in the hands of political elites rather than those of voters.\u201cThis is a tool that\u2019s risky, but politicians keep using it because they think that they\u2019ll win,\u201d said Alexandra Cirone, a fellow at the London School of Economics. But often they do not win, and instead of resolving political problems, the referendums create new ones. Looking over the research on these votes, it becomes clear why many experts are skeptical.Voters face a problem in any referendum: They need to distill difficult policy choices down to a simple yes or no, and predict the outcome of decisions so complex that even experts might spend years struggling to understand them.When a referendum is put forward by the government, people often vote in support if they like the leadership and vote in opposition if they dislike it, according to research by Lawrence LeDuc, a political scientist and professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.Voters may also cope with complex issues by shoehorning them into existing ideological beliefs.This dynamic plays out in virtually every referendum \u2014 especially those with higher stakes.Politicians or other powerful actors will often reframe the referendum into simplistic, straightforward narratives. The result is that votes become less about the actual policy question than about contests between abstract values, or between which narrative voters find more appealing.In Britain\u2019s debate over whether to leave the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d neither side emphasized the specifics of membership in the bloc, instead framing the vote as a choice about which values to emphasize. The \u201cRemain\u201d campaign presented membership as a matter of economic stability. The \u201cLeave\u201d campaign emphasized immigration.It worked. People who voted to remain expressed great concern about the economy, but not much about immigrants. People who voted to leave said they were very concerned about immigration, and less so about the economy.Colombia, Ms. Cirone said, also highlighted that \u201cin contexts where the referendum addresses a historical political issue, it may be hard for voters to separate past experiences with what is best for the country in the future.\u201dIn Thailand, the military-led government held a referendum in August to approve a new Constitution that would entrench its power and curtail elements of democracy. But the military also promised elections only after the Constitution passed, in effect selling an anti-democratic document as the pro-elections choice. The measure passed.Though presented as putting power in the hands of the people, referendums are often intended to put a stamp of popular legitimacy on something leaders have already decided to do.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a lot to do with whether this should be decided by the people,\u201d Ms. Cirone said. \u201cIt has to do with whether a politician can gain an advantage from putting a question to the people.\u201dFor example, David Cameron, until July the British prime minister, held the vote on whether to depart the European Union expecting that it would bolster his decision to stay in the bloc and would thus silence British politicians who wanted to leave.The Thai military restricted news coverage of the draft Constitution, ensuring that there was no counternarrative that might portray it as a threat to democracy. By giving the appearance of popular input, the military in fact dampened it.This stamp of popular legitimacy, though, can sometimes be a good thing, settling contentious national disputes that might otherwise lead to political turmoil or even to armed conflict. But it is precisely because the stakes are so high that the risks are, as well.This shows an important way referendums are different from regular elections: They succeed only when the nation perceives the vote as reflecting popular will. That works best if turnout is high and one side wins in a landslide, as happened in Northern Ireland\u2019s 1998 vote.But in Colombia, turnout was just 38 percent, and the vote was split almost perfectly down the middle, meaning a few thousand people swung the outcome. Even if the referendum had passed, it would have failed to give the peace deal popular legitimacy.That problem can be solved by requiring high turnout and a landslide victory for a referendum to be binding, Ms. Cirone said. But in a puzzling decision, neither Colombia nor Britain required more than 50 percent of the vote for either side to win.A low-turnout, close result like Colombia\u2019s can risk deepening political disputes rather than bridging them. Leaders have to choose whether to accept a result that does not demonstrably reflect popular will, or reject the result and risk a political backlash or a constitutional crisis.National referendums can also be extremely volatile, driven by factors unrelated to the issue\u2019s merits and outside anyone\u2019s control.Opinion polls are often misleading because people do not form their opinions until immediately before the vote. Tellingly, they often abandon those views just as quickly.Professor Marsh of Trinity College Dublin said he had found, in some cases, that \u201cmost people can\u2019t remember any arguments for \u2014 this is about a week later \u2014 they can\u2019t remember any arguments against, and they\u2019re not really quite sure why they voted yes or no.\u201dHe added, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t inspire me, really, with referendums.\u201dThe ambient noise of politics can also distort popular will: Whether one party is up or down in the polls, whether intraparty infighting over the vote spills into public, and how the news media portrays related issues all play a role.Votes are also subject to random factors, including the weather. In Colombia, turnout for the referendum may have been depressed by a hurricane that hit the day before, forcing evacuations in some areas.\u201cThis isn\u2019t democracy; it is Russian roulette for republics,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

As the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg realized early in his tenure, cities, with their concentrated populations, can play an important role in addressing local air pollution as well as global climate change. (Mr. Bloomberg helped to lead a delegation of mayors from various countries at last December\u2019s global climate summit meetings in Paris, and their presence had much to do with pushing a final agreement over the finish line.)Moreover, it has proved easier to act locally than to push legislation through Congress, many of whose members publicly question the existence of human-caused climate change, and whose recalcitrance has forced President Obama to use his executive powers to get anything done on climate change or, for that matter, any environmental issue.Last month, the Los Angeles City Council took an important step toward getting 100 percent of the city\u2019s energy from renewable sources. It is only at the beginning of the process. There is no timeline, but the Department of Water and Power has been ordered to study how the city could reach that goal.The obstacles are formidable. The city now gets only about a quarter of its energy from renewables, mainly wind. To get to 100 percent, it would need to convert a power grid that relies on coal and gas power plants that can adjust their supply to meet demand into one that can handle the vagaries of solar and wind power.Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s second-most-populous city, has the potential to serve as an especially powerful role model for other cities, just as California has served as a model for other states and, indeed, the nation as a whole. It has taken a crucial first step by committing to study the issue.

It\u2019s late summer. She is wearing a seasonable, unfashionable tan under a white cotton dress with high espadrilles; and she has brought her glasses, her Blackberry, her sweater in case of air conditioning and a 350-page manuscript.You\u2019d be excused for guessing the manuscript is her own. Parker, 51, has been acting for over four decades, which is plenty of justification for a memoir. It\u2019s been almost 20 years since the premiere of \u201cSex and the City,\u201d the show that fixed her star in Manhattan\u2019s sky and made her character, Carrie Bradshaw, the avatar of self-serving womanhood. Neither character nor actress has since known a day\u2019s rest from inspiring other people\u2019s personal style, and if Parker were to print an inventory of her storage closet and bind it in her favorite color, peacock blue, it would be a best seller.Parker\u2019s father was a poet and journalist, and she has \u201cthe greatest respect and love\u201d for what writers, editors and even literary agents do. What she is doing herself, for Hogarth, is an ode more to her mother, Barbara Forste, a retired nursery schoolteacher and lifelong, compulsive reader. If Parker can be found reading in the makeup chair on an HBO set, it is because Forste used to drive the kids to school with a novel in her lap, and if Parker is excited to work with librarians \u2014 Hogarth is partnering with the American Library Association to get more books, and not just Hogarth books, into more hands \u2014 it is because Forste made sure a young Sarah Jessica was never without a library book in her school bag.\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d she asks me, picking up one of the two paperbacks I\u2019ve brought with me, scanning the back cover and opening it at random to bury her nose in the crepey musk. \u201cPeople have tried to bottle the smell of old books,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s the most elusive thing, like trying to recreate a great story. You can\u2019t, which is what makes it special.\u201d A literary manuscript, she says, should come with a blank white cover \u2014 no title, no name \u2014 like a vial of perfume for a blind test, without a whiff of identity.The manuscript she\u2019s reading is of a novel by Edan Lepucki, \u201cWoman No. 17,\u201d to be published by Hogarth in May, and it is one of dozens she will read \u2014 for research, a sense of the landscape \u2014 before fall, when SJP for Hogarth makes its first round of selections. Criteria, says Parker, include \u201cgreat stories\u201d and \u201cglobal voices,\u201d which is another way of saying she can\u2019t say too much. But we can take our clues from the qualities she has noted in recent literature. The Irish novelist Eimear McBride wields a language in her 2013 debut, \u201cA Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing,\u201d that is as \u201cbrutal and mythic, almost familiar\u201d as it is formally inventive, whereas Colson Whitehead takes a history of mass brutality and makes it \u201chappen right in front of you\u201d in his latest, \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d Donna Tartt\u2019s 2013 novel, \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d is magnificent in its sweep but also in its dusty particulars, like \u201cthe smell of dad\u2019s wet wool in the back of a closet,\u201d while Lionel Shriver\u2019s \u201cThe Post-Birthday World\u201d makes a trip to the grocery store unforgettable.

But when Marvel came calling, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIt was the craziest offer I ever got,\u201d says Coates, who ended up collaborating with the artist Brian Stelfreeze. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to mull it over.\u201dWriting comic books would seem to represent a radical change of course for Coates. But it is also a return to roots. Growing up in West Baltimore, he was an obsessive reader of \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cThe Uncanny X-Men.\u201d \u201cThey felt like an allegory for what my life was,\u201d Coates says.\u201cBlack Panther\u201d has the rock \u2019em, sock \u2019em action and pulp plotlines that comics fans expect. But Coates\u2019s preoccupations peek through. His \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a meditation on the burdens and costs of political power, on gender relations, on the dynamics of popular uprisings. The language also has a telltale Coatesian ring, mixing a journalist\u2019s economy with ringing lyricism. \u201cBefore I became a journalist, I really wanted to be a poet,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2009\u2018Black Panther\u2019 reminded me of the old days of trying to write poetry. You need to get things across but you don\u2019t have much space.\u201dCoates has signed on to write another dozen \u201cBlack Panther\u201d books. And he has become something of comic-book impresario, helping to recruit two leading black writers, the essayist Roxane Gay and the poet Yona Harvey, to collaborate on a \u201cBlack Panther\u201d companion series, \u201cWorld of Wakanda.\u201dAn article on Page 132 this weekend about the journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s new foray into comic-book writing with the series \u201cBlack Panther\u201d misspells the given name of a writer Coates has helped recruit to work on a companion series. She is Roxane Gay, not Roxanne.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Investor\u2019s Plan to Transplant Private Health Care in Africa", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The eyes of the private equity investor lit up as he strode across the empty floor of a recently built hospital here. There was not much to see: a stretch of unfinished concrete, and steel bars pushed into a corner.Room for more patients \u2014 and a nice return on his investment.\u201cYou could squeeze another 50 beds in here, easy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will really improve profits.\u201dAbraaj is trying to do something that hasn\u2019t been tried before: build a global network of hospitals across cultures and in some of the poorest parts of the world \u2014 including India, Pakistan, Ethiopia and here in Kenya. Mr. Mann\u2019s new fund has just bought a fast-growing hospital in India and is now trying to export its business model to Africa.Even in rich countries with sophisticated medical markets, it can be tricky, given vastly different regulatory regimes and national quirks, for a hospital to go global. Few have done it. Abraaj, however, is betting that Indians, Nigerians and Pakistanis, who in many cases have annual incomes of no more than $1,000, will dip into their savings to pay for an angioplasty or some other necessary, but not necessarily cheap, procedure.The process is further complicated by cultural differences. The Abraaj-owned hospital chain in Hyderabad, India, for instance, is run by a doctor so revered locally that he approaches \u201cguru\u201d status. Some patients refer to him as a god.As a business model, that might not scale.Still, India, Kenya and other less-developed economies share crucial similarities. Government-run hospitals offer cheap or even free care, but they can be extremely overcrowded and grim. With personal incomes rising, Abraaj thinks an emerging middle class of teachers, small-business owners, call-center workers and others will be eager to pay private doctors for better care.But in a country where the main afflictions are malaria, meningitis and road accidents, the 150-bed hospital has become a destination for people willing to pay for decent medical attention. And then there is the rapid rise of unfamiliar ailments in poorer countries \u2014 diabetes, heart disease and obesity. They, too, are a byproduct of booming economies and rising wages, which enable unhealthier diets.\u201cNairobi is a sweet spot for us,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cThere is a big population that is growing. You have emerging middle incomes. And there is a massive need for health care.\u201dHe was in town to \u2014 he hopes \u2014 clinch a deal to buy Metropolitan for the $1 billion health care fund that Abraaj started this year. Mr. Mann is not the only one with this idea: Eight other private equity investors have visited recently, according to Metropolitan\u2019s chief executive.Abraaj\u2019s fund includes money from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the medical parts companies Philips Healthcare and Medtronic, as well as other big institutional investors. \u201cThere will be some heavy lifting ahead \u2014 $1 billion is a lot of money to deploy in these types of markets,\u201d said Maria Kozloski, who oversees private equity investments at the International Finance Corporation, the finance arm of the World Bank, which has also invested in the fund. \u201cThe opportunity is compelling, but it\u2019s going to take some time.\u201dThe fund\u2019s size also reflects investors\u2019 appetite for new ways to invest in emerging markets \u2014 an asset class that represents one-half of the global economy \u2014 after four years of so-so returns in publicly traded markets.Abraaj is not well known in the usual private equity circles of New York and London. But with $10 billion under management, among the most any private equity firm has invested in these markets, its name is well traveled in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa. For years now, its founder, Arif Naqvi, has been pushing the notion that the best way for long-term investors to benefit from core emerging market themes \u2014 growing urbanization and consumption \u2014 is through long-term private equity investments that target specific business sectors, as opposed to volatile stock and bond market bets.The health care fund, which Mr. Naqvi conceived, is a prime example.Most emerging market investors tend to get their exposure via public stock and bond markets, for instance, by buying shares in Brazilian oil companies or Russian government bonds. But these investments tend to be extremely volatile, shooting up and down in tune with ever shifting risk perceptions in a given country.Abraaj, by contrast, tries to spot investment ideas less likely to be whipsawed by the headlines. In an interview, Mr. Naqvi cited a recent investment in a Turkish dairy company \u2014 made at a time when Turks were protesting against their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\u201cTurks will drink milk irrespective of who governs them,\u201d Mr. Naqvi said.Selling beer to thirsty Ethiopians or dairy products to Turks is a fairly simple proposition. And it gets at the core thesis of investing in these markets, which is to take advantage of young and growing populations in rapidly developing economies.The trick, of course, is to pick the right companies \u2014 because there is no quick and easy way to dump a stake in a private company, as you can with a stock on a public exchange.It is this fundamental challenge \u2014 finding the right company, with the right management team \u2014 that has kept emerging-market private equity funds from growing like their larger peers in more developed markets. After all, it can be hard to get a true reading of your business partner in Jakarta, Indonesia, if you are sitting in New York, London or Hong Kong, as is the case with most private equity shops.Abraaj tries to solve that by being based in Dubai and maintaining 20 regional offices, in places like Cairo and Karachi, Pakistan. Its principals also hail from these markets. In addition to Mr. Naqvi, who is from Pakistan, the firm\u2019s senior partners are citizens of Egypt, Ghana, India, Mexico and Turkey.The 48-year-old Mr. Mann is typical in this respect. Born in the dicier precincts of Birmingham, England, to parents who had recently immigrated from Pakistan, Mr. Mann went to Cambridge, won a scholarship to the Wharton School and dropped his plan to become a doctor, switching to law and finance.Today he lives in Dubai and spends at least three weeks a month searching for hospitals and health clinics to buy in places like Ethiopia, Nigeria and Pakistan. He wears the tightfitting suits of a money-center banker, carries a fancy handbag and converses fluently in Urdu and Hindi.With his slick suit and practiced smile, Dr. Thenya seems more a deal maker than a doctor. Both he and Mr. Mann caused a bit of a stir, rushing up and down the hospital\u2019s spartan hallways and bursting into crowded patient rooms.Mr. Mann brimmed with questions about how to get doctors to see more patients and provide them with more profitable services. In a laboratory where blood samples from patients are analyzed, Mr. Mann asked how long each test took.Between 15 to 30 minutes, he is told.\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou want to get the tests back as quickly as possible.\u201dThen Mr. Mann poked his head into the room housing the hospital\u2019s single CT scan machine. The room was empty but for a bored-looking attendant hunched over a computer. These machines are a rarity in Kenya, and for hospitals looking to maximize profits, they are crucial pieces of equipment.Mr. Mann asked the doctor how many scans he performed in a day.About seven, came the reply.He shook his head. \u201cYou could be making a lot more money out of that machine,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cYou could be doing as many as 15 to 20 patients a day. A machine like this can really drive profitability.\u201dMr. Naqvi, in marketing Abraaj\u2019s health fund, has insisted that its emphasis will be to have a positive social impact first and make money second. He refers to this mix of capitalism and social good \u2014 a bit majestically \u2014 as \u201cpartnership capital.\u201d Nevertheless, both he and Mr. Mann know that any vision of a benevolent health conglomerate will not materialize unless they can find hospitals that are financially sound.Perhaps the greatest tension for Abraaj to resolve is pricing. Few patients in India or Africa have health insurance. In Kenya, 67 percent of health expenditures are paid out of pocket. And in India \u2014 the fund\u2019s central focus \u2014 that number is 60 percent.This makes for extremely price-sensitive patients.For example, the Hyderabad hospital chain that Abraaj recently bought, Care, has a business model that relies on patients paying $3,000 for a heart bypass operation, even though average income per capita in India is half that amount. (In the United States, similar treatment might cost $40,000, although insurance would help.)\u201cLook, this is not Mother Teresa stuff \u2014 we have a responsibility to our investors,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cBut in this case, I really think that you can do good and make money.\u201dWhen Mr. Naqvi hired Mr. Mann to head the new fund in 2014, their first challenge was to find a country, and a hospital, that would serve as the driving force for the project. Because of India\u2019s 200-million-person middle class and its wealth of doctors and surgeons trained to world standards, it was a logical place to start.Mr. Mann had long been aware of the niche that Care had carved out for itself, with its 16 hospitals serving a wide area in and around Hyderabad and other parts of central India. Mr. Mann knew, too, that to make the dream work across countries and continents, it would not be enough to swoop into Nigeria, buy the best hospital he could find and hope for the best.Training Nigerians and Kenyans how to use a CT scan or conduct a routine heart operation would be critical. If he could tap into the programs for professional advancement that Care had already built, he theorized, perhaps he could train his new doctors at a fraction of the cost it would take to send them to Europe or the United States.These doctors would then return to their home countries grasping not only the latest medical techniques but how to get people to pay for them \u2014 a sensitive dynamic that has been at the root of Care\u2019s success.Leading Care, spiritually as well as medically, is its popular chairman, Dr. B. Soma Raju, a 69-year-old cardiologist. He made his name developing an affordable coronary stent many years back when they cost too much to import to India.A quiet, stooped man, Dr. Soma Raju mumbles, making it hard for his fellow doctors and patients to hear him. But they hang on his every word, and he has been known to treat as many as 100 patients in a day.For a number of years now, the vast majority of those who come to see him have illnesses related to diabetes. Close to 70 million people in India \u2014 second only to China \u2014 have been found to have the disease as a growing number of Indians lead more sedentary lives and eat more processed foods.The result has been a sharp increase in what medical experts call truncal obesity, where fat is stored mainly around the waist. That can lead directly to heart problems, kidney disease and loss of sleep.One day this month, Dr. Soma Raju saw a patient who fit the pattern perfectly. The owner of a village rice mill, the 61-year-old man had traveled far to be seen by the doctor.Days without sleep had inflamed his eyes. In a ragged voice, he described what ailed him. And then there was his weight: 262 pounds, far too heavy for a man standing 5 feet 5 inches tall, the nation\u2019s average.\u201cHe has serious sleep apnea, blood sugar is increasing, and blood pressure is up,\u201d Dr. Soma Raju explained. He advised the patient to exercise more, but his condition was so grave that the doctor also felt that weight-reduction surgery was needed.In the large waiting room outside his examination chamber, every chair was filled. And as was the case with the owner of the rice mill, many patients had traveled more than 400 miles to see the doctor \u2014 not only from tiny rural villages but also metropolises like Mumbai.India is a country where a doctor\u2019s counsel is often viewed as sacred. One patient, a 77-year-old retired farmer who also had diabetes, said that he \u201cbelieved in Dr. Soma Raju like a god.\u201d Upon leaving the office, he bowed deeply before him.All of which is good for business at Care. The hospital\u2019s dialysis wards are filled to capacity, and many of the doctor\u2019s patients \u2014 like the rice mill owner, for example \u2014 are paying full price for the services they receive, reflecting the growing wealth of India\u2019s middle classes and the dearth of government spending on health care.Dr. Soma Raju is as fluent in the language of finance as that of medicine. And such jargon as Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 or, more simply, cash), profit margins and six sigma (a management style popularized by the former General Electric chief executive Jack Welch) rolls easily off his and his fellow doctors\u2019 tongues.When making his rounds in Hyderabad, Mr. Mann often asks that Care doctors take him to surrounding villages, where the hospital is opening small outposts. While Care is based largely in cities, about 70 percent of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people live in rural areas.Recently he traveled to Kandlakoya, a hamlet of about 2,000 people an hour\u2019s drive from the city, where cows jostle with cars for right of passage. The bare-bones doctor\u2019s office, a single room, was stuffed with a desk, a patient\u2019s chair and a hospital bed, and a crowd of elderly men patiently waited their turns.Presiding was a garrulous, 73-year-old doctor, who briefed Mr. Mann on the day\u2019s afflictions: water contamination, anemia and most of all, complications from diabetes.Are they paying for their visits, Mr. Mann asked?\u201cOh, yes, sir,\u201d replied the doctor, G. S. N. Raju, pointing to his scribbled notations in a battered ledger. \u201cThey come to me and tell me their problems.\u201dThen, to Mr. Mann\u2019s surprise, the doctor grabbed him in a tight embrace. A more buttoned-up deal maker might have stiffened, but Mr. Mann pulled the small man close.\u201cProfitable, impactful and outreaching,\u201d he proclaimed, a smile breaking out on his face. \u201cThis is the essence of partnership capital.\u201dIt was good P.R., too \u2014 an Abraaj public relations executive was quick to capture the moment on his camera. He also suggested that the ebullient doctor be flown to Dubai for the firm\u2019s next investor conference.While the Abraaj model seems to be working in India, it is not clear yet whether the strategy will immediately transfer to poorer countries in Africa where people may have more trouble paying for their visits.One way to start to understand why Care has so many willing customers is to visit the alternative \u2014 an Indian government-run hospital. This can require a steely stomach, particularly in urban areas, where the population is outracing already overburdened facilities.At one children\u2019s hospital in Hyderabad, large crowds of parents, having made the trek from distant villages, squatted recently in a concrete lot in the rain. This was essentially the waiting room. As families endured sometimes dayslong waits for their turns with a doctor, their children relieved themselves in the street.These types of conditions replicate themselves at government hospitals across India. Treatment is more or less free, but the facilities are Dickensian in comparison with the Care hospital \u2014 teeming emergency rooms, with hundreds of parents and children pushing for a single doctor\u2019s attention.The Indian government spends only about 1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, and it shows. All of this helps explain why people who can afford to do so pay for hospitals like Care.Similar scenes play out in Kenyan public hospitals. After his meetings at the private health facilities in Nairobi wrapped up, Mr. Mann dropped in at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital.Named after a former first lady of Kenya and built with help from the Chinese government, it is in a rundown eastern suburb of Nairobi. The emergency ward of its pediatric wing was a swarm of crying infants and sickly children, packed closely together, noses dribbling and wounds open, with few doctors in sight. \u201cDid you see all those with contagious diseases squeezed into that room?\u201d Mr. Mann muttered.He said he tried to stop in at state-run facilities in the countries he visited to get a better sense of how public health care was administered \u2014 to size up the competition.Like all ambitious private equity figures, Mr. Mann finds the glory of a billion-dollar deal \u2014 and the potential for a financial reward at the end \u2014 an obvious motivation. But a large part of his job, he says, lies in making the moral case for providing high-quality health care to lower- and middle-income patients in these countries. \u201cHow often do you get an opportunity to do something like this \u2014 I mean, to really make a difference?\u201d he said.He is also feeling the pressure to make this grand project work. Bill Gates is watching, and so are the World Bank (via its financing arm) and, not least, Mr. Naqvi, the fund\u2019s philosophical father, to whom Mr. Mann writes detailed mission notes describing each step taken.\u201cOf course I am nervous,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cI think about this 24/7.\u201dTo some observers, the two ideas he most frequently deploys in explaining the goals of the Abraaj fund \u2014 cash flow and care \u2014 are more contradictory than symbiotic. Among those people was Karivki Ngure, a medical student doing his rotation at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital.\u201cAll these things are good on paper,\u201d he said, after running into Mr. Mann and hearing what Abraaj was doing in Kenya. \u201cBut if you come to this facility here, you will realize that there is a real need at this level,\u201d he said, referring to the impoverished patients. \u201cSo what do you do about them?\u201dIt was a fair point, and Mr. Mann knew it. He knew, too, that in terms of what Abraaj was hoping to do, without the cash flow there would be no care to give.\u201cWe can\u2019t go to that part of the population because the business is just not sustainable,\u201d he responded.The delegation from Abraaj finished the day at the office of the hospital\u2019s head, Musa Mohammed, a child of refugees from the war-torn South Sudan. Mr. Mohammed asked Mr. Mann pointed questions about the prices his privately run Kenyan hospitals were charging patients.Mr. Mohammed, who was raised in the Nairobi neighborhood of Kibera, considered Africa\u2019s largest slum, argued forcefully that the government needed to step in more aggressively to cap health care prices. \u201cI know the private sector has to make a profit,\u201d he said, choosing his words carefully. \u201cBut how much profit? But I guess this is why it is called a free-market economy.\u201dMr. Mann did not agree that private hospitals in Kenya, not least the ones he was going to buy, were gouging their customers. But he held his tongue: Mr. Mohammed\u2019s moral authority was daunting. Mr. Mann would try to win him over instead. So he asked the hospital chief if he could come by for a visit the next time he was in Nairobi.An article last Sunday about efforts by the Abraaj Group to develop private health care systems in Africa rendered incorrectly the name of a medical device company that has invested in the group\u2019s $1 billion health care fund. It is Medtronic, not Medtronics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Three Strong-Performing Funds Pick Stocks", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byMany stock-picking styles have sizzled lately, with growth and value and domestic and international investing all toting up gains. Three of the better-performing mutual funds of recent months found their winners among small- and large-cap growth stocks and Chinese shares.\u201cOur typical company might have only six analysts following it, compared to maybe 50 for Apple,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. The Hood River managers say there is a \u201cresearch gap\u201d that they can fill, thanks to their 20 years of work with small caps.The three met in the 1990s while working at what was then Columbia Management in Portland, Ore. In the early 2000s, Mr. Smoluch and Mr. Marvin created a predecessor to their fund at Roxbury Capital Management. A few years later, they recruited Mr. Swank, and, in 2013, the three started Hood River Capital Management, also in Portland.As stock pickers, they\u2019re generalists, surveying all parts of the market. They will scoop up several companies in a field if they see growing companies benefiting from a broader trend. They have done that in fiber optics, with holdings like Oclaro, Fabrinet and Finisar, all recent double-digit gainers.\u201cFor a while, there was a huge overcapacity of components for fiber networks,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve had a major industry consolidation combined with accelerating demand,\u201d as networks upgrade to meet the bandwidth needs of smartphones, cloud computing and video streaming.In researching a promising company, they talk with its competitors, customers and suppliers. They estimate they make about 1,000 calls a year. Talks with pharmaceutical and biotech executives led them to a holding in PRA Health Sciences.\u201cIt\u2019s a contract research organization that manages clinical trials,\u201d Mr. Swank said. \u201cBased on our conversations, we believe it\u2019s gaining market share, and the entire industry is being helped along by the high level of biotech financing that happened in 2015.\u201dThe institutional shares of the Hood River fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 15.01 percent in the third quarter, compared with 3.85 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Baker builds his portfolio around themes that he sees shaping technology and the economy, like the emergence of artificial intelligence, and seeks stocks with strategies that will play out over three to seven years. Market attention tends to be short-term, creating opportunities for people who can be more patient, he said.He has long held Amazon shares, for example, even as other investors have said they are overvalued, based on the price-earnings ratio.\u201cAmazon has gone, over the last 15 years, from $5 to $840,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019d think people would wear down and realize that looking at it on current-period earnings isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.\u201d\u201cMore than a million people die every year driving,\u201d he said. \u201cSelf-driving cars will never drive drunk or high or distracted. They won\u2019t be texting and driving.\u201dArtificial intelligence favors the biggest tech companies, he said, because it demands lots of data and cheap, powerful computing, both of which they have in abundance.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009, and over the last five years, it has been one of the top performers among large-cap growth funds, returning an annualized average of 18.53 percent. In the third quarter, it returned 11.89 percent. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.91 percent.The fund holds only 36 stocks, a deliberately focused selection, he said. \u201cYou have to choose between the last two to get down to the one you really like,\u201d he said.For several years, worrisome economic news has streamed from China \u2014 reports of a slowing economy, overheated real estate markets and banks fat with problem loans. Mr. Mattock said such macro scares have buffeted China portfolios, on and off, for the roughly 15 years he has been investing in the country.But the \u201cobsession with macro,\u201d he said, has overshadowed a continued maturation of Chinese companies that offers opportunities for committed investors. \u201cWe have a lot of the big industry leaders in the portfolio, and these macro stories meant I could pick them up at a very good price,\u201d he said.In insurance, for example, the fund owns Ping An and China Life, two of the country\u2019s biggest insurers. In e-commerce, it holds Alibaba and Vipshop Holdings. Alibaba and Vipshop are leading e-commerce companies.The Matthews fund, with an expense ratio of 1.14 percent, returned 14.95 percent in the third quarter.An article in the special Mutual Fund Quarterly section last Sunday about the strongest-performing mutual funds misstated the expense ratio for the institutional shares of the Hood River Small-Cap Growth Fund. It was 1.09 percent, a net figure that accounts for fee waivers and expense reimbursements by the fund company, not 1.49 percent, which is the gross expense ratio.Advertisement"}

He dispatched an aide to buy the ship, the Serene, which was owned by Yuri Shefler, a Russian vodka tycoon. The deal was done within hours, at a price of approximately 500 million euros (roughly $550 million today), according to an associate of Mr. Shefler and a Saudi close to the royal family. The Russian moved off the yacht the same day.It is the paradox of the brash, 31-year-old Prince bin Salman: a man who is trying to overturn tradition, reinvent the economy and consolidate power \u2014 while holding tight to his royal privilege. In less than two years, he has emerged as the most dynamic royal in the Arab world\u2019s wealthiest nation, setting up a potential rivalry for the throne.His seemingly boundless ambitions have led many Saudis and foreign officials to suspect that his ultimate goal is not just to transform the kingdom, but also to shove aside the current crown prince, his 57-year-old cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, to become the next king. Such a move could further upset his relatives and \u2014 if successful \u2014 give the country what it has never seen: a young king who could rule the kingdom for many decades.Crown Prince bin Nayef, the interior minister and longtime counterterrorism czar, has deep ties to Washington and the support of many of the older royals. Deciphering the dynamics of the family can be like trying to navigate a hall of mirrors, but many Saudi and American officials say Prince bin Salman has made moves aimed at reaching into Prince bin Nayef\u2019s portfolios and weakening him.This has left officials in Washington hedging their bets by building relationships with both men, unsure who will end up on top. The White House got an early sign of the ascent of the young prince in late 2015, when \u2014 breaking protocol \u2014 Prince bin Salman delivered a soliloquy about the failures of American foreign policy during a meeting between his father, King Salman, and President Obama.Many young Saudis admire him as an energetic representative of their generation who has addressed some of the country\u2019s problems with uncommon bluntness. The kingdom\u2019s news media have built his image as a hardworking, businesslike leader less concerned than his predecessors with the trappings of royalty.Others see him as a power-hungry upstart who is risking instability by changing too much, too fast.Months of interviews with Saudi and American officials, members of the royal family and their associates, and diplomats focused on Saudi affairs reveal a portrait of a prince in a hurry to prove that he can transform Saudi Arabia. Prince bin Salman declined multiple interview requests for this article.But the question many raise \u2014 and cannot yet answer \u2014 is whether the energetic leader will succeed in charting a new path for the kingdom, or whether his impulsiveness and inexperience will destabilize the Arab world\u2019s largest economy at a time of turbulence in the Middle East.Early this year, Crown Prince bin Nayef left the kingdom for his family\u2019s villa in Algeria, a sprawling compound an hour\u2019s drive north of Algiers. Although he has long taken annual hunting vacations there, many who know him said that this year was different. He stayed away for weeks, largely incommunicado and often refusing to respond to messages from Saudi officials and close associates in Washington. Even John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director, whom he has known for decades, had difficulty reaching him.But his lengthy absence at a time of low oil prices, turmoil in the Middle East and a foundering Saudi-led war in Yemen led several American officials to conclude that the crown prince was fleeing frictions with his younger cousin and that the prince was worried his chance to ascend the throne was in jeopardy.The exact personal relationship between the two men is unclear, fueling discussion in Saudi Arabia and in foreign capitals about who is ascendant. Obscuring the picture are the stark differences in the men\u2019s public profiles. Prince bin Nayef has largely stayed in the shadows, although he did visit New York last month to address the United Nations General Assembly before heading to Turkey for a state visit.\u201cThere is no topic that is more important than succession matters, especially now,\u201d said Joseph A. Kechichian, a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, who has extensive contacts in the Saudi royal family. \u201cThis matters for monarchy, for the regional allies and for the kingdom\u2019s international partners.\u201dThe prosecution of the war by a prince with no military experience has exacerbated tensions between him and his older cousins, according to American officials and members of the royal family. Three of Saudi Arabia\u2019s main security services are run by princes. Although all agreed that the kingdom had to respond when the Houthis seized the Yemeni capital and forced the government into exile, Prince bin Salman took the lead, launching the war in March 2015 without full coordination across the security services.The head of the National Guard, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, had not been informed and was out of the country when the first strikes were carried out, according to a senior National Guard officer.The National Guard is now holding much of the Yemeni border.American officials, too, were put off when, just as the Yemen campaign was escalating, Prince bin Salman took a vacation in the Maldives, the island archipelago off the coast of India. Several American officials said Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter had trouble reaching him for days during one part of the trip.The prolonged war has also heightened tensions between Prince bin Salman and Prince bin Nayef, who won the respect of Saudis and American officials for dismantling Al Qaeda in the kingdom nearly a decade ago and now sees it taking advantage of chaos in Yemen, according to several American officials and analysts.\u201cIf Mohammed bin Nayef wanted to be seen as a big supporter of this war, he\u2019s had a year and a half to do it,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former Middle East analyst at the C.I.A. and a fellow at the Brookings Institution.Near the start of the war, Prince bin Salman was a forceful public advocate for the campaign and was often photographed visiting troops and meeting with military leaders. But as the campaign has stalemated, such appearances have grown rare.This is part of what analysts say is Prince bin Salman\u2019s attempt to foster a sense of Saudi national identity that has not existed since the kingdom\u2019s founding in 1932.\u201cThere has been a surge of Saudi nationalism since the campaign in Yemen began, with the sense that Saudi Arabia is taking independent collective action,\u201d said Andrew Bowen, a Saudi expert at the Wilson Center in Washington.Still, Mr. Bowen said support among younger Saudis could diminish the longer the conflict dragged on. Diplomats say the death toll for Saudi troops is higher than the government has publicly acknowledged, and a recent deadly airstrike on a funeral in the Yemeni capital has renewed calls by human rights groups and some American lawmakers to block or delay weapons sales to the kingdom.People who have met Prince bin Salman said he insisted that Saudi Arabia must be more assertive in shaping events in the Middle East and confronting Iran\u2019s influence in the region \u2014 whether in Yemen, Syria, Iraq or Lebanon.Brian Katulis, a Middle East expert at the Center for American Progress in Washington, who met the prince this year in Riyadh, said his agenda was clear.\u201cHis main message is that Saudi Arabia is a force to be reckoned with,\u201d Mr. Katulis said.Saudi Arabia is one of the world\u2019s few remaining absolute monarchies, which means that Prince bin Salman was given all of his powers by a vote of one: his own father.More important, the king decreed a new order of succession, overturning the wishes of King Abdullah and replacing his designated crown prince, Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, with Prince bin Nayef.While all previous Saudi kings and crown princes had been sons of the kingdom\u2019s founder, Prince bin Nayef was the first of the founder\u2019s grandsons to be put in line. Many hailed the move because of the prince\u2019s success at fighting Al Qaeda and because he has only daughters, leading many to hope he would choose a successor based on merit rather than paternity.The bigger surprise was that the king named Prince bin Salman deputy crown prince. He was 29 years old at the time and virtually unknown to the kingdom\u2019s closest allies.This effectively scrapped the political aspirations of his older relatives, many of whom had decades of experience in public life and in key sectors like defense and oil policy. Some are still angry \u2014 although only in private, out of deference to the 80-year-old king.Since then, Prince bin Salman has moved quickly to build his public profile and market himself to other nations as the point man for the kingdom.Read in one way, the documents are an ambitious blueprint to change the Saudi way of life. Read in another, they are a scathing indictment of how poorly the kingdom has been run by Prince bin Salman\u2019s elders.Official government development plans going back decades have called for reducing the dependence on oil and increasing Saudi employment \u2014 to little effect. And in calling for transparency and accountability, the plan acknowledges that both have been in short supply. Diplomats and economists say much about the Saudi economy remains opaque, including the cost of generous perks and stipends for members of the royal family.Many Saudis say his age and ambition are benefits at a time when old ways of thinking must be changed.\u201cHe is speaking in the language of the youth,\u201d said Hoda al-Helaissi, a member of the kingdom\u2019s advisory Shura Council, which is appointed by the king. \u201cThe country for too long has been looking through the lenses of the older generation, and we need to look at who is going to carry the torch to the next generation.\u201dOthers have been popular. After Prince bin Salman called for more entertainment options for families and young people, who often flee the country on their vacations, the cabinet passed regulations restricting the powers of the religious police. An Entertainment Authority he established has planned its first activities, which include comedy shows, pro wrestling events and monster truck rallies.Instead, he has sought the favor of younger clerics who boast millions of followers on social media. After the release of Vision 2030, Prince bin Salman held a reception for Saudi journalists and academics that included a number of younger, tech-savvy clerics who have gone forth to praise the plan.Prince bin Salman\u2019s prominence today was difficult to predict during his early years, spent largely below the radar of Western officials who keep track of young Saudi royals who might one day rule the kingdom.Several of King Salman\u2019s other sons, who studied overseas to perfect foreign languages and earn advanced degrees, built impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. One became the first Arab astronaut, another a deputy oil minister, yet another the governor of Medina Province.Prince bin Salman stayed in Saudi Arabia and does not speak fluent English, although he appears to understand it. After a private school education, he studied law at King Saud University in Riyadh, reportedly graduating fourth in his class. Another prince of the same generation said he had gotten to know him during high school, when one of their uncles hosted regular dinners for the younger princes at his palace. He recalled Prince bin Salman being one of the crowd, saying he liked to play bridge and admired Margaret Thatcher.King Salman is said to see himself in his favorite son, the latest in the lineage of a family that has ruled most of the Arabian Peninsula for eight decades.Prince bin Salman graduated from the university that year and continued to work for his father, who was named defense minister in 2011, while dabbling in real estate and business.Many members of the royal family remain wary of the young prince\u2019s projects and ultimate ambitions. Some mock him as the \u201cPrince of the Vision\u201d and complain about his army of well-paid foreign consultants and image-makers.Other are annoyed by the media cell he created inside the royal court to promote his initiatives, both foreign and domestic. Called the Center for Studies and Media Affairs, the group has focused on promoting a positive story about the Yemen war in Washington and has hired numerous Washington lobbying and public affairs firms to assist in the effort.Inside the kingdom, the government has largely succeeded in keeping criticism \u2014 and even open discussion \u2014 of the prince and his projects out of the public sphere. His family holds sway over the parent company of many Saudi newspapers, which have breathlessly covered his initiatives, and prominent Saudi editors and journalists who have accompanied him on foreign trips have been given up to $100,000 in cash, according to two people who have traveled with the prince\u2019s delegation.Meanwhile, Saudi journalists deemed too critical have been quietly silenced through phone calls informing them that they are barred from publishing, and sometimes from traveling abroad.\u201cYou can buy tens of newspapers and hundreds of journalists, but you can\u2019t buy the history that will be written about you,\u201d he wrote.He said that the prince\u2019s popularity among Saudis was based on a \u201csweeping desire for great change\u201d and that they loved him based on the hope that he would \u201cturn their dreams into reality.\u201dIn that lay the risk, Mr. Qahtani wrote: \u201cIf you fail, this love withers quickly, as if it never existed, and is replaced by a deep feeling of frustration and hatred.\u201dAs sweeping and long-term as Prince bin Salman\u2019s initiatives are, they may hang by the tenuous thread of his link to his father, who has memory lapses, according to foreign officials who have met with him. Even the prince\u2019s supporters acknowledge that they are not sure he will retain his current roles after his father dies.In the meantime, he is racing against time to establish his reputation and cement his place in the kingdom\u2019s power structure.His fast ascent, and his well-publicized foreign trips to Washington, Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia, have led senior Obama administration officials to consider the prospect that he could step over Prince bin Nayef and become Saudi Arabia\u2019s next king.This has led to a balancing act for American officials who want to build a relationship with him while not being used as leverage in any rivalry with Prince bin Nayef. Obama administration officials say relations with Prince bin Salman have generally improved, but only after a rocky start when he would routinely lecture senior Americans \u2014 even the president.In November, during a Group of 20 summit meeting at a luxury resort on the Turkish coast, Prince bin Salman gave what American officials described as a lengthy speech about what he saw as the failure of American foreign policy in the Middle East \u2014 from the Obama administration\u2019s restraint in Syria to its efforts to improve relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitter enemy.Personal relationships have long been the bedrock of American-Saudi relations, yet the Obama administration has struggled to find someone to develop a rapport with the prince. The job has largely fallen to Secretary of State John Kerry, who has hosted the prince several times at his home in Georgetown. In June, the two men shared an iftar dinner, breaking the Ramadan fast. In September 2015, dinner at Mr. Kerry\u2019s house ended with Prince bin Salman playing Beethoven on the piano for the secretary of state and the other guests.His desire to reimagine the Saudi state is reflected in his admiration \u2014 some even call it envy \u2014 for the kingdom\u2019s more modern and progressive neighbor in the Persian Gulf, the United Arab Emirates.He has influential supporters in this effort, particularly the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who for more than a year has been promoting Prince bin Salman in the Middle East and in Washington.Crown Prince bin Zayed, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 de facto ruler, is a favorite among Obama administration officials, who view him as a reliable ally and a respected voice in the Sunni world. But he also has a history of personal antipathy toward Prince bin Nayef, adding a particular urgency to his support for the chief rival of the Saudi crown prince.In April of last year, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, led a small delegation of top White House officials to visit Prince bin Zayed at his home in McLean, Va. During the meeting, according to several officials who attended, the prince urged the Americans to develop a relationship with Prince bin Salman.But all questions about Prince bin Salman\u2019s future are likely to depend on how long his father lives, according to diplomats who track Saudi Arabia.If he died soon, Prince bin Nayef would become king and could dismiss his younger cousin as a gesture to his fellow royals. In fact, it was King Salman who set the precedent for such moves by dismissing the crown prince named by his predecessor.\u201cIf the king\u2019s health starts to deteriorate, Mohammed bin Salman is very likely to try to get Mohammed bin Nayef out of the picture,\u201d said Mr. Riedel, the former C.I.A. analyst.But the longer King Salman reigns, foreign officials said, the longer the young prince has to consolidate his power \u2014 or to convince Prince bin Nayef that he is worth keeping around if Prince bin Nayef becomes king.Most Saudi watchers do not expect any struggles within the family to spill into the open, as all the royals understand how much they have to lose from such fissures becoming public or destabilizing their grip on the kingdom.\u201cI am persuaded as someone who focuses on this topic that the ruling family of Saudi Arabia above all else puts the interest of the family first and foremost,\u201d said Mr. Kechichian, the analyst who knows many royals.\u201cNot a single member of the family will do anything to hurt the family.\u201dAn article on Oct. 16 about Prince Mohammed bin Salman, son of King Salman of Saudi Arabia and a potential rival with his cousin for the throne, misstated, in some editions, an achievement of another one of King Salman\u2019s sons. The son, Sultan bin Salman, was the first Arab astronaut, not the only one.Nicholas Kulish, Jo Becker and Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Are the New Battleground States?", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCan Hillary Clinton win the Republican strongholds Arizona and Georgia? At the moment, thanks to Donald J. Trump\u2019s self-destructive tendencies and both states\u2019 growing populations of professionals and nonwhites, it\u2019s possible.The 2016 election is poised to be the most polarized presidential election in our lifetime, deeply split along racial, gender, generational and educational lines. The outcome could leave the balance of power in Washington virtually unchanged and yet simultaneously heighten both parties\u2019 distrust of each other to the level of hysteria.It also promises to reorder the electoral map in powerful ways. In 1996, Bill Clinton carried Iowa, Missouri and Ohio on his way to re-election, while losing Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia. Twenty years later, Hillary Clinton\u2019s path to 270 electoral votes is more likely to do the opposite.The matchup between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump is accelerating trends that were expected to unfold gradually but have, in 2016, emerged to jolt the electoral map. The parties are realigning along an axis primarily of educational achievement, but also of race. Democrats have been on the upswing with minorities, college-educated whites and younger voters, while Republicans are increasingly reliant on older whites, whites without a degree, or both.This explains why Mr. Trump is looking for breakthroughs in states where non-college whites outnumber college-educated whites the most: Iowa (by 30 percent), Wisconsin (by 25 percent), Ohio (by 24 percent) and Nevada (by 18 percent).Conversely, it explains why Mrs. Clinton maintains an edge in states where that margin is closer, like Virginia (2 percent) and Colorado (0.1 percent), and has a strong opportunity to win North Carolina (12 percent).The Clinton campaign calculates that its candidate is likelier to prevail by \u201cdisqualifying\u201d Mr. Trump \u2014 using ads to make the idea of voting for him socially unacceptable in professional suburbs \u2014 among additional well-educated voters (in states like North Carolina) than by holding on to working-class voters tempted by Mr. Trump\u2019s populism (in states like Ohio).The Clinton campaign and its allies have run fewer ads puncturing Mr. Trump\u2019s credentials as a business savior or painting a picture of what the economy might look like for middle-income earners under a Trump presidency. That strategy carries risks.In 2012, President Obama was able to keep states like Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin in his column with early and effective ads linking Mitt Romney to Bain Capital and Cayman Islands bank accounts. Mr. Obama didn\u2019t carry a lot of blue-collar counties in these states, but the barrage helped him keep the margins close, by holding his share of the vote above 45 percent in working-class mill towns like Steubenville, Ohio, and Wausau, Wis.In 2016, however, many surveys have shown Mr. Trump holding a lead in Iowa and running nearly even in Ohio.Moreover, a Cook Political Report analysis of census data and official election results found that there were around 47 million whites without a college degree who were eligible to vote in 2012, but didn\u2019t. The overwhelming majority weren\u2019t even registered to vote. If Mr. Trump roused only a fraction of these voters, he could erase Mr. Obama\u2019s five-million-vote national margin and potentially flip states where these \u201cmissing\u201d whites were prevalent, like Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Nevada.Fortunately for Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign doesn\u2019t appear to have undertaken the kind of effort required to identify, register and turn out these whites.That\u2019s just one of the reasons Mrs. Clinton entered the homestretch in a commanding position \u2014 even before the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.States like Arizona and Georgia may have a supporting role in a Clinton victory this year \u2014 if she carries either state, she will have already won in a landslide.But in future cycles, these states may be on a trajectory for a starring role \u2014 assuming America survives this election.David N. Wasserman is the House of Representatives editor at The Cook Political Report.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Communist Party Declares Xi Jinping \u2018Core\u2019 Leader", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byMr. Xi\u2019s newest title, carrying echoes of those political strongmen, reinforces his power to shape the new leadership of the party. It is also a warning that officials should fall in line, though some privately fear he has amassed too much control and has eroded traditions of collective leadership, built up to prevent a return to the arbitrary abuses of Mao\u2019s final decades.Since he became general secretary of the party in 2012, the leadership \u201cwith Comrade Xi Jinping as its core has acted on its words and led by example,\u201d said a communiqu\u00e9 from the four-day assembly of the Central Committee.In China, such titles are a powerful political currency, and Mr. Xi\u2019s new status will resonate through the party hierarchy.The term \u201ccore\u201d does not carry particular powers. But it demonstrates to potential rivals that Mr. Xi stands above the pack in a way few modern Chinese leaders have. Officials up and down the country will face a welter of propaganda and study sessions demanding that they demonstrate their loyalty to Mr. Xi by acclaiming his new status.\u201cIt appears on the surface to further erode the concept of \u2018collective leadership\u2019 that has emerged as the norm in Chinese politics since 2000,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a researcher in Beijing who is writing a book on the legacy of Mao.\u201cIt confirms a narrative that Xi himself must be aware of \u2014 namely that the norms of power-sharing and institutionalized succession that have slowly emerged in the post-Mao era are now clearly in question,\u201d Mr. Blanchette said.People\u2019s Daily, the party\u2019s main newspaper, said that the country and one-party rule needed a powerful center of authority to weather those challenges.The term \u201ccore\u201d leader dates back to the turbulence of 1989, when Deng used it to anchor the shaky authority of Jiang Zemin, who had been abruptly appointed general secretary. Deng also said he and Mao were the core leaders of their respective generations, suggesting that they had near unassailable authority. But Mr. Xi\u2019s immediate predecessor, Hu Jintao, a cautious leader who was unable to establish his pre-eminence, never received the title.\u201cThis concept of a core will certainly help in advancing supervision inside the party and fighting corruption,\u201d Professor Nie said.The Central Committee also set in motion plans for a congress in the second half of next year, which is virtually certain to confirm Mr. Xi as national leader for five additional years and appoint a new cohort of officials under him.At the congress, many leaders must retire, giving Mr. Xi room to reshape the party\u2019s top echelon. Under the informal retirement ceiling, five of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party\u2019s highest body, must step down, leaving only Mr. Xi and the premier, Li Keqiang.In the past two leadership successions, a likely heir has emerged five or even 10 years before the incumbent\u2019s retirement as party chief. But some political insiders and analysts have said Mr. Xi may delay choosing a successor, so that he has more time and more choices, and preserves his influence.Mr. Xi\u2019s elevation \u201cshows his colleagues that he is more than willing to ignore past so-called norms, which could have big implications for appointments next fall,\u201d when the congress is likely to meet, said Christopher K. Johnson, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. It \u201cconfirms that he is no first among equals, but just first.\u201dBut the Central Committee announcement also hinted that Mr. Xi respects the need for a leadership that brings together different backgrounds. Officials should be promoted from \u201cacross the five lakes and four oceans,\u201d said the meeting communiqu\u00e9, using an old Chinese phrase for diverse backgrounds.Precisely how Mr. Xi won the title probably will not be known for a long time. Elite party politics is intensively secretive, and has become more so under him.But even that praise fell short of the official imprimatur given by the Central Committee, which met in a Soviet-style hotel opened in 1964. There, Mr. Xi also won endorsements for two new sets of rules \u2014 on party political life and supervision \u2014 that offer tools to cut off corruption, strengthen top-down control over officials and extend the reach of the party.\u201cThe party central leaders\u2019 approach is to keep up the high pressure coming from the top down,\u201d Professor Nie of Renmin University said. \u201cAnd you need to have a core to make that work.\u201dAdam Wu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What About the Planet?", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byOur two major political parties are at odds on many issues, but nowhere is the gap bigger or more consequential than on climate.If Hillary Clinton wins, she will move forward with the Obama administration\u2019s combination of domestic clean-energy policies and international negotiation \u2014 a one-two punch that offers some hope of reining in greenhouse gas emissions before climate change turns into climate catastrophe.If Donald Trump wins, the paranoid style in climate politics \u2014 the belief that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by a vast international conspiracy of scientists \u2014 will become official doctrine, and catastrophe will become all but inevitable.So why does the media seem so determined to ignore this issue? Why, in particular, does it almost seem as if there\u2019s a rule against bringing it up in debates?Before I get there, a brief summary of the policy divide.It\u2019s strange how little credit the Obama administration gets for its environmental policies.So there is a huge, incredibly consequential divide on climate policy. Not only is there a vast gap between the parties and their candidates, but this gap arguably matters more for the future than any of their other disagreements. So why don\u2019t we hear more about it?This was especially striking in Tuesday\u2019s debate.But if we\u2019re worried about the longer-term implications of current policies, the buildup of greenhouse gases is a much bigger deal than the accumulation of low-interest debt. It\u2019s bizarre to talk about the latter but not the former.Yes, I know, people should be paying more attention \u2014 but this nonetheless tells us how easy it is for voters who rely on TV news or don\u2019t read stories deep inside the paper to miss what should be a central issue in this campaign.The good news is that there are still two debates to go, offering the opportunity to make some amends.It\u2019s time to end the blackout on climate change as an issue. It needs to be front and center \u2014 and questions must be accompanied by real-time fact-checking, not relegated to the limbo of he-said-she-said, because this is one of the issues where the truth often gets lost in a blizzard of lies.There is, quite simply, no other issue this important, and letting it slide would be almost criminally irresponsible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Central Banks Consider Bitcoin\u2019s Technology, if Not Bitcoin", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byBitcoin was created by libertarian-minded programmers with a deep suspicion of central banks and the national currencies they issue.Yet it is central banks that are doing some of the most ambitious work of late in trying to harness the technology introduced by Bitcoin.The central bankers do not want their institutions to own or use Bitcoin itself. Instead, they hope they can use the decentralized method of record-keeping introduced by Bitcoin \u2014 known as the blockchain or distributed ledger \u2014 to complete and record transactions in the real economy more efficiently, quickly and transparently.The most enthusiastic central banks \u2014 including the Bank of England and the People\u2019s Bank of China \u2014 have discussed issuing their national currencies onto some sort of distributed ledger, a name that comes from the concept of several parties keeping records simultaneously.Blockchains allow several players to keep a shared spreadsheet using cryptography and so-called consensus mechanisms that provide a way to agree on which transactions happened at what time.For the central banks, the promise of the technology is that it would allow them to track every pound or renminbi on every step of its travels through the financial system in real time \u2014 something that is impossible now. The goal would be to make the financial system more transparent, fast, efficient and secure.If the central banks succeed, it would be one of the greatest unexpected twists in new technology: An invention aimed at dethroning central banks and making it harder for money to be tracked instead ends up empowering those central banks and making money more easily traceable.\u201cWe are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing and settlement,\u201d Ms. Brainard said.Even the central bank officials who are most enthusiastic about these experiments say it will be years before any central bank issues its own currency onto a live distributed ledger.Some critics say the public interest in the blockchain has been all talk and no substance \u2014 an easy way for stuffy central bankers to appear hip and relevant.David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said many of the central banks looking at blockchain technology would be better served by spending time and energy in updating the current software that underlies the financial system.\u201cIf you take a snapshot of the existing plumbing, it looks a bit ugly,\u201d Mr. Andolfatto said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing magical about a blockchain in solving this problem.\u201dEven within the Fed, though, other researchers and officials have expressed more excitement about the technology.A week before Ms. Brainard of the Fed gave her speech on distributed ledgers, the chairwoman of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, was asked about the technology at a congressional hearing. She said that \u201cinnovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society.\u201dThe Fed has been pushed to act by the big banks that it regulates, many of which are experimenting with distributed ledgers as a way to settle trades and record data and transactions. Just last week, JPMorgan Chase said it was moving toward a public release this year of its \u201centerprise grade\u201d blockchain.Most financial institutions and central banks are looking at distributed ledgers that would be maintained on the computers of all the major players in the financial system, including the central bank and the biggest financial institutions.In the systems being discussed, each player in the system would communicate with all the others anytime money moved in the system, allowing everyone to update the ledgers on their computer systems simultaneously. This would provide multiple backups if the central bank\u2019s computers came under attack. It would also hypothetically allow them to complete transactions much more quickly, and would make it easier to spot rogue actors.Eric Piscini, who oversees work on blockchain by the consulting firm Deloitte, said that a year ago, central banks were looking at the technology mostly because they wanted to understand what private banks were talking about.Now, he says, the central banks are embracing the technology to revamp their own infrastructures.At the headquarters of the Netherlands\u2019 central bank in Amsterdam, Ron Berndsen set up five laptops to run an experimental virtual currency, derived from the Bitcoin software. The coins issued in the system were nicknamed Dukatons, after a 17th-century silver coin used in the time when the Netherlands was a part of the Spanish Empire.Mr. Berndsen operated the Dukaton system for three months to see what would happen if the central bank were setting the rules and did not have the same limits as Bitcoin. While the experiment was a success, he is now thinking much bigger and is in constant conversation with other central bank officials who are looking at ways to put their own currencies on distributed ledgers.\u201cThere are so many things going on that it is hard to keep track of all the contacts,\u201d said Mr. Berndsen, the head of market infrastructure at the Dutch central bank. \u201cI hear from other central bank colleagues that it is the same everywhere.\u201dThe experimentation so far has taken on many different forms and contemplated many different roles for distributed ledgers to play in the financial system.The Bank of Canada teamed up with the nation\u2019s five largest banks \u2014 and the blockchain consulting firm R3 \u2014 for what was known as Project Jasper. In a simulation run this summer, the central bank issued so-called CAD-Coins onto a blockchain similar to the one that underlies the Bitcoin alternative known as Ethereum.The banks used the CAD-Coins to exchange money \u2014 in this case fictional money \u2014 the way they do at the end of each day to settle their master accounts.Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said in an interview that while the experiment was a success, a great deal of testing is still necessary before the bank can decide whether distributed ledger technology is ready for the real world.Critics of blockchain technology have noted the apparent contradiction in central banks\u2019 looking to distributed ledgers.The blockchain was created to allow Bitcoin transactions to be recorded communally so that a central authority, such as a central bank, would not be necessary. If a central bank is involved and keeping track, why go to the trouble of keeping records communally?The distributed ledgers being discussed by central bankers also generally lack the openness that has been one of the most attractive attributes of the Bitcoin network.With Bitcoin, anyone can join the network and help support it, which has helped it win a following. The distributed ledgers being considered by the financial industry and central banks would generally allow only a small number of registered entities to join in and take part in the network.Ms. Wilkins said the Bank of Canada was interested in the technology as a way to build a single, shared record of all the transactions among several institutions. That could leave much less money sitting idle while banks reconcile their different ledgers, as now happens.\u201cThere is currently a whole industry set up to reconcile and audit all these separate ledgers, and you can\u2019t easily connect them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis comprehensive shared data source could be a real benefit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Orchestras in the U.S., So Much Depends on Their Communities\u2019 Fortunes", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byBut three strikes should not be taken to mean that classical music is out.\u201cI think orchestras are fundamentally local businesses,\u201d said Thomas W. Morris, who has led both the Cleveland Orchestra and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Morris added that while the unions representing musicians tend to look at what their peers are paid at comparable orchestras across the country, management typically focuses on what it thinks the local area can support.(The cost of living is significantly higher in Boston and San Francisco than in Philadelphia.)The strike action is likely to direct renewed attention to the orchestra\u2019s decision to seek bankruptcy protection in 2011. In an email she sent to supporters of the orchestra, Allison Vulgamore, the ensemble\u2019s president and chief executive, said, \u201cThe talents of our great musicians must be recognized while also balancing the need for the kind of careful financial stewardship that will keep the Philadelphia Orchestra strong and viable for years to come.\u201dThe financial challenge has grown as orchestras that could once count on support from business leaders and industrialists \u2014 when the Pittsburgh Symphony was founded at the turn of the last century, Pittsburgh was a booming steel town, and Andrew Carnegie helped support the ensemble \u2014 now must struggle to raise money in a very different kind of economy.\u201cIt used to be understood that there was a group of good community citizens, usually associated with the big companies in town who had deep ties to the community and a sense of civic responsibility,\u201d Mr. Morris said. \u201cNow companies are changing, they\u2019re owned by holding companies, their headquarters are elsewhere, and CEOs move around.\u201dPittsburgh\u2019s musicians went on strike after rejecting a management proposal that they said would cut their pay by 15 percent in the first year, freeze their pensions and reduce the orchestra\u2019s size. The chairman of its board, Devin McGranahan, said in a statement that its deficit and debt had put it on track to \u201crun out of cash and have to close the doors\u201d by spring.Still, real tests remain. The old subscription model that orchestras relied on to fill seats is on the decline as audiences now prefer to make last-minute decisions about their leisure time. Some orchestras are struggling with attendance. Cincinnati is renovating its Music Hall, and plans to reduce its capacity by roughly 1,000 seats from the 3,417 it once held.But even in shaky economic times the unions representing orchestra musicians hold power because without players, the show cannot go on: Their product, live performance, cannot be outsourced. That has made it difficult for orchestras to curb costs.Robert J. Flanagan, an emeritus professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who wrote the 2012 book \u201cThe Perilous Life of Symphony Orchestras,\u201d said that the recent labor unrest showed that the challenges facing many orchestras had not disappeared with the end of the Great Recession.\u201cFrom the point of view of the musicians, they\u2019ve spent a long time developing their skills, so they tend to look at what people with similar skills are being paid at other orchestras,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cOn the management side, they\u2019re basically stuck with what the community they\u2019re located in is willing to pay. And those two perspectives have very little to do with each other.\u201dA news analysis article in some editions on Sunday about strikes by three orchestras misstated, in some editions, the name of another orchestra that recently went through a 16-month lockout.

{"Headline": "Is Leftist Era Fading in Latin America? Ask Colombia and Brazil", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 It was not a banner day for Latin America\u2019s leftists.\u201cPut simply, conservatives are on the rise in Latin America,\u201d said Mat\u00edas Spektor, a professor of international relations at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a university in Brazil.Many factors are feeding the trend. The sharp drop in commodities prices has eroded economic growth around Latin America and the support leftist governments once drew from it. The clout of evangelical Christian megachurches is expanding, and they are confronting socially liberal policies and channeling widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo.Still, political analysts caution that the trend does not necessarily involve a wholesale rejection of the policies that won admiration and votes for leftist governments in previous years. For instance, Michel Temer and Mauricio Macri, the leaders of Brazil and Argentina, have expressed support for maintaining popular antipoverty programs.Peru\u2019s new president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, relied on an alliance with the left to defeat his rival, Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of Alberto Fujimori, the imprisoned former president.Likewise, Colombia\u2019s vote on the peace deal offered an example of how unpredictable politics is getting in some parts of Latin America. Leaders around the region \u2014 from an array of ideological backgrounds \u2014 had supported the agreement, which was forged between President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC.Colombians rebuffed the deal largely because they thought it was too lenient on the FARC, enabling most fighters to walk away scot-free. But the result also showed how ready voters were to reject what the political establishment was offering.\u201cVoters defying the status quo is hardly peculiar to Colombia,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. \u201cIt fits a pattern that can be discerned in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and other countries.\u201dIn Brazil, a country of 206 million, half of South America\u2019s population, the shift to the right has unfolded against a backdrop of rising political divisiveness.Supporters of the impeached president, Dilma Rousseff, argue that her ouster was the equivalent of a coup, a view that has weighed on the legitimacy of Mr. Temer, her former vice president who rebelled against her. Candidates from his centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party were also roundly defeated in Sunday\u2019s mayoral elections in Brazil\u2019s largest cities.But the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which had its origins in the opposition to the country\u2019s military dictatorship before evolving into a more conservative grouping that now anchors Mr. Temer\u2019s coalition, scored big gains. One of the party\u2019s members, Jo\u00e3o Doria, a former host of a reality television show that involved firing participants on the air, glided to victory in the mayoral race in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city.Some in the region see parallels with the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in which Britain elected to leave the European Union, or the chance that Donald J. Trump, who also starred in a reality game show in which he fired contestants, will win the presidential election in the United States.Colombia, for its part, has long defied easy explanations of its politics. A top ally of Washington in Latin America, the country has traditionally been more politically conservative than some of its neighbors, even as nominally leftist guerrillas persisted for decades in its jungles.The rightward shift has stalled in some parts of the region. While the opposition won control of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly earlier this year, the country\u2019s leftist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has managed to delay a referendum to remove him from office despite the collapsing economy.\u201cWe are facing a historical turning point in the region; some are talking about a throwback,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Linera said, comparing the current situation to previous periods of conservative resurgence in Latin America. \u201cWe must relearn what we learned in the \u201980s and \u201990s, when everything was against us.\u201dAs leaders on the left pick up the pieces in parts of Latin America, their dilemma now resembles that of the conservative politicians they long struggled to dislodge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Sea Fields Flag, Denting Prospects for Scottish Independence", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionsThe Transocean Winner, a rig filled with more than 300 tons of diesel and weighing 18,740 tons, broke away in an August storm to drift onto the rocks on the Isle of Lewis, in far western Scotland.The huge semisubmersible oil rig detached in rough seas from a tug trying to bring it to Malta, and amid worries about pollution, it looked massive and forlorn as salvage crews tried to free it, and refloat it.But the Transocean Winner, both in its plight and in its journey away from the North Sea, is a symbol of Scotland\u2019s growing problem. At the same time as North Sea production slips and oil and gas become harder and more expensive to extract, the price of energy has fallen sharply.Cheap oil prices are making it uneconomical to produce oil and gas from the North Sea, so investment is postponed or canceled and rigs are shutting down or being transported elsewhere. And the drop in production from the mature field has meant a steep drop in tax revenues for Scotland, which in turn has put a big question mark over the prospects of Scottish independence from the United Kingdom.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of Scotland, the leader of the ruling Scottish National Party, is committed to independence, and after Britain voted in June to leave the European Union, while Scotland voted heavily to remain, she said a second independence referendum was \u201chighly likely.\u201dBut in fact it seems far away. Ms. Sturgeon cannot afford to lose a second referendum, and although Scots feel adrift from a Conservative-ruled Britain, the economic situation has deteriorated badly. And that is largely because of the collapse in the price of oil, which has not only reduced revenues, but made new exploration simply too costly.The September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence was a raucous and emotional affair, but one of the central questions was whether an independent Scotland would thrive economically or become poorer than now. And the key element to that debate was competing analyses of the future of North Sea oil \u2014 how much revenue it would yield and how far into the future, given that the North Sea is a mature field and production was slowing.Scots voted against independence by 55 percent to 45 percent, driven largely by doubts on the country\u2019s economic future, not just on oil revenues, but on what kind of currency Scotland would have and whether it could join the European Union smoothly or from a standing start.The turnout was 84.6 percent, the highest ever for an election or referendum in the United Kingdom, underlining how important the vote felt to Scots. The turnout for last June\u2019s British referendum on membership in the European Union, by contrast, was 72 percent.In fact, production from North Sea oil and gas peaked in 1999 at 4.55 million barrels of oil equivalent a day; today, that number is 1.64 million, said Alexander Kemp, professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen. And revenue has gone down sharply every year since 2011.The trade group Oil & Gas UK figures that the industry will lose 120,000 jobs by the end of this year. Passenger numbers at Aberdeen airport, a base for the North Sea oil industry, have dropped 20 percent over the last 18 months, and helicopter traffic from the airport to rigs has dropped a quarter in the last year. Aberdeen, once considered Britain\u2019s Klondike, is suffering.Analysts at S&P Global Platts said that investor anxiety would add to the \u201cexisting gloomy prognosis\u201d for the North Sea. \u201cUncertainty alone could lead to years of delay for new development projects and put more weight behind any planned closures.\u201dWith little new investment, they warned, \u201cfields may close down sooner, and the cost of running and maintaining pipelines and other infrastructure is spread over fewer remaining barrels.\u201dIn other words, extracting oil from the turbulent North Sea is becoming less and less cost-effective \u2014 fine when oil was at $100 a barrel, difficult at $60, disastrous at $44.Budgets for decommissioning oil rigs are estimated to triple over the next two years, because some 30 percent of North Sea rigs now operating are doing so at a loss, and wells are being capped on the seafloor.The 2014 independence referendum put a number of freighted questions to Scots: What kind of country would an independent Scotland be, with what relationship to Britain and to the European Union, and with what resources to finance a country that sees itself as a Nordic-style social democracy and spends far more than it takes in?Figures from the same official agency, issued in August, were far worse. For fiscal 2015-16, Scotland\u2019s public spending deficit was \u00a314.8 billion amid plummeting oil prices. That deficit, 9.5 percent of gross domestic product, was more than double the percentage debt of Britain as a whole and more than three times the level the European Union requires of new member states.Revised figures for the fiscal year 2014-15 showed Scotland\u2019s deficit at \u00a314.3 billion, or , 9.1 percent of G.D.P.The latest government report also estimated that Scotland\u2019s share of North Sea revenues fell about 97 percent in 2015-16 year to just \u00a360 million from \u00a31.8 billion in 2014-15.\u201cThat\u2019s a tiny figure,\u201d said Professor Kemp. With the drop in the price of oil, lower British taxes, accumulated tax credits from major investments since 2009 and now tax credits from decommissioning, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have a very low tax take for several years at least, even if the oil price comes back.\u201dScotland\u2019s onshore revenues grew by \u00a31.9 billion, but overall, Scotland\u2019s revenue was estimated at \u00a310,000 a person, about \u00a3400 a person lower than for Britain as a whole. And its government expenditure, at \u00a312,800 a person, was \u00a31,200 greater than the British average.In response, Ms. Sturgeon recognized the challenge. \u201cThe lower oil price has, of course, reduced offshore revenues, with a corresponding impact on our fiscal position,\u201d she said. \u201cThis underlines the fact that Scotland\u2019s challenge is to continue to grow our onshore economy.\u201dShe insisted that the \u201cfoundations of the Scottish economy remain strong\u201d and tried to swing attention to the damage a British exit from the European Union and its single market would do to Scotland. \u201cScotland\u2019s long-term economic success is now being directly threatened by the likely impact of Brexit,\u201d she said.She is not wrong that Brexit, presuming that it actually happens in a couple of years, would do economic damage to Scotland if it remained a part of Britain.But whether Scots would vote for a poorer independence, with a hard border between itself and the rest of Britain, is far less clear. Scotland\u2019s economic ties \u2014 and dependency \u2014 on Britain were emphasized after the so-called Brexit vote by former prime minister Gordon Brown, a Scot who does not favor independence and did not favor Brexit.The British government\u2019s secretary for Scotland, David Mundell, said recent figures demonstrated \u201chow being part of the U.K. protects living standards in Scotland.\u201d Scotland has \u201cweathered a dramatic slump in oil prices last year because we are part of a United Kingdom that has at its heart a system for pooling and sharing resources.\u201dThe North Sea oil industry \u201cis in long-term decline,\u201d Professor Kemp said. While some oil will continue to be produced until at least 2050, \u201cit\u2019s a question of how gently or brutally this decline takes place. Reserves are still substantial \u2014 it\u2019s whether they can be produced economically.\u201dOil prices ebb and flow, of course, and Scotland is trying to invest in alternative sources like wind and tidal power. But the amazing windfall that the North Sea provided for the last 50 years is coming to an end. And investment forgone in an aging field is unlikely to be replaced.A recent study of the North Sea industry by PwC, the audit and consulting firm, concluded that the North Sea had a future, if carefully managed over the next two years, but that there was risk of \u201ca rapid and premature decline\u201d if government and industry did not \u201ccreate one last cycle of success that will retain and generate jobs, stimulate growth and ensure security of energy supply.\u201dScottish independence may depend on it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Newly Released Hillary Clinton Emails Offer Glimpse at Husband\u2019s Advice", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The State Department on Friday began releasing thousands of emails the F.B.I. collected as part of its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state, but many were duplicates or near duplicates of messages already made public.The emails released on Friday suggested that materials from the investigation might not add significant new information to an issue that has dogged Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign for a year and a half. They nonetheless revealed still more details about her tenure as secretary and the advice she received from those closest to her, including her husband, former President Bill Clinton.One email offered a rare glimpse into the strategizing between the two Clintons on matters of foreign policy. In a message dictated to an aide, Mr. Clinton offers his recommendations for negotiating with China, India and other poor countries in the days leading to the Copenhagen conference on climate change in December 2009.\u201cI recommend that you begin by saying that this challenge is an opportunity if we approach it the right and way,\u201d the note read, including an unnecessary word, \u201cand provide the right financing options so that the old energy economy no longer has an advantage over new ways of providing and consuming energy.\u201dThe State Department released only 75 new emails on Friday, including some that were merely brief replies to emails that had been previously turned over by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyers and made public under the Freedom of Information Act.Under a new court order, the department is scheduled to continue releasing batches of emails before the election on Nov. 8. That has raised hopes among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s critics that new disclosures could still damage her prospects. At a minimum, the staggered releases will keep a focus on her use of the server, which she has repeatedly acknowledged was a mistake.Mr. Comey has since faced intense criticism from Republicans over his handling of the investigation, including decisions to give immunity to some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides in exchange for testimony.\u201cFolks, this is a very sad time, I\u2019m telling you, for justice in this country,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, said at a recent rally, where he ridiculed the investigation.In reaction to the criticism, the F.B.I. took the unusual step of turning over to the State Department and Congress reams of materials related to its investigation, including 14,900 emails. More than 9,000 of those were deemed personal, however, and will not be made public. That leaves roughly 5,600 more, many of which will not become public until well after Election Day.It appeared that many of the emails the F.B.I. uncovered came from other accounts at the State Department or from fragments of the computer servers and phones Mrs. Clinton used.Five of the emails released on Friday included replies or forwards to emails that contained information later upgraded to classified. One included a note from Mrs. Clinton to her aide Huma Abedin in response to a long discussion on Honduras in 2009. \u201cAll of this did not print last night,\u201d she wrote. The original message, from Jake Sullivan, a senior policy adviser both then and now, was previously released by the State Department with sections blocked on the grounds they were classified confidential.Mrs. Clinton was usually the recipient of the emails, not the sender. But in one email she expressed to a confidante what she said was her deep personal pain over the death and destruction caused by a 2010 earthquake in Haiti.\u201cWe have much to do, my friend, and I\u2019m sending strength and blessings to you and the Haitian people,\u201d she wrote to Dr. Paul Farmer, co-founder of a group called Partners in Health, as he was preparing to go to Haiti to help with the relief effort, in which the Clinton Foundation played an important role.\u201cIf we\u2019re falling short in our efforts, pls yell. Love, Hillary,\u201d she wrote.In a separate email released last year by the State Department, Chelsea Clinton warned her parents that the relief efforts were indeed falling short.The message with advice from Mr. Clinton, who has said he rarely used email, was sent through intermediaries. \u201cI\u2019ve had a busy day and too little time to study all the articles enough to give much good advice,\u201d stated his note, dictated to an aide, Jason Cooper. \u201cCall me anytime to talk,\u201d he said, and forwarded two articles he wrote on climate change. It was signed simply \u201cBill.\u201dAnother email came from Mark J. Penn, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former pollster, analyzing President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in 2010 (\u201cpretty good speech \u2014 but he seemed angry\u201d) while praising one of hers by contrast.He offered a predication that proved false: \u201cOnly way for him to win second term is to ask you to be VP,\u201d Mr. Penn wrote.Advertisement"}

In a four-way race, 49 percent supported her; 21 percent supported Mr. Trump; 14 percent supported Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee; and 5 percent supported Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate.The results show that Mrs. Clinton will have to convince many young people that they should trust her to grapple with some of the nation\u2019s biggest issues.\u201cThe combination of her performing better than expectations during the debates with Donald Trump, and Gary Johnson disappointing voters, has left her in a position where she has increased the number of people who view her favorably,\u201d Mr. Della Volpe said. \u201cBut she still has progress to make if she\u2019s going to unite the most progressive wing of the party, moderates and even Republicans.\u201dSigns of that challenge can be seen in the number of young voters concerned that she may not be able to improve crucial parts of society. Just 47 percent of the young Americans Harvard surveyed said they trusted her more than Mr. Trump to improve the economy, and 46 percent said they trusted her more to combat the spread of terrorism. Only 42 percent trust her more than her opponent to reduce the impact of money in politics, as she continues to push back against the perception that she is too closely tied to Wall Street.Still, 56 percent of young people said they preferred her when it came to addressing inequality, while 51 percent said they trusted her more to unite the country. Half said they thought she could deal with immigration issues, which she has promised to focus on, better than Mr. Trump could.Mr. Trump is underperforming among young Republican likely voters by 17 percent, compared with Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, who earned 91 percent of their support that year, according to exit polls.

{"Headline": "Can Humans Go From Unintended Global Warming to Climate By Design?", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "In pondering the plausibility or desirability of such a tool, it might be useful to start with a thought experiment:So far, humanity\u2019s main climate intervention, through emissions of vast amounts of greenhouse gases, has been an unintended consequence of pursuing the most convenient energy choice \u2014 fossil fuels.With all of this in mind, it could be argued that the momentum driving global warming is simply speeding the journey toward an inevitable juncture when we\u00c2\u00a0will start\u00c2\u00a0engineering the climate.Welcome to the geoengineering\u00c2\u00a0debate.I have long supported investing in research on this possible response to global warming but questioned its real-world prospects. I still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine a scenario in which a single actor would initiate some sun-blocking initiative or, in contrast, a global consensus could be reached on its deployment (unless things get truly unhinged on the up side).Here\u2019s the tweet that started this discussion back in February:.@Revkin talks very long run with Pierrehumbert: https://t.co/5zPnQFijEd Does geoengineering change that picture? https://t.co/QBZgzGu6qKHere\u2019s the first part of Morton\u2019s provocation and a link to the rest:I agree with the authors that taking a view measured in millennia is an appropriate, and underappreciated, part of assessing the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and the need for climate action; I also agree with their conclusion (and starting point) that a zero-net-emissions human world is a desirable target. And it is inspiring to see such progress being made in the detail with which models of ice sheet dynamics and other forms of change can be applied to the moderately far future.But I have a problem with the way in which, while discussing some plausible\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aif far from inevitable\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aforms of technological change, the authors choose to ignore others. They repeatedly describe change on the timescales they are looking at as \u00e2\u0080\u009cirreversible\u00e2\u0080\u009d. There is a potent sense in which this is true: once a change has happened it cannot be made not to have happened; once they have risen, neither carbon-dioxide concentrations nor sea levels can be made not to have risen. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what most people mean by \u00e2\u0080\u009cirreversible\u00e2\u0080\u009d: the term normally means pretty straightforwardly \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reversed\u00e2\u0080\u009d. And at a couple of points in their paper the authors make it clear that that is indeed the sense in which they mean it.Specifically, they say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe implication is that, in the absence of efficient, large-scale capture and storage of airborne carbon (emphasis mine), carbon emissions that have already occurred or will occur in the near future result in a commitment to climate change that will be irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia and longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Which is to say: in the absence of technologies to reverse this, it is irreversible.Well yes. And in the absence of a reverse gear, a car is irreversible, too. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why cars have reverse gears.That may read as a flippant trivialization. But I think the authors of the Nature Climate Change paper trivialize the issue, too; they just do it more subtly, through neglect. The sentence I just quoted implies pretty strongly that, in the presence of efficient (or for that matter inefficient) large-scale capture and storage of airborne carbon, carbon emissions that have already occurred or will occur in the near future might not result in a commitment to climate change that is irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia and longer. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite an important statement. But it receives almost no follow-up at all in the subsequent six pages. A paper that makes use of the concept of the Anthropocene\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008aa concept predicated on the idea that human activity is a dominant factor in the state of the earth system\u00e2\u0080\u008a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u008adoes not spend any time at all looking at what humans might try to do, or be able to do, about the problems it discusses over the periods it imagines.I know that there are not yet any negative emissions technologies up to the task. But the possibility of such things is under active discussion. Indeed negative emissions are already being incorporated into the sort of integrated assessment models that inform discussion like those of COP 21 in Paris. Those scenarios typically demonstrate a lack of specificity about the costs and potentially enormous impacts of such technologies, which makes their ready and convenient acceptance of a currently hypothetical capability disturbing. But to ignore the potential capability completely does not redress that problem.\u00a0FollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Streets of Laredo: How 2 American Teenagers Became Assassins", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In 2005, two Mexican drug trafficking organizations were fighting for control over the sister cities of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Laredo, Tex., the linchpin for one of the most lucrative smuggling routes in the Americas. On the Mexican side of the border, the conflict took on all the trappings of war, as men dressed in black tactical outfits with assault rifles and grenades went house to house rooting out members of the opposition, torturing and executing them, or else engaged in gun battles in the streets of Nuevo Laredo. From 2006 to 2012, as the battles between warring cartels and between cartels and the Mexican Army spread across the country, more than 150,000 people were killed or went missing.On the Texas side of the border, life went on largely unchanged, despite the proximity to the chaos across the Rio Grande. Yet of all the headlines generated by the conflict, perhaps the most sensational was the story of a pair of American teenagers from Laredo who were recruited and trained by one of the warring factions, known as the Zetas, to work as paid assassins. Between them, the two boys, Gabriel Cardona and Rosalio Reta, apparently killed dozens of the Zetas\u2019 opponents on the Mexican side. Taking advantage of the boys\u2019 citizenship and familiarity with Laredo, Zeta commanders also sent them across the border with a list of enemies to kill on the Texas side, a brazen move that set their story apart from that of the average young soldier in the cartel wars. Both young men wound up in Texas prisons with very long sentences, but not before they had managed to eliminate several of their targets on American soil. \u201cI like what I do,\u201d Reta told police after he was arrested in 2006. \u201cI don\u2019t deny it.\u201dIt\u2019s a hell of a story, one deserving of the former Wall Street Journal reporter Dan Slater\u2019s book-length treatment, which is based largely on a yearslong exchange of letters with Cardona, along with interviews with the diligent Laredo detective who orchestrated his capture. Both Cardona and Reta, known as Bart (for his resemblance to the \u201cSimpsons\u201d character), have given numerous interviews in the decade or so since they were incarcerated, and Slater\u2019s reporting covers territory that has been well mined by other reporters. This wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a problem, if the book were especially well written or offered an original take on the story. But Slater, whose previous book was about the internet dating business, is an uneven narrator. Cardona, we read, \u201cdreamed of something glorious to fill the blah of life\u201d; quitting the high school football team was \u201ca decision in which loads of portent would later be vested.\u201d A digression into the history of Prohibition in America \u2014 which might have provided some useful historical context \u2014 ends, curiously, in 1831, with government agents chasing Indian bootleggers on the Missouri River. Here and there the prose makes an ill-advised turn toward the hard-boiled \u2014 sex between Cardona and his girlfriend lasted \u201ctill their nerves rang numb,\u201d while cartel parties featured women with breasts \u201cspilling out of tight leather jackets\u201d \u2014 complete with jarring bits of profanity in the author\u2019s own voice.Some of the book\u2019s scenes are undeniably gripping. Detectives surveil Cardona and his companions as they are about to make a hit on the driver of a blue Hummer outside a Laredo nightclub, who, in a case of mistaken identity, turns out to be not a rival but a local dentist. (This scene, among others, owes a considerable debt to a 2009 account by Luke Dittrich in Esquire.) Slater\u2019s take on the political economy of our own \u201cdrug war\u201d \u2014 a metaphor that seems less useful than ever considering the literal warfare going on across the Rio Grande \u2014 is sophisticated in places. Veteran reporters of the border beat will find themselves nodding as Slater describes a Laredo principal observing that his school \u201cfostered two groups: those who would go into the drug business, and those who would chase them.\u201d Sadly, they will also be shaking their heads to read Slater\u2019s odd account of snorting cocaine with one of his sources; not to mention his somewhat too pithy description of Laredo, a city founded two decades before the American colonies declared independence, as \u201ca giant, unimproved truck stop.\u201dCrime rates in American border communities have remained low throughout the crisis in Mexico, and Slater, to his credit, does not overplay the \u201cspillover violence\u201d meme, a concept that surfaced around 2009 and was promulgated chiefly as a Republican talking point meant to hammer President Obama for his party\u2019s alleged weakness on the issue of border security in advance of the 2010 midterm elections. Yet Slater\u2019s book, landing as it does in the midst of an election season in which immigrants are once again being demonized, seems destined to further muddy the waters. His decision to call Cardona and Reta \u201cwolf boys,\u201d a label hatched (as a footnote informs us) from a combination of cartel slang and the author\u2019s own imagination, surely doesn\u2019t help, conjuring as it does unfortunate echoes of the 1990s scare about so-called superpredator teenagers running rampant in the streets of American cities.Cardona\u2019s tale is really a story about poverty. Slater knows this, and his correspondence with the boy killer offers some poignant insights on his upbringing in El Azteca, one of Laredo\u2019s hardscrabble barrios. But the best moments are mostly in the epilogue, in which we encounter a much more reflective Cardona as an inmate approaching the age of 30, with decades left to serve. Readers hoping to understand why he did what he did when he was a teenage agent of mayhem on both sides of the river \u2014 the only question really worth asking \u2014 will be left unsatisfied.Nate Blakeslee, the author of \u201cTulia: Race, Cocaine, and Corruption in a Small Texas Town,\u201d is working on a book about the battle over wolves in the American West.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: Mercedes C300 Coupe Subtracts Doors, Adds Passion", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byDrivenTHE automotive business is just that \u2014 a business. Carmakers might be making transportation devices, but at the end it\u2019s all about profits. At the moment, S.U.V.s and crossovers are the best bet for black ink.Still, the car business needs a certain amount of passion. And few vehicles are more emotional than a two-door coupe. They ooze a sort of wild abandon. The lack of rear doors, the crouched entry to the invariable cramped back seat, it says something about the owners. Maybe they have embraced the reality that they seldom carry more than one passenger. Maybe they\u2019re just impractical. Or hedonistic.All of which makes it easy to understand why Mercedes-Benz C300 Coupe buyers would skip the sedan version, if only for the feel of leaving adult responsibility in the slow lane. Then, too, one need not squint much to see contours of the S-Class Coupe in the C\u2019s lines.Starting at just under $44,000, the C300 is a design bargain, though undoubtedly, most will add some luxury kit.My test car had the Premium 2 Package with a powerful Burmester audio that costs around $5,000. Add the $1,675 Sport Package with body trim and AMG floor mats and the total settled in at $59,165. That a rearview camera is a $460 extra seems rather penny-pinching for a luxury brand. But this is a business, after all.Coupes have sporty reputations, and the C300, with its suspension lowered by about a half-inch compared with the sedan, skews that way. At $1,190, the Airmatic adjustable suspension is a no-brainer, allowing either frisky or \u2014 after a tough day at the office \u2014 relaxed dynamics.A note to Speed Racer: The 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder serving up 241 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque makes the C300 sporty-ish. But drivers desiring serious O.M.G. should move up to the AMG variants. The C43, starting at $56,425, has 50 percent more horsepower. The C63, with a base of $67,925, nearly doubles the C300. (Oh, the C400 is no more.)For the C300, choose between rear-wheel drive or the 4Matic all-wheel drive that I tested. The transmission is a 7-speed automatic with steering wheel paddles. (Sorry, clutch lovers). Throttle response, transmission mapping and steering heft can be dialed to your liking.It takes about 6 seconds to go 0 to 60 miles an hour. Those sprints do not feel that fast; maybe it\u2019s the refinement. The cabin is quiet, with the silky engine exuding little emotion from the exhaust note.The C300 slices through corners without drama, with moderate feel coming through the steering wheel. The E.P.A\u2019s all-wheel-drive fuel economy numbers are 23 city and 29 highway on premium fuel. Driving harder than most might, my yield was a couple of notches below that.An automatic engine start-stop feature switches it off seamlessly at stoplights. Restart is noticeable. If that bothers you, the function can be turned off.Stuffed with wood and purposeful aluminum garnish, the interior is a space worth lingering in. It\u2019s my vote for cabin all-star. Seats are well bolstered for a wide variety of occupants, and the optional head-up display is appreciated.I\u2019m not a fan of the transmission stalk operation. But if I owned the car, I suppose I\u2019d eventually stop confusing it with the wiper controls.The Comand \u2014 short for Cockpit Management and Data system \u2014 user interface can be operated with a jog wheel or a touch pad. Like the transmission stalk, it occasionally vexes me. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are not available.That back seat? The front seats will motor ahead once the seat back is tilted forward, making access as genteel as possible. The space is more generous than a Cadillac ATS coupe, but less livable than a BMW 4 Series. Adults under 5\u20199\u201d should find it tolerable for short trips. There are belts and cup holders for two back there, but, oddly, no seat back pockets for organization.Mercedes has plenty of S.U.V.s for those needing cargo capacity. At least this coupe gets 40/20/40 folding seats and enough trunk room for four carry-on suitcases.The C300\u2019s clean, elegant lines might cause a few sedan shoppers to take the more emotional route. The pricier AMG models will attract enthusiasts and gratify Mercedes accountants. Everyone\u2019s happy.Only those climbing into the back might grouse. Advertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s problem.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything more than basically what has been in the newspaper, because it was basically a New Jersey issue,\u201d Mr. Cuomo told an interviewer in December 2013, as though his curiosity stopped at the state line. His comment came three months after aides to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey closed two of the three access lanes to the bridge in Fort Lee, N.J., apparently to punish a mayor who had declined to endorse Mr. Christie.Yet as two scandals have lapped at Mr. Cuomo\u2019s feet, the governor has plowed ahead, meeting little resistance along the way.\u201cNone of this appears to have had an impact on voters\u2019 view of the governor,\u201d Steve Greenberg, a pollster for Siena College, said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a presidential election. It\u2019s all kinds of craziness going on, and that\u2019s what voters are most focused on.\u201dAfter one witness testified to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s involvement in the bridge scandal, the chairman of the state Republican Party, Edward F. Cox, said in a statement the trial had revealed that \u201che sacrificed the commuters of his state and participated in a cover-up to serve his own political interests.\u201dBy last week, the state Republicans had released an online ad, titled \u201cCuomo\u2019s Web of Corruption,\u201d tying him to both scandals.The Republicans have been among the few to voice the suspicion that Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie each saw an upside in cooling the furor surrounding the bridge scandal.\u201cIt was just so painfully obvious,\u201d Jessica A. Proud, a Republican strategist and spokeswoman for Mr. Cox, said. \u201cIt was like, finally the truth comes out,\u201d she said of the bridge trial.The governor\u2019s aides have treated Republican attacks with scorn. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeble attempt by Ed Cox and his cronies to distract from their corruption issues and uncomfortable questions about their support for Donald Trump,\u201d a spokesman, Richard Azzopardi, said on Sunday.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s appointees to the Port Authority first got involved when Patrick J. Foye, the Cuomo appointee who served as the agency\u2019s executive director, found out about the lane closings and ordered them reopened, calling them \u201chasty and ill advised.\u201dIn October, a month after the lanes were closed, an email from Scott Rechler, a Cuomo ally who served as the authority\u2019s vice chairman, suggested that the governor was monitoring what Mr. Foye would say about the lane closings at a Port Authority public board meeting.\u201cGov just called, but I figured I will call him after the meeting in case Pat does anything different,\u201d Mr. Rechler wrote to an aide.Mr. Rechler and two other witnesses have testified that as the scandal grew, the two governors spoke by phone to discuss the lane closings, and that Mr. Christie complained to Mr. Cuomo that Mr. Foye\u2019s interference was inflaming the situation.Another witness, David Wildstein, a former Christie ally who has pleaded guilty to ordering the lane closings while at the Port Authority, testified that other Christie appointees had told him that the governors agreed to have the Port Authority issue a report claiming that the lane closings had been part of a \u201ctraffic study.\u201dHe also said he believed that at Mr. Christie\u2019s behest, Mr. Cuomo had told Mr. Foye to stay quiet until after Mr. Christie had safely won re-election. (Mr. Wildstein\u2019s involvement in the scandal did not become public until the day after Mr. Christie was re-elected.)Under questioning from prosecutors, Mr. Wildstein acknowledged he did not have direct knowledge of the conversation, leading Mr. Cuomo\u2019s aides to dismiss his testimony as \u201cfalse, thirdhand gossip.\u201dMr. Cuomo took the same tack, telling reporters the next day, \u201cWe have the advantage of knowing it is factually not true, because Pat Foye did not stand down.\u201dNo traffic study report appeared. Mr. Foye has said through a lawyer that he was never asked to conceal or ignore the matter. Mr. Rechler testified that Mr. Cuomo never told him how to handle Trenton\u2019s complaints about Mr. Foye.Events in the scandal that has settled around Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey regarding the motives behind the shutdown of some traffic lanes to the George Washington Bridge.After The Wall Street Journal reported on Dec. 12 about a conversation between the two governors, both men quickly denied that they had discussed Mr. Foye.Asked a few days later whether he believed the claim that the closings were part of a traffic study, Mr. Cuomo said, \u201cI\u2019m sure it is as Governor Christie says it is.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s aides have moved swiftly to counter the narrative that has emerged from news reports and from the trial, with each successive denial more narrowly tailored than the last.After Mr. Rechler testified that the two governors had discussed Mr. Foye\u2019s interference, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo denied that there had been a plan to cover up the scandal, but acknowledged that the men had discussed the bridge \u2014 a well-known fact, he said.As Mr. Christie\u2019s reputation was repeatedly flayed in federal court this month, Mr. Cuomo declined to pile on.\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to tell him what to do,\u201d he said at the Columbus Day parade on Oct. 10, after reporters asked him if Mr. Christie should abandon Mr. Trump, for whom he has served as a prominent surrogate. \u201cI leave New Jersey to him and his politics to him, and he leaves New York to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That Feeds Him", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorHe has built, at great expense, a narrow-gauge railway between two villages that figured in his childhood and where his family now owns homes. Soccer-obsessed, he also built a large sports stadium near his weekend house. He manipulates news coverage in many ways, including letting cronies snatch control of national media outlets that fell on bad times. When he created a government program to encourage land acquisition to assist farmers, one conspicuous beneficiary was his wife.For the past six years, Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, has vacuumed up his country\u2019s assets, putting them either in his pocket or the pockets of people close to him. This is no secret. His kleptocracy has been well studied. But there is a tendency to view it merely as sad and remote, a familiar story of yet another autocrat in a country struggling with a transition to democracy.The truth is darker. Mr. Orban is hollowing out his country\u2019s fragile institutions and challenging core precepts of the European Union \u2014 with the acquiescence of the European Union itself, and the passive enabling of the United States. Though he claims to speak for the common masses of Hungary, as opposed to its elites, just last weekend he failed to rouse enough voters to take part in a referendum that would have renounced European Union immigration policies. He claimed victory because 98.2 percent of those who voted were with him, but the rest of Europe breathed relief that the low turnout had nullified the referendum\u2019s validity.In fact, without the European Union, his administration would be in deep trouble. The union cofinances a large share of all public investments; inside the union, many of those investments have come under suspicion of being corruptly handled.Nevertheless, European politicians cite three arguments \u2014 all debatable \u2014 to justify their leniency: 1) By staying \u201cinvolved\u201d with Hungary, the European Union can influence things for the better. 2) Average Hungarians would be the first economic victims of a withdrawal of support. 3) Taking a hard line with Mr. Orban might prompt him to lead Hungary out of the 28-nation bloc into the embrace of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, starting a trend that could pull along Poland and other neighbors.This European Union policy of permissiveness can only encourage the worst tendencies in Mr. Orban and those like him \u2014 emulating Mr. Putin and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. They, too, offer autocracy hiding behind a democratic facade, laying claim ever more unconvincingly to democratic practices like majority rule and the appearance of independent institutions of governance. Current efforts by Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice Party to hamstring the media, limit civil liberties and attack judicial independence already read like an opening page in Mr. Orban\u2019s playbook.By not taking Mr. Orban seriously, the West is failing not only the people of Hungary but the broader cause of decent governance at a time of populist discontent around the world. Mr. Orban has the support of many of his own people because, like Mr. Putin, he taps into a fantasy of lost glory and presents himself as the defender of Europe\u2019s Christian identity in the face of a Muslim flood. Equally alarming is that Mr. Orban\u2019s truculence could become a blueprint for the European Union\u2019s self-destruction: a government that derides union governance while taking its money to enrich an oligarchy and entrench populist nationalism.European Union funding for Hungary is enormous: an expected 25 billion euros in the 2014 to 2020 funding cycle, per capita more than any union country other than Lithuania. Transparency International describes a large percentage of Hungarian projects funded by the European Union as corrupt.Other European countries hope that Mr. Orban\u2019s undermining of democracy will lead to pervasive discontent and strong public opposition, but that is not happening. The Hungarian population has been quiescent except for infrequent street protests against, for example, internet taxes or Mr. Orban\u2019s vision of educational reform.Uninhibited and shameless, Mr. Orban appears unmoved by Western criticism, dismissing it as foreign \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d while state television explains it as a product of Western conspiracies (by bankers in league with journalists). Ironically, the most muscular opposition to him comes from a party, Jobbik, which is even further to the right and which recently accused him of trumpeting \u201cso-called achievements\u201d through \u201cdouble talk\u201d that conceals his real intentions.In America, the democracy advocate George Soros, who was born in Hungary and follows it closely, views Mr. Orban as seriously challenging Angela Merkel for leadership of Europe when he promotes \u201cthe principles of Hungarian and Christian identity\u201d and denounces European Union refugee settlement proposals.It is unsettling to remember that Mr. Orban\u2019s disgust with what he calls \u201cWestern values,\u201d his determination to resurrect pre-1914 Hungarian borders, and his explicit identity-based nationalism arise from the seedbed of historic grievance that produced both world wars.On the internet, Hungarian dissidents describe a brand of cooperation between government and business that approaches an art form. For example: European Union funds intended to assure the transparency of funded projects are sidelined by invented project-management companies into investigations that go nowhere; meanwhile, Mr. Orban\u2019s close associates receive huge payments for useless consulting work, or loans with which to buy up steeply discounted assets like exclusive real estate and vineyards.Along the way, Mr. Orban has curtailed the constitutional court\u2019s ability to serve as a check on Parliament and, according to Human Rights Watch, diminished the protection of minorities. If an Orban associate is accused of stealing funds, the judiciary proves enfeebled. A few headlines suggesting government concern quickly evaporate into inaction.What can be done? Germany should be urged to play a central role. German companies figure heavily in Hungary\u2019s automotive industry, which contributes 10 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and is the fastest-growing sector of the national economy. Even as he works to fracture the European Union, Mr. Orban will pay attention if Ms. Merkel demonstrates there are consequences for bad behavior.The union should go beyond periodic slaps on the wrist by invigorating severe economic sanctions and placing Hungarian-bound funds in escrow during compliance investigations.The United States can work behind the scenes, avoiding Mr. Orban\u2019s paranoia in imagining a Soros-inspired cabal. It can support social media, and a new American president should challenge Mr. Orban\u2019s demonization of Brussels.Hungary has a vibrant humanistic culture. Its universities, literature, design, music and performing arts, medical science and technology are world class. You\u2019ll find salons where the conversation dissecting Mr. Orban\u2019s behavior is breathtakingly brilliant.But the opposition is deflated; as in Turkey, Russia and Venezuela, there is an overriding resignation that the country will not change, that the best and brightest will continue to flee, seeking a better future. Unless something fundamental changes, the resignation one senses in Hungary will continue because most Hungarians believe Mr. Orban has won.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In City Built by Immigrants, Immigration Is the Defining Political Issue", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byHAZLETON, Pa. \u2014 Thousands of Dominicans have poured into this little city in eastern Pennsylvania since 2001 to work in the food plants and warehouses on the edge of town, where the highway to New York meets the highway to Philadelphia.Hazleton\u2019s population is growing for the first time in more than half a century. Landlords, doctors and shopkeepers are learning to love their new customers.But the city\u2019s economic evolution has left behind its previous, non-Hispanic working class, and the presidential election has crystallized its frustrations. Many of those losing ground economically, including lifelong Democrats, say they plan to vote for Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee. Many of those who are prospering, including lifelong Republicans, say they will vote for the Democrat, Hillary Clinton.For both sides, how to deal with immigration has become a defining political issue, one that is likely to transcend the contretemps over Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women that has cost him so much support among elected Republicans. This city was built by European immigrants who flocked here a century ago to work in the coal mines. Their children found better jobs in the factories. Now their grandchildren are struggling against economic decline and cultural displacement.\u201cI don\u2019t care for this town no more because of the Hispanics,\u201d said Lewis Beishline, 70, as he sat drinking at 11 a.m. on a Friday at Cusat\u2019s Cafe, a bar owned by the mayor of Hazleton, who lives upstairs. Mr. Beishline, a retired welder, said he moved from Hazleton to a nearby town last year because he no longer felt safe.He plans to vote for Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cbecause of the immigration.\u201dThe Hispanic community, meanwhile, is eager to establish its own political power in the face of what many describe as persistent and painful discrimination. Community leaders in this city of 25,000 say they have registered more than 800 Hispanic voters in recent months, expanding the voting rolls by almost 10 percent.\u201cI tell my kids, if someone asks where you are from, you say \u2018Hazleton,\u2019\u201d said Guillermo Lara, 49, who moved here from Mexico in the early 1990s and whose two daughters were born here. \u201cWe\u2019re here, and we don\u2019t go nowhere. We want more.\u201dThat sharp divide is mirrored by the candidates seeking the Oval Office. Beyond his promised wall and deportations, Mr. Trump has denigrated immigrants repeatedly, at times without distinguishing between legal and illegal immigration.Mr. Barletta introduced Mr. Trump at a rally in nearby Wilkes-Barre on Monday night, declaring that voters in northeastern Pennsylvania would propel Mr. Trump to the White House.Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, has celebrated immigrants, both legal and illegal, as important contributors to American society. Her campaign describes her plan to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants as one of her most important ideas for increasing economic growth.\u201cComprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together \u2014 and it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in accepting the party\u2019s presidential nomination in Philadelphia, about 100 miles southeast of Hazleton.In the 2000 census, just 4.9 percent of Hazleton\u2019s population identified as Hispanic. A decade later, that figure was 37 percent. By 2014, the most recent data available, 46 percent of the population said it was Hispanic. In all likelihood, Hazleton is now a majority-Hispanic city, just like the nearby cities of Reading and Allentown.When the local coal mines began to close in the 1950s, Hazleton residents raised money to build an industrial park that attracted factories to the region. When the factories began to leave in the 1990s, the city mobilized again. Local officials won state permission to create one of Pennsylvania\u2019s largest tax-free Keystone Opportunity Zones. A Cargill meat processing and distribution plant arrived in 2001. Other distribution businesses have followed, including an Amazon.com warehouse.Many residents claim that city officials advertised for low-cost immigrant labor on billboards in New York or New Jersey, but Mr. Longazel said there was no evidence that ever happened. The truth is that the immigration was unanticipated but most likely inevitable.\u201cThe new jobs don\u2019t pay as much as the old jobs did, and the reality is that native-born folks were just not interested,\u201d Mr. Longazel said.The city also was also aging. Almost a quarter of the population was over 65 in 2000, roughly twice the national average.And nature abhors a vacuum \u2014 especially in a work force.Many of the new arrivals trace their roots to one Dominican city, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa. Hazleton\u2019s old shopping streets, nearly abandoned in the 1990s, are now lined with Dominican bakeries, barbershops, travel agencies and Mexican restaurants. The Italian restaurants are now run by Mexican families. The city has two Spanish radio stations and a television station that broadcasts six hours of local programming a day.Stephen M. Schleicher, a dermatologist, said Hispanic residents now made up a third of his patients. He has hired a bilingual receptionist and is looking for a bilingual nurse. He has started placing ads in the local Spanish-language newspaper.Dr. Schleicher, a lifelong Republican, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s views on immigration had persuaded him, albeit reluctantly, to vote for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a total revitalization despite the government trying to keep the immigrants out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been a ghost town of older white people.\u201dYet it is easy to overstate Hazleton\u2019s recovery. Many of the new jobs pay poorly. Almost 29 percent of the population lived in poverty in 2014, almost twice the national average.And Hazleton\u2019s evolution has inspired deep resentment. Many residents complain bitterly about the new arrivals not speaking English, about loud music late at night, about people walking in the street and driving without regard for traffic rules.Wana Bostic, 45, scrapes by on $11.50 an hour as a home health aide. She said that she was not paid nearly enough, but that employers can squeeze workers because of the ready availability of immigrant labor.\u201cNo one talks about white Americans and what we really need,\u201d she said.Crime has increased, as has drug use. The police force, meanwhile, has shrunk with declining tax revenue. Many residents are convinced that illegal immigration is to blame.\u201cIf you come into the country breaking the law, that\u2019s not a good way to get your foot in the door,\u201d said Nick Zapotocky, 31, who now has three deadbolt locks on the door of his home. \u201cThat says you\u2019re willing to break the law again.\u201dHe voted for President Obama in 2008. In 2012, he did not vote. And this year, he said he will vote for Mr. Trump.Francisco Torres-Aranda said people were blinded by their fear of change, unable to see the benefits that immigration is bringing to Hazleton. Mr. Torres-Aranda, whose father was Mexican, runs a company that makes caps for old wells. He employs 30 people in the summer, only a few of them Hispanic. And he noted that some of the largest employers in the area are now Mexican companies, including Bimbo Bakeries, which has a plant nearby that makes millions of Thomas\u2019 English Muffins.Mr. Torres-Aranda said he had always voted Republican, loyal to his pocketbook. But he plans to vote for Mrs. Clinton, he said.\u201cThey fear they\u2019re losing what they remember,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what can you do? The United States is in evolution. Apple pie came after the Germans arrived. Maybe it will now be \u2018As American as salsa.\u2019 So what?\u201dHazleton still has no Hispanic elected officials. The city just added its first Hispanic police officer. The public school system, which has very few Hispanic teachers, was ordered by the federal Department of Education in 2014 to improve efforts to teach English to immigrants, and to communicate with parents.But a second generation of Hispanic Americans in Hazleton may force change.Mr. Lara worked three jobs to pay private school tuition so his daughters could avoid Hazleton\u2019s high school. After 12-hour days in a factory, he washed dishes at night and cleaned offices on weekends. Two years ago, his eldest daughter, Amanda, graduated from Ithaca College in upstate New York with a degree in psychology and came home.She teaches after-school classes for Hispanic children in the building that was once her elementary school. It has become a community center thanks in large part to Joe Maddon, a Hazleton native who manages the Chicago Cubs.Ms. Lara, who is studying for a master\u2019s degree at the University of Scranton, said racial tensions had increased. At the city\u2019s annual Funfest, she noticed an empty space between the Hispanic vendors and the Polish and Italian vendors.\u201cAnd I hear it from my kids,\u201d she said of her students. \u201cThey\u2019re not dumb. They can tell when they\u2019re not liked or they\u2019re not welcome.\u201dBut she said she was not sure she wanted to move away. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Why would you want to stay there?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWell, for one thing, this is my hometown.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Study Finds Some Uber and Lyft Drivers Racially Discriminate", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byBy tapping into new technologies and the ubiquitous use of smartphones, the likes of Uber and Lyft \u2014 rival ride-booking services \u2014 were supposed to solve many of the problems that litter the traditional economy.But it turns out some of those problems are hard to tackle, even for these new Silicon Valley tech darlings.Airbnb, for its part, has recently taken steps to stamp out such racial bias, including the creation of a new nondiscrimination policy.As part of the research into Uber and Lyft, African-American and white users in Seattle and Boston hailed rides separately with both services.\u201cWe found that African-American travelers in Seattle experienced statistically significantly longer delay waiting for a trip request through UberX or Lyft to be accepted,\u201d said the researchers from the University of Washington, M.I.T. and Stanford. UberX is Uber\u2019s baseline service.\u201cWe theorize that at least some drivers for both UberX and Lyft discriminate on the basis of the perceived race of the traveler,\u201d they added.Rachel Holt, Uber\u2019s head of North American operations, said there was no place for racism on the company\u2019s online platform, though Uber had no plans to alter how it currently operates.\u201cStudies like this one are helpful in thinking about how we can do even more,\u201d she said.Adrian Durbin, a Lyft spokesman, said that the company provides ride-sharing services to underserved areas, and has had a positive impact in \u201ccommunities of color.\u201dThe company does not \u201ctolerate any form of discrimination,\u201d he added in an email.In Seattle, the researchers found, African-American users had to wait as much as 35 percent longer for some Uber rides, while in Boston, people with African-American-sounding names were more than twice as likely to have their Uber rides canceled compared with people with white-sounding names.The academics said the companies could avoid such discrimination by not including passengers\u2019 names when bookings are made, as well as imposing sanctions on drivers who routinely cancel trips without cause.\u201cTransportation sharing networks such as UberX and Lyft bring a number of benefits to the economy,\u201d the researchers said. In extreme cases, though, \u201cdrivers are more than four times as likely to cancel on an African-American male passenger than on a white male passenger.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Magnate\u2019s Twin Goals: Fighting Climate Change and Electing Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byMONTAUK, N.Y. \u2014 On a sunny morning late this summer, Andrew E. Sabin was aboard his 60-foot yacht, \u201cAbove the Ground.\u201d He had begun the day in Amagansett, a well-heeled enclave near East Hampton where he maintains a lush seven-acre compound replete with a menagerie featuring peacocks and an enormous pig. Now, on the eastern tip of Long Island, Mr. Sabin pierced a clam with a hook and dropped his fishing line 120 feet to the ocean floor, hoping to land some cod.A wisecracking, boyish septuagenarian of seemingly unlimited energy, Mr. Sabin runs a privately held precious-metals recycling business that has made him enormously wealthy. The Sabin Metal Corporation processes about $1 billion worth of platinum, palladium and other metals each year. Annual revenue is less than that, but it clearly leaves plenty for a personal fortune.With that money, Mr. Sabin has emerged as a leading supporter of climate change initiatives. He has endowed the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, funds climate change prizes and professors at Yale and the University of California, Los Angeles and is a major donor to Global Wildlife Conservation. He founded a local natural history museum where he leads nature walks, and, thanks to his generous support of environmental causes, he has four species named after him \u2014 two frogs, a chameleon and a lemur.But Mr. Sabin also sharply diverges from the environmentalist stereotype: He is a strident Republican donating big sums of money in an effort to elect Donald J. Trump president.His twin passions are at odds. Many of the Republican Party\u2019s elected officials deny that humans are accelerating the warming of the planet, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence. Prominent environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, generally back Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. Yet Mr. Sabin has been a generous donor to the Republican Party for years, contributing more than $500,000 to Republican candidates, committees and other political groups this election cycle.Even within his party, Mr. Sabin is an outlier: Many other Republicans who believe in climate change have declined to support Mr. Trump. But after backing Jeb Bush early in the primaries, Mr. Sabin threw his wallet behind Mr. Trump and never looked back. He recently donated $100,000 to Trump Victory, the candidate\u2019s joint fund-raising venture with the Republican Party.To hear Mr. Sabin tell it, a Trump presidency would not be such a threat to environmental concerns. Yes, Mr. Trump has routinely suggested that global warming is not real, has vowed to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency if elected president and said he would walk away from the landmark Paris accord approved last year, in which nearly 200 countries agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions.Mr. Sabin, however, brushes that off as election-season bluster. \u201cI don\u2019t think he believes half the things he says,\u201d he said. In meetings with Mr. Trump, he has come away convinced that the candidate is actually a reasonable, well-tempered man who is committed to clean air and clean water. As for Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamations about the E.P.A. and the Paris agreement, Mr. Sabin is dismissive, arguing that such actions wouldn\u2019t get through Congress. \u201cThere are good checks and balances,\u201d Mr. Sabin said. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to do whatever he wants.\u201dThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.As much as he supports the Republican ticket, Mr. Sabin is equally motivated by his loathing for Mrs. Clinton, whom he derides as untrustworthy, unethical and unfit for office. In front of his mansion, in an organic garden that features kale, blueberries and Swiss chard, Mr. Sabin has erected several \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d yard signs. Last year, after the signs disappeared in the middle of the night, Mr. Sabin placed them on stilts and surrounded them with a 6,600-volt electrified fence.\u201cYou will have a fascinating journey down the rabbit hole in trying to understand the complexity of Andy Sabin,\u201d said Susan Rockefeller, a prominent conservationist who has worked with Mr. Sabin and affectionately calls him \u201cthe eco-saint of the Hamptons.\u201dThis summer, Mr. Sabin made several trips to Washington. His mission was to persuade Republican members of Congress to acknowledge climate change in the party platform that would shape the Republican National Convention in late July.In a flurry of meetings, Mr. Sabin, who wears a uniform of Hawaiian shirts, baggy khaki pants and sneakers, visited the offices of Republican representatives including Chris Gibson of New York, Joe Wilson of South Carolina and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, as well as Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.Mr. Sabin has no doubt that greenhouse gases from human activity are warming the planet, leading to rising oceans and more severe weather. \u201cThe science is clear,\u201d he said, and inasmuch as he can, Mr. Sabin is working to minimize his own carbon dioxide emissions. At Sabin Metal Corporation\u2019s processing plants in upstate New York, North Dakota and Ontario, he says he has invested in expensive equipment to reduce emissions and minimize pollution. \u201cNot a drop of carbon comes out of my stacks,\u201d he said.Yet on Capitol Hill, he measured his words. Instead of trying to persuade Republican lawmakers that climate science is real, he talked to them about the need to minimize pollution as a way to keep people healthy. He makes the case that worse air quality leads to premature deaths, an increase in illnesses, more stillbirths and higher hospital spending. \u201cI don\u2019t discuss climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cI discuss health.\u201dMr. Sabin employs this rhetorical sleight of hand to reconcile what, to many, are inherently contradictory positions.\u201cI came to the conclusion that I needed to come up with a way to get Republicans on board about cutting carbon,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats aren\u2019t going to convince Republicans that climate change is real, so I\u2019m trying to get them to the same place.\u201dHe has drafted a policy paper peppered with statistics from the RAND Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University that encourages lawmakers to invest in clean energy jobs and to pressure businesses to pollute less, simply for the good of public health. If embraced in earnest, Mr. Sabin says, this approach will result in reductions in greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 a goal of many Democrats.But he opposes many ideas from Democrats about how to reach that goal. He is vehemently opposed to new regulation and a carbon tax, and he says the E.P.A. is guilty of overreach. Instead, Mr. Sabin says that private investments in clean coal technology, new nuclear power and renewable energy will reduce greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to check global warming. In the meantime, Mr. Sabin supports the use of cheap and abundant natural gas.It is a position that closely mirrors that of the broader Republican Party on energy production. And Mr. Sabin claims to have the Trump campaign\u2019s ear on the issue. He says he is in regular contact with the campaign and took credit for shaping the response to a question in the second presidential debate, when Mr. Trump talked up clean coal, wind power and solar energy. \u201cThat came from me,\u201d Mr. Sabin said.Many environmentalists, however, say the policies promoted by Mr. Sabin and Mr. Trump will not do nearly enough to curb emissions.\u201cTo put the fate of our climate on clean coal and so-called next-gen nuclear is about the riskiest proposition in the world,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. \u201cWe might as well bet on leprechauns and the Easter bunny.\u201dMr. Sabin\u2019s positions baffle even some professors he supports. Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said: \u201cAndy and I agree about some things and agree to disagree on other things. The party has gone off the rails on that side.\u201dMany Republicans in Congress reject the idea that human activity is contributing to climate change. \u201cI don\u2019t think what we do as a race is going to be the deciding factor in what happens with our environment,\u201d said Ms. Foxx, the North Carolina congresswoman. \u201cBecause I happen to believe that God is in charge.\u201dShortly after Mr. Sabin\u2019s visits to Washington, he had a private meeting with Mr. Trump at the Manhattan home of Steven Mnuchin, the candidate\u2019s national finance chairman. Mr. Trump wore his usual dark suit with a white shirt and a red tie. Mr. Sabin attended the meeting in a bright green Hawaiian shirt, wearing Buddhist prayer beads on his wrist.Mr. Sabin came away impressed. \u201cTrump knows in his heart that cutting carbon is the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Sabin said. \u201cHe\u2019s very different in person. He listens.\u201dMr. Sabin, 70, grew up in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn and still speaks with a thick New York accent reminiscent of Mr. Trump\u2019s. As a boy, he would wander over to undeveloped areas in nearby Bensonhurst and collect frogs and snakes with his bare hands. \u201cI started catching them and never grew up,\u201d he said.He joined the Army reserve in the late 1960s, he said, and then joined his father\u2019s business, which collected and sold scrap metal. In the early 1970s, Mr. Sabin started a trading house for metals and other commodities. As Wall Street went digital, Mr. Sabin left trading behind and built out his father\u2019s company into Sabin Metal Corporation.He attributes his passion for the environment to his boyhood enthusiasm. \u201cSince I started catching frogs, I\u2019ve always been interested in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the years went on I realized the importance of preserving what I was enjoying.\u201dHe has been a Republican for as long as he can remember, too, and has internalized the party\u2019s talking points about Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI see corruption with the Clintons only rivaled by Nigeria, Malaysia or Indonesia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt starts right at the top, and it disgusts me.\u201dPerhaps one way to makes sense of Mr. Sabin is to recognize that he is much like Mr. Trump himself. Impassioned and at times charismatic, he is also quick to ignore facts, brimming with conspiracy theories, and prone to objectifying women. His girlfriend is several decades his junior. \u201cYou\u2019re only as young as the woman you\u2019re touching,\u201d he said. While watching Fox News, he complimented the appearance of the daytime host Jenna Lee. (\u201cI think she\u2019s so hot,\u201d he said.) Aboard his yacht, he openly viewed pornography on an iPad. Over the course of several months, he sent a reporter numerous emails containing X-rated images.On Thursday, Mr. Sabin said he was repulsed by Mr. Trump\u2019s recently unearthed comments about sexually assaulting women \u2014 though not enough to withdraw his support. And he is unashamed of his own libido. \u201cI\u2019m proud that at 70 years old I still have a healthy sex drive,\u201d he said.He also talks of radical transformation to the economy, while rejecting regulation as a tool to facilitate change. And on his Facebook page, Mr. Sabin traffics in the conspiracy theories of the so-called Alt Right. Stories such as \u201cMichelle Obama Vows to Confiscate All Firearms Before Leaving the White House\u201d and \u201cUnited Nations to Investigate Hillary Clinton for Election Fraud\u201d are posted alongside pictures of Mr. Sabin searching for salamanders.This complex personality is on constant display. Tooling around the Hamptons, he drives a Jeep Wrangler with his nickname, the Salamander Commander, emblazoned on the doors. On the back of the jeep are bumper stickers that say \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d and \u201cTrump 2016.\u201dAt a separate property that he owns in the Hamptons, away from his mansion, Tibetan prayer flags form a canopy over the driveway. In front of the house is a small sanctuary for injured turtles. Buddha statues are placed around the grounds and throughout the house. Inside, a piano once owned by the abstract expressionist painter Lee Krasner sits in the living room. And all around the property are National Rifle Association signs, warning trespassers that they will be shot.These days, Mr. Sabin acknowledges his candidate\u2019s shortcomings. And he said he disliked the hobbies of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s children. (\u201cI don\u2019t like hunting,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t like about Trump\u2019s kids: these pictures of them holding leopards and elephant tails.\u201d)And yet, Mr. Sabin is still supporting Mr. Trump for lack of what he sees as a better option. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep a Republican House, and Republican Senate and a conservative Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump comes with the package to do that.\u201dIt is a combustible, contradictory mix, reflecting the tensions roiling the Republican Party \u2014 and the nation \u2014 in this bizarre election season.In the run-up to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, the party\u2019s official platform was unveiled. \u201cClimate change is far from this nation\u2019s most pressing national security issue,\u201d it read. \u201cThis is the triumph of extremism over common sense, and Congress must stop it.\u201dMr. Sabin was unruffled by the snub. \u201cIt was a disappointment,\u201d Mr. Sabin said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t try it can\u2019t happen.\u201dMotoring back to the Long Island shore on his yacht, Mr. Sabin was satisfied with his haul. A dozen meaty fish were in the hold, including several cod and a handful of black sea bass. On the horizon, five towering wind turbines rose from the ocean. The first offshore wind farm in the United States, the turbines have stirred up predictable controversy in this area. But Mr. Sabin rejects the Nimbyism that has turned some wealthy locals against the project.\u201cI\u2019m a big proponent of wind energy,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people worry about the views, but it\u2019s better than more carbon.\u201dIn the cabin of the boat, Fox News played on a large flat-screen TV. It was midday, and Mr. Trump was holding forth at a news conference at his new Washington hotel, where he finally admitted that President Obama was born in the United States, after years promoting the birther conspiracy.\u201cTrump is doing really well,\u201d Mr. Sabin said enthusiastically. \u201cHillary\u2019s in trouble.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the wealthy businessman Andrew E. Sabin\u2019s contradictory stance of supporting both action to thwart climate change and the presidential aspirations of Donald J.

{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Economy Slows, a Look at What Could Happen", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s economy is slowing. How bad can it get?China reported on Wednesday that its economy grew 6.7 percent in the third quarter compared with a year ago. That matched economists\u2019 expectations exactly, and was identical to the pace China set in the first and second quarters of this year. In economics, stability like that is remarkable \u2014 and usually not to be believed.\u201cChina\u2019s growth has already slowed down dramatically from the heady rates before the financial crisis,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Enodo Economics. \u201cThe economy has reached the end of the road when it comes to its export- and investment-led growth model.\u201dThat is a major concern for central banks, economists, investors and corporate executives around the world, as China has been a major engine of growth for decades. Their main question: What happens next?Below are three situations that are often discussed as the most likely outcomes of China\u2019s predicament \u2014 and what each would mean for the rest of the world.China escaped the worst of the 2008 global financial crisis by starting a campaign of state-directed spending that created mountains of new debt. This helped cushion the blow of the fallout around the world. But critics argue that this only delayed China\u2019s own day of reckoning.China is still adding credit at a heady pace, and experts are starting to sound alarm bells. Under this situation, China risks its own version of the 2008 crisis that shook Wall Street and plunged the United States into recession and years of painfully slow growth. The rest of the world \u2014 which is still dealing with Europe\u2019s woes \u2014 could follow.The good news is that few people actually think such a crisis is the most likely outcome.\u201cThe risks of a financial crisis remain very low,\u201d said Andy Rothman, an investment strategist at Matthews Asia, based in San Francisco.Mr. Rothman and others point to China\u2019s tight grip on its own financial system. It controls the country\u2019s big banks as well as the big companies that borrow the most. It also limits how much money can leave its borders and keeps a firm grip on the value of its currency.So why can\u2019t China just spend its way out of its slowdown?The problem is that China\u2019s debt burden is so much larger than ever before \u2014 both in absolute terms and compared with the economy.\u201cThe resurgence of state investment has helped sustain growth in the short run, as has the modest rebound in property investment this year,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on China\u2019s economy who is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.But he added, \u201cThe productivity of state investment is low, so it is a very inefficient way to sustain growth.\u201dWith China\u2019s high debt, inability to spend and a lack of political will to make tough choices to fix its economy, economists are increasingly comparing it to another Asian powerhouse: Japan.China is not Japan, of course, and its vast and upwardly mobile population stands in contrast to Japan\u2019s wealthier but aging society. Still, a growing number of economists see the possibility of something similar.\u201cJust having a lot of debt, and bad debt, does not cause you to have a crisis,\u201d said Arthur R. Kroeber, the managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, an economic research firm in Beijing.\u201cBut the price that you pay \u2014 if you don\u2019t do the financial restructuring and real economy restructuring that is necessary to restore things to health \u2014 is that you get a very long period of very low growth and anemic activity,\u201d he added.That could also sideline one of the world\u2019s most reliable engines of growth. It could also cause problems in China, where leaders have long pledged to provide jobs and opportunity to the millions who still leave their rural villages looking for a better life.Still, that could be better than the alternative.\u201cThis expansion of debt is way beyond anything we saw in Japan, both in terms of magnitude and time frame,\u201d said Charlene Chu, a partner at Autonomous Research and a former China banking analyst at Fitch Ratings.\u201cI think a Japan outcome in many ways would be a best-case scenario for China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bernard Built a New York Megachurch", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "The reverend\u2019s intellectualism and distinctive brand of man-up Christianity draws a wide audience to his church, the largest in New York.Supported byCameras on telescoping booms were cantilevered over the stage, which is bland and massive, like the set of a daytime talk show. It was the final morning of a weeklong women\u2019s conference, and the female audience of more than 1,000 took out their own devices and cued up their Bible apps, poised to take notes.When the pastor speaks, everyone takes notes, not just the younger congregants.His church, the largest in New York City, has long been considered a required stop on the way to City Hall and beyond. Having served as an adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for all three terms, Mr. Bernard counts the billionaire among his many powerful friends. (In 2013, he flirted briefly with his own mayoral bid.) Mr. Bernard has met with the last two popes, and when Reuven Rivlin, the president of Israel, visited New York for the first time last year, he attended service at the church days before he addressed the United Nations. Mr. Bernard is a registered Republican, but he voted twice for Bill Clinton and twice for President Obama. The Clintons are old friends; they made sure to visit the church last spring in the days before the New York primary.Mr. Bernard may have a reputation as a kingmaker, or \u201cspiritual power broker,\u201d as Bill Cunningham, the political consultant and former communications director for Mr. Bloomberg, described him recently, following a storied tradition of influential black pastors in New York City. But his tweedy intellectualism and distinctive brand of muscular, man-up Christianity also draw stars of pop music, film and sports to East New York.\u201cHe\u2019s made me a better person through his teachings,\u201d Pauletta Washington said. \u201cMy husband as well.\u201dOnce a Nation of Islam follower and teenage civil rights activist who read Alan Watts and Krishnamurti before he read the Bible, Mr. Bernard presents more like a professor than a bible thumper. That he is a motorcycle-riding family man and father of seven sons as well as a martial arts devotee \u2014 inked into Mr. Bernard\u2019s forearm is a Chinese character that translates as \u201cthe unfettered mind\u201d \u2014 adds to his allure.On that Saturday morning in Brooklyn, Mr. Bernard was writing swiftly on his marker board while the women in the audience called out encouragements. \u201cYou have a responsibility to get smarter,\u201d he told them. \u201cIf you\u2019re the smartest one in your group, get a new group. Develop your strengths. Manage your weaknesses.\u201d As always, Mr. Bernard closed with this refrain: \u201cDid you get anything out of this today?\u201dThen Karen Bernard, his high school sweetheart and wife of 44 years, stepped onto the dais and swiftly upstaged him. Though she has multiple sclerosis, she waved away the stool a burly security guard had brought for her and stood next to her husband, a smartly dressed figure in black patent leather platform shoes with stiletto heels, a delicate diamond bracelet circling her ankle. As her husband described the pneumonia that hit him hard last month \u2014 unlike Hillary Clinton, he was benched for two solid weeks \u2014 and how his wife had cared for him, Ms. Bernard scanned the crowd, eyebrows eloquently aloft, and said with perfect comedic timing, \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you do with a baby?\u201dMr. Bernard winced as the crowd roared its approval.Ms. Bernard is the not-so-secret sauce in Mr. Bernard\u2019s global ministry. Their long marriage has been a touchstone in his preaching, and he has used their marital struggles as teaching aids. Mr. Bernard will tell you that his work has often been his mistress, and Ms. Bernard will just as quickly tell you how mad that has made her, and for how long (on this morning, she pinched his arm hard to make her point, which delighted her rapt audience).In the early 1980s, Ms. Bernard miscarried twins while Mr. Bernard was on the road, she said. She blamed him for being absent, and she stayed bitter, she said, for a solid decade. \u201cI thought about leaving him,\u201d she said, but with seven sons, \u201cI had nowhere to go. And my sons needed their father. And I loved him.\u201dIt was after the Saturday service, and the Bernards were in the large, formal dining room of Mr. Bernard\u2019s office suite at the church, an elegant, carpeted apartment with gleaming mahogany furniture that recalls the West Wing. There was a cadre of security guards brandishing walkie-talkies, along with a sizable crowd of family members, church employees and congregants, all milling about the many rooms, which are organized around a large, oval-shaped central hall.\u201cShe had cause to walk away,\u201d Mr. Bernard said, \u201cbut she stayed, and I really went to work on myself. I discovered a lot of things about myself I didn\u2019t like. I\u2019m a workaholic. I was all in. That\u2019s when I began to develop teachings about men and men\u2019s responsibilities. She hung in there and things began to change, and the church just began to explode.\u201dThe two met in high school in East New York, when he was 15 and she was 16. Mr. Bernard\u2019s mother, Adelina Bernard, had been a Panamanian sprinter who qualified for the 1952 Summer Olympics but wasn\u2019t able to compete because an affair with an older man left her pregnant, after which he rejected her and their son. She and Mr. Bernard moved to New York City when he was 4.He and Ms. Bernard began to host a Bible study in their Williamsburg kitchen, and it wasn\u2019t long before they figured out that Mr. Bernard was very good at preaching. A deft speaker who uses traditional pastoral tropes like call and response, Mr. Bernard crafts his 45-minute sermons like mash-ups of a university lecture and a Baptist revival, though Mr. Bernard\u2019s church is pointedly nondenominational.\u201cComing from a heavy black radical activism, to embrace Jesus was a major thing for me,\u201d he said. \u201cChristianity was the religion of the oppressor, so I had to work through what I knew historically.\u201d Investigating the religion and its central text as an academic would, he began to realize, Mr. Bernard said, \u201cthat I had an ability to articulate what I was reading and studying in a way that was not common within any denomination. I also realized that banking was not going to be my life\u2019s calling.\u201dBy the mid-1990s, his church was so popular that it had rapidly expanded from a congregation of 685 to more than 10,000. People came from all five boroughs, as they do today, some traveling hours to do so, and were folded into three Sunday services held in a former Key Food supermarket building in Brownsville, around which lines would start to form as early as 4 a.m. Nightclub goers on their way home grew curious about the crowds, which further swelled the church\u2019s ranks. You might run into Cheryl James and Sandra Denton, two of the members of Salt-N-Pepa, the hip-hop trio; Angela Bassett; or Kim Cattrall, who played the sultry publicist on \u201cSex and the City.\u201dIn the late 1990s, Disque Deane, the real estate investor and leader of the partnership behind Starrett City, the country\u2019s largest federally subsidized housing complex, approached Mr. Bernard with a proposal for a 15-acre parcel on the edge of his development. As the pastor recalled, \u201cHe said, \u2018I have a billion-dollar complex I need to preserve, and I\u2019ve been studying you and I want you to build a church.\u201d Mr. Deane did not finance the deal, Mr. Bernard added; the church raised the money and bought 11\u00bd acres. When the $12.6 million complex was nearly complete, Ms. Bernard looked around and told her husband, \u201cIt\u2019s not big enough.\u201d\u201cSo he crosses a lot of lines, a lot of boundaries,\u201d Mr. Cunningham added. \u201cIf you\u2019re a politician and you have a message about jobs or the economy or crime and you\u2019re addressing that megachurch, your message will ripple out to all these different communities.\u201dInitially, Mr. Bernard\u2019s sermons about male responsibility were attracting a lot of young men, which in turn, brought in more women. Church congregations typically skew more female than male, but at one point more than half of the Christian Cultural Center\u2019s membership was male. (Now the split is 60/40 female to male, like many college campuses.)Man up, men, Mr. Bernard exhorts, or you\u2019ll lose her. Echoing animal behaviorists, he suggests women offer positive reinforcement if their menfolk behave properly.Mr. Martin, the former football star, is one male congregant who has been avidly following Mr. Bernard\u2019s teachings; he said the pastor is both his friend and a father figure. \u201cHe is the single most influential male in my adult life,\u201d he said. Now 43, Mr. Martin began attending his church in the late 1990s, when he signed with the Jets. \u201cA friend of mine said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to hear this guy speak,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I just kept going back. I\u2019m a very practical person, and I think he has a tremendous gift for making what is complicated extremely simple. He can talk about God in a way that makes you attracted to God so you don\u2019t get lost in all the rules and regulations.\u201dMr. Martin brought his friend Carra Wallace, now chief diversity officer in New York City\u2019s office of the comptroller. She was coming off a divorce \u2014 \u201cI like to say I married late and divorced early,\u201d she said \u2014 and was attracted to Mr. Bernard\u2019s teaching method: \u201cYou take notes, you\u2019re able to study and think about it.\u201d These days, Ms. Wallace attends the 8 a.m. service, an hour\u2019s train ride from her home in Battery Park City. \u201cYou get your message in, and then you have your day.\u201dMr. Bernard, who is the chief executive of his church, as well as its senior pastor (his six-figure salary is determined by a board), is at heart a practical evangelist. When it was reported in the run-up to the presidential election in 2012 that African-American ministers were encouraging their congregations not to vote because of President Obama\u2019s position on gay marriage, Mr. Bernard bristled at being lumped into that group.\u201cLet me give you three powerful reasons why I would never tell my congregation not to vote: Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney,\u201d he told a reporter on MSNBC, referring to the young civil rights workers who were murdered in Mississippi in 1964. \u201cDon\u2019t let same-sex marriage be the deciding factor.\u201d He went on to give a meticulous, and theologically agile, mini-lecture on the separation of church and state, on why same-sex marriage is a civil rights issue and how his own faith nonetheless requires that he obey its tenets.Last year, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, Mr. Bernard delivered a sermon about how societal norms and laws change over time. \u201cI used the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit as one example,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the law, but most people are doing 65, so that\u2019s the norm. If they hit 95, which is the extreme, the police will pull them over. Over time, cultural practices can move from extreme to norm to law.\u201dChange is a process, not an event, he likes to say.This election year has come with its own challenges. In June, when Donald J. Trump\u2019s team invited a group of evangelicals to advise the candidate, Mr. Bernard was among them. Mr. Bernard has since stepped away from that role, he said, because he felt more like \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d as he put it, than a genuine adviser. The two had met years ago, weirdly, at Maya Angelou\u2019s 80th birthday party, where Mr. Bernard was the keynote speaker; the setting was Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, which perhaps explains the unlikely pairing of that presidential hopeful with the poet and civil right activist.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to advise you,\u201d Mr. Bernard said, \u201cit\u2019s because I\u2019m going to really, genuinely advise you. O.K., politics is a weird game, I get it. But when I found out that no matter what we were saying, he continued the same path, I said: \u2018You know what? I need to step back and remain neutral.\u2019\u201dMs. Bernard, with typical candor, said, \u201cI never met Trump, but Trump just has issues, and it\u2019s obvious he has issues.\u201dTwo weeks ago, when Elena George, a celebrity makeup artist, was preparing Donna Brazile, the veteran political analyst now serving as interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, for her role on CNN\u2019s round table after the first presidential debate, they phoned Mr. Bernard to join them in a prayer. \u201cI told Donna, \u2018We need reinforcement,\u2019\u201d Ms. George recalled.\u201cHe quoted scripture,\u201d Ms. Brazile said. \u201cAnd it was helpful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dangers of Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byA VOTE for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, the Clinton campaign has suggested in broad ways and subtle ones, isn\u2019t just a vote for a Democrat over a Republican: It\u2019s a vote for safety over risk, steady competence over boastful recklessness, psychological stability in the White House over ungovernable passions.This theme has been a winning one for Hillary, in her debates and in the wider campaign, and for good reason. The perils of a Trump presidency are as distinctive as the candidate himself, and a vote for Trump makes a long list of worst cases \u2014 the Western alliance system\u2019s unraveling, a cycle of domestic radicalization, an accidental economic meltdown, a civilian-military crisis \u2014 more likely than with any normal administration.But passing on the plane-crash candidate doesn\u2019t mean ignoring the dangers of his rival.The dangers of a Hillary Clinton presidency are more familiar than Trump\u2019s authoritarian unknowns, because we live with them in our politics already. They\u2019re the dangers of elite groupthink, of Beltway power worship, of a cult of presidential action in the service of dubious ideals. They\u2019re the dangers of a recklessness and radicalism that doesn\u2019t recognize itself as either, because it\u2019s convinced that if an idea is mainstream and commonplace among the great and good then it cannot possibly be folly.Almost every crisis that has come upon the West in the last 15 years has its roots in this establishmentarian type of folly. The Iraq War, which liberals prefer to remember as a conflict conjured by a neoconservative cabal, was actually the work of a bipartisan interventionist consensus, pushed hard by George W. Bush but embraced as well by a large slice of center-left opinion that included Tony Blair and more than half of Senate Democrats.This record of elite folly \u2014 which doesn\u2019t even include lesser case studies like our splendid little war in Libya \u2014 is a big part of why the United States has a \u201clet\u2019s try crazy\u201d candidate in this election, and why there are so many Trumpian parties thriving on European soil.One can look at Trump himself and see too much danger of still-deeper disaster, too much temperamental risk and moral turpitude, to be an acceptable alternative to this blunder-ridden status quo ... while also looking at Hillary Clinton and seeing a woman whose record embodies the tendencies that gave rise to Trumpism in the first place.Indeed what is distinctive about Clinton, more even than Bush or Obama, is how few examples there are of her ever breaking with the elite consensus on matters of statecraft.She was for the Iraq War when everyone was for it, against the surge when everyone had given up on Iraq, and then an unchastened liberal hawk again in Libya just a few short years later.The good news is that she is not a utopian; she is \u2014 or has become, across a long and grinding career \u2014 temperamentally pragmatic, self-consciously hardheaded. So she is unlikely to do anything that the cosmopolitan capitals of Europe and America would consider obviously radical or dangerous or dumb.But in those cases where the cosmopolitan position isn\u2019t necessarily reasonable or safe, in those instances where the Western elite can go half-mad without realizing it, Hillary Clinton shows every sign of being just as ready to march into folly as her peers.Advertisement"}

Assuming he used it to the fullest \u2014 as he has boasted he has \u2014 avoiding taxes on $50 million of income a year over 18 years, he would have saved almost $400 million in federal taxes in today\u2019s money. Deploying the deduction against New York\u2019s state and local income taxes would have produced savings of another $150 million.Mr. Trump and his surrogates on the campaign trail have portrayed such maneuvering as a sign of accounting genius, a crucial skill for a future president to have. Yet perhaps the most relevant question, considering Mr. Trump\u2019s ambition to the highest office in the land, is what did his fellow Americans lose in exchange for his gain?Half a billion dollars over 18 years would not be enough to plug the budget deficit or rebuild the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. But it is definitely real money.Consider Mr. Trump\u2019s tax savings. Half a billion dollars would finance housing vouchers for more than 40,000 families with children, at just under $10,000 a family. It would fund more than 50,000 slots for the Head Start program, which costs about $8,700 a child.It would pay the unemployment insurance benefits of more than 60,000 Americans getting the average weekly check of $300 for six months. Or it would cover the average food stamp benefit of $126 a month for more than 300,000 people for an entire year.The federal and state governments spent $11.3 billion in child care subsidies in 2014, a 12-year low, according to the Center for Law and Social Policy. Another $500 million would provide support for an additional 75,000 children, freeing thousands of low-income parents to go to school or enter the labor force.And yet Mr. Trump\u2019s proud dodge should draw attention to one of America\u2019s most damaging weaknesses: The nation does not manage to provide its people with a minimum standard of well-being, something commonplace across the rest of the industrial world.The United States scores depressingly low compared with other advanced countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A baby girl born in the United States today is expected to live four fewer years than one born in Italy or South Korea. One in five American children lives in a poor home. In Norway, fewer than one in 20 do. For every 100,000 American children, 33 die before they turn 20. That\u2019s 12 more than in Britain. And American teenagers have babies at four times the rate of teenagers in Spain.What\u2019s going on? On average, Americans are among the richest people in the world. The problem is that too many of them have been left out of that prosperity. And the American government has simply not had the wherewithal to lend a hand.A preschool student at the North Idaho College Head Start school Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho. Mr. Trump\u2019s tax savings could have funded more than 50,000 slots for the Head Start program, at about $8,700 a child.Contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the United States is one of the most heavily taxed nations, only South Korea, Chile and Mexico, among O.E.C.D. countries, collect less in tax revenue as a share of the economy. That means the American budget for things like prenatal care, low-income housing and worker training is simply not up to the task.President Obama has tried hard to draw more resources for the federal government by raising the top rate of taxes paid by rich people like Mr. Trump. He forced Congress to increase the top income tax rate for high-income Americans from 35 percent back to 39.6 percent, where it was under President Bill Clinton. He imposed a small tax on the wealthy to help pay for health coverage for the uninsured.Still, total federal tax revenue in 2015 amounted to only 18.3 percent of the nation\u2019s G.D.P. That is less than Washington collected in the 1950s. Federal taxes on individuals generated just 8.7 percent of gross domestic product, well below the peak of 9.9 percent 15 years earlier.In this context, Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting \u201cgenius\u201d adds up, for the nation, to an existential threat.The large and growing share of income flowing to the very wealthiest Americans \u2014 those who routinely deploy high-price professionals and sophisticated financial engineering to keep the taxman at bay \u2014 poses a simple question:Are those who have benefited the most from the economy\u2019s bounty prepared to do anything more to improve the nation\u2019s meager social standing and allow their fellow citizens to share in America\u2019s riches?Advertisement"}

Even grocery stores are snatching up bona fide pastry chefs.Yet, according to Mr. Pfeiffer and 10 other chefs and restaurateurs, the salaries of pastry makers in the Chicago area do not appear to have budged much, if at all. The key to this puzzle tells us a lot about why the American economy isn\u2019t necessarily behaving the way workers have traditionally assumed.Employers, according to those in the industry, have increasingly turned to less experienced workers to ensure the flow of sweets. In effect, they are creating their own pastry chefs like so many tart shells rather than paying a premium to hire them fully formed.The strategy isn\u2019t unique to the culinary world. In many booming sectors, employers have an underappreciated capacity to slow the upward march of wages by hiring less credentialed candidates.A company looking for a web developer \u2014 an occupation whose numbers have increased by about one-quarter during the three most recent years for which there are government data \u2014 could pay well into the six figures for top talent, or it could pay in the mid-five figures.\u201cI worked for a European wedding cake maker,\u201d she said, \u201cwho was adamant that you didn\u2019t deserve to think of yourself as a pastry chef until you put in 10 years as an apprentice.\u201dMr. Emanuel, who previously was President Obama\u2019s chief of staff, helped lure the James Beard Awards, akin to the Oscars for the food industry, to Chicago. Next spring will be the third consecutive year the city has hosted them.Along the way, said Sam Toia of the Illinois Restaurant Association, there has been a significant increase in chef-driven restaurants, the sort of establishments whose chefs would sooner cut out their tongues than outsource their dessert offerings.And yet Mr. Shields\u2019s case illustrates how restaurants have managed to keep salaries in check. Instead of hiring a pastry chef who spent years honing her skills, he chose to hire a pair of sous-chefs in their mid-20s for each restaurant. He pays them about $35,000 a year. Mr. Shields, a longtime savory chef who did a tour at the famed Chicago restaurant Alinea, and his wife and business partner, Karen Urie Shields, a former executive pastry chef at another noted Chicago eatery, Charlie Trotter\u2019s, conceptualize the desserts. The two younger chefs execute them.Mr. Shields and other restaurateurs say there is a strong economic imperative at work. In a low-margin service business like food, it is difficult to pay high salaries to a worker who is involved in only a limited aspect of the restaurant\u2019s menu. \u201cPaying someone $55,000 per year is a big venture,\u201d he said. (For the Shieldses, the rationale is even more creative than it is economic: Their pastry vision could clash with that of a more experienced chef.)Although both of Mr. Shields\u2019s young pastry chefs have committed to staying for two years, the pay means that the Shieldses may not be able to keep them for much longer. \u201cEveryone is looking for somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone might say, \u2018Why do I want to make $35,000 at this place when I could go make $75,000 working for Whole Foods?\u2019 \u201d (A Whole Foods spokeswoman said the company generally paid salaries in that range only for those who oversaw desserts across multiple stores.)Many restaurateurs have adopted some variation of the Shieldses\u2019 strategy, meeting their pastry needs by throwing younger and less experienced people at the job. In an extreme case, they simply pull a cook off the savory line and rechristen him the pastry chef.For the profession, the downside is that it can be hard to scratch out a middle-class living. Even during the current expansionary frenzy, pay for pastry line-cooks in the Chicago area hovers in the same $10 to $15 an hour that it has for years. Sous-chefs make a bit more, as in Mr. Shields\u2019s operation, while executive pastry chefs typically command $35,000 to $60,000 a year, depending on the restaurant\u2019s size and profitability, versus a salary in the high five figures for a top savory chef.The upside for young pastry chefs is that rigorous training at a top-flight restaurant like Mr. Shields\u2019s can lead to a position earning considerably more, like overseeing desserts for a large restaurant group or hotel, where they can typically make $70,000 or $80,000 a year.And major opportunities for talented chefs can come relatively early in their careers.On a Wednesday in late September, Ms. Spurlin, 28, was busy preparing a vegan curry squash tart whose richness came from a mix of coconut milk and creamed cashews, for a tasting with some of the restaurant\u2019s staff members.The chocolate chip cookies she had been refining for the better part of a month were finally coming along \u2014 the breakthrough was caramelizing the butter \u2014 but she said she was having trouble finding a spot in the restaurant where her sourdough starter would rise, given its sensitivity to temperature.At this, she pulled out a plastic bin full of starter labeled \u201cClint Yeastwood.\u201d \u201cMost bakers name their starters,\u201d she confided.Pastry traditionalists fret over the willingness of restaurateurs to rely on the young and inexperienced.Mr. Galzin, the Nashville restaurateur, complained that young pastry chefs too often concocted elaborate creations before they had mastered the basics. \u201cPeople feel like they can skip some of the fundamentals of pastry,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rosemary caramel \u2014 you want to add rosemary but your caramel sucks in the first place.\u201dOn one hand, he and his fellow practitioners of progressive gastronomy, who blur the lines between sweet and savory dishes, often find the idea of a separate pastry chef restrictive and even contrived.On the other? \u201cI really love the idea of someone that\u2019s dedicated to their craft, dedicated to the practice of pastry,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to come back into the fold really soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Carney has been called upon to resign by some politicians who support an exit from the European Union, or Brexit. They argued that Mr. Carney politicized the bank ahead of the June 23 vote on whether to leave.Mr. Carney will now most likely stay as head of the central bank through the final negotiations by Britain on its exit from the 28-nation bloc.\u201cThis should help contribute to securing an orderly transition to the U.K.\u2019s new relationship with Europe,\u201d Mr. Carney said in his letter.On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May expressed her support for the central bank chief, before meeting with him later in the day.Ms. May has pledged to activate Article 50 \u2014 the two-year process under which Britain will formally leave the European Union \u2014 by the end of March.The central bank is expected to unveil within days its latest monetary policy decision and provide an updated forecast for inflation.The bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep interest rates steady when it announces its decision on Thursday.Mr. Carney was praised in the days after the referendum for acting as a steadying force after David Cameron stepped down as prime minister and there was a battle for leadership of the ruling Conservative Party.In August, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain\u2019s economy over fears that Brexit could weigh on growth. The rate had remained steady at 0.5 percent since March 2009.But the British economy has performed better than expected since the June referendum.Last week, the Office of National Statistics said that gross domestic product grew at a 0.5 percent rate between July and September, ahead of forecasts by economists.That has led some politicians who favored Brexit to renew their calls for Mr. Carney\u2019s departure.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Europe and Asia Hoard Cash, Economists See Echoes of Crisis", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byEuropean and Asian investors have been rushing into the United States bond market, spurred by a global glut of savings that has reached record levels.Running from near-zero interest rates at home, foreign buyers are piling into the booming market for corporate bonds, including high-grade debt securities issued by the likes of IBM and General Electric and riskier fare churned out by energy and telecommunications companies.A growing number of economists are concerned that this flood of money may inflate the value of these securities well beyond what they are worth, potentially leading to a market bubble that eventually bursts.More broadly, however, these economists fear that an excess of ready cash in Europe and Asia is on the rise, which could keep a damper on global growth prospects.That is because the cash, instead of being spent on building bridges in, say, Germany, or individual shopping sprees in China and Japan, is accumulating and being recycled into global capital markets, keeping interest rates artificially low as investors chase after returns.And again, economists say, the burden is placed on the United States, with its still fragile economy, to be the growth engine for the world.\u201cAsia and Europe keep exporting their savings to the rest of the world,\u201d said Brad W. Setser, an expert in global financial flows who worked at the United States Treasury from 2011 to 2015. \u201cAll this money sloshing around looking for a home is not healthy \u2014 it indicates a real lack of demand in other parts of the global economy.\u201dThe surge in flows echoes a wave of investment in the years right before the financial crisis, when mostly European investors snapped up billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities before the American housing market imploded.The current numbers are also arresting.According to Mr. Setser\u2019s figures, about $750 billion of private money has poured into the United States in the last two years alone. About $500 billion, he calculates, reflects European and Asian investors buying United States Treasury securities, bonds issued by Fannie Mae and debt issued by American companies.The rest comes from American institutional investors unloading their zero-returning European bonds and looking for some extra yield closer to home.\u201cThere is a glut, and the glut isn\u2019t healthy,\u201d Mr. Setser said.There are economic theories that daze and confuse, thanks to their opacity. And then there are a few that define a moment in time by explaining why asset markets overreach and implode.Mr. Bernanke cautioned that an accumulating cash pile in fast-growing countries like China was keeping global interest rates low and steering money into risky investments.Within months, investment banks in the United States began their death march as the once-soaring market for mortgage securities collapsed.Over time it became accepted in academic and policy circles that the global savings glut that Mr. Bernanke had described played a crucial role in the boom and eventual bust of the housing bubble in the United States.Now, nearly a decade after Mr. Bernanke\u2019s warning, Mr. Setser and others are making the case that this cash pile is as large and dangerous as ever, driven by a persistent rise in excess savings in China and elsewhere in Asia, and in Europe, with Germany leading the way.Not everyone subscribes to the savings glut theory, of course, especially not those nations that are sitting atop these piles of cash and facing pressure to take action, as Germany is.Still, the total sum of the savings glut is a stunning number \u2014 $1.2 trillion \u2014 a bit above what it was in 2007 when Mr. Bernanke warned about it. Three-quarters of it comes from China and other Asian dynamos.The rest comes from large savers in Northern European countries like Germany and the Netherlands, replacing oil producers in the Middle East that have seen their cash piles erode with the decrease in oil prices.In 2005, when Mr. Bernanke introduced the thought that there could be a downside to all this saving overseas, the American housing market was still robust and his remarks did not quite resonate.It is easy to see why, given that the problem, as outlined by Mr. Bernanke, was not having too much debt, but having too much cash.Past global blowups, like Mexico\u2019s in 1994, and Southeast Asia\u2019s in 1997 and 1998, were often stories of fast-growing economies running up debt and then running out of money.Now, Mr. Bernanke was proposing, the danger was that these and similar nations were safeguarding cash by increasing exports and not investing as much as they should, with the result being a savings surge.Recently, criticism has been directed toward large developed economies like Germany and other big savers in Europe like the Netherlands for allowing their current-account surpluses \u2014 essentially a country\u2019s cash on hand after investments \u2014 to increase more than fourfold since the financial crisis, to $488 billion today.But Mr. Setser in his paper contends that the sharp upswing in East Asian surpluses has been less noticed.That is because, he says, even with China\u2019s tremendous investment binge during recent years, its savings rate is still near 50 percent \u2014 which is just too high a level for the world economy.\u201cThis is a big problem,\u201d said Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University who was recognized for his early warnings about the 2008 crisis. \u201cThere is no way to force those who are oversaving to spend more.\u201dAll of which hangs like a pall over the global economy, depressing interest rates and prospects for growth.\u201cBernanke is even more right than he was in 2005 and 2007,\u201d Mr. Setser said.While no one is saying yet that the flood of investment has created an asset bubble similar to that of 2008, market participants accept that certain corners of the market, like junk bonds, have had a very nice ride of late.Ken Monaghan, who oversees high-yield bonds for the global fund manager Amundi Smith Breeden, says that he is seeing a surge in interest from Asian and European insurance companies and pension funds \u2014 many of them conservative clients not known for dabbling in these sorts of securities.\u201cIt has really caused spreads to move,\u201d he said, using Wall Street jargon to describe what happens when the interest rates of these bonds decrease as investors pile in. \u201cWe are seeing institutional investors come to us and ask for levels of risk that they have never asked for before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At his rallies, Latino immigrants are cast as an invasion that needs to be stopped because it is transforming the face of America too profoundly, too quickly.The implicit point of his campaign theme \u2014 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2014 is that America was great when it was a less diverse nation and that resurrecting that era will require drastic measures. While this has resonated with some white Americans, disaffected by social changes and an uneven economic recovery, it has offended and frightened Latinos, one of the fastest-growing segments of the electorate.Whether stoking xenophobia turns out to be a genius or a disastrous move by a presidential candidate who has defied all the laws of political gravity will depend on how many of the 27 million eligible Hispanic voters turn out in November.In a tight race, a resounding Latino showing could flip battleground states for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and change how political parties perceive and engage with Hispanic voters in the future. That would affirm that Latinos are shaping the destiny of a nation that has always become stronger by embracing newcomers.Presidential campaigns have been courting Latino voters since John F. Kennedy made a strong effort to woo Mexican-Americans during his 1960 White House run, which he narrowly won. Since then, Latinos, an electorate that is rapidly diversifying as it grows, have continued to lean Democratic in presidential elections, but have turned out in low numbers.Mr. Trump obliterated any chance that would happen by making the demonization of Mexican immigrants a centerpiece of a campaign that has catapulted white supremacy into the mainstream of American politics. He has also vilified Muslims and spoken ignorantly and contemptuously about African-Americans.In addition to defeating a bully, Latinos have plenty of reasons to enthusiastically support Mr. Trump\u2019s main rival.While immigration reform will no doubt entail a tough political fight, Latinos could make the prospect of an overhaul more likely by going to the polls in November. Low turnout among these voters would increase the likelihood of a Trump victory, which could mean mass deportations and more attacks on immigrants.America\u2019s 56 million Latinos \u2014 one third of whom are under 18 \u2014 are helping to shape America\u2019s future in classrooms, workplaces and neighborhoods. It is only a matter of time before their mark on the nation\u2019s politics matches their contributions in other spheres.That moment should start now.Leer en espa\u00f1ol (Read in Spanish)Advertisement"}

But Wallonia\u2019s economy has stagnated in recent decades, as its steel mills have closed down, like those of the American Rust Belt and of northern England; the region has lost ground to Dutch-speaking Flanders.The stagnation has opened the door to trade skeptics like Mr. Wiertz, who argue that the deck is stacked against them.Global competition has squeezed small businesses dry, said Mr. Wiertz, a fifth-generation farmer.\u201cWe now produce milk at the world price,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly big multinationals can afford to do that, but they don\u2019t pay their fair share of taxes, or they take their capital abroad.\u201dWallonia, to be sure, does not speak for all of Belgium.

{"Headline": "If Immigration Can\u2019t Be Stopped, Maybe It Can Be Managed", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneCan anything be done about illegal immigration?Donald J. Trump\u2019s proposal to end illegal immigration \u2014 to build a supposedly impregnable wall \u2014 is a fake solution. For all intents and purposes, the wall is already there: a fence across large stretches of the southwestern border complemented by drones, sensors and a small army of agents.Maybe the answer, instead, lies in another direction. Rather than building a bigger wall, it consists of opening a door in the wall we have. The best way to stop illegal immigration may be for Mexico and the United States to create a legal path for low-skill Mexicans seeking work in the United States.\u201cWhen I hear \u2018Secure the border,\u2019 I think that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not the solution,\u201d said Carlos Gutierrez, who was commerce secretary under President George W. Bush. \u201cWe need laws that enable us to get the immigrant workers we need for the economy to work and do it in a legal way that doesn\u2019t require employers to resort to a black market.\u201dThis might sound like a giveaway to employers seeking to undercut American workers with cheap foreign labor. Neither major party presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton or Mr. Trump, is very likely to embrace the approach in the homestretch of the presidential campaign. And yet it deserves a hearing. In more than half a century, it is the only strategy that has worked.The idea has been tested before, from the 1940s to the 1960s, under what came to be known as the Bracero Program, named for a Spanish term for laborer who works with his arms. At its peak in the late 1950s, it provided more than 400,000 temporary work visas a year to people from Mexico, most of them employed on farms. Not coincidentally, from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, apprehensions of Mexicans crossing the border unlawfully \u2014 a rough measure of rises and falls in illegal immigration \u2014 plummeted to near zero.Now a group of scholars and policy makers that includes Mr. Gutierrez; Ernesto Zedillo, a former president of Mexico; Eliseo Medina, a Mexican union leader; Silvestre Reyes, a former congressman from Texas and Border Patrol chief; and Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, have come together to pitch a similar framework as the only viable strategy to end illegal immigration for good.History suggests that the United States cannot eliminate immigration of low-skilled workers. But the nation can choose what kind of low-skilled immigration it will have, legal or illegal. The former seems undoubtedly better. Legal flows can be managed to the maximum advantage of the economies and workers of Mexico and the United States. Unauthorized flows cannot.Then came the next big immigration law change, during the Reagan administration in 1986. Some 28 million immigrants had arrived illegally in the United States since the end of the Bracero Program, and 23.5 million had left, leaving a net undocumented population of some 4.5 million.After legalizing three million of them, the Immigration Control and Reform Act also tried to close the border to future flows by threatening to fine employers who hired unauthorized workers. But by 1990, more unauthorized immigrants were in the United States than had been before the change in 1986.Critics of guest workers have a point. The Bracero Program was deeply flawed. Abuses by employers who routinely violated agreements on wages, safety, housing and the like were widespread. Workers were helpless, bound to a single employer. Though theoretically they could complain of mistreatment, in practice the procedure was useless.As the \u201cBlueprint\u201d points out, though, these problems can be fixed, especially in a bilateral program managed jointly by Mexico and the United States. It proposes a long list of provisions: Employers in the United States and labor recruitment companies in Mexico would have to apply for certification from their respective governments. Immigrant workers would be protected by American labor law, free to change employers within broad sectors of the economy. Jobs and workers would be matched transparently in a public database managed by American immigration authorities.Employers would have to pay a fee to recruit Mexican migrants, which would encourage them to hire American workers first. Part of workers\u2019 pay would be withheld in a saving account to be drawn from after they returned to Mexico. And the visa quota for migrant workers would vary annually to fit changing labor market conditions.These ideas do not amount to comprehensive immigration reform. The authors say nothing of what to do about 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Nor do they deal with illegal immigrants from other countries.Proposing a large new program for guest workers might sound crazy in the current political environment. Just hear the roar of approval that greets Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for a \u201cbig and beautiful wall.\u201d Many labor unions remain highly skeptical that the United States needs any guest workers at all. Temporary migrant workers, they argue, are devices used by employers to undercut wages.This criticism seems off the mark, though. Opponents judge the effects of visa programs for migrant workers by comparing them with an alternative reality with no migration, rather than by comparing them with large-scale unlawful migration. \u201cHistory since has given reason to question that perspective,\u201d the \u201cBlueprint\u201d states.\u201cIt is a difficult political lift, but we\u2019ve tried other ways for half a century,\u201d said Michael Clemens of the Center for Global Development, the chief writer of the \u201cBlueprint.\u201d Barring legal immigrant workers will not protect American workers. But it will ensure that illegal immigration persists.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Dangerous \u2018China Fantasy\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s, American business executives and political leaders of both parties repeatedly put forward what I label the \u201cChina fantasy\u201d: the view that trade, foreign investment and increasing prosperity would lead to political liberalization in the world\u2019s most populous country.\u201cTrade freely with China, and time is on our side,\u201d said President George W. Bush. He was merely echoing his Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton, who called the opening of China\u2019s political system \u201cinevitable, just as inevitably the Berlin Wall fell.\u201dTo say the least, things in China haven\u2019t turned out that way.Over the past few years, the Chinese regime has become ever less tolerant of political dissent \u2014 to such an extent that, these days, American leaders have become far more reluctant to make claims about China\u2019s political future or the impact on it of trade and investment. The \u201cChina fantasy\u201d got the dynamics precisely wrong: Economic development, trade and investment have yielded greater political repression and a more closed political system.This amounts to a new China paradigm: an intensely internationalized yet also intensely repressive one-party state. China provides the model that other authoritarian regimes, from Russia to Turkey to Egypt, may seek to replicate. As a result, the United States will find itself struggling with this new China paradigm again and again in the coming years.In using the word \u201crepression,\u201d I am talking about organized political activity, not private speech. Visitors to China are sometimes surprised to find that cabdrivers, tour guides or old friends may speak to them with candor, even about political subjects. However, what such people can\u2019t do is to form an organization independent of the Chinese Communist Party or take independent action to try to change anything.Indeed, over the past two years the Chinese government has been moving in new ways against people and institutions that might, even indirectly, provide support for independent political activity. It has tightened the rules for nongovernmental organizations. More recently, it has been arresting Chinese lawyers. It has also been staging televised confessions, a practice reminiscent of Stalin\u2019s show trials.Why is it that trade and investment have led to a Chinese regime that represses dissent more than it did five, 10 or 20 years ago? The answer, put simply, is that the regime thinks it needs to do so, can do so and has fewer outside constraints inhibiting it from doing so.First, it needs to because as the economy develops and grows more complex, Chinese citizens are having new grievances of the sort that would otherwise lead to organized political activity. Environmental problems have multiplied. Consumers worry about product safety (tainted milk, for example) and accidents (like train wrecks). And at least to educated Chinese, internet censorship can be an annoyance, if not an insult.Second, China\u2019s security apparatus has a much greater capacity to repress dissent than it did in the past. Technology gives it greater capacity to control both physical space (the streets) and cyberspace (the internet).Finally, the world\u2019s increased commercial involvement with China over the past two decades has made foreign leaders more reluctant to do anything in response to Chinese crackdowns, lest the Chinese regime retaliate. This is in large part a problem of perception: In fact, the Chinese regime cares about its standing in the world and would seek to avoid international condemnation if world leaders took stronger stands and worked together.Almost forgotten now is that in the 1990s, the United States, possessing far greater economic leverage in dealing with China than it has today, threatened trade restrictions if Beijing did not improve the human rights climate. After intense debate, the Clinton administration eventually backed away from threats to limit trade with China.The aftermath of that debate was disastrous. American leaders overreacted by deciding to avoid any further strong actions in support of human rights in China. Instead, they offered the \u201cChina fantasy\u201d: the idea that change would come inevitably.At one point, giving voice to the optimism and the false assumptions about how trade would liberalize China, President Clinton told China\u2019s president, Jiang Zemin, at a Washington news conference, \u201cYou\u2019re on the wrong side of history.\u201d History, however, is rendering its own judgment \u2014 that America\u2019s confidence in the political impact of trade with China was woefully misplaced.Looking forward, we are obliged to deal with a China capable of moving endlessly from one crackdown to another, no longer interrupted by the occasional easings or \u201cBeijing Springs\u201d of the past. It will be a different China, in which educated, middle-class people may be less loyal, but their views also less influential.What we can do is to keep expressing as forcefully as possible the values of political freedom and the right to dissent. Democratic governments around the world need to collaborate more often in condemning Chinese repression \u2014 not just in private meetings but in public as well. We should also find new ways to single out and penalize individual Chinese officials involved in repression. Why should there be a one-way street in which Chinese leaders send their own children to America\u2019s best schools, while locking up lawyers at home?The Chinese regime is not going to open up because of our trade with it. The \u201cChina fantasy\u201d amounted to both a conceptual failure and a strategic blunder. The next president will need to start out afresh.James Mann, a resident fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and former Beijing bureau chief for The Los Angeles Times, is the author of \u201cThe China Fantasy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump in April: If I Lose, \u2018I\u2019ll Let It All Out\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byNotebookTrump has never been shy with his opinions about his fellow Republicans, but his lashing out at Ryan was notable, not least because five months ago Trump had all but deputized Ryan to be his economy czar. On May 12, just after he had wrapped up the nomination, Trump met in a Republican National Committee conference room with Ryan and the R.N.C. chairman, Reince Priebus. Ryan wanted to brief Trump on pending federal budgetary issues. Knowing that Trump did not share his enthusiasm for fiscal minutiae, Ryan kept his usual 20-minute presentation to less than half that. He shared with Trump a sheaf of charts relating to unfunded liabilities, the long-term debt problem and the growing share of mandatory spending in federal outlays.Barely five minutes into Ryan\u2019s monologue, Trump cut him off. According to an individual familiar with the conversation, the Republican nominee said that Ryan obviously knew what he was talking about and would therefore be in charge of managing \u201cthis stuff\u201d in a Trump administration.This lack of concern for the fine print, or even the not-so-fine kind, has always been one of the most divisive features of Trump\u2019s now-embattled candidacy, refreshing to his supporters and appalling to most everyone else. Immediately following the third debate, a CNN/ORC poll found that by a margin of 59 to 35, people found that Clinton was better prepared to handle the presidency than Trump. For all of his authoritarian impulses, Trump has sent signals that in the increasingly unlikely event of his election next month, his would be the most outsourced presidency in recent memory. His disinterest in policy intricacies was evident in all three debates.But it\u2019s not even clear whether Trump would find the overall experience of being the nation\u2019s chief executive all that interesting. On a plane ride back from a campaign stop in Buffalo this April, Trump volunteered to me that what would interest him most as president, \u201cother than jobs,\u201d would be \u201cdealing with foreign leaders. I really look forward to doing that.\u201d Creating jobs and negotiating with his counterparts are, arguably, the two skills Trump would be bringing from his experience as a developer. Other than building a wall \u2014 another throwback, perhaps, to the brick-and-mortar pursuits of his prior life \u2014 it has been difficult to imagine much else that would animate a President Trump.Trump\u2019s defenders maintain that as president he would be a big-picture chief executive who delegates the grubby mechanics of governance to like-minded professionals from the private sector. That argument might be more persuasive if professionalism were the hallmark of Trump\u2019s campaign operation. Because it isn\u2019t, the odds that we will ever get to see which executive model would prevail in a Trump administration are fast shrinking.The single most frequently uttered phrase in the Trump universe\u2019s lexicon is \u201cone hundred percent.\u201d It is blurted out with Pavlovian reliability by the candidate, by his two eldest sons, by his top lieutenants in the Trump Organization, by his campaign aides. \u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d of course, connotes certitude, round-the-clock commitment, totality, crystal clarity, perfection. It seldom represents reality as we know it \u2014 except in Trump World, where bravado is fact and the absolute maximum is an everyday achievement.Trump has traveled a great distance on the wings of his soaring self-regard. He may blame a \u201crigged\u201d system for his woes now, but his entire political trajectory has been aided and abetted by rigging of various sorts: politicians hungry for a big donation, reporters lunging toward a quotable celebrity. Perhaps he knew all along that his run would not last, that this was (to coin a Trump-ism) a big league to which he did not finally belong. Back in early April, when the riggers consisted primarily of establishment Republicans, the candidate acknowledged to me that his chances of winning were well short of one hundred percent. Being a realist did not mean that he would take defeat gracefully. \u201cEither I\u2019ll win and I\u2019ll be a terrific president,\u201d he said, \u201cor I\u2019ll lose, and I\u2019ll let it all out.\u201dRobert Draper is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

(If you want to see how hard it is, try clicking on the robotic mussel in the photo above.)\u201cIt\u2019s a problem finding them again,\u201d said Brian Helmuth, a professor of marine science and public policy at Northeastern University, \u201cbecause they do look so much like mussels.\u201dThe robotic mussels, which were devised about 18 years ago by Dr. Helmuth, contain little thermometers and data loggers that record the temperature every 10 minutes, approximating the internal temperature of the actual mussels nearby.Dr. Helmuth describes these mussels as an example of \u201cbiomimicry,\u201d a relatively new field of science that uses natural processes, structures and strategies to deal with human problems.The battery powered mussels, nestled in beds from Canada to Chile and from Oregon to New Zealand, provide greater insight into the thermal stresses being placed on various organisms by climate change, Dr. Helmuth said. The data undermines the widely held theory that only animals and plants living at the edges (southern in the Northern Hemisphere, northern in the Southern Hemisphere) of a habitat will be most affected by rising temperatures, causing them to die off or migrate. Instead, species in various \u201chot spots,\u201d as he calls them, are likely to be affected by a warming world, too.Instead, Dr. Helmuth said, the temperatures that he and his team have gathered show that mussels can experience daily fluctuations of as much as 20 degrees Celsius, or about 36 degrees Fahrenheit,even at sites well within the species\u2019 natural range. On the Oregon coast, for example, low tide, when the mussels are not covered by water, is frequently in the middle of the day, and in the summer warming midday air and water temperatures there put more stress on the mussels.Dr. Helmuth said the thermometers take temperatures as the mussels experience them \u2014 the sun shining directly over the water, wind rippling the surface \u2014 to get a better idea of how these animals are reacting to a changing climate. He notes that mussels are the most reliable indicator of how the ecosystem as a whole may be doing.\u201cMussels, they\u2019re basically like trees,\u201d he said. \u201cThey create the environment for all the other organisms, and what happens to the mussels happens to the whole intertidal ecosystem.\u201dThey are also important to local economies, especially in Asia and Europe, Dr. Helmuth said, where people may consume more mussels than they do in the United States. As a result, Dr. Helmuth and his team, which includes more than 50 authors from different institutions around the world, have begun to put mussel robots in beds in Israel, Italy and elsewhere in the Mediterranean.Dr. Helmuth said that he hoped this data would indicate that the current theory about the stresses on different organisms because of climate change, and their potential die-offs and migrations, was incomplete.\u201cWe\u2019re past the point where we can keep talking in generalizations,\u201d Dr. Helmuth said, adding that generalizations have not helped scientists and others determine the risks to particular ecosystems.\u201cYou won\u2019t know where to look if you only look from the point of view of a human,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will the Next President Face a Recession? Don\u2019t Assume So", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceThe economic expansion that has been underway in the United States since 2009 is getting old, and soon will die.At least that\u2019s the conclusion you would reach from various news media prognostications about the economic environment the next president will face.It\u2019s tempting to think of an economic expansion as being like a life span. The older you get, the closer you are to death; a 95-year-old probably has fewer years left to live than a 60-year-old. But this year Glenn D. Rudebusch, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, looked at the evidence from post-World War II United States economic expansions, and did not find that pattern held up at all.Expansions don\u2019t die of old age. They die because something specific killed them. It can be a wrong-footed central bank, the popping of a financial bubble or a shock from overseas. But age itself isn\u2019t the problem.A look around the world also shows plenty of examples of expansions that have lasted a lot longer than either the seven years the current United States expansion has been underway or the longest expansion in American history, from 1991 to 2001.Will a President Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump face a serious economic downturn or a recession in the next four years? Quite possibly. The Federal Reserve could make a mistake, either raising interest rates too quickly, and stopping the expansion in its tracks, or raising them too slowly, and then needing to move abruptly to combat inflation. A new financial crisis could emerge; some shock we can\u2019t even imagine might stop this expansion cold.There is a decent argument that the United States economy is more susceptible to recession now than it has been for most of the last several decades, for two reasons.First, growth has been around 2 percent a year, below the 3 to 4 percent that was commonplace in the second half of the 20th century. That means there is less of a growth cushion. It takes a smaller negative shock to pull the economy into contraction territory.But those are separate issues from the more general idea that \u201cwe\u2019re due\u201d for a recession, and they\u2019re also issues that have been present for all seven years of the current expansion.It\u2019s true that we\u2019re closer to the arrival of the next recession than we were a year ago. But that\u2019s tautological. We\u2019re also a year closer to the destruction of Earth by the sun, or to a Cleveland Browns Super Bowl title.And there\u2019s no particular reason to think either of those are going to happen during the next presidential administration either.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s the \u201ccap\u201d part. The goal of reducing carbon emissions should be, well, to reduce carbon emissions, not to produce revenue.California\u2019s economywide cap-and-trade system, in a much larger economy than Washington State\u2019s, makes more sense.

{"Headline": "Can Colombia Overcome Fear to Achieve Peace?", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCartagena de Indias, Colombia \u2014 The president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, reacted to his defeat in Sunday\u2019s peace deal plebiscite by calling on all sides, and especially former President \u00c1lvaro Uribe, to open a dialogue that eventually would lead back to the negotiating table.Even if this happens, an acceptable version of the peace agreement between the government and the guerrillas \u2014 the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC \u2014 is uncertain. It will mean redefining the terms of the pact between leaders with opposing views of Colombia\u2019s future.The vote was not just against 297 pages of hard-to-read small print and a discredited FARC, but also against a president who has seen his popularity plummet, undermined in part by the relentless opposition of Mr. Uribe, his former ally. This has been a key obstacle, though not always a visible one, in the search for peace these past four years. The war is not only against the FARC; it is also a struggle inside Colombia\u2019s political elites. And although the FARC has promised not to break the bilateral cease-fire, if the opponents of peace refuse to compromise, they risk driving the guerrillas back to armed conflict and drug trafficking, leaving the country\u2019s poorest regions mired in violence.Within months of Mr. Santos\u2019s inauguration in 2010, Mr. Uribe began to attack the new president. He accused Mr. Santos of treason for abandoning his security policy. The main tool he used was Twitter, criticizing the Santos administration daily to his 4.5 million followers. His favorite strategy was to question any peace talks with the unpopular guerrilla forces, claiming the dialogue was a step back for democracy and security. The president, Mr. Uribe argued, had surrendered to \u201cCastro-Chavismo,\u201d referring to the alliance between the Cuban and Venezuelan governments. This unyielding vilification machine helped Mr. Uribe rebuild his political brand, shape public opinion and inflict enduring damage to his successor\u2019s image.In addition to allowing him to stoke latent fears of a society suffering from 50 years of internal armed conflict, the peace agreement gave Mr. Uribe an opportunity to exploit the feelings of conservative Catholics and Protestants, who have been upset with the president\u2019s liberal attitude on issues such as same-sex marriage and campaigns that foster tolerance toward L.G.B.T. people. In other words, the peace agreement also became the target of those who feared the efforts to build a more open and progressive society.Mr. Santos has been unable to capitalize on the substantial improvements in security achieved over the past few years under his administration. He did a poor job in selling the most controversial aspects of the agreement, such as transitional justice for the guerrillas, military members and civilians involved in human rights violations. As a consequence, the political environment during the plebiscite campaign was marked by severe polarization and distrust fanned by threatening rumors spread through social networks.With this new crisis, civil society, particularly a younger generation committed to peace, will call for securing the advances made by years of careful negotiations. The guerrillas must not return to terrorism. Peace must be established in the poorest regions most affected by violence. There must be no more victims.Yet the coming negotiations will be extraordinarily challenging because the guerrillas may make new demands, because the government negotiating team is worn out, and because the deal could become a battleground in the struggle for power in the 2018 elections. The negotiations could also lead to more complicated, hard-to-predict outcomes, such as a call for a constituent assembly to broaden the scope of the accords, which is favored by the FARC and seemingly by Mr. Uribe. A new process would be an opportunity for him to include other themes in the debate, such as education, gender equality and presidential re-election. If Mr. Uribe ultimately succeeds, he may finally find a way to return to office.The electorate\u2019s rejection of the peace agreement could lead to a profound political crisis and even bring to a halt the tax reforms needed for funding the peace process. Nonetheless, we should appreciate the concrete achievements made so far. While previous negotiations were marred by violence, there were no deaths this time around. International sponsorship, and the backing of the armed forces, were crucial improvements. Now, to stay on the road to lasting peace, those who opposed the agreement have to be brought to the negotiating table. The FARC has reiterated its backing of the deal. Mr. Uribe has yet to agree to participate, but many of his allies have said that the negotiations need to continue.Colombia is evenly divided. If it cannot escape from polarization to reach political agreements, it will stagnate as a society, as an economy and as a democracy. The time has come to ask all political leaders to be generous and patriotic, to seek peace and negotiate, so that the war can finally come to an end. A peace agreement can be reached, with both Mr. Uribe and Mr. Santos in the picture, right next to the FARC.Jaime Abello Banfi is the director of the Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez Foundation for a New Ibero-American Journalism.

{"Headline": "In \u2018Gaining Currency,\u2019 a Look at China\u2019s Global Ambitions for Its Money", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported bySinosphereWhy is China reconsidering the role of its currency?China is increasing its dominance in the world economy. But there was a sense that China wasn\u2019t getting the respect that it felt it deserved. One of the manifestations of that was that its currency was not quite seen as an elite currency.Chinese policy makers, especially the more reformist-minded officials, recognized that China needs to do a lot of work to get its financial markets ready before the renminbi could become a prominent international currency. Of course, there is a lot of opposition to such reforms because the system worked well for a lot of politically and economically powerful people.About three or four years ago, these reformist-minded officials had a very important insight: If they could get the Chinese people and leadership to sign on to making the renminbi a great global currency, that could provide a very useful mechanism for getting around the opposition and putting in place a lot of reforms. Ultimately it would be good for China, no matter what happened to the currency.I view this as a sort of Trojan horse strategy.These serve a very positive role, but they must come from the right sources in the right fashion. When the U.S. Treasury or the I.M.F. tells China to allow its currency to appreciate, that is seen as something that is not necessarily in China\u2019s best interest.When it comes to matters where the West has some sort of prize to offer, that changes the dynamic. We\u2019ve seen some examples of that over the last year and a half. When China decided it wanted to get the renminbi into the I.M.F.\u2019s elite basket of currencies, it felt that this would be a great way of getting more prestige for its currency in one fell swoop. The I.M.F. and China came together and decided on a checklist of things that China needed to accomplish over the next year. That checklist turned out to be very useful particularly for the People\u2019s Bank of China [China\u2019s central bank] in pushing out its reforms.After the 2008 financial crisis, the United States pumped money into its financial system, which in effect lowered the value of China\u2019s vast holdings of American debt. How has that affected China\u2019s ambitions for its currency?Chinese are net creditors to the rest of the world. That is, the world owes China a lot more than China owes to the world. But the net income that China\u2019s earning \u2014 the amount paid by foreign investors minus the amount it pays out to foreign investors \u2014 is in fact negative. Foreign investors get pretty good returns in China. But China, because most of its foreign assets are in the form of U.S. Treasuries and the government securities of other advanced economies, is earning piddling rates of return.The fact that the U.S. dollar is so dominant in global finance, and also that the architecture of global finance is controlled by the U.S. and the Western economies, frustrates the Chinese. I think the Chinese feel that the system is stacked against them.It is surprisingly prevalent even among Chinese economists who are pro-reform. There is a good reason for that: If one takes economic theory and the practical experience of emerging market countries into consideration, China is doing it exactly the wrong way.The right way to do it is to make domestic financial markets more sound, improve regulatory frameworks and make the exchange rate more flexible so that it can act as a shock absorber. Then you can open up the capital account.But I think there\u2019s a logic to China\u2019s strategy. Opening up the capital account isn\u2019t just about money, because China doesn\u2019t need money from abroad. But what comes with the money is very important.One example is where the Chinese government brought in foreign strategic investors into its banks. In 2007, in particular, there was concern that there was no improvement being undertaken in the corporate and financial structure of the big state-owned banks. The idea was that those foreign investors in the banks will have an incentive to bring with them better corporate governance practices and better risk-management practices. So all these sort of collateral benefits that come with the capital are what China wants.The Chinese government prizes stability. Will it give up control?China represents a grand and fascinating experiment in managing these two fundamentally contradictory impulses: trying to let the markets work freely versus trying to maintain stability and control in the market. We see that in a variety of contexts, and the currency is no exception. The Chinese government would like the currency\u2019s value to be more market-determined because they see that as important in terms of increasing the renminbi\u2019s prominence.They view the stability of the currency as an important marker of their ability to manage the economy well. This is going to create a number of stumbles and missteps in the future, and indeed it already has.Should the world be concerned about China\u2019s growing financial ambitions?There is a positive view about this \u2014 that having China become more engaged with the international community is a good thing. Rather than saying that it is a developing country and should be handled by different standards, China might recognize that ultimately having good rules governing international trade and finance would be to its own benefit.But I think there was also a fear that China could end up parlaying its economic heft into a more strategic influence that then feeds into its somewhat expansionist tendencies. In the past, and in fact until fairly recently, China took a fairly brute-force approach, using its economic clout to gain economic and political influence.China is very effectively gaining what I like to think of as a multilateral sheen for its effort to build closer economic relationships with other countries.At a time when the political rhetoric in the U.S. is about disengaging and questioning traditional lines both economic and political, I think China stands ready to fill in the void. That is not intrinsically a bad thing. But we have to remember many of the values the U.S. in particular has fought for, or tried to expand, like supporting democratic forms of government, by-and-large free markets, freedom of expression and so on. All those are anathema to China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia, Where Even Milk Depends on Oil, Struggles to Remake Its Economy", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Secrets of the KingdomLow crude prices and the war in Yemen have sent a shock through the kingdom\u2019s budget and forced it to revise its social contract even as it seeks to diversify its businesses.Supported byAL KHARJ, Saudi Arabia \u2014 This is what it takes to run a mega-dairy in the scorching desert here: 180,000 Holstein cows, precisely cooled cowsheds, water pumped from deep underground, feed from Argentina and a state-of-the-art refrigeration system. To transport chilled milk and other products all over the Arabian Peninsula, add 9,000 vehicles.None other than the Saudi king\u2019s favored son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has held up the dairy, Almarai, as a model for a country trying to wean itself from oil dependence. But even companies like Almarai, with no apparent connection to petroleum, rely on the cheap energy provided by the kingdom.Prince Mohammed\u2019s plan for an economic overhaul has sent tremors through a nation whose citizens have long enjoyed a cosseted lifestyle underwritten by the state. \u201cThe government is moving very fast at reforming things in Saudi Arabia, while the people are finding themselves left behind,\u201d said Lama Alsulaiman, a businesswoman and board member of the Jidda Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \u201cLife as usual and business as usual can no longer continue.\u201dThe vast subterranean seas of petroleum here have seeped into almost every part of the Saudi economy. Crude oil does more than deliver billions of dollars in profits to Saudi Aramco, the state oil company, and Sabic, the chemical giant; it also buttresses energy-intensive sectors like cement production and aluminum smelting.Saudi Arabia burns barrel after barrel of crude oil for electricity, one of the few countries to do so in large quantities. Commercial air-conditioners cool shopping malls as temperatures outside soar past 100 degrees in the summer, and children go sledding at Snow City, a frigid new recreation center in the capital. Much of the drinking water needed to keep this desert nation alive comes from energy-draining desalination. And the S.U.V.s idling in Riyadh\u2019s enormous traffic snarls drain gasoline.Saudi Arabia\u2019s about-face last month at a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Algeria, agreeing to cut production to raise the price of crude, showed the urgency policy makers here are feeling. Prince Mohammed announced plans this year to sell off a small piece of the country\u2019s economic crown jewel, Saudi Aramco, to free up money for investment.The budget deficit was nearly $100 billion last year. The country\u2019s foreign reserves have dropped by a quarter since oil prices started falling in 2014. The government has taken loans from foreign banks and will try to borrow more from the global bond market.Hedge funds are wagering that the Saudi central bank will be forced to revalue its currency, the riyal. Zach Schreiber, the head of PointState Capital, which made $1 billion betting that oil would fall, told investors in May that the Saudi riyal was \u201cmassively overvalued\u201d and that the country had only \u201ctwo to three years of runway before it hits a wall.\u201dThe government has abruptly cut construction projects, forcing contractors to lay off workers. This year, foreign laborers set fire to buses in protests demanding months of back pay. The sudden jump in water bills this spring led to such an outcry on social media that the minister for water and electricity was fired after telling customers to dig their own wells if they were unhappy with prices.\u201cIf you\u2019re a Saudi, you\u2019ve grown up with that expectation of the financial largess that\u2019s dished out,\u201d said Adel Hamaizia, the vice chairman of the Oxford Gulf and Arabian Peninsula Studies Forum. \u201cThings are likely to get more difficult for the government in terms of managing frustration from the everyday people.\u201dAdding to the pressure, the kingdom\u2019s population has nearly doubled since 1990. With half of all Saudis younger than 25, the private sector does not offer enough good opportunities for the estimated 300,000 young people entering the work force each year, especially women. Fewer of the public sinecures that have sustained earlier generations are available, with plans for deeper cuts.Despite Saudi Arabia\u2019s image as a haven for Ferrari-driving sheikhs with stables full of racehorses, oil revenue is much lower per capita than in small states like Qatar or Kuwait. There is poverty in the kingdom as well as an increasingly anxious middle class.One evening last month, it was a stifling 99 degrees in Riyadh after sunset, with dust hanging in the air. Um Rashed Al-Rashed was selling jewelry and baskets of seeds at a small souk, hoping to supplement her husband\u2019s modest pension.\u201cThe prices are increasing for everything,\u201d Ms. Rashed said. The couple\u2019s electricity bill after the Ramadan holiday was so high they could no longer afford it, so the power was shut off. \u201cOnly a camel can live without electricity,\u201d she said.That would include expanding the country\u2019s mining industries to exploit gold, phosphate and uranium deposits, and building up the financial, technology and entertainment sectors. And while many countries declare that they will generate added revenue through tourism, only Saudi Arabia has Mecca, which more than 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide are instructed to visit on a pilgrimage before they die.Prince Mohammed gathered business leaders, government officials and even athletes and artists at the palatial Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh late last year to discuss the economic targets his team was developing. Consultants with tablet computers fanned out across the country, surveying Saudis to determine how far the government could pare back subsidies without setting off protests.After decades of rule by octogenarian kings, some young Saudis said in interviews that they felt energized by the role played by a prince from their generation. \u201cSubsidies should have been done a long time ago. Things are still so cheap,\u201d said Salman M. Al Suhaibaney, a Saudi entrepreneur, holding up his drink to demonstrate. \u201cThis bottle of water is more expensive than the same amount of gas.\u201dBut more public funds are needed right now to close the budget gap. The government has announced plans to more than triple non-oil revenue by 2020, starting with rising fees for visas, higher fines for traffic violations, and a sin tax on sugary drinks.Officials have seized on every opportunity to squeeze costs. After cutting pay for ministers, freezing hiring and curtailing regular bonuses and overtime for the entire public sector work force, the government announced last week that workers would be paid according to the Gregorian calendar (as in the United States and Europe), instead of the slightly shorter Islamic Hijri calendar, adding roughly one unpaid workday a month.\u201cIf your salary is going down and your costs are going up, something\u2019s got to give,\u201d said Mr. Hamaizia of the Oxford Gulf and Arabian Peninsula Studies Forum.Less spending by government, businesses and increasingly strapped consumers means less growth and fewer jobs. The only way to create more jobs for Saudis in such an environment may be by getting rid of foreign workers and replacing them with locals. That policy, known as Saudization, has been pursued at least since the early 1980s and always failed, with the number of foreign laborers ballooning from roughly one million to 10 million.The Almarai dairy employs 8,000 Saudis among its work force of more than 40,000. On a recent morning, 150 Holsteins moseyed into the milking parlor where workers from Kenya, the Philippines and elsewhere hooked them up to automated pumps. The business \u2014 which also produces yogurt and cheese and includes a bakery \u2014 has its own training academy for Saudis, drawing 15,000 applicants annually for just 400 slots.Prince Sultan bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Kabeer, a member of the extended Al Saud royal family and one of those rich Saudis with a stable of thoroughbreds, founded Almarai in 1977 with the help of Irish dairy farmers.\u201cWe try to keep it to a standard that if the prince wants to come in tomorrow with his friends, he\u2019s welcome,\u201d said Tony Gavin, the Irish manager of the largest Almarai dairy farm, in Al Kharj, southeast of Riyadh. Wearing brown shorts and Ray-Ban sunglasses, Mr. Gavin gave a tour of the sprawling farm.The cows rest under a cooling mist scattered by large fans, the temperature and quantity of water computer controlled. A nutritionist optimizes the cows\u2019 diet with cottonseed from Greece, sugar beet pellets from the Netherlands and locally grown alfalfa.But the government has dictated that dairies must phase out local feed production because water is so scarce. Despite its arid environment, Saudi Arabia once pursued large-scale farming, even becoming a wheat exporter before all but abandoning cultivation to save water. Almarai has bought farmland in Argentina, California and Arizona to produce alfalfa to ship here.Still, the business is getting squeezed. While utility and feed prices are rising, the dairy has not been allowed to raise the price of milk.\u201cWe\u2019ve tried in the past, and the king sort of tapped us on the shoulder and said, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019\u201d said Stuart Gouk, manufacturing manager at the plant here. Higher milk prices could have political repercussions.The kingdom\u2019s subsidy cutbacks are expected to deepen. There may well come a point where, as with wheat farming, policy makers will have to decide whether it really makes sense to produce milk in the desert.\u201cPeople who visit can\u2019t believe there are cow herds here,\u201d Mr. Gavin said, \u201cbut they never thought about where the milk comes from.\u201dSheikha al-Dosary contributed reporting from Riyadh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nations, Fighting Powerful Refrigerant That Warms Planet, Reach Landmark Deal", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 Negotiators from more than 170 countries on Saturday reached a legally binding accord to counter climate change by cutting the worldwide use of a powerful planet-warming chemical used in air-conditioners and refrigerators.The talks in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, did not draw the same spotlight as the climate change accord forged in Paris last year. But the outcome could have an equal or even greater impact on efforts to slow the heating of the planet.President Obama called the deal \u201can ambitious and far-reaching solution to this looming crisis.\u201dSecretary of State John Kerry, speaking to fellow negotiators in Kigali, said, \u201cIt is likely the single most important step we could take at this moment to limit the warming of our planet and limit the warming for generations to come.\u201d\u201cIt is,\u201d Mr. Kerry added, \u201cthe biggest thing we can do in one giant swoop.\u201dWhile the Paris agreement included pledges by nearly every country to cut emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the fossil fuels that power vehicles, electric plants and factories, the new Kigali deal has a single target: chemical coolants called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, used in air-conditioners and refrigerators.HFCs are just a small percentage of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but they function as a sort of supercharged greenhouse gas, with 1,000 times the heat-trapping potency of carbon dioxide.The Kigali deal was seven years in the making, and is a compromise between rich nations and poorer, hotter ones, including some where rising incomes are just starting to bring air-conditioners within reach. Wealthier nations will freeze production of HFCs more quickly than poorer countries, though some nations, including those in Africa, elected to phase the chemicals out more rapidly than required, citing the grave threats they face from climate change.While the Paris pledges are broad, they are also voluntary, often vague and dependent on the political will of future world leaders. In contrast, the Kigali deal includes specific targets and timetables to replace HFCs with more planet-friendly alternatives, trade sanctions to punish scofflaws, and an agreement by rich countries to help finance the transition of poor countries to the costlier replacement products.So, narrow as it is, the new accord may be more likely to yield climate-shielding actions by industry and governments, negotiators say. And given the heat-trapping power of HFCs, scientists say the Kigali accord will stave off an increase of atmospheric temperatures of nearly one degree Fahrenheit.That would be a major step toward averting an atmospheric temperature increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which many experts think the world will be locked into a future of rising sea levels, severe droughts and flooding, widespread food and water shortages, and more powerful hurricanes.Over all, the deal is expected to lead to the reduction of the equivalent of 70 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere \u2014 about two times the carbon pollution produced annually by the entire world.The Kigali accord is \u201cmuch, much, much stronger than Paris,\u201d said Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a research organization. \u201cThis is a mandatory treaty. Governments are obligated to comply.\u201dThe deal is an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the landmark 1987 pact designed to close the hole in the ozone layer by banning ozone-depleting coolants called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. That means the Kigali amendment maintains the legal force of a treaty, even if that treaty was ratified by the Senate during the Reagan administration.Chemical companies responded to the 1987 agreement by developing HFCs, which do not harm the ozone layer but do trap heat in the atmosphere.The Kigali deal came about in part because Mr. Obama, as he sought to build a legacy of tackling climate change, elevated the obscure effort to amend the Montreal Protocol to a top White House priority. The final agreement is also consistent with the president\u2019s efforts to push his climate change agenda while using creative ways to bypass a hostile Congress.Mr. Obama began paving the way to the HFC deal at a 2013 get-acquainted meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the Sunnylands golf estate in California. The two leaders agreed to make a deal to reduce the use of HFCs a priority, a major concession from China, the world\u2019s largest HFC producer.Since then, American and Chinese companies have increased production of HFC replacement chemicals, and major chemical makers in both countries stand to emerge as winners in the deal.Top officials from the chemical industry were in Kigali to push for the deal. \u201cOur industry is hard at work doing the research on the HFC alternatives,\u201d said Stephen Yurek, the chief executive of the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, an advocacy group. \u201cGetting that right is certainly as important as reaching agreement.\u201dThe Kigali amendment adds momentum to a series of new global climate change agreements. The Paris agreement entered into legal force this month, and governments from 190 countries adopted a deal to curb planet-warming emissions from the aviation industry.\u201cThis will be the trifecta of international climate agreements,\u201d said Andrew Light, a former State Department climate change negotiator. \u201cIt\u2019s just extraordinary.\u201dIn each case, the new climate deals have been criticized by scientists for being too weak, and together they do not add up to the solution to global warming. But each accord will make significant inroads on different parts of the problem.Negotiators in Kigali conceded that the final deal was much less stringent than some had originally hoped. The United States and other rich countries had pushed a plan that would freeze the use of the heat-trapping chemicals by 2021, reducing them to about 15 percent of 2012 HFC levels by 2046. That plan would have eliminated the equivalent of about 90 billion tons of carbon dioxide pollution from the atmosphere by 2050.The final deal will divide the world economy into three tracks. The richest countries, including the United States and those in the European Union, will freeze the production and consumption of HFCs by 2018, reducing them to about 15 percent of 2012 levels by 2036.Much of the rest of the world, including China, Brazil and all of Africa, will freeze HFC use by 2024, reducing it to 20 percent of 2021 levels by 2045.A small group of the world\u2019s hottest countries \u2014 India, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \u2014 will have the most lenient schedule, freezing HFC use by 2028 and reducing it to about 15 percent of 2025 levels by 2047.After arriving in Kigali on Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Gina McCarthy, and her counterparts spent hours locked in meetings, working on Excel spreadsheets to try to find a compromise. But no one could agree on the numbers. In contrast to many other environmental negotiations, it was possible for negotiators to calculate the exact effects of their proposals in real time, down to numbers of tons of planet-warming pollution avoided.\u201cIt became clear that to get everybody to the same place was not possible,\u201d Ms. McCarthy said. \u201cIt was not going to be a one size fits all.\u201dMr. Kerry arrived on Thursday, and his talks with officials from India, Pakistan and China went late and grew contentious.\u201cWe wanted a deal,\u201d said Shri Manoj Kumar Singh, an Indian negotiator. \u201cIndia is a hot country, a poor country, and we needed a deal that would work for us.\u201dAfter details were hashed out Friday night, the deal was gaveled in at 7 a.m., and the exhausted but exultant negotiators gathered for an impromptu Champagne breakfast.Environmental advocates and countries that had pushed for a more stringent deal still called the Kigali amendment a significant step forward.\u201cIt\u2019s a step toward ensuring the survival of our island,\u201d said Mattlan Zackhras, the climate change minister of the Marshall Islands, a low-lying Pacific nation threatened by rising seas. \u201cBut we need to take further steps.\u201dNegotiators noted that many of the hottest, poorest countries, including the entire African bloc, had decided not to join India on the least ambitious timetable, but rather signed on to the midlevel one. While most Africans lack air-conditioning, African negotiators said rapidly battling climate change was a higher priority.\u201cAfrica is a continent that is deeply vulnerable to climate change,\u201d said Vincent Biruta, Rwanda\u2019s minister of natural resources. \u201cWe are witnessing disastrous droughts \u2014 our people are losing lives. We need to address climate change if we are to address poverty.\u201dRwanda, which has worked to emerge from the shadows of its 1994 genocide, hopes to become known as well for the forging of a major climate deal. Negotiators met in the sparkling new Kigali Convention Center, and the night the deal was completed, it was illuminated in green.Advertisement"}

It is the greatest loss and despair in the lives of all Thais nationwide.\u201dKing Bhumibol, 88, who ascended to the throne in 1946 and became the world\u2019s longest-reigning monarch, helped balance rival political factions, at times giving his blessing to juntas that seized power from democratically elected governments, including the current leadership.His son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, who for years has spent most of his time in Germany and who has a reputation as a jet-setting playboy, is expected to take the throne. It was unclear whether he would have the same moral authority to insert himself into the nation\u2019s contentious politics.On Thursday evening, the crown prince unexpectedly said he was not ready to become king and requested more time to grieve the loss of his father, General Prayuth told reporters. The 64-year-old prince, who has been the royal heir since 1972, wants to wait until an appropriate time to take on the mantle of monarch, the prime minister said.Thailand\u2019s National Assembly, which had been expected to crown a new king, convened in the evening. Members stood in silence for nine minutes \u2014 the king was the ninth in his dynasty \u2014 but adjourned abruptly soon afterward without taking further action.Thai news media reported that Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, the government\u2019s chief spokesman, asked all TV channels to show only the government channel\u2019s programming during a 30-day mourning period.Throngs of people had gathered at Siriraj Hospital on Thursday afternoon as rumors of the king\u2019s death spread. Many wore pink, the color thought to bolster his health, and knelt on the ground to pray for his recovery. At one point, the crowd chanted, \u201cLong live the king.\u201d By then, it was too late.President Obama said in a statement that King Bhumibol, who was born in Massachusetts, was a \u201cclose friend\u201d of the United States.\u201cHis Majesty was a tireless champion of his country\u2019s development and demonstrated unflagging devotion to improving the standard of living of the Thai people,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWith a creative spirit and a drive for innovation, he pioneered new technologies that have rightfully received worldwide acclaim.\u201dGeneral Prayuth said flags would fly at half-staff for 30 days and asked the public to refrain from holding celebrations during that period. Government officials will be in a state of mourning for one year, he said.\u201cEven though we are in sorrow and tears are in our faces, our beloved Thailand and the monarchy must continue,\u201d the prime minister said during an appearance broadcast on all television channels. \u201cDo not let the death derail his majesty\u2019s determination to see his kingdom prosper, the people live in blessedness and be kind to each other.\u201dThitinan Pongsudhirak, a political-science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said King Bhumibol\u2019s accomplishments included helping to develop the nation\u2019s economy and preventing the communist movement from making inroads in Thailand as it swept through neighboring countries.While the last 10 years in Thailand have been volatile, he said, the king\u2019s leadership was especially critical during the height of the Cold War, from the 1950s through the 1970s.\u201cHe has left behind a great nation, a grieving and grateful nation,\u201d Professor Thitinan said. \u201cThere are detractors and critics who might argue that the monarchy has impeded democratic development over the past decade, but in the broader, overarching perspective, Thailand would not be where it is today without this monarchy and this monarch.\u201dThailand has been divided for years between poor farmers mainly in the rural north and more prosperous urban residents centered in Bangkok. At the same time, Muslims have been fighting a low-level insurgency in the far south for more than a decade, seeking independence from the central government.The military has staged two coups over the past 10 years to oust populist governments that favored the rural poor, first the government led by a billionaire businessman, Thaksin Shinawatra, and later the government of his sister, Yingluck.Part of the rationale for the current government\u2019s remaining in power was to ensure a smooth transition after the expected death of King Bhumibol.The announcement of the king\u2019s passing came about three hours after the official time of death, 3:52 p.m. He died at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, where he had been confined for most of the past few years. He had a number of health problems, including kidney failure, and in his final days was on a ventilator.On Wednesday rumors of his death sent the Thai stock market plunging nearly 7 percent before it recovered somewhat later that day to a loss of 2.5 percent.\u201cEven though the team of doctors tried their best, his illness hasn\u2019t improved and he declined accordingly until 13 Oct. 2016,\u201d the palace said Thursday in its announcement.Although the king\u2019s death had long been anticipated, the reality still came as a shock to many Thais.\u201cI really, really love the king,\u201d said Thanthai Kaenwong, 35, a bartender.\u201cHe is the father of all Thais,\u201d he added. \u201cWe closed our club today to mourn him. But no one is in the mood, anyway.\u201dWimonsiri Kaewsadet, 39, a Bangkok food vendor, grew teary as she spoke of the king. She said her chest felt tight, her face was numb, and she could not eat. She said her sense of loss was even greater than when her own father died.\u201cMy heart is broken in pieces,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one wished him to go so soon like this. But he was very, very sick. He could not go on. He had endured so much pain.\u201dShe said the king\u2019s absence made her feel uncertain about the country\u2019s future.\u201cIt\u2019s the news that no one wants to hear,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

And this year, the crowds have gotten even more epic in scale, with hordes of travelers taking to the highways, the rails and the air. (Also, of course, to tourist camels in the Gobi, horses on the Tibetan Plateau and boats on the Yangtze River.)People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, said 589 million people were expected to travel this week \u2014 almost twice the population of the United States.But \u201csustainable\u201d means different things to different people. Photographs of miles-long traffic jams on highways and oceans of people at the country\u2019s top attractions are circulating online this week.On Tuesday, the official Twitter account of People\u2019s Daily posted one such photo from the Forbidden City, in Beijing. It said the palace had sold 20,000 tickets within two hours on Sunday, or 166 tickets a minute.One photograph online showed fog and mist enveloping the mountain, and others showed many elderly tourists and women and children gathered in a cave near the mountaintop cable car station. Mount Hua, or Huashan in Mandarin, is a sacred Taoist mountain in Shaanxi Province that is about 7,067 feet tall. The West Peak, where the cable car station is, has an altitude of 6,850 feet.Air passengers that day numbered 960,000, a 6.4 percent increase over 2015.Driving was also popular because governments do not collect tolls on roads during this time, \u201cwhich led to the inevitable gridlock on the country\u2019s highways,\u201d the television network said. The same report said traffic on a six-mile stretch of road in Shanghai ground to a halt.Domestic tourism has been on the rise in China for years, with the Golden Week period generating more revenue for most tourism-related businesses than any other week of the year.Beijing has been quiet outside of the most popular tourist attractions like the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, the Temple of Heaven and the Summer Palace. On streets that are usually clogged on workdays, there are few cars. Many restaurants are closed.One resident, Mu Shuhua, said he was staying in town this week.

{"Headline": "Snooping in the Bathroom to Assess Credit Risk in China", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byKUNSHAN, China \u2014 Banks and other lenders typically look at borrowers\u2019 credit histories, tax forms and other financial information to determine whether they will get paid back. In China, lenders also look at their bathrooms.Lenders have to be creative. As the economy slows, the government wants to nurture a credit culture to get Chinese families spending instead of saving.But judging creditworthiness is tricky in a country where cash reigns, fraud is rife and even the most basic details can be difficult to verify. Despite China\u2019s size and wealth, most people have never taken out a mortgage or used a credit card, so lenders often have little reliable information about potential borrowers.To fill the gaps, one upstart lender, China Rapid Finance, supplements data analysis with on-the-ground spade work. The company\u2019s investigators, in more than 90 cities, check for the number of toothbrushes or towels to determine how many people are living in a house. They look for dirty dishes in the kitchen. They take photos of a potential borrower at work to confirm employment status.\u201cThis is probably the largest untapped consumer finance market globally,\u201d said the founder and chief executive of China Rapid Finance, Zane Wang, who spent years as the head of analytics at the credit arm of Sears, the American retailer.Getting credit right is crucial to China\u2019s economic plans. The government is trying to bolster consumer spending to help offset the sharp decline in the smokestack industries that previously helped power the country\u2019s ascent. China will need to increase the use of credit to make it easier to spend, while at the same time avoiding the pitfalls that come with too much debt.Shifting generational dynamics will play a big role, as China\u2019s millennials are much more likely to use credit than their scrimping and saving parents. But lenders will also need to put the right products in their hands.While the country\u2019s wealth has swelled, the financial system has not kept pace.China\u2019s banks have a modest consumer lending business. But they typically favor making loans to big state-owned companies.They are trying to attract the next generation of spenders like Mao Yiting, a researcher at the local antiquities bureau in the coastal city of Haining.Ms. Mao, 27, has never had a credit card or taken out a loan. But she regularly borrows small amounts of just over $90 from Huabei, a consumer lending business started by the Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial. She uses the money to pay for online purchases like books, dog food, or ingredients for the dessert recipes she likes to cook.\u201cI always pay the debt on Huabei on time,\u201d said Ms. Mao, who repays the money in installments. \u201cIt\u2019s more convenient than the credit cards issued by banks.\u201dBut online lending in China still has a Wild West aspect \u2014 for both the lender and the borrower.After that, regulators have stepped up their oversight of online lenders, including setting caps on the amounts that can be borrowed. The regulators\u2019 tightening grip is \u201csomething like a shepherd gradually herding his sheep into an increasingly narrowing pen or chute,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the founder and managing director at Marbridge Consulting, based in Beijing.The lenders themselves are entering a financial black hole, with little to no credit history on potential borrowers.In the United States, the Big Three credit bureaus \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 compile borrowing and repayment records to create so-called FICO scores. Financial institutions rely heavily on those scores to make lending decisions.China lacks a direct equivalent. The central bank\u2019s main database includes personal credit history data on less than a third of the country\u2019s population.\u201cCompared with the broad consumer base, there is still lots of room to go,\u201d said Paul Wang, a co-founder and the chief executive of Happyfi.com, a Shanghai start-up that guides online lenders on risk management.Without a more complete depository of information, the industry is finding new ways to build those histories.WeLab, an online lender, uses data collected on mobile phones, with the permission of users, to automatically process hundreds of details about potential borrowers\u2019 habits, online and offline. When deciding whether to lend money, it becomes granular, like the time of a day a loan application is submitted. Those filed from 1 and 6 a.m. have a higher correlation with repayment default, according to Simon Loong, the founder and chief executive of WeLab.\u201cGetting efficient access to cheap lending is still a fundamental way of how people improve their quality of life,\u201d said Mr. Loong, a banking veteran whose start-up has backing from Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, and Sequoia, the Silicon Valley investor.China Rapid Finance draws on transaction data and other records from dozens of internet companies, including Baidu and Tencent. The company feeds this raw data into its own algorithms to identify potential customers.Based on that information, the company first gives out small, preapproved loans to build a credit history. China Rapid recently teamed up with Tencent\u2019s QQ messaging platform to offer loans of $75.After a borrower repays several loans, the company then hands out bigger amounts. At that point, the company\u2019s investigators step into the mix to vet borrowers further.One applicant, the company said, wanted to borrow 100,000 renminbi for 18 months at an annual interest rate of 2.89 percent. The applicant, a 28-year-old single man from Changchun, wanted the money to renovate his home.It did not pass muster. On inspection, the company found that the applicant had stayed at what he claimed was his residence for only three days. His stated employer had no record of him.\u201dWe need to have a mechanism to check and verify,\u201d said Mr. Wang of China Rapid Finance. \u201cWe have to start somewhere.\u201dKaroline Kan contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kind of Thinking Cities Need", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisQuito, Ecuador \u2014 Day after day, under a bright sun, hourslong security lines snaked out of El Ejido Park into the surrounding streets. Enterprising women in multicolored skirts and brown hats sold water and folding umbrellas for shade. Inside, representatives at the German pavilion seduced passers-by with beer and apples to spread propaganda on the \u201ccircular economy,\u2019\u2019 while the incongruous sound of a mariachi band playing Frank Sinatra music wafted from Ecuador\u2019s booth, nearly drowning out a speech by an architect from California describing her company\u2019s projects to improve a slum in Kenya.But my takeaway from Habitat III had next to nothing to do with the official agenda and a great deal to do with what I sense is a worldwide sea change, a generational shift, rejecting the glum, defeatist view toward cities and urban life that prevailed when Habitat first convened 40 years ago in Vancouver, Canada.In other words, cities were a problem. This view prevailed through the 20th century. Cities were regarded as crime-ridden, unhealthy and polluted, aging incubators of infant mortality and malnutrition, increasingly abandoned by the educated and the middle classes. Modernist architects and planners famously envisioned wiping the urban slate clean. They advocated utopian, tower-in-the-park developments, high-rises in antiseptic plazas, with housing neatly cordoned off from offices, and highways bulldozed through old neighborhoods to whisk people who could afford cars out of town. A brighter future beckoned in suburbia.Today, progressive thinking, reinforced by the undeniability of climate change, has overturned those ideas. Cities are being recognized increasingly as opportunities for economic and social progress, density as a response to environmental threats; the automobile as a big problem; slums as not just a blight but a potential template for organic urbanism. Young generations around the world, entering the tech economy and bound by the internet, are embracing urban ideals, including the common ground of public spaces, mass transit, streets and sidewalks.This news has clearly not penetrated the thinking of older leaders everywhere. From Caracas, Venezuela, to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, many cities in the developing world remain in thrall to obsolete, environmentally irresponsible, socially debilitating visions of high-rises and highways, sprawl and segregation, with poor people pushed to the outskirts and more well-to-do residents in gated communities that are yet another unfortunate global export from postwar America.Federal authorities often thwart initiatives by mayors, who know the benefits of cities best. I found Miguel \u00c1ngel Mancera, the mayor of Mexico City, at the conference. He told me that Mexico\u2019s federal government in September slashed funding to Mexico City by billions of pesos, interrupting critical repairs to the strained metro system and to the precarious system of water pipes upon which tens of millions of residents rely. Instead, the national government is funding sprawl and building double-decker highways, paving the path to ruin.This is where the youthful spirit I found at Habitat comes in. The ethos here stressed grass-roots, environmentally conscious, entrepreneurial urban development. There was lots of righteous talk about redistributing real estate profits and treating housing as a basic human right, but also about how investments in things like public transit and infrastructure pay big economic dividends \u2014 how good cities are not just equitable and green but good for business.She belongs to this new generation that is changing the conversation about cities. Despite the noise, she made herself heard.Michael Kimmelman is the New York Times architecture critic.Advertisement"}

Vote Condemning Cuba Embargo", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Making a bit of history, the United States on Wednesday abstained for the first time in an annual General Assembly condemnation of the half-century-old American trade embargo against Cuba.The abstention \u2014 a break from the \u201cno\u201d vote the United States delegation has always cast \u2014 was another important signal by the Obama administration of its intention to fully repair relations with Cuba, including an end to the embargo.A General Assembly resolution condemning the embargo, proposed every year since 1991, had become something of a ritualized event at the United Nations, used by Cuba and many others to castigate the United States. The lone American ally on this issue, Israel, also changed its vote on Wednesday to abstain.The vote for the resolution, taken early Wednesday afternoon, was 191 in favor, none opposed and the two abstentions.Ms. Power called the resolution \u201ca perfect example of why the U.S. policy of isolation toward Cuba was not working \u2013 or worse, how it was actually undermining the very goals it set out to achieve.\u201dBut she also said that \u201cabstaining on this resolution does not mean that the United States agrees with all of the policies and practices of the Cuban government.\u201dThe Cuban foreign minister, Bruno Rodr\u00edguez, who came to the United Nations for the vote, thanked Ms. Power for the abstention and acknowledged the progress made so far in improved ties.Nonetheless, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez devoted most of his prepared remarks to criticizing the embargo and exhorting the Obama administration to do more.\u201cThe human damages caused by the blockade are incalculable,\u201d he said in the official English translation of his remarks. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any Cuban family or sector in our country that has not suffered from its effects.\u201dThe Obama administration has taken a number of steps to ease the embargo\u2019s effects, which have severely constrained Cuba\u2019s economy. Under the relaxation, the United States has permitted some increased commerce, resumed regularly scheduled airline flights and eased limits on visits by tourists and family members.But these measures have been done by executive power. The embargo can be annulled only by the Republican-led Congress, where support for it remains. The abstention at the United Nations effectively sharpens the confrontation between the administration and Congress over the issue.Republican critics of Mr. Obama\u2019s Cuba policy have repeatedly denounced what they call the administation\u2019s capitulation to an authoritarian Communist government run for decades by Fidel Castro and later his brother, Ra\u00fal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Says Labor and Inflation Complicate Fed\u2019s Plans to Raise Rates", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byBOSTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, did not talk on Friday about the Fed\u2019s plans for its benchmark interest rate. Instead, she talked about why those plans have been so hard to make.In a wide-ranging speech, Ms. Yellen said the Fed was struggling to understand the behavior of the labor market and the weakness of inflation. It is reconsidering how changes in monetary policy ripple through the economy, and the impact of international events. In short, as often happens after a crisis, the Fed is sorting through some existential issues.\u201cThe market seems to think that there\u2019s a very high probability of December,\u201d Mr. Rosengren told CNBC. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the economic data actually comes in, but I think that is priced appropriately.\u201dMs. Yellen and most of her colleagues were not.The debate among Fed officials revolves in part around the consequences of holding down interest rates to push unemployment to an unsustainably low level. A certain amount of unemployment lubricates labor markets, maintaining a ready supply of workers for businesses that are expanding. In the past, pushing unemployment below that level has increased inflation. Mr. Rosengren has warned that could force the Fed to raise rates more sharply, potentially driving the economy into recession.But an unusually large share of American adults are neither working nor counted among the unemployed. They are not trying to find jobs. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have raised the possibility that a low unemployment rate could persuade some of these people to start looking. That could increase growth without increasing inflation.\u201cIf strong economic conditions can partially reverse supply-side damage after it has occurred, then policy makers may want to aim at being more accommodative during recoveries than would be called for under the traditional view,\u201d Ms. Yellen said on Friday.Ms. Yellen described this outcome as \u201cplausible\u201d but not proven. Businesses buoyed by strong sales might expand; workers might find it easier to move into better jobs; increased investment in research might even lead to higher productivity growth.The Fed is embarked on the experiment. Officials predicted in December that they would raise rates four times this year. So far, they have not raised rates at all. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate remains in a range between 0.25 percent and 0.5 percent, a low level that encourages investment and risk-taking.Federal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.And over the last year, the unemployment rate has held steady while the labor force has expanded.The question is how much further the Fed can go.\u201cJust pushing down unemployment, by itself, is unlikely to draw large numbers of workers back into the labor force,\u201d said Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, a professor of economics at Harvard University.James Stock, also a Harvard economist, said annual growth during this expansion has been about 1.74 percentage points slower than the last three expansions. He said demographics and productivity accounted for about 0.9 percentage points of the shortfall. He attributed most of the rest to insufficient government spending and weak demand for exports.Yet few drew the conclusion that the Fed should raise rates.Peter Ireland, a professor of economics at Boston College, described himself as \u201creally, really nervous\u201d about the judgment that the central bank\u2019s work is done.\u201cMy December vote is no,\u201d said Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economist.The Fed is unlikely to act at its next meeting, in November, just a few days before the presidential election on Nov. 8. Patrick T. Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said on Thursday that the election could cause significant economic disruptions.\u201cIt may be prudent to wait until we have resolved some of that uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Harker said.The Fed\u2019s last meeting of the year, in December, looks more likely for a rate change. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said early this month that he wanted the Fed to move forward slowly, but that he did not regard the exact timing of the next rate increase as important.December would be \u201cfine,\u201d Mr. Evans told reporters in Auckland, New Zealand. \u201cI am less concerned about the timing of the next increase than I am about the path over the next three years.\u201dMs. Yellen surveyed a number of the issues that are perplexing Fed policy makers.The conventional understanding of monetary policy is that the Fed raises or lowers interest rates, which moves markets, which changes the behavior of businesses and consumers, and so the American economy grows or slows. But the Fed has struggled to stimulate the economy.One possible reason, Ms. Yellen said, is that households and businesses with relatively large debts were unwilling, or unable, to take advantage of low interest rates. She said that the Fed also needed to improve its understanding of the economic impact of changes in financial conditions.The behavior of inflation is another mystery. It fell less than expected during the recession; it has strengthened more slowly than expected in the aftermath. \u201cThe influence of labor market conditions on inflation in recent years seems to be weaker than had been commonly thought,\u201d she said.Finally, she mentioned the impact of global economic weakness on domestic growth.\u201cThis is a wonderful time to be an academic,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said in introducing Ms. Yellen. But, he continued, \u201cI empathize with the challenges our chair has\u201d in charting policy with so many uncertainties.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}

Neither of the presidential campaigns responded to requests for comment.This lack of attention might lead some observers to conclude that Americans are unconcerned about climate change, but some surveys tell another story. Most Americans say they are interested in climate change, but they just do not hear much about it.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it.

Just five of those posts focused on climate change, and those have not generated a great deal of user engagement. According to an analysis by The New York Times, only one of the 100 posts that were most liked, shared and commented on mentions climate change: It offered a link to video of the appearance with Mr. Gore.Sam Adams, the director of the United States climate initiative for the World Resources Institute, noted that while climate change was a strong part of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s platform, it still posed a political danger. The liberal wing of her party finds her too incremental in her attitude toward ending fossil fuel dependence, and more conservative Democrats argue that a too-rapid shift to renewables will hurt coal and oil workers.\u201cIt\u2019s not a risk-free issue for Clinton to campaign on, either from the left flank or the right flank,\u201d he said.And sometimes, the question simply falls through the cracks.Lester Holt, the NBC anchor who moderated the first debate, did plan to ask about climate change, according to Mark Kornblau, a senior vice president for communications for NBC News and MSNBC.

{"Headline": "If War Can Have Ethics, Wall Street Can, Too", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byThe StoneNearly a decade after one of the most devastating financial collapses in modern history, Wall Street appears as corrupt as ever. Evidence is not hard to come by \u2014 most recently, the Wells Fargo scandal, in which employees of the company, spurred by perverse incentive structures, opened two million fraudulent accounts in their customers\u2019 names. The bank had put intense pressure on employees to meet sales goals; some employees who reported the wrongdoing were fired, along with 5,300 more, after the scandal broke. All this is but one reminder of how far major actors in the economy have strayed from any reasonable standard of moral behavior.Despite the recent urging of high-profile figures like Pope Francis and Senator Bernie Sanders to establish a \u201cmoral economy,\u201d we have not. Free-market advocates hold fast to justifications that amount to variations on the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d theory of Adam Smith \u2014 that the economy is not a moral space, but one that relies on a free and fair market, self-interested (as opposed to selfish) actors and amoral (as opposed to immoral) calculation to arrive at the most efficient and innovative outcomes. The invisible hand of the market must be allowed to act; placing moral limits on the economy, they argue, would hinder this flourishing.To some, the unbridled force and overarching goal to be pursued is the efficiency of the market, even to the detriment of society, transforming market theory into a sort of divine scripture, to be faithfully followed. The suggestion of a moral economy is decried for the inefficiencies that moral limits would place on behavior in the market. It is as if society exists to serve the market, not the other way around.The pursuit of a comparative advantage in the market has come to justify nearly any behavior and its consequences. The result of this approach in the United States is already well-known \u2014 a staggering level of economic inequality and widespread, devastating effects on millions of citizens struggling against this tide.Hedge funds and investment banks utilize high-speed trading to place the individual investor at an insurmountable disadvantage. Multinational corporations pump money into political campaigns to influence tax policies that allow them to skirt paying taxes. The mega-wealthy deploy a small army of accountants and attorneys to hide their assets. Slavish devotion to market theories serves as a convenient rational justification for some to take selfish actions they know to be wrong or questionable.In short, the amoral economy envisioned by free market theory is a fantasy, a theoretical construct that has never really existed in practice. It has been overwhelmed by immoral actors who have turned it into an immoral space, tipping the playing field to their advantage.Some progress on this question can be made by examining how we have chosen to navigate an even more perilous manifestation of the human condition: war. The economy, like war, creates winners and losers, makes heroes of those who seize opportunities and victims of those caught between forces beyond their control, and can transform the fortunes of society for better or ill. Yet, unlike war, the economy has no foundational morality. Instead it leaves critical moral judgments with real consequences in the tenuous hands of self-interested economic actors whose guiding light is the maximization of their own benefit, without consideration for the effects on others.The Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz warned of \u201ctotal war\u201d as a theoretical construct in which, by rationally following the escalations of war to their conclusion, war outstrips its strategic logic and becomes irrational, therefore requiring limits in practice. Without limits, Clausewitz argued, theory could be misused to justify and rationalize the unjust and irrational. Unless war is bounded by a higher societal purpose and tempered by what Clausewitz referred to as \u201cthe spirit of the age,\u201d it threatens to become its own raison d\u2019\u00eatre, an irrational end in itself.In war, immoral action may provide the combatant with a comparative advantage, but it also stains society and humanity in ways that we have collectively deemed to be unacceptable.Humanity has tried to limit war on moral terms since Cicero first outlined the Just War Ethic, an effort that continues to this day. In war, the reversion to barbarism can be tempting in the heat of battle, and as passions and hatreds rise between peoples. However, even here, humanity has managed to place moral limits.In the modern world, the Just War Ethic may seem like a distant abstraction; but its effects influence the relationship between war and society in profound ways. Michael Walzer, perhaps the most influential living philosopher of just war theories, articulated the importance of seeking to establish moral principles there: \u201cWar is the hardest place: if comprehensive and consistent moral judgments are possible there, they are possible everywhere.\u201dThe Just War Ethic provides the foundational principles on which the laws of war have been constructed; when policy makers seek to justify the use of force, they employ the language of the Just War Ethic; they speak in terms of the principles of just cause, last resort, necessity, proportionality and the reasonable prospects of success. Although often overshadowed by the horrors of war, the principles of the Just War Ethic do limit war\u2019s worst excesses by underpinning the discourse, decisions, behaviors and accountability related to war.Of course, the Just War Ethic suffers from a problem: The normative ideal in this case is the absence of war, yet the reality of war precludes that ideal. Therefore, any applied ethics of war are by definition morally flawed. The question for the ethicist then is this: Is it more ethical to make continued (and often ignored) normative pronouncements against the existence of war, or to engage with the temporal reality of war with ethics that seek to limit the cases in which war is undertaken, to moderate its effects, and to guide it toward the normative goal, with the understanding that this goal is not immediately or fully achievable? Obviously, advocates of the Just War Ethic, myself included, come to the latter conclusion.The question is not one of moral perfection, but of moral improvement. It is a step in the right direction.If we can seek to regulate war in terms of morality, there is no reason such morality cannot be equally applied to the economy, as Walzer indicates. When faced with illegal or immoral orders, it is the duty of professional soldiers to refuse such orders. When such a refusal occurs, it is followed by thorough investigations, and potentially courts-martial or war crimes prosecutions for those who issue such orders. In the case of the former Wells Fargo employees, the opposite occurred. Imagine the moral and societal hazard if the military permitted such retaliation against those who reported illegal and immoral behaviors.The principles of a moral economy would seek to curb the market\u2019s more harmful excesses while preserving its societal benefit. Developing fair and just principles to guide a more moral understanding of capitalism may provide a pathway to a more equitable distribution of income and wealth, one that creates more perfect outcomes for society at large.While the immoral economy has provided advantages to some, it has also stained society and humanity in ways that we are beginning to collectively deem to be unacceptable. The task then is to develop and implement principles of a moral economy which serves the greater good of society.In a \u201cjust\u201d economy, venture capitalists would consider the collateral damage (layoffs, defaulted retirements, etc.) that may result from their actions in the same way that military commanders must consider whether the use of a certain weapon in proximity to civilians would be discriminate and proportional. Chief executives would begin to care for their employees and their families the same way that professional military commanders care for their troops and their families. The promise of these outcomes, and society\u2019s growing dissatisfaction with the current reality, makes this a conversation worth having.Some might argue that we already have laws and regulations to perform these functions, but these have, at times spectacularly, failed to maintain the market as a truly neutral, free, and fair space. In a theoretical sense, law should approximate the normative ideal in the real world. Yet, in economic thought we have no normative ideal, no foundational morality. We have economic ideals derived from market theory, but these are not tempered by a coherent set of ethical ideals, allowing the market\u2019s worst excesses, and resulting in many of the morally troubling outcomes produced by the economy. We need better laws and regulations, but first we must establish a foundational morality to guide their development.To demand moral perfection or to succumb in the face of seeming futility is to turn our backs on what can be achieved by acknowledging both the ideal and the limits of reality. Applied ethics guide our interactions in the world as it exists while nudging us incrementally closer to the normative ideal and the world we seek to create.War is inherently unjust, but the Just War Ethic has made it more just. The economy is not moral, but a foundational ethics of the economy could make it more moral. The product of such ethics would be decidedly imperfect, but it would be better than no ethics at all.The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect the official policy or position of the United States Military Academy, Department of the Army, Department of Defense or the United States government.Nathaniel B.

{"Headline": "Global Governments, Loath to Change, Are Wasting Oil With Subsidies", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byVenezuela has no shortage of problems, but one of the more curious is its cheap prices at the gas pump.Drivers pay roughly the equivalent of 40 cents a gallon for regular gasoline, and that is after the government raised prices slightly in a minor adjustment in a vast, popular subsidy, which is helping to prop up the tottering government politically, while helping to bankrupt it economically. With little incentive to conserve fuel and the more they drive, Venezuelans release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which contribute to climate change.Venezuela is hardly the only developing country wasting oil and natural gas with consumer subsidies. In many nations, transportation fuels are as cheap as soda. Electricity rates are so discounted in the Persian Gulf states that some residents do not bother to turn down their air-conditioners while away on vacation.By some estimates, the consumption subsidies may be responsible for more than 10 percent of total global emissions of carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas. They also contribute to traffic jams and air pollution in cities across the developing world.When oil prices tumbled in late 2014, environmentalists and economists at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund urged governments to abandon policies that froze energy rates at artificially low levels. A substantial number of governments announced pricing policy changes, seizing the opportunity to improve their finances. Malaysia and Morocco ended gasoline and diesel subsidies, while India not only stopped subsidizing diesel but raised fuel taxes.But many governments stood still or failed to fulfill their announced policies, despite making broad commitments to decrease carbon emissions at the December climate summit in Paris. In some cases, street demonstrations and election campaign pressures halted reforms, while in others, special interest groups \u2014 like truckers and farmers who depend on cheap diesel \u2014 lobbied to stall or upend change.The Supreme Court of Argentina recently dealt the country\u2019s new leader, President Mauricio Macri, a big political defeat by reversing a gas price increase for residential users, a central policy initiative of Mr. Macri\u2019s to improve the economy. Energy subsidies account for more than half the Argentine government\u2019s fiscal deficit.\u201cSome countries have tweaked policies,\u201d said Jim Krane, an energy expert at Rice University in Houston, \u201cbut with oil prices so low, there is a golden opportunity to adjust prices and reduce waste. It\u2019s a shame more countries aren\u2019t taking advantage.\u201dProgress in cutting consumption subsidies has been especially uneven in countries that froze local prices when global prices slumped, only to neglect to raise them locally when global prices rose again.This year, for instance, oil prices nearly doubled at times from their February lows. But Bolivia and Algeria continued to freeze energy prices at low levels. In Indonesia, which had promised to adjust gasoline and diesel prices monthly to comply with market shifts, changes in prices have been few and sporadic, and some subsidies once cut have since re-emerged.After neglecting to put announced fuel price increases into effect last year, Egypt said that it would move slowly to pare subsidies through the decade without ending them. Iran missed its target to end its subsidies last year.\u201cEnduring pricing reform is still politically challenging,\u201d said Masami Kojima, an energy analyst at the World Bank. With fuel prices easing again at times this year, she added, \u201cgovernments have a second chance to seize this moment and tackle subsidy policy and move to market-based pricing.\u201dBut few are taking it.Consumption subsidies are just one of many energy subsidies. The United States, like most developed countries, does not subsidize energy consumption, but it does offer tax breaks to fossil fuel and renewable-energy companies. Gasoline is moderately priced in the United States, relative to countries with higher fuel taxes. And environmentalists and some economists say a carbon tax should be levied to reduce emissions and to price in the social costs of pollution, congestion and damage to public health.But economists say energy subsidies are a particular drain on the economies of poor countries.The argument against the subsidies seems obvious to most mainstream economists. Worldwide, such subsidies have cost governments and state oil companies as much as $500 billion annually in recent years, according to the International Energy Agency. Economists say the vast majority of benefits from the subsidies go to the wealthy, not to the poor, because it is the wealthy who do the most driving and use the most electricity. Wasteful consumption of all fossil fuels, including the dirtiest coal, burdens governments with additional spending that might otherwise go to social programs.Subsidized cheap fuels also encourage smuggling, create fuel shortages, depress fuel prices on the black market and enrich organized crime. In some Southeast Asian countries, fishermen have found it more attractive to smuggle cheap fuel to neighboring countries rather than fish.Nevertheless, the poor \u2014 and political movements that count on the impoverished as their base \u2014 typically protest cuts in subsidies because higher energy prices have an impact on daily life. That is why many economists urge governments to strengthen social safety nets, like by using the money saved once subsidies are removed to create employment and improve health care and education for the poor.But for political leaders, ending subsidies is not so easy because it immediately means higher consumer prices.The conflict between economic necessity and political necessity is especially palpable in the Persian Gulf, where governments need to cut spending as their oil revenues recede but also need to curry the favor of their populations while political turmoil swirls across the Middle East.The Saudi government has raised electricity prices for residential customers as well as the price of gasoline and diesel, but Saudi drivers still pay less than $1 a gallon at the pump. Gasoline prices have also been raised significantly in recent months in Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman, but drivers still pay a fraction of what Europeans or even Americans pay.And while Qatar has raised electricity prices for foreigners, its own citizens still cool their homes virtually free.\u201cIt\u2019s human nature, not just Arab nature, to bridle when something that was once free or low cost suddenly costs more,\u201d said Chase Untermeyer, a former United States ambassador to Qatar, \u201ceven if the consumers can easily afford it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Showing How Art Critical of Malaysian Premier Thrived During His Rule", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Mahathir Mohamad, who transformed this country of paddy fields and rubber plantations into a modern economy of factories, highways and skyscrapers, is known as much for his bold economic vision as for his intolerance of anybody who got in his way.While he was prime minister of Malaysia from 1981 to 2003, Dr. Mahathir detained opponents, fired top judges, controlled the news media, clipped the power of Malay royalty, fired one deputy and pushed another to resign.Yet the visual arts mostly escaped his attention.\u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d a show of 48 works by 28 artists that is on view at Ilham Gallery here until Nov. 20, is evidence of that inattention. Despite their critical nature, many of the pieces in the show appeared in state-funded institutions like the National Art Gallery; some won national awards.Art was seen as a concern of the urban elite, with no influence on the masses. \u201cIt was not really on his radar,\u201d said Valentine Willie, the curator of \u201cEra Mahathir\u201d and the creative director of Ilham Gallery. \u201cIn a way, it was a saving grace for us. He didn\u2019t take us seriously.\u201dDr. Mahathir\u2019s policies created a growing wealthy class whose members were looking for ways to spend their money. \u201cIf you have a million-dollar apartment, what are you going to put on the wall? Not your grandmother\u2019s portrait,\u201d Mr. Willie said.In Malaysia this year, another artist, Fahmi Reza, was charged \u2014 twice \u2014 under cybercrime laws for posting a caricature of Prime Minister Najib Razak with a clown face on Instagram and Facebook.But in Dr. Mahathir\u2019s Malaysia in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, even as art took a decidedly sociopolitical turn, galleries flourished, as did theater.\u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d which features works on loan from the national art gallery, private collections and the artists, opens with a panel by Mohd Nor Khalid, better known as Lat, whose cartoons ran in the pro-government New Straits Times.In the panel, Lee Kuan Yew, a former Singapore prime minister who died last year, is drawn clutching a newspaper and asking Dr. Mahathir why he allows cartoonists to get away with such unflattering depictions of him. \u201cLook what they do to your nose!\u201d Mr. Lee says. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Dr. Mahathir, depicted with a giant nose, agrees, \u201ctoo much freedom.\u201d It\u2019s funny, and makes a point: Even among autocrats, there are degrees of autocracy.The show also includes a politically charged work by Ahmad Fuad Osman. In 1998, the artist joined thousands in the streets protesting Dr. Mahathir\u2019s firing of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who was later charged with corruption and sodomy \u2014 a crime in this country. Then Mr. Ahmad Fuad went home and picked up his brush.Until then, he had been known for his studied, symbolic pieces. He ended up producing four vigorous self-portraits, in oil, each over six feet tall. Three were based on the old proverb \u201cSee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,\u201d to which he added a fourth portrait, of him holding his nose.\u201cThere are times we have to scream,\u201d Mr. Ahmad Fuad said in a phone interview from his current base in Bali. \u201cWe can\u2019t whisper anymore. We have to let our voices out.\u201dMr. Ahmad Fuad\u2019s self-portraits were shown at Galeri Petronas, owned by the national oil company. One of these four pieces \u2014 titled \u201cShhh!\u201d and showing the artist with finger to lips \u2014 is included in \u201cEra Mahathir.\u201dAnother work, \u201cNEP,\u201d by Roslisham Ismail, is a wall-size collage forming the acronym for the New Economic Policy, an affirmative-action plan for the country\u2019s majority Malays that Dr. Mahathir wielded to a greater degree than any leader before him. The three giant letters are made up of posters and calling cards for loan sharks, a comment on the abuses of the policy and the growing chasm between rich and poor Malays.Liew Kung Yu\u2019s \u201cProposals for My Country\u201d features a photo montage of the Greek and Roman columns that mushroomed during the building boom, adorning everything from mansions to office buildings to wooden stilt houses \u2014 a sign of new money gone mad.Mr. Liew, in an interview, denounced Dr. Mahathir\u2019s obsession with showy construction; the Petronas Twin Towers, briefly the world\u2019s tallest buildings, were erected during his time.Kathy Rowland, a Malaysian arts researcher who wrote an essay for the show\u2019s catalog, noted that during Dr. Mahathir\u2019s time the state built a national theater, a national art gallery \u2014 both planned under earlier administrations \u2014 and a home for the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra at the base of the Petronas Twin Towers.\u201cI suppose a rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d she said.The show is running as Dr. Mahathir, 91, is starting a new political party and forging a once-unthinkable alliance with the opposition to try to oust Mr. Najib, the current prime minister, who is mired in a billion-dollar scandal involving a state fund named 1MDB. That the gallery is owned by Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister and one of Dr. Mahathir\u2019s closest allies, adds to the intrigue.Mr. Willie, the curator, said that he had had the idea for the show for a while and that the timing was coincidental. Mr. Daim, a longtime art collector, provides the space for Ilham \u2014 12,000 square feet over two floors in a skyscraper he owns on the edge of the central business district.He pays Mr. Willie, who used to own five galleries across Southeast Asia, a fee to run it, but does not interfere in curatorial decisions, Mr. Willie said. Entry is free, and none of the works are for sale.Ilham\u2019s ownership has perturbed some in the arts community, who fear that artists are being co-opted in some larger political tussle. Ray Langenbach, an American who worked in Malaysia for years and is now a theater professor at the University of the Arts Helsinki, said he had rejected a request from the gallery to include his 1994 video documenting a performance piece by another artist.The piece was based on one of Dr. Mahathir\u2019s most severe crackdowns, 1987\u2019s Operation Lalang \u2014 lalang is a hardy local weed \u2014 when 106 activists, politicians, intellectuals, students and others were detained without trial, accused of stoking racial tension. \u201cAllowing criticism of his past acts makes Mahathir stronger now,\u201d Mr. Langenbach said in an email. (The gallery used news clippings about the performance piece instead.)Still, the gallery has attracted the participation of many independent voices.\u201cIt\u2019s a relevant art show, and you see a lot of anger from the time he was in power,\u201d said Jahabar Sadiq, a Malaysian journalist who wrote an essay on Dr. Mahathir\u2019s legacy for the show\u2019s catalog. In it, he described the ex- leader\u2019s biggest fault as bringing an overconcentration of power to the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201cOf course there\u2019s an agenda,\u201d Mr. Sadiq said. \u201cThe agenda is: I want you to talk about it! This is therapy for the country. The country needs this therapy.\u201dA picture caption on Oct. 9 with an article about \u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d an exhibition in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, featuring artwork that was popular during the tenure of a former Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, misstated, in some copies, the patronymic of the artist whose self-portrait \u201cShhh!\u201d is in the show. He is Ahmad Fuad Osman, not Osmand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Following the Scent of More Perfume Sales", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byThere was a time when buying a bottle of tax-free perfume as a gift or personal indulgence was a standard part of a trip for many travelers.But while sales of duty-free beauty products have been rising over all in recent years, the proportion spent on scent has declined.And even as the number of global travelers increases \u2014 it is expected to rise 3.1 percent this year \u2014 terrorism and security concerns have cut sharply into arrivals in France and Turkey, countries traditionally found near the top of the most-visited lists, and economic and political turmoil has curbed what were rising numbers of outbound travelers from other countries, including Russia and Brazil.What\u2019s a fragrance brand or tax-free retailer to do?Many companies have decided to put more emphasis on those who continue to travel, tailoring their offerings to match the distinct tastes of on-the-move shoppers in specific regions.\u201cWe are living in a VUCA world,\u201d said Vincent Boinay, managing director of travel retailing at L\u2019Or\u00e9al, whose portfolio of fragrance brands includes Lanc\u00f4me, Viktor & Rolf and Giorgio Armani. The acronym he used \u2014 borrowed by the business world from American military jargon \u2014 stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.And so, he continued, \u201cone of the key rules in our business model is agility.\u201dThat agility is needed to cope with the depressed duty-free fragrance market. In 2015, sales in the beauty category, which includes scent, makeup and skin care products, totaled $19.8 billion, with fragrance accounting for 43.6 percent, according to Generation Research, a travel analytics company.But in 2014, the overall sales were $19.3 billion, with fragrance accounting for 48.7 percent and, in 2013, $17.5 billion and fragrance, 50.8 percent.The decline in the percentage of fragrance sales, which can be attributed to factors including a decrease in disposable income in some countries, has been a wake-up call to businesses.\u201cFragrance companies have understood that one size doesn\u2019t fit all,\u201d said Peter Mohn, chief executive of m1nd-set, a Swiss-based research company that focuses on travel retailing. \u201cThey really understand that they have to have a different portfolio that they offer in different regions of the world.\u201cTen years ago that wasn\u2019t the case \u2014 they were mostly standardized,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow companies are understanding more and more what travelers are looking for, so they\u2019re adapting more to the passenger mix at the airport.\u201dFor example, Armani/Priv\u00e9, one of the brands Mr. Boinay works with, created a fragrance last year with Chinese customers in mind. Called Pivoine Suzhou, it has a scent redolent of peony (pivoine, in French), a flower that is a Chinese symbol of wealth and happiness. And the perfume\u2019s box is detailed with lines about the flower by Liu Yuxi, a Tang Dynasty poet, written in Chinese calligraphy.For the holiday season, a special eau de toilette edition, infused with specks of mother of pearl, is being distributed to duty-free destinations, especially those most popular with Chinese travelers.Similarly, Miracle, a floral scent by Lanc\u00f4me, is being spotlighted in some duty-free stores that cater to the Chinese, while La Vie Est Belle, another Lanc\u00f4me fragrance, with iris gourmand notes combined with patchouli, is being marketed more toward Europeans and Americans.But fragrance companies are not alone in focusing on Asia, the world\u2019s biggest duty-free market, with more than $25 billion spent there last year, according to Generation Research.And companies are examining Southeast Asia and the Pacific areas for opportunities as travelers, especially those in China\u2019s growing middle class who are affected by the stalling of the country\u2019s economy, are opting for regional trips rather than long-distance destinations.\u201cThere is an enormous growth in inter-Asia travel,\u201d said Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association, a trade organization that is holding its annual global conference in Cannes, France, this week.\u201cI would find it difficult to not mention one place where there aren\u2019t very interesting developments in terms of new shops being added,\u201d Mr. Juul-Mortensen added. \u201cIt\u2019s really across the board: You see it in Cambodia, in Thailand, in Malaysia, in Vietnam \u2014 all over the place.\u201dIn March, DFS Group, the Hong Kong-based operator of airport duty-free shops as well as an increasing number of downtown locations in major cities, established its first store in Cambodia, in Siem Reap. The town is where tourists stay to visit the extensive Angkor Wat temples, which drew 2.1 million visitors last year, according to the organization in charge of the ruins.\u201cWe\u2019re opening doors where our customers are going to want to travel next,\u201d said Ariel Gentzbourger, the senior vice president for beauty, fragrances and well-being at DFS. \u201cThe strategy is to go to these locations.\u201dCoffrets \u2014 packaged sets containing a selection of perfumes \u2014 are doing particularly well in the Siem Reap store, according to DFS.Ms. Gentzbourger added that product selections in the region are being tailored to Asia\u2019s millennials, with a focus on contemporary fragrances from brands like Marc Jacobs, Moschino and Givenchy, sometimes in smaller bottles to make them more affordable.The Russian market has its own preferences. \u201cRussians tend to like fragrances with a stronger character that make them differentiate a little more from others,\u201d Mr. Mohn said. \u201cThey want to be a little more unique.\u201dSo some Russian airports, including the three major ones that serve Moscow, often carry niche fragrance brands, like By Kilian and Escentric Molecules, according to Fatima Dzoblaeva, executive director of the Eurasian Duty Free Association. Fragrances by these brands tend to be quite pronounced.A popular option from By Kilian, for example, mixes a heady note of oud, the heady, wood-based note sometimes called aoud, with the scent of Turkish roses.Among the optimists about the future of travel, David Scowsill, president and chief executive of the World Travel & Tourism Council, notes that one significant event this summer actually had something of a silver lining for fragrance and duty-free companies.In Britain, \u201cthe short term effect of \u2018Brexit\u2019 is that sterling is now 15 percent cheaper than it was against the dollar,\u201d he said, referring to Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. \u201cFor Americans coming to the U.K., and it\u2019s same for the Europeans, it\u2019s a great bargain place, because your money goes further.\u201dAnd fragrance sales at Heathrow, Britain\u2019s busiest airport, with 75 million passengers last year, have been outpacing those of 2014; from Jan. 1 through Sept. 1, average monthly sales increased by almost 50,000 bottles, according to the airport.Advertisement"}

And the Socialists did so only to avoid another national election, in which they stood to take a serious drubbing.Other than that, nothing has changed since national elections last December and again in June denied Mr. Rajoy the parliamentary majority he had enjoyed since 2011.

Now he can form a government, but neither the Socialists nor the far-left Podemos party \u2014 one of two upstart parties that helped create the gridlock \u2014 are in any mood to help him get much done.And there\u2019s a lot that needs to get done.

Growth is above 3 percent, tourists have arrived in record numbers and unemployment has nudged downward. That may be evidence that a mature democracy needs not panic in periods of political uncertainty (which should be welcome news in some other Western capitals). But it is not proof that a country can get by for long without a responsible government. Letting Mr. Rajoy take charge only to make it impossible for him to act makes little sense.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video Review: Ford Fusion Hybrid Combines Savings and Style", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byDrivenThere was a time not so very long ago when a vehicle\u2019s high fuel economy was something worth bragging about (you know who you are, Prius owners). Then gasoline became cheap and hybrids began stacking up like so much cordwood on dealership lots. Some buyers still seek lofty miles-per-gallon numbers, but the clear trend has been toward bigger, thirsty vehicles. At least until gas hits $4 again.But why wait for that? There are fuel misers available that are roomy, refined and fetching in the looks department. One example is Ford\u2019s Fusion Hybrid.With seating for five, the car has handsome chiseled lines that pay the Aston Martin design team a great compliment. I would say Fusion, Chevy Malibu and Kia Optima are the lookers when it comes to hybrid sedans. Less comely, but rounding out the list of four-doors with gas/electric powertrains, are the Hyundai Sonata, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.Design might be subjective, but numbers are hard and cold. Spending a week with a top-of-the-line Fusion Platinum, I easily achieved nearly 41 miles per gallon with a moderate throttle foot. That\u2019s in the ballpark of the 43 city, 41 highway E.P.A. rating. A lighter touch on the pedals returned 44 m.p.g. in town.Toyota\u2019s new Prius clobbers the Fusion\u2019s efficiency numbers. (I saw 51 m.p.g. in the current generation.) Another Prius advantage is the trunk, because Toyota tucks the battery beneath the back seat. Its useful hatchback and flat floor gobbles stuff easily, while the limitation of the Fusion\u2019s sedan design is further hampered by the lump of its 1.4-kWh lithium-ion pack in the cargo hold. At least the Fusion\u2019s seats split and fold, which extends the trunk room.With deep low-end torque, this machine feels quick enough off the line in urban traffic, but the power curve drops off as speed climbs. With zero-to-60 runs clocking in at about 9 seconds, the Hybrid is about fuel economy. If you want fast from a Fusion, go with the new turbo V6 Sport model.In motion, Fusion\u2019s dynamic is classic hybrid operation. Generally, the car gets going using the AC motor, and then the gas engine smoothly feathers in. Apparently, speeds up to 85 m.p.h. are possible on electric alone, but it wasn\u2019t something I and my heavy right foot experienced. The battery is charged while coasting and braking; the cylinders shut down at stoplights.Only a princess who can feel a pea under a stack of mattresses would notice the transitions between gas and electric. But people of all sorts will probably notice seemingly random whirring and humming from the powertrain. (It\u2019s faint and not a deal breaker.) The brake pedal feel while making the transition from power regeneration is fairly graceful.A base Fusion S Hybrid costs $26,060. My tester was the top-of-the-line Platinum edition, adding nearly $12,000 to the price.It might be worth the upgrade. In addition to all kinds of desirable safety features (adaptive cruise control, semiautonomous parking, lane-keeping assistance and auto braking with pedestrian detection), the Platinum provides a fair amount of eye candy in the cabin. There is stitching on the instrument panel, diamond quilting on the climate-controlled seats and trim that looks to be from real trees (but that wouldn\u2019t be ecologically responsible, would it?).Let us now bow our heads in deep appreciation: Most 2017 Fords get the Sync 3 infotainment system, a major leap over the MyFordTouch interface in touch responsiveness, processing speed and visual clarity. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are tossed in as well. The transmission selector has been replaced with a rotary knob that helps to clean up the center console, too.The generous back seat is distinctively comfortable with great thigh support (though at the Platinum level, those cushions really should be heated). Optima and Sonata offer that back-seat warmth and a panoramic glass roof that improves the ambience. The 12-volt and 115-volt power plug-ins can tackle the charging needs of any device.There is also a plug-in hybrid version of the Fusion called Energi. (Boy, does spell-check hate that name). The Energi will go 19 miles on electric power alone before defaulting to a standard hybrid mode, although its battery takes an even larger chunk out of the trunk.The standard Fusion Hybrid version offers high style with fuel economy to brag about. Just as long as you\u2019re not in a huge hurry.A review of the Ford Fusion Hybrid on the Automobiles page on Friday described the car\u2019s acceleration inaccurately. As it goes from 0 to 60 miles an hour, the rate of acceleration \u2014 not the momentum \u2014 slows.Advertisement"}

He noted last week that Ronald Reagan and Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill, Democrat of Massachusetts, struck major accords on Social Security and taxes in the 1980s, and that President Bill Clinton and congressional Republicans overhauled welfare and balanced the budget in the 1990s.\u201cDivided government is actually the best government,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cthe best time to tackle really difficult things, because it requires both sides to buy into it to make progress.\u201dSo why have the last six years of extremely divided government been one long series of legislative stalemates, shutdown showdowns and budget failures? Mr. McConnell blames President Obama, seen by many Republicans as a neophyte in dealing with Capitol Hill.\u201cNo one expected them to agree with everything that he did or tried to do, but Americans deserve better than the way Republicans behaved toward President Obama.\u201dThe price he paid was being driven from office by hard-right conservatives who were outraged at his willingness to compromise.Mr. Ryan, who has experienced some of the same difficulties with his party\u2019s right wing while managing to contain the dissension, is ready for an all-Republican government.\u201cWe\u2019re just at loggerheads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten some good things done. But the big things \u2014 poverty, the debt crisis, the economy, health care \u2014 these things are stuck in divided government, and that\u2019s why we think a unified Republican government\u2019s the way to go.\u201dThat view is in line with the perspective of someone who has been shaped by the House, where the majority has a strong hand and can force through legislation with little concern for the minority party\u2019s view.There have been recent examples of the setup Mr. Ryan would prefer. In the first two years of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, Democrats held a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate and a sizable majority in the House. Together, they did produce a flood of legislation, including the health care law, Wall Street regulation and the economic stimulus.Still, the enactment of those major initiatives along mainly partisan lines fed a fierce sense of retribution, a factor that eventually cost Democrats control of Congress and contributed to an increasingly poisonous political atmosphere.Many on Capitol Hill believe Mrs. Clinton has both the experience and love of the policy process that would allow her to forge a working relationship with congressional Republicans.Some lawmakers also think that perhaps the least plausible election outcome \u2014 a Trump presidency and a Democratic Senate \u2014 could produce some legislative gains.Whatever the new configuration of government, the incoming president and members of Congress will face real pressure to deliver from a public increasingly fed up with stasis in Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How \u2018The Birth of a Nation\u2019 Silences Black Women", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byBut the most celebrated representations of the rebellion leader, including a white abolitionist\u2019s 19th-century essay and Mr. Parker\u2019s film today, have all reimagined Turner\u2019s story as one that hinges on interracial rape. And though the race of both the villain and the victim of the rape have changed over time and have been dependent on the politics and era of the author, there has also been a strange uniformity.In all these narratives, the rapes of women, black or white, are the prime motivation for Turner\u2019s rebellion, while the women themselves are doubly marginalized. First, they are silenced by the violations against their bodies and then again when their victimization is cast as secondary to Turner\u2019s heroism, their voices sidelined to the plot of Turner\u2019s realization of his own manhood in the horror of slavery.In \u201cNat Turner\u2019s Insurrection,\u201d an 1861 essay by the abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Turner\u2019s wife is a slave who belonged to a different master. But the focus is on her husband, who \u201chad no more power to protect her than the man who lies bound upon a plundered vessel\u2019s deck has power to protect his wife on board the pirate-schooner disappearing in the horizon.\u201dMore than a century later, William Styron would take up the theme of sexual violence again in his 1967 novel, \u201cThe Confessions of Nat Turner.\u201d But instead of focusing on the vulnerability of Turner\u2019s wife and his impotency in the face of her assault, Styron erased her altogether, turning instead to a relationship between Turner and the teenager Margaret Whitehead. According to Gray, Whitehead is the only person that Turner admitted to killing in 1831. In the novel, Styron invents the story line of Turner\u2019s having several violent sexual fantasies about the blond teenager before ultimately killing her. Explaining his choices in 1992, Styron speculated that perhaps \u201cshe had tempted him sexually, goaded him in some unknown way, and out of this situation flowed his rage.\u201dThe group\u2019s members included the actor Ossie Davis, who cited the lynching of thousands of black men in the South, \u201cthe rationale of such activities being that these men constituted a threat to white womanhood.\u201d He asked, \u201cAre we that clear of our horror at the thought of a black male lusting after white flesh?\u201dThe group was eventually able to get the script rewritten and Styron\u2019s title removed. But Fox (which, through its Fox Searchlight unit, is now the distributor of \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d) eventually pulled the plug on the movie, in part because some white residents of Southampton County in Virginia did not like Styron\u2019s portrayal of slave masters.It would take nearly 50 more years, the threat of a new boycott and a rape controversy before audiences would be able to see Nat Turner onscreen.In many ways, Mr. Parker\u2019s film is the redeeming antithesis of Styron\u2019s novel. Cherry (Aja Naomi King) becomes Turner\u2019s love interest and eventually his wife after he persuades Samuel Turner, his owner, to purchase her on the auction block and save her from the ravaging hands of other slave masters. Their romance is the main frame for the movie, making her sexual assault and brutal beating by three white men all the more devastating.And though Turner\u2019s political evolution is catalyzed when he travels to other plantations and witnesses slaves\u2019 degradations, his conversion to insurrectionist is fully cemented when Cherry gives him permission to avenge her rape.The rape, at the hands of a white man visiting Samuel\u2019s plantation, takes place offscreen \u2014 Esther quietly enters and exits the master\u2019s house, her trauma implied by her sunken stare and her collapse into the arms of her husband, Hark. For Esther, we can assume only that this is the final blow to her dignity; for Hark and Turner, we see something else: their transformation into men emboldened enough to fully defy their master.\u201cThere should be a better understanding of the sexual economy of slavery \u2014 one that pushes us beyond simple patriarchal notions of black men\u2019s inability to protect black women,\u201d Crystal Feimster, a Yale history professor, said. Rape, she added, \u201chad everything to do with sexual exploitation of enslaved women\u2019s productive and reproductive labor.\u201dTheir silence also has another function in \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d: It mutes their ability to act, rendering their rebellion virtually nonexistent in a film about revolt and freedom. In denying these women their revolutionary gestures, Mr. Parker risks making them objects that he, and only he, can freely move around the screen. By contrast, WGN America\u2019s breakout hit \u201cUnderground\u201d offers a more nuanced look at a woman\u2019s resistance: The slave Rosalee (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) stabs a white overseer who tried to attack her, and she eventually becomes an abolitionist.\u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d is also out of step with the cause it has often been associated with, Black Lives Matter, which has steadfastly resisted the model of a single charismatic male leader and has primarily been led by African-American women.\u201cTurner\u2019s heroism does not have to come at the expense of black women,\u201d Ms. Feimster said. African-Americans\u2019 struggle for freedom \u201cis about so much more than valorizing black manhood. We will miss so many stories, lose so many narratives, when we only see these one-dimensional characters.\u201dAn article on Oct. 16 about the film \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d misstated a plot point of the WGN show \u201cUnder-ground.\u201d The slave Rosalee, played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell, stabs a white overseer who tried to attack her; she does not kill him.Salamishah Tillet is an associate professor of English and Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Antigraft Enforcers Take On a New Role: Policing Loyalty", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The investigators descend on government agencies and corporate boardrooms. They interrogate powerful officials and frequently rebuke them for lacking zeal. Most of all, they demand unflinching loyalty to President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party.They are the inspectors from the party\u2019s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and the humbling displays they have orchestrated recently in many of China\u2019s most influential government agencies and largest corporations are the most prominent sign of their expanding authority.Best known as the country\u2019s anticorruption agency, the commission has lately assumed a growing role as political inquisitor, investigating the loyalty and commitment of cadres to Mr. Xi and his agenda, while cementing the commission\u2019s role as his chief political enforcer.The move reflects Mr. Xi\u2019s ambitions and fears as he prepares for a second five-year term as national leader, and has confirmed the rise of the commission and its formidable secretary, Wang Qishan, a longtime ally of Mr. Xi now seen by many as the second-most powerful official in China.The commission\u2019s investigators have shown a taste for chastening displays of power in what has become a ritual of rebuke and repentance.At the Ministry of Public Security headquarters in Beijing this month, for instance, hundreds of officers were marched into a cavernous auditorium to listen to investigators excoriate senior ministry officials for lacking \u201cpolitical judgment\u201d and demand greater loyalty to Mr. Xi and the party.Another notable target was the Propaganda Department, which the commission censured in June, saying that it \u201clacked vigor\u201d and that \u201cthe political awareness of some leading officials has not been high.\u201dThe criticism of such a powerful arm of the party fueled speculation of a factional rift at the top of Mr. Xi\u2019s government. But dozens of other party and government agencies have faced similar reprimands.The discipline commission has even taken a role in enforcing Mr. Xi\u2019s economic policies, including efforts to cut back gluts of coal, steel and other industrial products.But the core of its work is about loyalty to the party and its top leadership, referred to as the party center.Underlying the push for stricter loyalty is fear, the leadership\u2019s nagging nightmare of the Communist Party\u2019s crumbling in a Soviet-style collapse.Some officials have been publicly swearing to uphold his \u201cabsolute authority.\u201dMr. Wang, with Mr. Xi\u2019s backing, has freed the commission of organizational shackles that once allowed local officials to stymie it, and he has taken to the task with enthusiasm.He told them that the pressure would not let up. \u201cI\u2019ve said there\u2019ll be no end to this, because if there\u2019s a backlash, there\u2019ll be big problems,\u201d he said.On a practical level, the anticorruption campaign has deprived thousands of local officials of illicit income, eliciting discontent that the loyalty campaign aims to eradicate.So far there have been no signs of public backlash to the campaign. But there are fears that it risks undermining Mr. Xi\u2019s efforts to rejuvenate the economy.As the discipline commission has taken a role in enforcing economic policies, censuring state-controlled companies and banks, foreign investors have become worried about the effects on their Chinese business partners and clients.American businesses should not tolerate corruption, he said, but \u201cwe are very much concerned about the expanding scope and uncertain duration of C.C.D.I. investigations, which appears to have extended nationwide and to practically every sector of the economy.\u201dMore broadly, the centralization of power, incessant inspections and demands for conformity have sapped the morale of government officials, experts and investors said. China\u2019s past spurts of economic rejuvenation often came from letting officials take risks, but the relentless pressure for loyalty to the top has instilled caution.\u201cThere is widespread inaction from local elites and local governments,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody opposes, but nobody does anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Remote Job Comes With Free Land and a Sense of Community. 50,000 Apply.", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byWhycocomagh JournalThe family expected a few dozen responses; more than 50,000 poured in \u2014 and the calls keep coming.\u201cI expected a response, just not one as huge as this,\u201d said Sandee MacLean, a woman with multiple tattoos and copper red hair, who came up with the idea with her sister.Of course, Canada has a lot of land, but not a lot of people, and economically sleepy regions like Cape Breton in Nova Scotia have steadily leaked population. The island, a scenic 4,000-square-mile patch of rolling forest and farmland jutting into the northern Atlantic Ocean, has only about 130,000 residents and has been losing well over 1,000 people a year for the last two decades.As Cape Bretoners become increasingly frantic about stemming the tide of outward migration, giving away land just might be a solution.\u201cIt is validation that land is an attraction,\u201d said Chris van den Heuvel, president of the Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture. He hopes the strong response to the giveaway will help his group\u2019s effort to create a land bank that would make farmland affordable and bring newcomers to the province.Several economically depressed communities in the United States have tried the same idea in recent years, including towns in Iowa, Kansas and Minnesota.There is a long history of giving land away. European powers that wanted to populate their New World possessions, as well as Canada and the United States in their youth, gave land to anyone who would settle on it and make improvements.All of that was far from mind when Jim and Ferne Austin decided to turn their store over to their daughters this year. For the two women, Ms. MacLean and Heather Austin Coulombe, the most immediate concern was where to find employees.\u201cWe were in a panic, we were so short staffed,\u201d Ms. Coulombe said.The Austins opened the business, the Farmer\u2019s Daughter Country Market, in 1992 in Whycocomagh, Nova Scotia, after a life spent dairy farming. The combination bakery, produce market, ice cream parlor, fudge factory and gift shop now occupies a collection of barn-red buildings along the side of the road on a quiet stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway.Mr. Austin\u2019s father, also a dairy farmer, had amassed more than 600 acres; after sell-offs, about 200 acres remain. The land that is left is mostly mountain woodland \u2014 pretty to see, but not of much value unless it were logged. No one in the family wants to shave the hillsides for that.By the end of this summer, the country market was down by three full-time workers, making it difficult to meet a local grocery chain\u2019s demand for baked goods from the Farmer\u2019s Daughter. The baking business helps the operation stay afloat in the bleak winter months.Ms. MacLean and Ms. Coulombe tried hiring locally, but said capable and dependable hands were not available. The visa process for foreign workers was too cumbersome, too.That was when they came up with the idea of giving away land.The women put together a questionnaire that emphasized commitment and values and made it clear that the land they were giving away was remote and well off the grid.In about 500 words they offered a job, community and two acres of land to anyone who would come and work at the market for five years. They have since raised the offer to three acres to allow for a septic system.By morning, the appeal had been shared 200 times. By afternoon, a local radio station had called for an interview. Soon national radio and television stations were calling and the land offer was the top trending news story on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s website. When the report was picked up around the world, the floodgates opened.The sisters had already zeroed in on several candidates well before their appeal went viral. Within a week of the original post, they had interviewed the people they eventually hired.The newcomers consist of three families: the Andersens, the Walkinses and the Taits, who arrived in time for Canada\u2019s Thanksgiving on Oct. 10. The Austins, the parents of the sisters who are taking over the store, invited them all to their home for a traditional feast, the biggest Thanksgiving dinner they had ever put on, they said.Over plates of turkey and turnips and local condiments like the Farmer\u2019s Daughter Cape Breton chow (a relish made with green tomatoes), the families appeared to blend effortlessly.All three families said that it was the promise of community in a simpler, beautiful place that was the biggest attraction. Each parcel of land is worth only a few thousand Canadian dollars, and Cape Breton has plenty of land for sale.\u201cI never even asked about the land,\u201d said Sonja Andersen, a mortgage broker who drove nine days across the country from Vancouver, British Columbia, with her 10-year-old daughter and two dogs.Micah Tait said that he and his wife, Trish, had long dreamed of making such a move. \u201cEverything was exactly what we were hoping to work toward, and we just took a sort of shortcut,\u201d he said.Both said they missed the \u201cfeeling of belonging\u201d in their life in Vancouver, where they worked as security guards.When Brett Walkins lost his job in British Columbia as a project manager building wastewater treatment plants, he and his wife, Kerry, sold their house, bought a truck and a camper-trailer, and headed down the North American coast.Months later, having traversed the continent with two children and two dogs, they were on Prince Edward Island, west of Cape Breton, biting their nails over bidding on a new house.\u201cAn hour after we found out someone else had bought the house, I saw the Farmer\u2019s Daughter post,\u201d Ms. Walkins said. Mr. Walkins emailed that day under the subject line \u201ccommunity opportunity.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what spoke to me,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be welcomed into what we could tell was a close-knit family.\u201dMr. Walkins has already walked on the land, accessible by a muddy logging road, looking for a building site, while his wife has taken up her duties baking pies and making fudge. The couple plan to construct a solar-powered, self-sustaining home.The new arrivals have challenges ahead. They arrived in the midst of Cape Breton\u2019s beautiful fall foliage display, but a long frigid winter and then the region\u2019s famous black fly season await.Along with an uptick in business, the publicity has had other consequences for the Farmer\u2019s Daughter. A local couple have offered the sisters 42 acres they do not use. Television producers have called to talk about a possible reality show or, more to the sisters\u2019 tastes, a documentary series tracking the newcomers\u2019 integration into the community and their development of the land.The Whycocomagh Journal article on Oct. 21, about a land-rich family on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, who had an overwhelming response to their offer of free land to anyone who would work at their country store for five years, misspelled the surname of one of the families who took the offer. They are the Andersens, not the Andersons. The same error appeared in a picture caption with the article. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the occupation of Sonja Andersen, one of the arrivals. She is a mortgage broker, not a former mortgage banker.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Blurs the European Investment Outlook", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byWhen the British voted in a referendum to leave the European Union, it clouded the political outlook across the region, and that made the economic and investment outlook far murkier, too.It\u2019s still too early to tell, even three months after the vote, how much of an impact the so-called Brexit is likely to have on economic and business conditions, investment advisers say. Calm has been restored, they acknowledge, but they warn that long-term risks remain in Europe, Britain most of all, for businesses and therefore for investors, too.The investment outlook is \u201ca lot less favorable\u201d in Britain, said Alan Mudie, head of investment strategy at Societe Generale Private Banking Hambros. Until companies have clarity about their longer-term relationship with the European Union, they will delay investments, he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense not to, until they know what sort of marketplace they\u2019re going to be operating in.\u201dSarah Ketterer, manager of the Causeway International Value fund, agreed that \u201cfrom an investment perspective, everything is delayed.\u201d As a result, she said she was \u201cmaking very conservative assumptions\u201d about conditions in Britain, and she predicted a mild recession in 2017.She is not alone, and Britain may not be, either, when it comes to the consequences of Brexit. The British bank Barclays warned that Brexit is likely to create substantial headwinds for economies in Britain and on the Continent in coming months.Highlighting surveys showing that corporations\u2019 plans to invest declined markedly and that consumer confidence had eroded, Barclays forecast that the British economy would be pushed into a recession imminently.As for Europe over all, \u201cwe expect growth to slow further towards year-end, as Brexit weighs on confidence, private consumption and investment,\u201d the bank said in an economics report in August. Reaction to the vote in regional economic and confidence data had been muted, the report said. But: \u201cMost forward-looking components showed that expectations had resumed their downward trend, and we expect confidence to be further affected in the months to come. Uncertainty is likely to weigh on investment, with a negative feedback loop on the labor market and private consumption.\u201dThe initial reaction to the Brexit vote was much starker. Many people assumed that Brexit would be awful for the country, the region and beyond. The result was plunging stock markets and currencies almost everywhere.The MSCI Europe index fell 13 percent in the two trading days after the June 23 referendum, and the MSCI index of British stocks fell 15.7 percent. The indexes are calculated in dollars, so those figures incorporate the declines in stocks and also in the euro and the pound against the dollar.Within a week, both indexes had recovered more than half of the losses, although it is unclear why. A new British prime minister had taken over and pledged to honor the decision to leave the 28-nation bloc, but everything else related to Britain\u2019s departure was still up in the air. The outlook had not changed, only the public\u2019s feelings about it.Markets in the region have stabilized, helping investors who hung on for the wild ride. Funds that specialize in European stocks rose 5.3 percent in the third quarter, according to Morningstar.But where investors, and businesses, go from here is much less certain.What makes the post-referendum outlook especially hard to gauge for businesses is that Britain has yet to make clear how it intends to honor the result. A report by Brewin Dolphin, a British wealth management firm, suggested that the new government of Prime Minister Theresa May would have to thread a very slender needle as it tries to keep the country in the single European market for goods and services while imposing limits on immigration.How it will go about accomplishing that could become clearer next spring. Mrs. May said earlier this month that Britain would invoke Article 50 in March. That is a European Union treaty provision that governs the process for a country to leave the union.Evidence of the concern among businesses can be found in a Bank of England survey taken just after the vote. It reported that \u201ccompanies indicated the result of the E.U. referendum would have a negative effect, overall, on capital spending, hiring and turnover over the coming year.\u201d It added that \u201cemployment and investment intentions had weakened in absolute terms, pointing to expectations of little change in staff numbers and capital spending over the coming six to 12 months.\u201dJames Hunt, manager of the Tocqueville International Value fund, is willing to give the economy and stocks in Britain and the rest of Europe some benefit of doubt when it comes to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, if and when it occurs.\u201cThe market reaction is overdone,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cBrexit may not happen. There are plenty of ways the U.K. government can cause it not to happen\u201d through what it asks for, and when, in its negotiations with the union.If Brexit goes ahead, \u201cthere will be a moderate impact on the U.K. initially and then I think they could end up in a better place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a smaller impact on the European economy, and what I hope is that it\u2019s another incentive for Europe to accelerate whatever structural reforms they have going.\u201dSome businesses and investors in Europe have waited \u2014 and hoped \u2014 for many years for government initiatives to reduce regulatory hurdles and to make labor cheaper and employment more flexible, which would improve competitiveness and economic growth.The prospect of Britain leaving the European Union could concentrate the minds of political leaders, but Ms. Ketterer said many large companies are tired of hanging around and are undertaking changes of their own. That fact tends to get lost amid the apprehension over factors such as Brexit, creating what she sees as solid investment opportunities, particularly in large, European, multinational companies in economically fragile sectors.\u201cWe might have to wait awhile for governments to restructure, but these companies aren\u2019t waiting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really like these globally competitive, cyclical companies. They are really well managed and cheaper\u201d than shares of equivalent American companies.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.The preference for large British companies that make money abroad is widespread. Mr. Hunt likes the beverage purveyor Diageo, for instance. Its \u201ccash flows are global, and the perceived connection to the U.K. is greater than it really is,\u201d he said.A globally diversified revenue stream should inoculate such companies against weakness in the pound, a development that provides British exporters with a substantial competitive advantage over their peers elsewhere by making British goods and services cheaper to foreign customers, Mr. Mudie of Societe Generale pointed out. That is a prime reason that he also favors large British companies.Within the eurozone, he recommends health care and consumer sectors. Consumer stocks should benefit from a continuing decline in unemployment and improved access to bank credit, he said. Considering the markets more broadly, he anticipates American stocks outperforming their European peers, with British stocks doing better than ones on the Continent.Ms. Ketterer said she is taking a chance on British financial companies. A post-Brexit reduction in interest rates by the Bank of England hit their stocks especially hard; banks\u2019 profits depend on the spread between rates at which they borrow and lend, which is squeezed when rates fall, and insurance companies\u2019 profits depend on the income paid on the bonds in which they invest their policyholders\u2019 premiums. But the decline in bank and insurance stocks has been so severe, in her view, that they warrant a bet.Ms. Ketterer likes the British insurance companies Prudential and Aviva. Among British multinationals, she said the energy company Shell is appealing for its high yet secure dividend yield of close to 7 percent.But how big a bargain any European stock is may not become clear until the uncertainty surrounding Brexit abates. As Ms. Ketterer reminds investors, that could take awhile.\u201cThe initial shock has worn off\u201d since the referendum, she said. But \u201cin the U.K. nothing has been settled. There\u2019s a very long road ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facing \u2018Brexit,\u2019 Lawmakers Ask How to \u2018Make Britain Great Again\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byMemo From BritainLONDON \u2014 Once upon a time, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, there was a royal yacht, upon which Her Majesty the Queen, Elizabeth II, who also reigns over Canada, Australia and New Zealand and heads the Commonwealth, would sail upon the waters.The royal yacht, Britannia, 412 feet long and 139 feet tall, was launched in 1953 and traveled more than a million nautical miles.Alas, the yacht proved rather expensive to maintain, and while the Conservative Party had promised to replace Britannia, the Labour Party won the 1997 general election and decommissioned it, in a ceremony that led the queen to shed public tears.But with Britain\u2019s vote in June to leave the European Union, a decision known as Brexit, there is a strong move in the Conservative Party to bring back the glory of empire \u2014 and the royal yacht.\u201cI think we have to ask ourselves what sort of Britain we want to live in and what we can do,\u201d Jake Berry, a lawmaker, said Tuesday in Parliament, \u201cto make Britain great again.\u201d His answer? \u201cIf Brexit is going to mean successful Brexit, it should also mean the return of our royal yacht!\u201dThe Conservative benches loudly murmured their approval, and about 100 Tory lawmakers supported the motion \u2014 roughly the same number who fiercely backed Brexit before the referendum, giving former Prime Minister David Cameron fits.Many of them have dreams of a wholly sovereign Britain with all the old symbols of this island nation\u2019s empire, when \u201cBritannia ruled the waves\u201d \u2014 the royal yacht, the old dark blue British passport, the supreme power of Parliament. And even though the Brexit supporters won, they remain combative, suspicious that Mr. Cameron\u2019s successor, Theresa May, who quietly opposed Brexit, will somehow betray them. And they have no intention of giving up in their desire for a clear break with Brussels.With the same small majority in Parliament, Mrs. May is thus as vulnerable to intraparty parliamentary pressure as Mr. Cameron was. If the vote was meant to \u201creclaim\u201d full British and parliamentary sovereignty from those supposedly faceless Brussels bureaucrats, then, these same lawmakers argue, Mrs. May should consult them on every aspect of Britain\u2019s negotiating position with the European Union.\u201cI and many others did not exercise our vote in the referendum so as to restore the sovereignty of this Parliament only to see what we regarded as the tyranny of the European Union replaced by that of a government,\u201d said Stephen Phillips, a Conservative.But Mrs. May insists that to have successful negotiations, she must maintain a kind of radio silence and not provide \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the talks. For that reason, she says, she will not ask Parliament to vote on invoking Article 50, and the High Court held hearings on Thursday in a lawsuit testing the constitutionality of her position. Of course, she will have to secure Parliament\u2019s approval for any final deal.Mrs. May did agree, in what was widely labeled a concession, to let Tories vote for a debate on Brexit called for by the opposition Labour Party, while emphasizing that Parliament should not \u201cundermine the negotiating position of the government.\u201dWhatever that turns out to be.At the moment, there is no plan, just a set of arguments and political positioning. And there is little reference yet to the views and interests of the Europe outside Britain, with which Britain will finally have to negotiate, once it finishes negotiating with itself.Along with a 17 percent drop in the pound against the dollar since the June vote, inflation is beginning to rise and banks are talking openly about moving their headquarters out of London to remain in the European Union. In this atmosphere of anxiety among business leaders and foreign exchanges, Mrs. May\u2019s silence on substance disguises another of her problems: fierce divisions within her own government about what negotiating position to take.Despite her quiet opposition to Brexit, she publicly endorsed the referendum and put three prominent Brexit supporters in charge of crucial ministries. For the most part, like their parliamentary supporters, they are pressing for a \u201chard Brexit,\u201d a clean break with the European Union that would end unlimited migration from Europe to Britain and give up membership in the single market or even a customs union with the rest of the bloc.But other ministers, including Philip Hammond, the powerful chancellor of the Exchequer, are eager to preserve Britain as an area of free trade and protect the services sector of the economy, which represents about 80 percent of Britain\u2019s gross domestic product.Financial services alone \u2014 dominated by the City of London, the capital\u2019s financial district \u2014 represent 10 percent of G.D.P. and a large share of government tax receipts, and already some large banks and investment houses are discussing alternatives to London to preserve their access to the European Union.Paris, Frankfurt and Dublin are not-so-quietly jostling for what many believe will be a sustained slow bleed from London, but well-paid bankers are wary of France\u2019s high taxes and consider the night life of Dublin and Frankfurt far too dull. Some think New York will be the ultimate beneficiary.And while some favoring Brexit suggest that German carmakers, for instance, will seek duty-free status for Britain in any future deal, Britain is largely postindustrial, with trade in goods representing only about 20 percent of the economy.But to maintain some access to the single market would almost surely mean continuing to pay into the budget of the European Union and probably accepting a high degree of free movement of European citizens, which Brexit supporters would regard as betrayal.Mrs. May herself has said very little, other than that Britain must limit migration and strive for \u201cthe maximum possible access to the European market for firms to trade with and operate within,\u201d which is more aspirational than substantive.So the battle inside the government must be resolved before Britain can begin what will be unequal negotiations with the European Union, which is waiting for a British position before responding. The leaders of France and Germany have made it clear that Britain will not emerge with a better deal after voting to leave the union.Speaking in Paris last week, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France insisted: \u201cThere must be a threat, there must be a risk, there must be a price. Otherwise we will be in a negotiation that cannot end well.\u201dTrying to calm financial markets, Mrs. May\u2019s aides say the prime minister has not ruled out anything.The Memo From Britain article on Oct. 14, about efforts by British conservatives to force Prime Minister Theresa May to consult them about every aspect of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, misstated, in some editions, the month that Britons voted on exiting the bloc. It was June, not July.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Over 190 Countries Adopt Plan to Offset Air Travel Emissions", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byGovernments from more than 190 countries on Thursday adopted a measure that for the first time will reduce the climate impact of international jet travel.The accord adds an exclamation point to a week in which enough countries signed onto the broader Paris climate deal to ensure that it will enter into force later this year.The aviation plan, the product of years of negotiations, was approved by acclamation at a meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization, or I.C.A.O., in Montreal.The measure could force air carriers to take major steps to improve fuel economy in their routes and fleets, very likely accelerating the purchase of newer, more efficient planes.Carriers may pass the cost of the program on to consumers in higher airfares, though most experts think any increases would be relatively small.Leaders hailed the accord, which will take effect in 2021, as a major step in reducing the environmental impact of international aviation, which is currently responsible for about 2 percent of worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases.Secretary of State John Kerry called the measure \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said it built on the Paris agreement and other international efforts to reduce emissions.\u201cThis measure addresses a growing source of global emissions, demonstrates the international community\u2019s strong and growing support for climate action in all areas and helps avoid a patchwork of potentially costly and overlapping regional and national measures,\u201d Mr. Kerry said in a statement.The aviation measure will be voluntary for the first six years, and even countries that commit to it voluntarily will be allowed to opt out on relatively short notice.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Under the program, airlines will buy credits to offset emissions from individual flights. The credits will come from alternative energy installations, forest conservation programs and other projects that prevent some amount of greenhouse gas emissions.But critics point to several possible problems.Some environmental groups said the plan did not go far enough, forecasting that it would fall short of the goal originally set by the aviation organization to offset all of the growth in emissions from air travel after 2020.At least 65 nations, including the United States, China and the European Union countries, have signaled that they will participate during the voluntary phase of the measure.The measure exempts many smaller countries that do not have large international air carriers, and because of rules on competition, that could mean that some popular routes from participating countries could be exempt as well.Several countries that are significant sources of international air travel, including Russia and India, on Thursday expressed formal reservations about the agreement, indicating they would not participate, at least for now.Critics and supporters of the measure alike noted that much work remains to be done before the agreement is put into effect. Mechanisms must be developed to monitor and report current emissions, and criteria established to select conservation programs and other projects that will count toward offset credits.The aviation industry has supported the idea of mitigating the climate impact of its jet engines. Manufacturers have taken steps to improve the efficiency of current engines, and some carriers have begun replacing some of their conventional jet fuel with cleaner-burning biofuels.Some airlines have also encouraged environmentally conscious passengers to buy offsets voluntarily for their flights. Under the new measure, the airlines would buy the offsets, and they could pass the cost on to all passengers. But one estimate by the aviation organization forecasts that by 2025 the annual cost to airlines would be less than 1 percent of revenue.On Thursday, industry representatives welcomed adoption of the measure.Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, a coalition of manufacturers, carriers and other companies, said he was heartened by how many countries, including small developing countries with a lot at stake as climate change takes hold, had agreed to participate voluntarily.\u201cDespite some reservations over the scheme being voluntary in its initial years, the support of all these states \u2014 large, small, developed and developing \u2014 shows the commitment of the international community, working through I.C.A.O., to deliver a robust measure,\u201d Mr. Gill said in a statement.But an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research group, shows that the agreement as approved will offset only about three-quarters of the growth in emissions from international aviation above 2020 levels. That means the proposal falls short of the goal originally set by the International Civil Aviation Organization of \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d growth after 2020.Like the Science Times page on Facebook.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two New Books Spotlight the History and Consequences of the Suez Crisis", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byNonfictionBelow, David Frum\u2019s review of \u201cIke\u2019s Gamble,\u201d followed by Evan Thomas\u2019s review of \u201cBlood and Sand.\u201dReviewed by David FrumThis book is subversively revisionist history with sharp relevance to the present. Listen to whether this tale is familiar.A new administration comes to power, convinced that its predecessor has made a hash of Middle East policy. The new team\u2019s big idea: a bold diplomatic overture to the region\u2019s leading Muslim state. True, that leading Muslim state has a bad habit of sponsoring terrorism and threatening important allies. But the new team believes that much of this bad behavior is a response to provocations by the West and by Israel. Anyway, like it or not, the troublesome Muslim state represents the future, its local enemies outdated legacies of the past. By squeezing Israel and other allies for concessions, the United States could prove its own good faith \u2014 and get on the right side of history.This strategic perception gripped its believers so strongly that such terms as \u201cworldview\u201d fail to do it justice. Its proponents \u201cregarded it not as an intellectual construct but as a description of reality itself.\u201dBarack Obama and the ayatollahs\u2019 Iran? Yes. But before that, Dwight Eisenhower and Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s Egypt. The gamble of \u201cIke\u2019s Gamble,\u201d by Michael Doran, is the determined wooing of Nasser by the Eisenhower administration over its first four years in office. Why that gamble failed is the urgently timely question answered by this deeply researched, tightly argued and accessibly concise book.Hoping to stabilize the region, Doran argues, Eisenhower instead convulsed it. Seeking to assuage radicals, his administration instead empowered them.Doran, a senior director of the National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration and now at the Hudson Institute, is a leading expert on radical ideologies of the Middle East. He writes with the authority of the scholar and the familiarity of the senior policy adviser.In 1953, most of the Middle East was ruled by cautious, Western-aligned leaders who had come to power after World War I. They were backed by British military power. British troops protected the Suez Canal, through which oil from the Persian Gulf, also British-protected, moved to European markets.This inherited order began to dissolve in 1952. That summer, a group of nationalist military officers overthrew Egypt\u2019s monarchy. They reviled the government for its failure to destroy Israel, and for a too-cozy relationship with Britain and the West. Although only a colonel at the time of the coup, Nasser soon emerged as the new regime\u2019s dominant personality.The Eisenhower administration relied on the advice of officials who admired Nasser as a nationalist and anti-Communist: a secular modernizer, the long hoped-for \u201cArab Ataturk.\u201d The most important and forceful of the Nasser admirers was Kermit Roosevelt, the C.I.A. officer who had done so much in 1953 to restore to power in Iran that other secular modernizer, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.To befriend Nasser, the Eisenhower administration suggested a big increase in economic and military aid; pressed Israel to surrender much of the Negev to Egypt and Jordan; supported Nasser\u2019s demand that the British military vacate the canal zone; and clandestinely provided Nasser with much of the equipment \u2014 and many of the technical experts \u2014 who built his radio station Voice of the Arabs into the most influential propaganda network in the Arab-speaking world. Yet each of these overtures produced only grief \u2014 as Eisenhower himself soon came to learn.Offers of aid were leveraged by Nasser to extract better terms from the Soviet Union, his preferred military partner. Pressure on Israel did not impress Nasser, who wanted a permanent crisis he could exploit to mobilize Arab opinion behind him. Forcing Britain out of the canal zone in the mid-50s enabled Nasser to grab the canal itself in 1956. Rather than use his radio network to warn Arabs against Communism, Nasser employed it to inflame Arab opinion against the West\u2019s most reliable regional allies, the Hashemite monarchies, helping to topple Iraq\u2019s regime in 1958 and very nearly finishing off Jordan\u2019s.Bluntly put: Nasser had duped Eisenhower. \u201cNasser proved to be a complete stumbling block,\u201d Eisenhower confided to his diary as his Arab-Israeli peace efforts failed. \u201cHe is apparently seeking to be acknowledged as the political leader of the Arab world.\u201d He has concluded \u201che should just make speeches, all of which breathe defiance of Israel.\u201dEisenhower left office with anti-American regimes in power not only in Cairo, but also in Damascus and Baghdad. Eisenhower\u2019s humiliation of Britain and France in the Suez crisis of November 1956 weakened two allies \u2014 without gaining an iota of good will from Arab nationalists. Rather than cooperate with the United States against the Soviet Union, the Arab world\u2019s new nationalist strongmen were transfixed by their rivalries with one another. It was instead formerly despised Israel that emerged not only as America\u2019s most reliable ally but also as far and away the region\u2019s most capable military power. \u201cI never should have pressured Israel to evacuate the Sinai,\u201d Eisenhower lamented in 1965. He endorsed Israel\u2019s pre-emptive Six Day War of 1967 in an interview a few weeks after the fighting.As an enriched and empowered Iran becomes more aggressive abroad and more repressive at home, will such regrets eventually haunt President Obama too? That may depend more on the personality of the president than any external event.Eisenhower was a pragmatist in the strictest philosophical sense: someone who judges the truth of theories according to their success or failure in practice. He came to office holding one view of the Middle East. When that view failed, he discarded it in favor of another.But pragmatism of that kind is a very unusual trait, and especially unusual in politicians. Eisenhower may have rethought his gamble on Nasser. The subordinates who executed the policy, however, insisted to the end that any failure was somebody else\u2019s fault. Their self-justifications have reverberated into journalism and history.\u201cThe \u2018inside story\u2019 of the Eisenhower administration\u2019s Middle East policy,\u201d Doran writes, \u201ccomes to us not from Eisenhower and Dulles but from .\u2008.\u2008. the very men .\u2008.\u2008. who were most personally invested in the courtship of Nasser, and who fought against all efforts to abandon it. .\u2008.\u2008. Muscular Western policies, we learn, will almost always backfire.\u201dWith only a very few edits and updates, this mode of analysis will serve marvelously to excuse any disappointments in the Iran legacy the current generation of policy makers may leave behind. Here\u2019s the lesson that Doran wishes they would learn instead: the error of the belief \u201cthat distancing the United States from Israel would win the good will of all Arabs, and especially the Egyptians.\u201d This belief \u201cprevented them from recognizing the deepest drivers of the Arab and Muslim states, namely their rivalries with each other for power and authority.\u201dAmericans wish to solve problems \u2014 and they are accordingly always quick to assume that problems must have solutions. Does a nation express grievances against the United States? Mollify them with concessions and compromises. Do the grievances sound irrational? Begin a process of trust-building that can lead to more fruitful dialogue. Do they traffic in imperial fantasies and threats of genocidal violence? Downplay those as overheated rhetoric for domestic consumption.After all, that\u2019s how Americans behave. And isn\u2019t everybody on earth fundamentally like us? Not so much, Doran warns. \u201cThe Middle East is in the throes of an historical crisis, a prolonged period of instability. American policy can exacerbate or ameliorate the major conflicts, but .\u2008.\u2008. in the Middle East, it is prudent to assume that the solution to every problem will inevitably generate new problems. Like Sisyphus, the United States has no choice but to push the boulder up a hill whose pinnacle remains forever out of reach.\u201dDoran\u2019s profoundly humbling message will not be very welcome to ambitious policy makers of any political stripe. For that reason, it is all the more valuable as the Obama administration leaves office unchastened by adverse experience \u2014 and its potential successors assess the grim options they inherit.David Frum, a senior editor at The Atlantic and chairman of the British think tank Policy Exchange, was a speechwriter for President George W. Bush in 2001-02.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6Reviewed by Evan ThomasIn the mid-19th century, the historian Thomas Carlyle popularized the Great Man Theory, arguing that history was made by the heroism of soldiers and statesmen. The Great Man Theory has long since been junked by academics, if not popular historians. The course of history, the scholars say, owes more to impersonal forces and serendipity than to the efforts of some dead white males. That is true enough, but from time to time, at critical instances, great men have made a difference, for better or for worse.The Suez crisis of 1956 was one of the moments. It began as a last gasp of colonialism, a plot by Britain and France, working with Israel, to reclaim the Suez Canal, recently nationalized by Egypt. The scheme was the fruit of human folly, principally and most notably that of the British prime minister, Anthony Eden.The grand conspiracy was doomed to fail. The canal was blocked for months, causing a crippling oil shortage in Europe. The Arab-Israeli conflict worsened, and the Muslim world was inflamed against its old overlords in the West with lasting consequences. The botched invasion occurred just as the Soviet Union was crushing a rebellion in Hungary, its Eastern bloc satellite. When the Kremlin, seeing the opportunity to divert international attention from its own outrages, issued a letter widely interpreted as a threat to attack London and Paris with nuclear weapons, the great powers seemed for an instant to be lurching toward World War III.The turmoil and danger created by the Suez crisis and the Hungarian rebellion have largely faded from popular memory. With \u201cBlood and Sand,\u201d Alex von Tunzelmann, an Oxford-educated historian with an eye for human detail as well as a sure-handed grasp of the larger picture, does a marvelous job of recreating the tension and bungling that swept up Cairo, London, Moscow, Budapest, Paris and Washington during the harrowing two weeks of Oct. 22 to Nov. 6, 1956.The background of the crisis was complex, and some readers may get slightly dizzy as the author corkscrews back in time from her gripping narrative. But the ultimate reward is a deeper understanding of the forces at work, as well as a wild ride down a zigzag trail left by the flailing of men with bloated and broken egos.Von Tunzelmann begins her yarn with an arresting anecdote related by Anthony Nutting, a minister in the British Foreign Office. It was March 1956, and Nutting had been working on a plan to lessen the influence of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the charismatic president of postcolonial Egypt. Interrupted at dinner at the Savoy Hotel, Nutting took a call from Prime Minister Eden. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this nonsense about isolating Nasser or \u2018neutralizing\u2019 him, as you call it?\u201d Eden said, shouting over the phone. \u201cI want him murdered, can\u2019t you understand?\u201d Nutting (in his own telling) began to protest but Eden insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t want an alternative. And I don\u2019t give a damn if there\u2019s anarchy and chaos in Egypt.\u201d Then the prime minister hung up.Eden is a tragic if rather unappealing figure in von Tunzelmann\u2019s account. Bred to his class at Eton and Oxford, he looked the part of a perfect gentleman. He took first-class honors in Persian and Arabic at Oxford, and during his career at the Foreign Office, he had shown sensitivity to the emergence of nationalism in the Middle East. He had served bravely on the Western Front in World War I and capably as Winston Churchill\u2019s foreign secretary during World War II.But he was not well. \u201cHis flashes of temper and fragile nerves led some to wonder about his genetic inheritance,\u201d von Tunzelmann writes. \u201cHis baronet father had been such an extreme eccentric \u2014 complete with episodes of \u2018uncontrolled rages,\u2019 falling to the floor, biting carpets and hurling flowerpots through plate-glass windows \u2014 that even the Wodehousian society of early-20th-century upper-class England had noticed something was up.\u201dAs prime minister, Sir Anthony took to calling ministers in the middle of the night to ask if they had read a particular newspaper article. \u201cMy nerves are already at breaking point,\u201d he told his civil servants. In October 1956, he collapsed physically for a few days. According to one of his closest aides, he used amphetamines as well as heavy painkillers, and a Whitehall official said he was \u201cpractically living on Benzedrine.\u201dHe was obsessed with Egypt\u2019s Nasser, the leader of a group of nationalist army officers who had deposed the pro-British monarchy in 1952 and seized the British- and French-controlled Suez Canal in July 1956. About two-thirds of Europe\u2019s oil was transported through the canal; Nasser had his \u201cthumb on our windpipe,\u201d Eden fumed. Eden made Nasser \u201ca scapegoat for all his problems: the sinking empire, the sluggish economy, the collapse of his reputation within his party and his dwindling popularity in the country at large,\u201d von Tunzelmann writes. Resentment sharpened into vendetta. Over the summer and fall, Eden concocted a cockamamie scheme, called Operation Musketeer, to stage an Israeli invasion of Egypt, followed by an Anglo-French peacekeeping force for the \u201cprotection\u201d of the canal. The Israeli and French conspirators had their own foolish reasons for going along; significantly, the United States was kept in the dark.Fortunately, when the crisis broke, Eden\u2019s recklessness was foiled by the calm resolve of the American president, Dwight Eisenhower. Genial in public and so fond of golf that he installed a putting green outside the Oval Office, Eisenhower was easy to underestimate. But having liberated Western Europe as supreme allied commander and seen firsthand the waste of war, he was determined as president to keep the United States out of armed conflict. He also had an \u201cinstinctive sympathy with the postcolonial predicament,\u201d von Tunzelmann writes.Eisenhower was not always well served by the rhetoric of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles or the machinations of his brother, Allen Dulles, the director of central intelligence. And Eisenhower had a temper. \u201cBombs, by God,\u201d he shouted when the British began striking Egyptian air fields. \u201cWhat does Anthony think he\u2019s doing? Why is he doing this to me?\u201d But Eisenhower was shrewd and he could be coldly calculating. Understanding that the British would need to buy American oil, he quietly put Britain into a financial squeeze, forcing Eden to back off the invasion.Eisenhower was also, unusually for an American president, willing to say no to Israel. The Suez crisis blew up just as America went to the polls to vote on a second term for the president. His staff secretary, Andrew Goodpaster, recorded: \u201cIn this matter, he does not care in the slightest whether he is re-elected or not. He feels we must make good on our word [to defend Egypt]. He added that he did not really think the American people would throw him out in the middle of a situation like this, but if they did, so be it.\u201dWhen others were losing their heads, Eisenhower kept his. Though never explicitly stated, the take-away from von Tunzelmann\u2019s book is obvious: When it comes to national leadership in chaotic times, temperament matters. Which makes her book not only exciting and satisfying but also timely.Evan Thomas, the author of \u201cIke\u2019s Bluff\u201d and \u201cBeing Nixon,\u201d is working on an authorized biography of Sandra Day O\u2019Connor.Advertisement"}

In less sophisticated language, Donald Trump has sold a fairy tale that he can lead America back to its past glory.Those of us who were there remember those golden years in the 1960s and 1970s when American manufacturing was king, and working-class men and women led families to ever better lives. Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, the Europeans and the Japanese shifted from rebuilding their economies to compete with American manufacturing.In the 1990s and after 2000, the Chinese and underdeveloped Asian economies with the advantages of lower cost workers began competing for American jobs. Sadly, our government, liberals and businessmen (competitively driven to get lower costs) were widely unresponsive to the loss of working-class jobs.Donald Trump\u2019s fairy tale is too good a story for displaced working-class workers to cast aside no matter how much its reality is challenged. Nevertheless, ignoring the realities of the globalized world will only prolong the agony of working-class men and women.Hillary Clinton\u2019s policies to improve the education and skills of the American working class will be far better for finding good jobs in the globalized economy than wishful thinking that anyone can take us back to America\u2019s glory years.CHARLES FINCHHuntington Beach, Calif.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Corporate Confidence of the AT&T-Time Warner Deal", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byBy many measures, this should be a moment of great economic uncertainty for the corporate world.The United States election looms. Interest rates are set to rise soon. Britain plans to leave the European Union. China\u2019s economic growth is slowing. Cyberattacks are on the rise. And Russia is flexing its military muscle in the Middle East.Any one of these factors would usually be enough to give chief executives pause. The men and women who run the world\u2019s largest corporations are nothing if not cautious.Yet across industries, there are surprising signs of confidence, with corporate chieftains and directors signaling their belief that the upswing will continue for months or even years to come. Investors are betting on sustained growth. Companies are hiring. And huge mergers and acquisitions are back in fashion.On Saturday night, AT&T said it planned to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion \u2014 the biggest deal of the year. On Friday, British American Tobacco offered $47 billion for the portion of Reynolds American that it does not already own. And this week, the chip maker Qualcomm is expected to make a $37 billion offer for the rival company NXP Semiconductors.Such megadeals are often postponed during times of political or economic uncertainty. Yet at what feels to many like a tumultuous moment for the global economy, many corporate titans apparently see smooth sailing ahead.The most imminent economic concern may be the outcome of the race for the White House. Though Donald J. Trump has positioned himself as a successful businessman, economists have warned of market upheavals if he is elected.But with Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead over Mr. Trump wide and still growing with less than three weeks until Election Day, chief executives appear to be betting that the race is all but over.\u201cEveryone is expecting a Clinton victory,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cShe represents the status quo. They think nothing is going to change, and they\u2019re comfortable with that.\u2019\u201dAnother major concern among chief executives has been that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates, making it more expensive for companies to borrow. But after the Fed raised short-term interest rates last December for the first time since the financial crisis, the markets took it in stride. Even now, as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, signals that rate increases are coming soon, investors and executives appear unfazed.\u201cThe Federal Reserve is sending very strong signals that, yes, it is going to normalize interest rates, but very, very slowly,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cThat makes deals easier to get done. It\u2019s a very sanguine, propitious environment for deals.\u201dNot everyone is benefiting from that confidence in the C-suite. Millions of Americans are feeling left behind, a sentiment that is driving the rising populism that has shaped this election cycle. And in an era of sweeping consolidation, many smaller companies find themselves struggling to compete against multinational behemoths.But while corporate executives are monitoring a laundry list of political and economic risks, no single factor appears to be a major cause for concern.Instead, there is a growing sense that the combination of slow but steady economic growth, rapid technological innovation and an uncertain geopolitical landscape is here to stay for some time, or what business leaders call \u201cthe new normal.\u201d\u201cYou have a group of business leaders who have come of age only knowing uncertainty and complexity,\u201d said Blair W. Effron, co-founder of Centerview Partners, an investment bank that advises companies on big takeovers. \u201cThey are therefore really good at managing in this environment.\u201dWhen it comes to mergers and acquisitions, that means companies are thinking about how to position themselves for unpredictable swings in consumer preferences and unanticipated changes in global markets, often through deal making.For AT&T, the bet is about expanding beyond its roots as a distribution company. AT&T already offers phone, internet, cable and satellite services, but it has watched as Comcast, the country\u2019s largest cable operator, has expanded into content with its acquisition of NBCUniversal.By buying Time Warner \u2014 one of the most prestigious producers of television and film today, with brands including HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. \u2014 AT&T will suddenly become Comcast\u2019s closest true rival.\u201cAT&T is trying to keep up with the Joneses,\u201d said Robert Salomon, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business.For British American Tobacco, taking full control of Reynolds American means further expanding into the developing world as Americans and Europeans smoke less because of health concerns.For the German company Bayer, which agreed last month to acquire the agricultural giant Monsanto for $56 billion, it is about gaining market share and getting leverage over customers.And because interest rates remain so low, such deals are relatively easy to do these days.\u201cCorporations are still sitting on record levels of cash, and there\u2019s not a lot of organic growth out there,\u201d Mr. Salomon said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t grow organically, it\u2019s growth through acquisitions.\u201dIn other industries, too, the pace of consolidation has quickened. Two big deals had appeared poised to reshape the American health care industry. Anthem has offered $48 billion for Cigna, and Aetna has offered $37 billion for Humana.The Justice Department, however, has sued to block both deals, leaving their fates in jeopardy.That\u2019s not the case in other industries, like technology, where there are few barriers to the big getting bigger. This summer, Microsoft agreed to buy LinkedIn for $26 billion.All in all, the aggressive deal making \u2014 coupled with a steady stock market and an economy that is growing, if modestly \u2014 suggests that in a moment that could easily be fraught with uncertainty, many corporate leaders are surprisingly confident.It has now been more than seven years since the United States economy dipped into recession, making this one of the longest periods of so-called expansion in American history. The longest, at 10 years, occurred during the 1990s, but economists believe that absent any major setbacks, that record could soon be broken.\u201cThere is a growing sense that this expansion has a ways to run,\u201d Mr. Zandi of Moody\u2019s said. \u201cPeople are getting comfortable with the idea that this is going for a while.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That can only hurt President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who took the lead in negotiating the nuclear deal and sold it as a way to integrate his once-isolated country into the international economy. He is up for reelection next year and until then, the internal political warfare is only expected to get worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giving Every Child a Monthly Check for an Even Start", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneHow can it be that the United States spends so much money fighting poverty and still suffers one of the highest child poverty rates among advanced nations?The percentage of children who are poor is more than three times as high in the United States as it is in Norway or the Netherlands. America has a larger proportion of poor children than Russia.So what\u2019s going on? We may spend a lot of money, but we don\u2019t spend it well. It turns out that the most generous federal programs for families with children barely help the nation\u2019s unluckiest children. Rather, they generally push money to their counterparts higher up the ladder of well-being.Hillary Clinton, who, according to most polls, will be the next American president, unveiled a set of programs last week to help families with children.She proposed to double the child tax credit to $2,000 for each child up to the age of 4 and to restructure the benefit so more of it flows to very-low-income families. Today, the credit is worth only $300 to a mother of two who earns $5,000 a year. Under Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposal, it could be worth $2,250.It is not a bad start. But there is an opportunity for even bolder action. Why not get rid of the child tax credit and the child deduction entirely, and instead provide a monthly check of $250 for every child in the country, to guarantee a minimum level of well-being?\u201cThis is an old idea whose time has come,\u201d said Timothy Smeeding, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who directed the Institute for Research on Poverty there from 2008 to 2014. Daniel P. Moynihan, who advised former President Richard Nixon and was a Democratic senator from New York, actively supported this idea. So did Milton Friedman, the guru of conservative economic thinking from the 1960s through the 1980s.Now the idea is being pitched in a forthcoming article for the Russell Sage Foundation by nine experts on poverty and child well-being including Luke Shaefer from the University of Michigan, Jane Waldfogel from Columbia University and Professor Smeeding.The proposal rows against the flow of American policy over the last few decades. The benefit would be universal, like Social Security, rather than aimed at low-income families alone. And it would decouple government assistance from work, a sharp departure from the track followed since the welfare reform of the 1990s, when cash assistance was replaced with tax credits.And it could be a first step to guarantee a modicum of well-being to America\u2019s most vulnerable citizens, building a floor below which no one is allowed to fall. That is one of the hallmarks of just about every other advanced nation.\u201cWe might be coming into a moment where there could be some common-sense policy changes,\u201d Professor Shaefer said. \u201cThere is a policy window that wasn\u2019t open a year or two years ago.\u201dAustria, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden all already have some sort of child allowance. In Germany, the benefit for a family with two children adds up to $5,600 a year. In Canada, it is worth $4,935 per child under 6, and $4,164 for children ages 6 to 17.Providing $250 a month a child \u2014 or $3,000 a year \u2014 \u201cputs us in the ballpark of where our peer countries are,\u201d Professor Waldfogel said. Provided monthly, rather than annually in a lump sum at tax time as current tax credits are delivered, it would be easier to manage. According to the researchers, it would cut child poverty by over 40 percent and deep poverty by half.It is not even that expensive.Critics will argue that a universal child benefit squanders money on parents who don\u2019t need it. Yet many struggling middle-income families could do with the help. For taxpayers in higher brackets, a significant chunk of the benefit would be taxed away, returning it to the Treasury. Best of all, a universal program would avoid the bad incentives of targeted credits, which discourage work because they are phased out as parents\u2019 earnings rise.Eliminating the current tax exemptions would pay for much of it. Professor Shaefer and his colleagues estimate that at $250 a month a child (they also offer a few other options), their proposal would cost a little over $190 billion a year. Over half of that could be covered by dropping the child tax credit and the tax deduction, leaving a net price tag of about $90 billion, or about half of 1 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. That\u2019s only about $30 billion more than Americans spend on pets.I know, I know. This kind of policy talk sounds crazy in the midst of an election campaign consumed by reports of sexual assault and outlandish accusations of voter fraud. Even after the election, I suspect Hillary Clinton, a cautious politician, would balk at trying to persuade Congress to approve a $90 billion price tag for such a plan.And yet the case to help all children start life with equal support from society is powerful. Child poverty is perhaps the United States\u2019 most painful failure. The Russell Sage Foundation authors are pointing to a way not just to tinker with the problem, but to start fixing it.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}

Stephen M. Koeth, a Roman Catholic priest who assists at the Holy Trinity church on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. \u201cIt is a painful moment in our culture.\u201dFor voters across party lines, the presidential race was already ugly, already exhausting and already dominated by two candidates many voters found deplorable. And yet it somehow managed to tip into something worse in recent days: a twilight zone of politics where sexual tawdriness and assault accusations have become consuming issues in the final weeks of the campaign.Among many Democrats, despair is setting in that the next president could be, in their minds, a sexual predator. Among many Republicans, disgust is widespread that the next president could be married to a man who was, as they see it, a serial adulterer at best.Those negative feelings are intensifying, to judge by the increasingly angry crowds at Mr. Trump\u2019s rallies and the soul-baring support for Hillary Clinton from Michelle Obama and others. The election result now seems guaranteed to feel like a violation of the body politic for one half of the country or the other.\u201cI was prepared to find Trump\u2019s comments about women repulsive, but I was not prepared to find the comments cutting so deeply,\u201d said Larry Iannotti, a psychotherapist in Manhattan, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s bragging had shaken several of his clients who had suffered abuse. \u201cThe election is suddenly causing real pain that people didn\u2019t see coming.\u201dIt was deeply personal for Nicole Smith, a 22-year-old in Phoenix who was a Miss Arizona USA contestant. She said she was angry that her father and others were voting for Mr. Trump even though they knew she was often groped and harassed herself. She always carries a Taser, she said, because she does not feel safe in most places.\u201cYou guys talk about protecting me,\u201d she recalled telling the men in her life who are supporting Mr. Trump. \u201cBut the fact is you\u2019re voting for someone like that. So how can you protect me when you\u2019re electing someone that you\u2019re trying to protect me from?\u201dIn interviews late last week with two dozen voters around the country, many were quick to argue, even without prompting, that either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump was the worst offender on issues of inappropriate behavior toward women. Not only had sex taken control of the political discussion, but sexual conduct itself had become politicized, with voters arguing about which kinds of disturbing behavior were worse, their responses often reflecting the candidate they supported.Darwin Rieck, a farmer and Trump backer in Luzerne, Iowa, said he was dismayed that sexual behavior had become a dimension of the race, and accused the Clinton campaign and the news media of hyping the issue to hurt Mr. Trump.\u201cNow all we\u2019re talking about is his sexual encounters that supposedly he had \u2014 that\u2019s all we\u2019re talking about!\u201d Mr. Rieck said. \u201cHow can the Clintons talk about it with what Bill has done when he was in office? They have no room to be even talking about anything!\u201dBut others were appalled by the comparisons of the Clintons and Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton has not made sexually lewd remarks or been accused of physically harming anyone, as Mr. Trump has, and it is the Trump campaign that has been far more aggressive in throwing mud.\u201cShe has nothing to do with his infidelity,\u201d said Salici Robinson, a sales associate from White Plains, referring to Mr. Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019s not running for president.\u201d\u201cWhenever there is a really high-profile media story or case, we find that a lot of people who have experienced this months or even years ago, but never talked about it, it prompts them to reach out for help for the first time,\u201d he said.\u201cThis topic is being discussed at every workplace and every dinner table,\u201d Mr. Berkowitz continued. \u201cIt becomes harder for them to escape and more likely for them to talk to someone who understands.\u201d\u201cThe idea that a candidate with a major-party backing has allegations of this nature on his record is vile,\u201d said Alex Abbott, 20, a senior at Hampden-Sydney College, an all-male campus in Virginia. Still, he added, the responses to Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior that Mr. Abbott had heard from men \u201care either \u2018I would never do anything like that,\u2019 or \u2018Every guy does that, and it\u2019s not out of the ordinary.\u2019\u201dWhile surveys show voters are chiefly concerned about the economy and terrorism, the drumbeat of negative attention on Mr. Trump\u2019s sexual behavior is hurting him with female voters and independents, according to Republican pollsters. But support for Mrs. Clinton has not jumped noticeably, a sign that many Republicans still do not see Mr. Trump as morally unacceptable \u2014 at least compared with the Clintons.\u201cIt\u2019s what I have termed negative partisanship,\u201d Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, wrote in an email. \u201cWe vote against the other party/candidate more than for our own party/candidate, and that is especially true this year for Republicans.\u201d\u201cMy heart is broken,\u201d Mr. Baitz said. \u201cThere is, to me, a kind of fundamental American decency, and it\u2019s just been lost in the prurient shallowness of the discourse.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re running for president, isn\u2019t it disqualifying if you talk disrespectfully about women?\u201d asked Genesis Luna, a 16-year-old from the Bronx. \u201cIsn\u2019t it disqualifying if you do disrespectful things to women?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Mr. Rapp said.\u201cI think it should be,\u201d Ms. Luna said. \u201cBut I heard Bill Clinton treated mistresses badly.

{"Headline": "Bhumibol, a King of the People, Leaves Them to the Generals", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn November 1951, as Bhumibol Adulyadej, 23, was heading back to Thailand to take his throne, a group of generals overthrew the royalist government and stripped the Constitution of the substantial powers it accorded the monarchy.Bhumibol became king in 1946 but had been living in Switzerland, studying. His return home was supposed to be a celebration; it was greeted with a blow to the monarchy.This was an inauspicious start, but it may have been a great blessing. King Bhumibol\u2019s death on Oct. 13 concluded an extraordinary reign of seven decades, during which he arguably became one of the most popular and most respected monarchs in the world.King Bhumibol spent his first years on the throne engaging in what looked like politically benign activities. He made public appearances with his attractive, dynamic family. He played jazz over the radio. He sponsored charities and farm projects. Like many pious young Thai men, he was briefly ordained as a Buddhist monk.By 1957, he had enough public support to make a move against Field Marshal Phibun Songkhram, who had taken power in the 1951 overthrow. He supported a royalist general and rival of Phibun, Gen. Sarit Thanarat, who seized power in a new coup.King Bhumibol did not set out to build a representative democracy or promote the rule of law. For him, parliaments were impermanent, disposable. He may have been born in America and raised in Europe, but democracy was never his goal for Thailand. Restoring the traditional influence of the monarchy was.Thailand was ruled by a succession of military strongmen throughout the 1960s and \u201970s, spaced out by short-lived attempts at elected government. At the time that may have been justifiable: The overthrow of the monarchies in Cambodia and Laos raised existential fears for the palace in Bangkok. By the end of the 1980s, however, when the Communist wars in Indochina had largely wound down and Thailand was becoming the latest roaring Asian Tiger, this no longer made sense.In 1992, a popular uprising ousted yet another monarchy-backed military junta. A growing number of Thais had come to believe that an elected government and stronger democratic institutions would better serve Thailand\u2019s development.Yet King Bhumibol continued to favor alliances between the palace and the military over electoral democracy. He backed the generals whenever they obstructed efforts to modernize the Constitution or strengthen the rule of law, which happened again and again.Elections were restored, but every time Mr. Thaksin\u2019s allies have secured control of the government, and democratically, they, too, have been ousted. In 2014, Mr. Thaksin\u2019s sister was removed from her position as prime minister: first by a court, then, in effect, by the military \u2014 and again with the palace\u2019s support.This is a bleak backdrop for the end of King Bhumibol\u2019s reign. He was the model of a great king \u2014 modest, earnest and selfless, with his attention focused on the neediest. But he has left Thailand, as well as his heir, in the same situation he inherited all those years ago: in the hands of corrupt and shortsighted generals who rule however they want. And those King Bhumibol cared about the most \u2014 the Thai people \u2014 must suffer the consequences.Paul Handley is the author of \u201cThe King Never Smiles: A Biography of Thailand\u2019s Bhumibol Adulyadej.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Playing With Fear: Russia\u2019s War Card", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorCHICAGO \u2014 The Russian media have been talking up war for some time, but it has now reached new heights of warmongering. Dmitry Kiselev, a television journalist known for his close ties to the Kremlin, keeps threatening the West with nuclear weapons. Another ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, the voluble ultranationalist party leader Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, recently declared that if Hillary Clinton were elected, it would mean World War III.Clearly, the Kremlin is deliberately creating a sense of impending war by having its own media insist that NATO has put Russia under threat \u2014 from the military alliance itself and its democratic ethos. Ominously, Mr. Putin loses no opportunity to extol the Russian people\u2019s wartime virtues of heroism and martyrdom.Most recently, the war scenario moved from talk on television to Russian city streets. From Oct. 4 to 7, a Russian civil defense drill reportedly involved 40 million civilians and 200,000 civil defense experts who instructed citizens in schools, factories and offices. The government-controlled media rhapsodized that the bomb shelters were found to be in good order, as the people drilled in what to do during a nuclear, chemical or bacteriological war.In one Moscow district, local authorities posted fliers asking residents to contribute money to hasten construction of a bomb shelter \u201cbecause of the growing international tensions, particularly the expected nuclear aggression against Russia by the unfriendly countries,\u201d clearly a reference to the United States and its allies. Maybe all that these fliers signify is pandering to the Kremlin by local bureaucrats eager to impress the authors of a propaganda blitz. But there is no denying that such announcements are strengthening a genuine bout of war hysteria, emanating from the Kremlin.And increasingly strange things keep happening. On Oct. 10, St. Petersburg\u2019s governor authorized storing enough grain to provide 300 grams (two-thirds of a pound) of bread to each city resident for 20 days. In a city that suffered epic death and starvation during a 900-day German siege during World War II, such a decree has special resonance. The next day, the Kremlin ordered members of Parliament and government officials who had relatives abroad to bring them home immediately. In other news, a recent military exercise called Caucasus 2016 tested a plan for wartime governance in that region, under control of the national defense apparatus.Could this be just theater intended to intimidate the West at a time of insecurity in Europe and strong suspicions in the United States that Russia is meddling in its election? Or is it meant for an audience closer to home \u2014 yet another cynical ploy with which to distract Russia\u2019s own citizens from their economic woes by directing their anger into the proven channel of anti-Americanism?No doubt it is both. But that only deepens its significance, since the consequences of falsifying reality in order to manipulate fears are difficult to control. Too often in history, incendiary rhetoric has fed into dangerous policies and catastrophic miscalculations by both its perpetrators and its recipients.Russia\u2019s militarization and President Putin\u2019s nuclear chest-thumping did not start yesterday. Since 2012, Russia has been rapidly modernizing its military, and by 2015 had increased its military budget by 40 percent. Its level of announced military spending last year stood at 4.5 percent of Russia\u2019s gross domestic product, and most independent experts estimate that the real number is 5.3 percent. By contrast, China\u2019s military spending stands at 2.1 percent of G.D.P., and the United States\u2019, while still the largest in real dollars, is at 3.5 percent.Still, Russia\u2019s military budget remains a priority despite a backbreaking national deficit. Last week, the government announced a $12.7 billion increase in the so-called black budget usually assigned for security and military matters. The money came from a special fund that the government had created by delinking pensions from inflation rates. Spending also had been cut for social services, health care expenses and education.In recent years, Russia has frequently sprung surprise military exercises along its borders with its western neighbors. After its invasion of Ukraine, news of NATO fighters\u2019 intercepting Russian bombers flying perilously close to other European airspace has become routine. Recently the Kremlin moved a modified S-300 antimissile and antiaircraft system into Syria, deployed nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in the Kaliningrad region on the Baltic Sea, withdrew from a treaty on the disposal of plutonium, and effectively abrogated a treaty limiting land-based missiles.The Kremlin\u2019s modus operandi is simple: spread fear and uncertainty through provocative military moves and unrelenting propaganda at home and abroad. Most experts agree that the most dangerous part of this approach has been Mr. Putin\u2019s unprovoked escalations. Indeed, he behaves like a child in a sandbox who makes mischief repeatedly until he gets the attention of the adults. Similarly, the more the West ignores his provocations, the more he escalates.But a nuclear-armed world is no sandbox, and budding war hysteria in a huge country afflicted with imperial nostalgia, one-man rule, a looming demographic crisis, ethnic tensions and a declining oil-dependent economy cannot be dismissed lightly. While Moscow\u2019s saber rattling has clearly failed to intimidate the West, Russia\u2019s military and its nuclear arsenal remain the only aces in Mr. Putin\u2019s hand. So the Kremlin can be expected to continue escalating its disinformation and propaganda.Mr. Putin often evokes his tough childhood to explain his philosophy of life. \u201cHit them first and hit them hard\u201d was the lesson, and his adult career in the K.G.B. didn\u2019t change that. But this worldview follows the time-honored expansionist ambitions of Russian autocracy under czars and Communist leaders alike. For centuries, the Russian Empire advanced at the expense of its weaker neighbors until it met determined resistance or faced a war it could not win. The West must now send Moscow an unambiguous message that the price for future misadventures like the ones in Ukraine and Syria would be unacceptably high. And someone should remind Mr. Putin that one reason the Soviet Union collapsed was an arms race that it couldn\u2019t afford.Michael Khodarkovsky, a professor of history at Loyola University, is at work on a history of the Russian Empire.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Else Is on the Ballot? Minimum Wage, Death Penalty and Guns", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byWhen it comes to big choices facing voters on Election Day, it\u2019s not all about Hillary Clinton versus Donald J. Trump. Down the ballot are a variety of initiatives, from the raising of the minimum wage to the restriction of gun purchases to the reinstatement of the death penalty. Here\u2019s a look at some of the hot-button issues Americans will decide on Nov. 8.An increase in the minimum wage is on the ballot in four states, something more than a dozen other states have done since 2014. Voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington will decide whether to elevate their state\u2019s wage floors to amounts ranging from $12 to $13.50 an hour by 2020. A fifth state, South Dakota, will consider excluding teenagers from a recently passed increase.Supporters say higher minimum wages would put more money into consumers\u2019 pockets and help pull people off public assistance. Opponents say businesses that are already scraping by would be hit too hard, pointing to restaurants as particularly vulnerable.Some states are experiencing a crosscurrent, with employers saying the changes are going too far and too fast for them to keep up. In Colorado and Washington, opponents say that the proposed statewide shifts are feasible in cities with vibrant economies, like Denver and Seattle, but that rural areas would suffer. South Dakota\u2019s measure to decrease wages for teenage workers would pare down an across-the-board increase that passed in 2014.Oregon voters will consider a measure to raise corporate taxes as a way help the state generate more revenue.If Proposition 62 is passed, the strongest punishment available under California law would be life without the possibility of parole. Those on death row would see their sentences commuted to life without parole. Attempts to pass a similar measure in 2012 failed.Proposition 66 takes a different approach by trying to eliminate the obstacles to carrying out the death penalty and shorten the time between conviction and execution. The provisions of the initiative include a five-year limit on the appeals process.If both measures pass, the one receiving the most votes would prevail.Nebraska voters will decide whether to repeal a bill passed by the Legislature in 2015 that ended the death penalty by commuting death sentences to life in prison.Voters in California, which already has some of the country\u2019s toughest gun laws, will consider an initiative that would require people buying ammunition to pass a background check and to obtain authorization from the Department of Justice; ammunition would have to be bought from licensed dealers. The initiative would also ban large-capacity magazines for firearms, extending previously passed restrictions on their ownership.Maine and Nevada have proposals to more tightly regulate gun purchases. A measure in Maine would extend the requirement for background checks to include most private sales of guns.A similar proposal in Nevada would require most private buyers and sellers to conduct a background check through a licensed gun dealer.A proposal in Washington would allow courts to issue \u201cextreme risk protection orders\u201d to prevent people named in the orders from owning or getting firearms if there is a risk of harm to them or others.A measure under consideration in Washington would make it the first state to impose a tax on carbon emissions.Modeled after a similar initiative in British Columbia, just to the north, the measure would tax the sale or use of certain fossil fuels and electricity generated from fossil fuels. The revenue generated would be offset by a reduction in some other taxes.Supporters argue that residents have a moral responsibility to address climate change. Opponents say the measure would strain household budgets by increasing gasoline and electricity costs.An initiative in Maine is simple, but unusual: Should the state tax those earning more than $200,000 a year an additional 3 percent, and use the money for public education?The state estimates that it would provide $142 million in school funding, which supporters say is badly needed, while opponents argue that it would drive out businesses and high earners, imperiling the state\u2019s tepid economic growth.The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan though conservative-leaning group that researches tax policy, said the measure would give Maine the second-highest top individual tax rate in the country, after California.It has become a subject of fierce debate in one of the top states for public education: Should Massachusetts lift its cap on charter schools?The state has 78 charter schools, and counts more than 30,000 students on waiting lists, many of them in urban districts like Boston. A ballot proposal would allow 12 new charter schools to open each year.Polling suggests that public opinion might have turned against the move after a sustained opposition supported by teachers unions, the N.A.A.C.P. and public school committees. Opponents got a boost in September, when Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said she would vote against the question.Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, supports the measure.A proposed amendment in Colorado would radically transform the state\u2019s health insurance system, creating a first-in-the-nation single-payer plan that would cover all residents.State insurance would replace private insurance, and consumers would no longer have premiums or deductibles, though they would make co-payments. The endeavor, ColoradoCare, would be paid for by a 10 percent payroll tax. Employers would contribute two-thirds, and individuals one-third. An elected 21-member board would control many aspects of the program.The amendment has divided traditional allies in the liberal community. Supporters say it would fix an expensive system still laden with coverage gaps, save $4.5 billion by reducing bureaucracy, and ease economic pain in mountain towns where people with few providers face jaw-dropping premiums.A Colorado measure would make it more difficult to put constitutional amendments on the state ballot. The measure could have major consequences for people and communities opposing fracking, many of whom see the ballot as the last avenue for reining in oil and gas companies.Opponent say the measure, Amendment 71, would benefit well-financed industries while pushing out the ideas of grass-roots activists on a wide range of issues, including oil and gas.Proposition 106 would make Colorado the sixth state to allow terminally ill people to take their own lives using medication prescribed by a doctor. The initiative would require two doctors to confirm a person is terminally ill and mentally capable. The patient must be at least 18 years old.The typically pro forma elections in which voters decide whether justices may keep their seats have taken on a particularly bitter and partisan tenor this year. This comes after years of court rulings that have rebuffed policies set by the conservative state Legislature, and as lawmakers have maneuvered to reshape the judiciary.The Kansas Supreme Court, comprising mostly justices appointed by Democratic and Republican governors who preceded the current Republican governor, Sam Brownback, has ruled that the Legislature has not adequately and equitably funded public schools. It has struck down abortion restrictions and overturned death penalty sentences.The state\u2019s conservative lawmakers, who dominate the Legislature, have accused the court of impeding on their territory. In response, they passed a bill taking away the power of the Supreme Court to appoint chief judges in the district courts, and threatened to strip the judiciary of all funding if it found that law unconstitutional. They have floated legislation to allow for the impeachment of justices and to give the governor more power in appointing them.Justices face retention votes every six years, and five of the seven on the Supreme Court are up this year. Only one of those up for retention was appointed by Mr. Brownback.The key forces against retention include the state\u2019s Republican Party and the House Republican caucus, which has sent out emails opposing retention of the four justices appointed by Mr. Brownback\u2019s predecessors. A coalition that includes four former governors \u2014 two Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 is lobbying in favor of retaining the justices, saying that the judiciary should not be subject to political winds.Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood, Caitlin Dickerson, John Eligon, John Schwartz and Julie Turkewitz.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Content Trap\u2019 Rethinks Digital Media Strategy", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byBook EntryFor 15 years, the business school cases written by Bharat N. Anand, a popular Harvard Business School strategy professor, have played a central role in framing students\u2019 understanding of the media industry. Like all great business school cases, they tell an interesting story and provide the critical facts but leave it to the interactive classroom experience to draw out the relevant lessons.Dr. Anand has taken his insights from a generation of teaching these cases, along with his related research and recent experience building a new media business within the Harvard Business School, to provide a framework for thinking about effective strategy more broadly in the face of digital disruption.Given how many media businesses have been turned into roadkill on the digital superhighway, \u201cThe Content Trap: A Strategist\u2019s Guide to Digital Change\u201d (Random House) is a remarkably optimistic book. In Dr. Anand\u2019s view, those who have failed to thrive in this environment often have only themselves to blame for falling into a \u201ccontent trap.\u201d His criticism extends to all those both inside and outside media whose strategic response to the emergence of digital competitors reflects \u201ca bias towards content, product and quality.\u201dRather than embrace the opportunities afforded by the internet to make new \u201cconnections\u201d across customers, products and functions, unsuccessful companies have looked inward and made unwise content investments in a futile effort to forestall the inevitable digital future. Although the term \u201cconnections\u201d is stretched far beyond its usefulness in an effort to establish a unifying conceptual framework for the book, Dr. Anand\u2019s essential point seems to be that modern businesses can thrive by taking advantage of opportunities to foster valuable interactions with and among customers as well as complementary businesses and capabilities made available by the internet.Dr. Anand\u2019s observations about the impossibility of maintaining a sustainable advantage over competitors simply by being \u201cbetter\u201d \u2014 whether in content creation or product quality \u2014 are well placed. Equally insightful is his emphasis on the importance of context rather than universal \u201cbest practices\u201d to address emerging competitive threats.Less compelling is the insistence that \u201ca veritable gold mine\u201d awaits incumbents who simply \u201cthink creatively about how to differentiate\u201d new \u201cdigital products from the traditional ones.\u201d Dr. Anand repeatedly avoids pointing out the obvious: Even where successful, these new businesses typically have lower barriers to entry and are inevitably more competitive and less profitable. This reluctance may be based on a misapprehension about the nature of the differences between the network effects associated with digital businesses and the fixed-cost scale economies associated with traditional ones. In Dr. Anand\u2019s mind, \u201cchances are you win everything\u201d in the network-effects markets, but for those who rely on scale benefits, \u201cchances are that others can, too.\u201dIn an interesting twist, in the very market that \u201cThe Content Trap\u201d leads with \u2014 newspapers \u2014 the opposite was true. Local newspaper franchises are a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d market because the fixed costs make only a single paper economically feasible, whereas every online classified marketplace, while benefiting from network effects, supports multiple competitors.A real strength of \u201cThe Content Trap\u201d is the detailed case studies underlying the analysis. Surprisingly, however, given Dr. Anand\u2019s focus on connections and context, these have often not been updated or related to each other where doing so would have enhanced the narrative and provided important nuance to the strategic lessons.The success of the Scandinavian newspaper publisher Schibsted in building online classified businesses with other regional newspaper publishers is detailed, followed by a recounting of The New York Times\u2019s decision to institute a paywall. Nothing is said, however, about The Times\u2019s decision to remove itself years ago from an industrywide classified consortium. Other than describing the American newspaper classified consortium as \u201cunproductive,\u201d Dr. Anand does not contrast the respective approaches and experiences of Schibsted and The Times. Far from being unproductive, in 2014, the consortium sold just one of its classified verticals \u2014 cars.com \u2014 for almost as much as the public market value of the entire American newspaper sector.The book\u2019s discussion of the sports marketing giant IMG and its founder, Mark McCormack, is as compelling now as it was when Dr. Anand\u2019s Harvard case was last updated in 2002. But given the different direction that the subsequent owners took the business after Mr. McCormack\u2019s death in 2003, some discussion and analysis of the reasons and implications would have been helpful.Dr. Anand ends the book by recounting his own experience as a leader of the start of HBX, Harvard Business School\u2019s online education initiative, with the aim of demonstrating the successful application of the previously described strategic principles. The account is a fascinating one, and the product the school has developed sounds truly impressive.It is unclear, however, how this story should inform business decisions of others in online education or otherwise. Dr. Anand is operating at a well-funded, nonprofit university and was given access to arguably the best global brand in business education and its distinguished faculty. Armed with a seemingly unlimited budget, his direction from the dean was simply that \u201cfailure is not an option\u201d \u2014 although it is never clear how success is measured. Beyond noting the $1,500 price for the first program developed and the size of the initial cohort group, Dr. Anand provides no information about the costs, revenue or financial aspirations of HBX. Along the way, some odd strategic decisions are made. For instance, HBX decided to develop its own software platform on which it would run, although much of the core functionality described by Dr. Anand would appear to be supportable by any number of existing learning management systems.Regardless of any disagreements about the implications of specific cases, there is still much to be learned from the breadth and richness of Dr. Anand\u2019s examples. Although one can argue with his individual conclusions, the overarching observations regarding the dangers of \u201cthe content trap\u201d seem irrefutable \u2014 particularly in light of last year\u2019s breathtaking record of more than 400 scripted original television series.Sometimes, however, a digitally challenged business may also be better off simply dying with dignity and milking the core franchise rather than investing in new \u201cconnections\u201d that others are better positioned to exploit.Advertisement"}

The Left-Green Party also won 10 seats. The left-leaning parties \u2014 the Left-Greens, the Pirates and two allies \u2014 won 27 seats over all, just short of a majority.The liberal Regeneration Party, which is expected to play the role of kingmaker, has ruled out joining a coalition with the current governing establishment parties. This means that left-leaning parties could potentially form a governing coalition.While the conservative Independence Party made gains, \u201cit is not a return to the status quo,\u201d said Andres Jonsson, a political consultant. To form a government, the party will have to extend its hand to smaller, more rebellious groups, he said.\u201cThe traditional party system has been disrupted,\u201d Mr. Jonsson said. \u201cWe are not seeing big movements of people who feel that they are able to relate with the messages of the big coalition parties. Changes are going to come from the outside, not from inside the old parties.\u201dThe election for Iceland\u2019s Parliament, the world\u2019s oldest, highlighted the fragmentation of the political landscape. A dozen parties fought for power over an electorate of about 260,000, barely enough to fill three American football stadiums.Birgitta Jonsdottir, the anarchist leader of the Pirate Party, said she was satisfied with the result. \u201cWhatever happens, we have created a wave of change in the Icelandic society,\u201d she told a cheering crowd here early Sunday.About 40 percent of Pirate supporters are under the age of 30. They had pinned their hopes on a party that has promised to install a more inclusive and transparent government.The Pirates have pledged to enhance direct democracy by passing the world\u2019s first \u201ccrowd-sourced constitution,\u201d drafted by Icelandic civilians rather than politicians. Parliament blocked the document in 2013.\u201cWe want to see trickle-down ethics rather than make-believe trickle-down economics,\u201d Ms. Jonsdottir, 49, who is also a former WikiLeaks activist, said in an interview on the eve of the election.Strong anti-establishment feeling has swept through Iceland since the financial crisis, and has been aggravated by the Panama Papers scandal in April, which sent thousands of protesters into the streets. The Pirate Party has benefited from a wave of dissent that has swept through Europe and the United States, upending traditional politics and fracturing mainstream parties.When the crisis hit, Icelanders were plunged into debt and banks racked up losses of billions of dollars, many times more than the size of Iceland\u2019s economy.Today, the economy has recovered, partly thanks to booming tourism. But public anger still runs deep.\u201cWe are a platform for young people, for progressive people who shape and reshape our society,\u201d Ms. Jonsdottir told Agence France-Presse. \u201cLike Robin Hood, because Robin Hood was a pirate, we want to take the power from the powerful to give it to the people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Putin\u2019s Combativeness, Some See Motives Other Than Syria", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Somewhat obscured by the volatile American presidential election this week was the implosion of relations between the Kremlin and the West.President Vladimir V. Putin took it badly, sending relations into the kind of tailspin not seen for decades, with dogs of war baying on the state-controlled news media. So badly, in fact, that some analysts began to suspect that other factors were driving his response.Mr. Putin instantly unplugged several nuclear accords, including a 16-year-old bilateral agreement on reducing stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium, and he formulated a list of unattainable economic and legal demands as the cost of reviving the pact.He deployed sophisticated antiaircraft weapons to Syria and redeployed long-range ballistic missiles to Russia\u2019s Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad, leaving one-nuclear tipped version visible for the benefit of American spy satellites.On the home front, some 40 million Russians, 200,000 rescue workers and 50,000 specialized vehicles took part in civil defense exercises. The Kremlin\u2019s bellwether weekly news program also repeated its stark reminder, first rolled out two years ago, that Russia retained the ability to turn the United States into radioactive dust.\u201cBoorish behavior toward Russia has a nuclear dimension,\u201d said Dmitry K. Kiselyov, the show\u2019s host.So if Mr. Putin was not actually preparing Russians for war, then what was he doing? On the international front, analysts say, Mr. Putin appeared to be positioning himself to make maximum demands of the next American president and to pursue his perennial goal of getting other world leaders to treat him as an equal.More immediately, they say, he was raising the stakes for the anticipated resumption of negotiations over Syria, talks expected to begin again in some form in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday.But increasingly, commentators in Russia have begun to suspect other motives, beginning with a need to distract attention from gaping holes in the federal budget and the painful, politically unpopular steps needed to close them.\u201cThe serious part is not shown on television,\u201d Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, said. \u201cThe serious part is the battle of the budget.\u201dRussians are facing rising utility rates, and a new fee for building maintenance is especially irksome. Government spending on health care might be slashed 33 percent.Despite all the swagger the military budget will be cut by 6 percent annually for the next three years, after 15 years of increases.\u201cWhen we look at this rather grim-looking budget, it is basically spending for police and pensions and not much else,\u201d Ms. Schulmann said.Domestic matters aside, Mr. Putin still hopes to leverage the Syria crisis to change Russia\u2019s role on the international stage. In deploying his military there last year, he initially planned to use the conflict to stabilize the government of President Bashar al-Assad and break out of the economic sanctions and general Western isolation imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.Marked success in stabilizing Mr. Assad with little cost appears to have fed larger goals. Once the agreement with Washington fell apart, Mr. Putin went all out to win Aleppo for Mr. Assad, no matter the price on the ground, to help Damascus gain control over some swaths of western Syria that would then force the opposition into an agreement.\u201cRussia has a window of opportunity to do it,\u201d said Nikolai V. Petrov, a Russian professor of political science, said. \u201cThe next American president will face a new reality and will be forced to accept it.\u201dVarious potholes mar the route to long-term success, however, one reason Russia rapidly agreed to new negotiations over Syria. For example, some unusual public grumbling has surfaced from the Russian military that the Syrian Army is an unworthy ally.Beyond Syria, Mr. Putin harbors ambitions of restructuring the global order, with an eye to restoring Russia to what he sees as its rightful status in the upper tier.\u201cI believe that the talk about looming war is a propaganda trick: Russia wants to show that it can go far, it is an element of pressure,\u201d said Aleksei Makarkin, the deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think tank. \u201cRussia dreams about another Yalta conference, where together with other great powers it will divide the map.\u201dMr. Putin himself said as much in remarks on Wednesday: \u201cLet us not forget that we bear a special responsibility as the two largest nuclear powers for maintaining international peace and security at the global level.\u201dAnalysts brushed off the talk of new bases in Cuba, Vietnam and possibly Egypt, attributing it more to nostalgia than reality. There is no indication Russia would be welcomed by any of them, and the bases were shuttered over prohibitive costs. This is hardly the time for taking on more burdens.\u201cA while back, about a decade ago, Russia was never mentioned, they said there was nothing to talk about with regard to Russia because it was a third-rate regional power that was of no interest,\u201d Mr. Putin said Wednesday. \u201cToday, the No. 1 problem in the entire election campaign is Russia. It is the main talking point. That is very welcome of course, but only partially.\u201dThe \u201cpartial\u201d part was that the references were mostly negative. It also remains unclear that international matters really distract ordinary citizens from deepening economic woes.For the first time since Mr. Putin\u2019s first tenure as president, which began in 2000, Russians are facing falling incomes. An October report from the Higher School of Economics calculated that real monthly income per capita fell to just under $500 per month, or roughly 87 percent of the income level in August 2014.The backlog of unpaid wages has reached an astronomical $56 million, while the Center for Political and Economic Reforms says the number of strikes and rallies over labor disputes has doubled in the past three months.Given that the confrontation over Syria is likely to stall any relief on sanctions or other economic relations, Mr. Putin did what he often does in any confrontation: He raised the stakes.\u201cI see a certain step-up in rhetoric which seems to be our usual way to prepare for negotiations,\u201d Ms. Schulman said, comparing it to the Ukraine playbook during the last crisis in 2014. \u201cThere was escalation and then consultation and then some step back. That seems to be the usual tactic and it seems to be effective.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Yet despite the noisy debates, which have reached new heights during this presidential campaign, it is a little-noticed fact that trade is no longer rising. The volume of global trade was flat in the first quarter of 2016, then fell by 0.8 percent in the second quarter, according to statisticians in the Netherlands, which happens to keep the best data.It is the first time since World War II that trade with other nations has declined during a period of economic growth.Sluggish global economic growth is both a cause and a result of the slowdown. In better times, prosperity increased trade and trade increased prosperity. Now the wheel is turning in the opposite direction. Reduced consumption and investment are dragging on trade, which is slowing growth.But there are also signs that the slowdown is becoming structural. Developed nations appear to be backing away from globalization.It may be hard, however, to muster public enthusiasm in the United States and other developed nations. The benefits of globalization have accrued disproportionately to the wealthy, while the costs have fallen on displaced workers, and governments have failed to ease their pain.The result: The I.M.F. study calculated that a 1 percent increase in global growth increased trade volumes by 2.5 percent in the 1990s, while in recent years, the same growth has increased trade by just 0.7 percent.The chart is often presented as a depiction of the consequences of globalization. The reality is more complicated, but perception is undeniable. Voters in developed nations increasingly view themselves as the victims of trade with the developing world \u2014 and a backlash is brewing.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Registered to Vote... For This?", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byOpinionThis has been a weird election for everyone, but especially for people who are voting for the first time. In conversations I had with more than 50 first-time voters, the same word came up again and again when I asked what they thought about their options this year: \u201cDisappointing.\u201d While a large share of voters I talked to said they would be voting for Hillary Clinton, many saw their vote as more of a bulwark against a President Trump than anything else.One of the most striking stories to come out of this election may be the number of immigrants Donald J. Trump inspired to earn their United States citizenship so they could vote against him. Idania Barousse, 36, is a pastoral associate at a Catholic church in San Jose, Calif., that serves a congregation of Hispanic immigrants. She immigrated to the United States from Nicaragua when she was 14 and obtained her green card shortly after. Despite living in the United States for more than two decades, she has never voted.\u201cI feel like I wasted 20 years plus, and now I feel like my eyes opened up,\u201d she said.In July, Ms. Barousse started the process of becoming a United States citizen and officially became one in September. She said she would be voting for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cMy spiritual life is connected to my neighbor, and I have to act by my actions,\u201d she told me. \u201cI cannot just cross my arms and pretend nothing\u2019s happening. I have to defend my neighbor.\u201dAnya Mironets, 31, is a clinical pharmacist in Fort Collins, Colo. She became a United States citizen after emigrating from Ukraine more than 10 years ago, but hasn\u2019t exercised her right to vote. Ms. Mironets said she worried that if Mr. Trump became president, the United States would start to resemble the former Soviet Union, where she grew up.\u201cMy mother, brother and other relatives still live in Ukraine. I worry about their safety every day, and Trump\u2019s praise of Putin and ignorance about Ukraine frightens me,\u201d she wrote in an email.She added that she regretted not voting sooner, but said that when she was growing up overseas few people bothered to vote because rampant corruption made it unclear whether your vote would be counted.\u201cIt took me a decade of living in the United States to leave that mind-set behind,\u201d she said.Abhi Singh, a 39-year-old filmmaker in San Francisco, became a citizen in 2015 and will be voting for Mrs. Clinton. Despite his reservations about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s foreign policy and her private email server, he sees voting against Mr. Trump as a civic duty this year.\u201cTo say that you are not voting because you are disappointed with the candidates is an arrogant display of privilege,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen grandmas in India wait in line for hours to cast their vote, and I can safely tell you that the candidates and prospects were not any better than what we are faced with today.\u201dPaola Anez-Kikendall, a 47-year-old mother of three in North Carolina, moved to the United States from Venezuela as a child, but \u201cfelt an urgency\u201d to become a citizen only this year. She identifies as a Republican, but said she could not stomach the party\u2019s nominee.\u201cAs a woman, as a Hispanic woman, as a mother of a grown child who happens to also be gay,\u201d she said, \u201cI just cannot do it.\u201d She voted early for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party candidate.\u201cYou could tell there was something different about this election to her,\u201d Mr. Trevisani said, referring to the woman. \u201cYou could tell it was personal.\u201dThe young Muslim voters I talked to have also taken Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy personally. Aisha Bhoori is a junior at Harvard, and while she feels safe on campus, she worries about her parents when they attend Friday Prayer at their mosque in New Jersey.\u201cIf Trump wins, it\u2019s not a stretch to say that my entire religion will be under attack and Islamophobic incidents will increase,\u201d she said.Ms. Bhoori supported Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary and said she has come to accept Mrs. Clinton \u201cwith the same measured enthusiasm that I do \u2018Hamilton,\u2019 the musical: She has her flaws, and I don\u2019t wholeheartedly agree with all of her policies, but she\u2019s cracked the glass ceiling, goddamn it, and done so in a competent and confident and composed way that makes me proud.\u201dImani Khan, a freshman at St. Louis University, said she hoped American Muslims like herself would exercise their right to vote. Many see voting as a morally impure act, she said, especially if the politician they elect ends up contributing to more Muslim suffering overseas.\u201cIt\u2019s about time we start joining a conversation that includes us,\u201d she said.Ms. Khan plans to vote for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Her reasoning: Missouri is not a swing state, and if the Green Party wins 5 percent of the popular vote this year, it will qualify for federal election funding in 2020.\u201cTwo parties do not cover the wide spectrum of Americans\u2019 political views,\u201d she said. \u201cOther countries have three, four, five, six parties. Why are we still stuck at two?\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t see their vote as a vote for a hateful agenda; quite the opposite. Tyler Rice, 20, a plumber in Kentucky, said he was \u201cextremely excited\u201d to cast his first ballot for Mr. Trump.\u201cHe is representing a class of people who have been long forgotten by the federal government,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cSoaked in dirty politics and pay to play scenarios. I\u2019m voting for Donald Trump because he will strengthen America back into what she has always been, The Best.\u201dOther young Republicans are more reticent in their support for Mr. Trump. Charlie Kolean, a senior at Michigan State University, said Mr. Trump had \u201cobvious flaws,\u201d but \u201cunderstands what drives the economy and will do what it takes to get the economy going.\u201dLaura Schmitt, a junior at the University of Wisconsin, identifies as a conservative but will be voting for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI wish I were more optimistic about this election like lots of young people were when Obama took office,\u201d she said. \u201cI am unable to support Donald Trump because he does not represent my values or what I believe the Republican Party truly represents.\u201dYoung female voters, especially young white ones, said their reaction to the prospect of the first female president surprised even them. Kiley Delaney, a junior at Macalester College in Minnesota, said she was excited to cast her first vote for Mrs. Clinton. When Mrs. Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination in July, Ms. Delaney \u2014 to her own surprise \u2014 started crying.\u201cI know it\u2019s not cool to be excited to vote for Hillary, and that we\u2019re supposed to preface every positive remark about her with, \u2018Well, she\u2019s certainly not perfect, but \u2026,\u2019 but I would be excited to vote for her even if Donald Trump wasn\u2019t her opponent,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that I will cry again at her inauguration.\u201dEllie Herman, a junior at the University of Wisconsin, persuaded her 87-year-old grandmother \u2014 a staunch Republican who despises the Clintons \u2014 to mail in her ballot for Mrs. Clinton.\u201cThe more I time I spend with my grandma, the more I think my liberal vibes are rubbing off on her,\u201d Ms. Herman said. \u201cThankfully, her hatred of Trump and availability to vote from home were enough reasons for her to vote for Hillary.\u201dNow there\u2019s just one more thing for them to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Small Factories Emerge as a Weapon in the Fight Against Poverty", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byBALTIMORE \u2014 James Branch\u2019s life seemed destined to follow a familiar arc in the streets that surround the Marlin Steel factory, where he bends metal from sunrise until near dark.He fathered a child while in high school, dropped out, then spent a dozen years selling drugs. He went to prison and, afterward, squatted in abandoned houses in West Baltimore. He worked the fryer at Popeyes and fought the temptation to go back to dealing on street corners that many Americans will know from the television series \u201cThe Wire.\u201dFortunately, things turned around for Mr. Branch.Now 40, he earns just over $20 an hour as a skilled machine operator at Marlin Steel, a small maker of specialized metal baskets used by much bigger manufacturers like Ford Motor, Boeing and Merck. He owns a car, rents a two-story townhouse with an airy backyard and recently watched the daughter he fathered at 16 as she graduated from college with a degree in psychology.What altered Mr. Branch\u2019s fate? There was his own discipline, of course, like completing a two-year course in metalwork between his shifts at Popeyes. Or getting up at 3:45 a.m. and taking three buses to avoid being late for his first factory job.But his success is also because of the unlikely survival of Marlin Steel, a rare breed: the urban industrial manufacturer.Marlin is a thriving factory in a place that, over the last half-century, factories have fled \u2014 first to the South, and later to Asia. That flight haunts the United States perhaps most in its urban areas \u2014 especially neighborhoods that once housed the nation\u2019s working class \u2014 and helps explain why many African-Americans in particular today live in poverty in metropolises like Baltimore, Detroit, Newark and St. Louis.Despite the candidates\u2019 election-year promises, factories will never employ the masses of Americans they once did. Automation and foreign competition will not abate no matter who occupies the Oval Office. Over the last 20 years, industrial employment has dropped by nearly one-third. Only 12.3 million Americans work in the sector today, millions fewer than in leisure and hospitality, for instance, the category that includes frying chicken at Popeyes.But small manufacturers like Marlin are vital if the United States is to narrow the nation\u2019s class divide and build a society that offers greater opportunities for everyone \u2014 rich and poor, black and white, high school graduates and Ph.D.s.\u201cThe closing of factories has taken the rungs out of the ladder for reaching the middle class in urban areas,\u201d said Robert A. Johnson, a former hedge fund investor who is now president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a liberal research group. Many service jobs do not pay as well, nor do they offer the same opportunities for advancement.And as the service sector has expanded in recent decades, less educated workers in big cities have largely been bypassed as demand has grown for well-compensated professionals in what Mr. Johnson calls F.T.E., or finance, technology and electronics.\u201cManufacturing jobs involve a skill base that you develop over time, and that fortifies your negotiating strength,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. But in lower-skilled jobs, the competition is with someone who will do the same work for less. \u201cThe marketplace doesn\u2019t give you any leverage,\u201d he said.Today, smaller plants are particularly important to job creation in factory work, said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. \u201cMegafactories are the exception today,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cSmall manufacturing is holding its own \u2014 and you are seeing some interesting developments in urban centers.\u201dWhile they may not rival the scale of 1950s assembly lines, these smaller craft-type producers hold out hope for cities, Mr. Paul said, particularly as some companies look to move jobs back from overseas to be closer to customers and more nimble to supply customized, small-batch orders.What is more, these jobs pay people more. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing workers typically earn just over $26 an hour. By contrast, medical orderlies and nurse\u2019s assistants (a growing field) earn half as much. And fast food, a mainstay for Americans with a high school diploma or less, has a median hourly wage of $9.11.For Mr. Branch, this is not abstract economics.\u201cThis changed my life,\u201d he said, standing next to one of the machines he operates, which can cost up to $300,000 each. \u201cI went from minimum wage at Popeyes to making almost 70K a year. They\u2019re proud of me in my old neighborhood. They say I made it out.\u201dWith the rise of Donald J. Trump, much of the economic debate during the presidential campaign has centered on the anger and economics of the white working class in the Rust Belt and elsewhere. That is partly because blue-collar whites were especially hard hit by factory closures in the last decade, largely as a result of competition from China and the savage recession eight years ago.But it was the black working class that was devastated first, by a decades-long decline of manufacturing employment.As the sociologist William Julius Wilson has written in his classic studies, \u201cThe Truly Disadvantaged\u201d and \u201cWhen Work Disappears,\u201d the exodus of factories from high-cost, union-dominated cities to cheaper, less union-friendly locales in the South and West in the 1960s and 1970s played a major role in the breakdown of urban cores.\u201cThe trends among non-college-educated, white Americans today look like a lot like the trends among black Americans in the 1970s that so worried policy makers and social scientists,\u201d said David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., who researches the connections among trade, labor and employment. \u201cYou see it in the falling labor force participation, the decline of traditional family structure, crime and poverty. It\u2019s all there.\u201dFor Marlin and its 24 employees, all of this hit close to home when riots swept the city in April 2015 after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black resident of West Baltimore, died in police custody. Stores were looted not far from the industrial park that\u2019s home to Marlin. The police enforced a nightly curfew.One Marlin employee, Joshua Wallace, an Iraq War veteran who serves in the National Guard, was called to duty and had to patrol the streets instead of manning the computerized cutting machine. The factory\u2019s night shift, which runs seven days a week, was shut down because Marlin\u2019s workers couldn\u2019t come or go after dark.\u201cI didn\u2019t want my guys to get shot,\u201d said Drew Greenblatt, Marlin\u2019s owner.At the same time, he does not possess squads of accountants and lawyers or foreign subsidiaries that can be used to lower Marlin\u2019s tax payments \u2014 strategies most Fortune 500 companies use to cut their taxes far below the official rate.Then there is the soaring cost of health insurance and other benefits, which Marlin provides, unlike many other low-wage service employers. Factory jobs tend to come with benefits \u2014 92 percent of manufacturing employees have access to employer-sponsored health care plans compared with 79 percent of workers over all.Health care coverage for Marlin\u2019s two dozen workers costs nearly $100,000 annually, up from about $45,000 five years ago, or about the cost of two additional employees. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how much is out of my control,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling how many obstacles there are in our way. But these people are depending on me.\u201dMarlin Steel is nearly a half-century old, but today it bears little resemblance to what Mr. Greenblatt found when he bought the company in 1998. \u201cIt was right out of a Charles Dickens novel,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said, describing Marlin\u2019s old factory, then in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. \u201cEverything was done by hand, but there were guys missing eyes and fingers. It was dangerous, and health care coverage meant going to the emergency room.\u201dFor the first three decades of Marlin\u2019s existence, the company almost exclusively made simple, sturdy, welded-wire bagel baskets. As the Jewish breakfast staple exploded in popularity outside the Northeast, Marlin prospered along with it.But by the early 2000s, the bagel craze was fading, and the popularity of the Atkins diet and carb-phobia started hurting bagel sales. China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 presented traditional manufacturers \u2014 and what is more old-school than bagel baskets? \u2014 with an existential threat.Chinese versions of Marlin\u2019s products were selling for $6 each, or less than what the steel alone cost in Marlin\u2019s baskets. The other $5 that Marlin charged, to cover salaries, taxes, equipment and a sliver of profit, was now just red ink.Mr. Greenblatt did what organisms threatened with extinction have always done to survive: He evolved.He moved the factory to Baltimore in 1999, with eight of his Brooklyn employees following him, including one who is still working on the floor. Then he began going after what economists call value-added goods, products that were more specialized and sophisticated what than the Chinese were making, and therefore able to command higher prices.But producing baskets with very specific requirements, or tolerances, as they are known, for automakers or aerospace giants could not be achieved by hand. \u201cIf a bagel falls out the bottom, that\u2019s 10 cents,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. \u201cA single airplane part can cost thousands of dollars, so there\u2019s no room for error.\u201dOver the course of a decade, he invested in robots that churned out baskets almost a hundred times as fast as human beings. He trained his workers to operate the robots, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each, and hired engineers to help design ever-more-sophisticated products to win customers and stay ahead of overseas rivals.\u201cIn Brooklyn, eight fellows could do 300 bends an hour,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt recalled. \u201cNow two guys running robots can do 25,000 bends per hour.\u201dToday, in fact, many of Marlin\u2019s robot-made baskets are designed specifically to be handled by other robots.Automation did not mean the elimination of jobs \u2014 in fact, it saved the company. But it does mean producing many more baskets with only a few more workers. So, while Marlin\u2019s revenue has grown to over $5 million today, from $800,000 when Mr. Greenblatt arrived, the company\u2019s work force has increased by just a third, to 24 people from 18 people.Marlin\u2019s comeback isn\u2019t exactly a secret. In 2012, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, visited the plant. Mr. Greenblatt is a well-known booster in industry circles.Less publicized is how the company\u2019s survival has transformed the lives of its workers, even as the Westport neighborhood around the factory, and other poor sections of Baltimore, remain deeply scarred. \u201cSome are dead, some are locked up,\u201d said Edward Derrill, 23, of the guys he grew up with in West Baltimore. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to end up like that.\u201dWith an associate\u2019s degree in computer science from Morgan State University, a historically black college in Baltimore, workers like Mr. Derrill can earn at least $50,000 a year. Besides health insurance, they also have access to a 401(k) plan and two weeks\u2019 paid vacation, a rarity at many local employers.\u201cYou can work your way up and get raises,\u201d he said. Mr. Derrill hopes to become a team leader soon, supervising other workers. Marlin also pays for its employees to go back to school and get degrees in related subjects like engineering, giving workers who never had a chance to attend college additional options.Nationwide and for men in particular, whether black or white, the erosion of manufacturing work has been especially devastating.In the 1950s, says Lawrence Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard, nearly one-third of the men who went to work after high school were employed in factories. Those jobs and that era are never coming back, Mr. Katz said, \u201cbut a job as a physical therapist or a home health aide doesn\u2019t fit the identity of someone who is a welder or a machinist.\u201dAnd while not all the workers at Marlin are men \u2014 the split is about 80-20 \u2014 for many blue-collar men there and elsewhere, the idea of working with one\u2019s hands and building things is closely connected to finding a purpose in life, and in the workplace. \u201cI call it an identity mismatch, and I think it\u2019s a huge issue for men,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cPure physical labor isn\u2019t much valued today, but we need to try and rebuild the service sector for men without college degrees.\u201dBrent Fox, 34, served with the Marine Corps in Iraq and is now the weekend shift supervisor at Marlin, a position that can pay well over $50,000 a year. While the money is a draw, Mr. Fox also said working in a service-type role doesn\u2019t appeal to him.\u201c\u2018You want fries with that?\u2019 No way,\u201d he said. \u201cI like being able to take raw material and make it into something. There\u2019s pride in making things \u2014 you don\u2019t get that in a lot of service jobs.\u201dNew employers have appeared in Baltimore, including an Amazon warehouse that employs more than 3,000. But with hourly wages of over $15 an hour, that is still less than what most Marlin workers earn.\u201cThis isn\u2019t theoretical,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said, shouting over the din of metal pounding on metal. \u201cManufacturing bootstraps people out of poverty.\u201d\u201cTry to get a job,\u201d said John Brooks, who has lived in Westport for most of his 63 years. \u201cThey won\u2019t hire people from here.\u201dTicking off Baltimore employers of yesteryear \u2014 like Bethlehem Steel, and Carr Lowrey, a glassmaker that shut its doors in 2003 after 114 years down by the Patapsco River \u2014 Mr. Brooks shook his head.\u201cMcDonald\u2019s, you might not even get that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere used to be plenty of factories here. You didn\u2019t even need a high school diploma to work at Bethlehem Steel.\u201dOnce upon a time, Mr. Branch, the Marlin machine operator, also lacked a high school diploma. He earned one through an equivalency test, and later helped other prisoners earn their G.E.D.s during his time inside.After Popeyes and his course at the Magna Baltimore Technical Training Center, Mr. Branch landed a job at Crown Cork & Seal in a suburb of Baltimore. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone else would have taken a chance on me,\u201d he said.\u201cThe worst feeling in the world was watching my kids get up and leave after they visited me in prison,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI promised them I wouldn\u2019t put them through that again.\u201dMr. Greenblatt had worked with Magna, and when a headhunter steered Mr. Branch to Marlin Steel, it was a natural fit. \u201cI like being creative,\u201d Mr. Branch said, as he entered figures that would determine the diameter and angles of the parts that his machine produces.\u201cGod gave me a lot of blessings,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lived that life on the corner, you never knew which day would be your last. Now I can come home, sit on my couch, look at my big-screen TV and appreciate it because it came from honest, hard work. That\u2019s a great feeling, and nothing can take that away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Theresa May, British Premier, Urges Conservatives to Claim \u2018New Center Ground\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byBIRMINGHAM, England \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain capped the Conservative Party\u2019s convention on Wednesday by breaking with the domestic agenda of her predecessor, courting working-class voters and promising to use the power of government to rein in abuses by big business.Addressing delegates in Birmingham, England, at a conference that had been dominated by the issue of Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union, Mrs. May sought to redefine the profile of her party by claiming a \u201cnew center ground.\u201dMrs. May\u2019s speech suggested that her government would protect hard-pressed families who have struggled in the globalized economy that her predecessor, David Cameron, embraced enthusiastically.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the wealthy who made the biggest financial sacrifices after the financial crisis,\u201d Mrs. May said, adding that \u201cchange is going to come\u201d and pledging to pursue firms that fail to pay their share of tax.\u201cToo many people in positions of power behave as though they have more in common with international elites than the people down the road,\u201d she said.Conservative leaders have sought for years to reduce state intervention, but Mrs. May struck a different tone, saying that her government would tackle injustice and create an economy that benefited ordinary working people.Amid uncertainty from the unexpected decision by voters to leave the European Union, Mrs. May has sought to steady British politics, and she received an enthusiastic reception from delegates on Wednesday.\u201cJust listen to the way a lot of politicians and commentators talk about the public,\u201d Mrs. May said at the convention. \u201cThey find your patriotism distasteful, your concerns about immigration parochial, your views about crime illiberal, your attachment to your job security inconvenient.\u201dShe continued, \u201cThey find the fact that more than 17 million voters decided to leave the European Union simply bewildering.\u201dMrs. May supported continued membership in the European Union during the referendum campaign, though tepidly, but she has since embraced the cause of withdrawal, known as Brexit. She has given strong indications that she is willing to make a clean break from the bloc, even if that curtails the access of British businesses to Continental markets.The centrist Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, have just eight lawmakers in Parliament.As part of the Conservatives\u2019 effort to attract working-class voters, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, defended proposals that could require British companies to publish the number of foreign workers they employ.Mr. Corbyn accused the Conservatives of xenophobia and of blaming foreigners \u201cfor their own failures,\u201d adding that \u201cdrawing up lists of foreign workers won\u2019t stop unscrupulous employers undercutting wages in Britain.\u201dBritain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.The measure also appears to be at odds with the views of some of Ms. Rudd\u2019s cabinet colleagues, who have expressed concern about the risks to the economy if access to employees from the Continent is restricted.In the bars and corridors of the convention center in Birmingham, the debate focused on whether Britain would make compromises in an effort to maintain close economic ties with the European Union. Mrs. May\u2019s comments in the first of two speeches delivered on Sunday suggested that a \u201chard Brexit,\u201d with fewer concessions, was more likely.The British economy has not suffered the grievous damage many supporters of European Union membership had feared would follow a vote for withdrawal, and the stock market is buoyant.But Britain remains a full member of the bloc, and it will almost certainly continue to be one until the spring of 2019. This means that the effect on many parts of the economy have yet to be felt, and there are ominous signs.Perhaps most significant, the pound has dropped to its lowest level against the dollar in more than three decades, as currency markets continue to express concern that Britain may ultimately find itself outside the European Union\u2019s tariff-free market of around 500 million consumers.Britain\u2019s financial services sector, which accounts for almost 12 percent of economic output and 1.1 million jobs, is particularly worried that it will lose the right to operate freely throughout the bloc, under a system known as \u201cpassporting.\u201dMrs. May has given no indication that she is willing to make trade-offs with European partners to smooth market access for banks. Such concessions could include allowing the free movement of people across European frontiers and paying budget contributions to the bloc.Instead, the comments by Mrs. May and Ms. Rudd suggested that controlling immigration would be a higher priority than placating bankers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Countdown Clock on Brexit", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe prime minister, Theresa May, put the best face on the decision, declaring that Britain would once again become a \u201cfully independent, sovereign country,\u201d while her insouciant foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, repeated his foolish quip that Britain\u2019s policy was \u201chaving our cake and eating it.\u201d Yet the reality is that Britain has a lot to lose in leaving the union, and that putting a two-year limit on the negotiations further weakens an already shaky hand.It may well be that Mrs. May had little choice but to set a date for formally invoking Article 50 of a European Union treaty, which sets the rules for withdrawing, after the British voted to opt out in a referendum in June. Her government may have preferred to informally sound out Europeans on arrangements that would let Britain stay in the common European market while ending free entry for other Europeans, the main demand of the \u201cLeave\u201d voters. But the other 27 members of the union, led by France and Germany, made clear they had no interest in \u201cprenegotiations\u201d or any special deal for London. At the same time, hard-core Euroskeptics demanded that Mrs. May get moving on Brexit.Even with good intentions on all sides, two years is very little time for the complex process of disentangling Britain from the bloc\u2019s rules and procedures, especially since that also entails negotiating new trade agreements with the bloc itself and with all the countries that have trade deals with the European Union.If the talks run out of time or collapse in acrimony, Britain could simply be thrown out of the union, facing tariffs on its manufactured goods and losing the \u201cpassporting\u201d rights for British financial services to operate throughout the bloc.That would be a far greater blow to Britain than to the European Union. Britain is dependent on the union market for 45 percent of its exports, while only 16 percent of the union\u2019s exports are to Britain, and the British financial industry, which serves the European market, accounts for 10 percent of Britain\u2019s gross domestic product.No doubt the remaining 27 countries would prefer a harmonious divorce with minimal disruption to their economies, and perhaps that is what will happen. But with nationalist and populist parties on the rise in many European countries, and with the union facing economic and social challenges, the bloc\u2019s leaders are rightly determined to demonstrate that no member can be allowed to pick and choose among the \u201cfour freedoms\u201d to which the union is committed \u2014 freedom of goods, services, capital and people \u2014 and that opting out carries a serious penalty.Advertisement"}

Stellar sales growth. The global market for high-end personal goods is headed for its weakest year since 2009.Sales of designer handbags, shoes, cocktail dresses and the like are expected to flatline this year at 249 billion euros, or $273.4 billion, at constant exchange rates (that is to say, excluding currency swings), according to the study. At current exchange rates, sales have slipped 1 percent when compared to the \u20ac251 billion in sales of personal luxury goods last year.\u201cAfter years of unstoppable growth, this is the new normal for the luxury industry,\u201d said Federica Levato, a Milan-based partner at Bain.

But globally, the gains from local shoppers choosing to spend closer to home have failed to offset the slowdown in purchases by Chinese tourists abroad.Experience trumps productAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politicians Place a Bet on a Stadium, and Vegas Pays for It", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 The fight to get professional football to Nevada is actually a story of inside baseball.The Oakland Raiders want to move to Las Vegas, and the city\u2019s politicians, business leaders and legions of football fans are salivating. The catch, as usual, is the price tag. The Raiders want a new, 65,000-seat stadium as part of the deal, and they\u2019re asking for the state to pitch in to cover the nearly $2 billion cost using a tax on Vegas-area hotel rooms.The Raiders\u2019 owner, Mark Davis, has pledged $500 million, and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has offered $650 million. But both offers are contingent on the Nevada government\u2019s ponying up the remaining $750 million. Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, has called a special session of the Legislature next week to decide.Backers are betting on the fact that Las Vegas is already mad for pro sports, despite the lack of pro teams. A Sunday afternoon in a packed casino sports book lounge, with local and visiting gamblers gathering in swarms to ponder point spreads, attests to the city\u2019s enthusiasm.Las Vegas\u2019s first professional sports team, a yet-to-be-named National Hockey League expansion outfit, will debut next year, and with more than 15,000 deposits already made on season tickets, it is clear the city is excited about the arrival of professional sports franchises.But there\u2019s a difference between the proposed Raiders stadium and the new, privately funded site where the N.H.L. team will play, T-Mobile Arena. Hockey teams play 41 regular-season games at home; N.F.L. teams play just eight. The Rebels of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, will use the Raiders stadium too, but altogether it will host only about 46 events a year.Economists overwhelmingly agree that stadiums are not good economic investments for cities, but supporters claim the stadium could produce up to $800 million in new economic activity each year. But it\u2019s unclear how that can happen, since so few events will produce little job growth, and investors have made it clear the public will not share in any stadium profits.Supporters respond that the public funds in Vegas will come from an increased tax on hotel rooms, which means, they say, that tourists will foot the bill.And because room tax revenue is largely dependent on a thriving tourism industry and strong economy, there is a huge risk that those taxes won\u2019t be enough if a recession hits.Three groups in Nevada have voiced their disapproval of the stadium financing in its current form: the Nevada Taxpayers Association, Nevadans for the Common Good (a nonpartisan group of religious and community leaders) and the state\u2019s largest union, Culinary Local 226.Despite the growing coalition of the opposition, it is an underdog versus Mr. Adelson, one of the most powerful people in the state. He has been adamant that the stadium is a \u201cmust do\u201d \u2014 so much so that after the board of his casino company, Las Vegas Sands, denied his request to invest in the stadium, he offered up financing from his own personal fortune, an estimated $28 billion.In a country where football is king, no one \u2014 particularly not local politicians \u2014 wants to be responsible for passing up an N.F.L. franchise.Since the introduction of the stadium proposal in the spring, legislators including the State Senate majority leader, Michael Roberson, a Republican, have made it clear that they would not approve previously recommended projects without also approving the stadium proposal (like many state politicians in both parties, Mr. Roberson has received political donations from the Las Vegas Sands).Next week, it\u2019s a good bet that the stadium will pass, simply because stadium politics \u2014 whether in Las Vegas or San Diego \u2014 bring out two of America\u2019s deepest manias: sports fanaticism, and the feeding frenzy set off whenever wealthy investors dangle money in front of politicians.Lost in both is any consideration of what the people actually want, let alone need.An Op-Ed article on Friday about Las Vegas misstated when a National Hockey League team will make its debut there. The team is scheduled to open its first season in 2017, not this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sales in Trump Buildings Fall Off", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byWhen Harvey Koeppel and his wife, Peggy Koeppel, bought their three-bedroom apartment on the 12th floor of Trump Place at 200 Riverside Boulevard in 2000, it seemed like a solid investment.With Hudson River views and amenities that include a full-time doorman, concierge desk, a gym filled with the latest Life Fitness equipment and a pool that eventually got its own waterfall, they thought they\u2019d found the perfect spot to raise their son.A trove of celebrities \u2014 including Kathleen Turner, Bruce Willis, Kristin Chenoweth and Montel Williams \u2014 moved into Trump condominium buildings in the complex, increasing the sense of panache.In 2012, the Obamas even made an appearance, darting into the neighboring 220 Riverside Boulevard for a re-election fund-raiser.The Koeppels were never huge fans of Donald J. Trump, but gave little thought to the fact that their home carried his name.Until the 2016 election. This summer, the couple, who were in the process of retiring and moving full time to their country house in Rhinebeck, N.Y., listed their apartment with the Corcoran Group for $2.85 million.Two people showed up at their open house in late September. No one made an offer, even after the Koeppels dropped their price by $55,000. Then, in mid-October, their broker suggested cutting the price by another $100,000 and they decided to delist it.\u201cWe\u2019re taking it off the market,\u201d Mr. Koeppel said. \u201cMy sense is that there\u2019s a definite negative impact to having Trump\u2019s name there right now. For me personally, I\u2019m embarrassed to tell people I live in a Trump building.\u201dWhile there are other factors that may explain why the Koeppels\u2019 apartment has had no takers \u2014 $3,711 in monthly common charges and real estate taxes is no small sum \u2014 the couple is not alone in thinking this caustic campaign season has had an unforeseen effect on the Manhattan residential properties that carry the Trump name.And north, at 220 Riverside Drive, Ian Shrank, the owner of a 1,900-square-foot 36th-floor condo, has been petitioning to have the Trump name removed from that building. So far, those efforts have not borne fruit, and Mr. Shrank declined to comment, saying that any attempt to discuss the matter could only lead to more unwanted publicity for the building he loves and the name on it that he doesn\u2019t.There are clearly dissenters arguing to keep well enough alone. Abe Botha, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman Real Estate who has sold several dozen apartments at Riverside Boulevard, said he was more concerned about the larger New York real estate economy than about fallout from the presidential race.\u201cThere\u2019s an overall softening,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Trump still has his supporters, including some on Riverside Boulevard who see having the Trump name as a bonus. \u201cThere are plenty of people who would purchase in one of the Trump buildings, probably as many as who wouldn\u2019t.\u201dMr. Botha did not seem eager to mention in an interview that he is an owner at Riverside Boulevard as well as a broker there.Nearby was a broker from Corcoran, taking what may be a last whack at trying to sell the Koeppels\u2019 apartment. How was that going, a reporter asked. \u201cSlow,\u201d said the broker, who did not wish to be identified.There is increasing data to suggest that potential homeowners may be wary about buying in properties carrying the Trump name. Over the last two years, the amount of available inventory from Trump-branded residential buildings in Manhattan has stayed relatively constant, according to listings pulled from StreetEasy.com.To Michael Vargas, a principal of the Manhattan-based Vanderbilt Appraisal Company, the data had clear indications. \u201cAbsorption rates are a pretty good way to look at this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been a reassessment of that brand, on the part of property owners. Where that brand used to enhance value, it is now being perceived as a detraction to value. It\u2019s a slowdown in the real estate market combined with a negative view of the brand.\u201dAt Trump Park Avenue, the 30-plus-story former hotel that Mr. Trump purchased in 2002 and converted into condos, 10 apartments sold last year while eight were delisted. This year, six apartments sold and 18 units were listed but later taken off the market, according to StreetEasy.The condominium buildings on Riverside Boulevard told a similar story, with the number of listings taken off the market rising to 82 from 67, even as available units inched downward. This was also the case at Trump International, the 44-story condominium tower at the northern tip of Columbus Circle, where six of 14 units sold this year, compared with 14 of 20 last year.\u201cI can\u2019t see any good near-term or long-term effect for this campaign on Trump\u2019s real estate brand,\u201d said Robert Dankner, the president of Prime Manhattan Residential. \u201cDoes the election bring attention to Donald Trump\u2019s brand?\u201d Mr. Dankner said. \u201cYes. Does it increase the good will toward his brand? No. He\u2019s turning a lot of people off, with his divisive statements that are directed toward specific nationalities and religions.\u201dStill, few brokers who have sold apartments in Trump buildings seem willing to go as far as Mr. Dankner, citing both Mr. Trump\u2019s long history of lawsuits and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2019s standing in the real estate community, thanks in part to his status as the owner of the New York Observer.Repeated attempts to obtain comment from representatives of Mr. Trump were unsuccessful.Selling the property has been \u201ca huge problem,\u201d Ms. Sun said. \u201cMy owner bought it for around $1.025 million. Now she\u2019s taking a huge loss.\u201dAs Ms. Sun was quick to note, her problems with the listing extend beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and include the fact that some major banks do not lend to buyers in hotel/condo buildings. But, she added, \u201cI have international buyers who said right away, \u2018I do not want to be associated with Trump anything.\u2019 \u201dAt Trump Tower, it is particularly hard to argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s dominance of the news cycle is bringing the sort of attention buyers and sellers crave. Paparazzi line up outside regularly to catch Mr. Trump entering and leaving the building, where he lives in a three-floor, marble accented penthouse. Protesters parade by, carrying slogans that refer in explicit terms to both Mr. Trump and his opponent, Hillary Clinton.Carl Giuseppone, a former owner at Trump World Tower, said that \u201cwhen Trump is alienating a lot of people because of his rhetoric, it gets very difficult to move property.\u201dBut Don Reiss, a 71-year-old homeowner and lifelong Democrat at 220 Riverside Boulevard, remains optimistic this will blow over.\u201cIt\u2019s like buying a stock that goes down for a little while,\u201d Mr. Reiss said.Perhaps that explains why the seller of a $35 million penthouse at Trump Park Avenue delisted the apartment back in December after having no luck finding a buyer in the current market.The owner\u2019s name?

Different as they are, both approaches underscore that Europe is important.In Copenhagen, the Danish capital, the sense is similar, while exceptionalism remains.Denmark approved the Maastricht Treaty, which essentially established the European Union as it is now known, in 1993, only after rejecting it and negotiating four opt-outs \u2014 including waivers for the euro and defense.The Nordic neighborhood illustrates Europe\u2019s adaptability. Like Denmark, Sweden is part of the bloc but does not use the euro. Norway is a nonmember but pays heavily for access to the union\u2019s single market. Finland is in the bloc and uses the euro. Neither Finland nor Sweden, both neutral, are part of NATO; Denmark and Norway are.At the Copenhagen debate, Ulrik Vestergaard Knudsen, the top civil servant in the Danish Foreign Ministry, listed his country\u2019s five top security concerns: migration, terrorism, Russia, the Islamic State and Brexit. All are primarily European concerns, and none of them, he noted, were considered major issues three and a half years ago.\u201cWe do not see an alternative\u201d to the European Union in addressing them, and \u201cwe need to talk about European successes.\u201dTwo chance meetings in this lively capital underscored that view. At the national art museum, I talked with Jan Meyrowitsch, a biologist whose parents were among some 500 Danish Jews deported in 1943 to the Nazi camp at Terezin, north of Prague.They survived, returned and built another life. Among many other things, Mr. Meyrowitsch received almost 1 million euros, about $1.1 million, in European Union funds for his study of how visual perception might alleviate disease.Another scientist, Russell Gray, a New Zealand professor studying human and animal behavior, is one of many researchers lured to Germany during the administration of Chancellor Angela Merkel, a trained physicist.Mr. Gray is living in Jena, in the former East Germany. It\u2019s interesting, he said, with \u201cneo-Nazis\u201d occasionally marching in the streets and some of the hundreds of thousands of newly arrived asylum-seekers turning up in his wife\u2019s German classes.At dinner in the trendy meatpacking district, he relished Europe\u2019s variety and riches.Or, as Mr. Meyrowitsch put it: \u201cI am a library of books, of fates.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What we don\u2019t know is how far he intends to push his vision of a more independent foreign policy that is not tied to the strategic objectives of his country\u2019s most important ally.Such an alarming about-face would be a serious blow to regional stability and to President Obama\u2019s policy of strengthening relations with Asian countries as a counterpoint to a newly aggressive China.It is not unusual for national leaders to want to set their own paths; Mr. Duterte\u2019s views reflect resentments among some Filipinos that America has not always treated their country with respect. Still, his approach is counterproductive. He may believe that by criticizing the United States he will inspire China to invest more heavily in his country\u2019s struggling economy. But that posture generates deep concern in Washington and among Asian leaders who believe close ties with the United States are necessary to deter China from exerting hegemony over the South China Sea and its disputed islands, fishing beds and deposits of oil and gas.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is among those leaders. He reportedly warned Mr. Duterte that whatever his disagreements with the United States, China is no substitute ally. He\u2019s right: The only Philippine security treaty is with the United States, the two militaries are deeply entwined and millions of Filipino-Americans live in the United States.Mr. Abe no doubt also pointed out that both Japan and the Philippines are involved in maritime disputes with China and both have a lot to lose if China ignores a ruling in July by an international court in The Hague that overruled its claims in the South China Sea. To press the point, Mr. Abe gave Mr. Duterte two coast guard ships to help protect its territorial interests.While Mr. Duterte pledged to work closely with Japan to find a peaceful settlement of the disputes, whether he will carry through on that or will eventually sacrifice ties with the United States and Japan in favor of closer relations with China is increasingly an open question.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Will Speak for Haiti\u2019s Trees?", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDurham, N.C. \u2014 Flying over the mountains into Port-au-Prince, Haiti, a few years ago, I sat next to a volunteer taking her first trip to the country. \u201cI see trees,\u201d she said, pointing down at the hillsides. \u201cThey told us there are no trees.\u201dForeign descriptions of the country frequently claim it is almost completely deforested; people often reference a striking 1987 National Geographic photograph of the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti, forested on one side and barren on the other, as proof. In the common imagination, Haitians literally devour their forests; last week a meteorologist in Florida, describing the impact of Hurricane Matthew, said, \u201cEven the kids there, they are so hungry they actually eat the trees.\u201dThe destruction of Haiti\u2019s forests has been going on for centuries. When the French colonized the island starting in the 17th century, they cut down trees for lumber and fuel, and mahogany for furniture. By the late 18th century it was the most profitable plantation colony in the world, populated mostly by slaves and producing sugar and coffee for export. Hillsides near towns were already bare, and colonial towns frequently flooded.After Haiti\u2019s successful war of independence in 1804, former slaves got access to the country\u2019s land, and deforestation continued apace. They grew trees for coffee, fruit and lumber on their farms, which were part of an expanding economy rooted in a network of markets and ports. Dyewood was harvested and exported from Haiti throughout the 19th century.The first aerial photographs of the island, taken during the American occupation in the early 1930s, still show relatively widespread tree cover. By the 1940s and 1950s, however, deforestation was accelerating. In their novels, Haitian writers like Jacques Roumain and Marie Vieux Chauvet depicted a rural country tilting into poverty in a steadily worsening cycle: Increased population put more pressure on the forests, whose overuse and destruction made the land less productive. Many left for the cities, which expanded exponentially, their populations dependent on charcoal produced by cutting down trees in the countryside.The Haitian government did little to help, instead courting outside corporate interests. In the early 1940s, a Haitian-American project cleared 50,000 acres to plant rubber trees to contribute to the American war effort. The plan foundered and left the landscape scarred; in the area of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie alone, as many as a million fruit trees were destroyed. Industry wasn\u2019t the only culprit: In 1941, as part of a \u201canti-superstition\u201d campaign led by the Roman Catholic Church, sacred mapou trees were cut down.The situation worsened during the three decades of the Duvalier dictatorships. Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier ordered sections of the border with the Dominican Republic cleared to make it easier to police. By the time his son was overthrown in 1986, the country faced an environmental crisis. The new Constitution included a call for the protection of \u201cforest reserves\u201d by developing alternatives to charcoal, but little has been done to carry this out.Roadblocks to reforestation remain, especially for hillsides. Rural residents are wary of putting the effort into cultivating trees far from their homes, where it is easy for someone else to cut them down. But in recent years some have succeeded in tackling this problem by organizing reforestation efforts along entire watersheds. Where there are trees higher up, their roots and richer soils absorb rain, which decreases flooding below. When organizations tackle the problem holistically, connecting communities up and down a watershed, deforestation can be reversed with remarkable success.These initiatives provide clear examples of what works. Such strategies should be scaled up and shared on a national level, so that they can be applied in Haiti\u2019s diverse watersheds.The challenges are daunting, to be sure. But this is the moment to build on the knowledge already present in many communities about how to reforest the country. We should imagine a Haiti covered in trees, and begin to plant that future.Laurent Dubois, a professor of romance studies and history at Duke, is the author of \u201cHaiti: The Aftershocks of History.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany Withdraws Approval for Chinese Takeover of Aixtron", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 In a surprise move on Monday, the German authorities withdrew approval for the takeover of a domestic semiconductor firm by a Chinese bidder, a deal that was set to be an emblem of a new push by Chinese companies to acquire cutting-edge technology businesses and a sign of Berlin\u2019s tolerance for such moves.Although Chinese investment in European companies is nothing new, some experts have raised concerns as Chinese funds have shifted focus from ailing businesses to more advanced and successful firms, particularly in Germany. So far this year, the country has been the largest recipient of Chinese investment in Europe, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a research foundation based in Berlin.Many German companies retain a lead over Chinese competitors, but the wholesale purchase of firms like Aixtron has raised the specter of the technology being spirited away to the supply chain in China, as Beijing details in state economic plans.For Germany, that could mean a long-term loss of know-how and upper-class jobs. The country is particularly vulnerable because of its large number of highly advanced, small and midsize companies \u2014 known as the Mittelstand \u2014 that can be taken over more easily and more cheaply than large multinationals.Also this year, the robotics company Kuka \u2014 whose orange arms are ubiquitous in highly automated German auto plants \u2014 was taken over by the Chinese appliance maker Midea. And this month, Chinese news media said that two Chinese companies were considering a bid for Osram Licht, a Munich-based lighting and semiconductor firm.In its statement, Aixtron said the German Economics Ministry would reopen a review of the proceedings.The ministry confirmed that it had withdrawn its initial approval for the deal, but did not provide further details.In recent months, Germany\u2019s economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, as well as G\u00fcnther Oettinger, a German who is the European commissioner for the digital economy, have begun calling openly for new measures that would give the European Union and its member states more power to regulate acquisitions by non-European firms, particularly when those investors have ties to foreign governments.\u201cClearly, many German and European policy makers and senior officials have taken a second look at the investors and intentions behind Chinese acquisitions of high-tech companies,\u201d said Sebastian Heilmann, president of the Mercator Institute. \u201cChinese M.&A. activity has come to be seen as driven by government-sponsored programs, funds and investor networks in many cases.\u201dQuestions were raised in the case of Aixtron, as both the customer that dropped the orders and Fujian Grand Chip are related to state-controlled investment firms.The company that dropped the orders, San\u2019an Optoelectronics, is also one of the companies considering a bid for Osram Licht.When the Aixtron merger was announced, San\u2019an and Fujian Grand Chip had a common investor and an existing financial relationship, among other links. And they are both recipients of government funds. Although it is not clear whether the two coordinated in any way, they are a product of a new approach that Beijing has taken to develop its semiconductor industry.Nicola Clark contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Simple Tax Rule Let Donald Trump Turn a $916 Million Loss Into a Plus", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byIt is among the least controversial parts of the federal tax code, almost as old as the income tax itself: A business, big or small, can escape taxation if it lost money in a previous year, a rule that helps businesses weather tough economic times, and hopefully thrive again.But in the early 1990s, as his overleveraged and indebted properties faltered and he teetered on the edge of personal bankruptcy, Donald J. Trump sought to take this ordinary provision to an enormous scale and escape a foundering business \u2014 and avoid taxes for years going forward.The maneuver would have protected him for up to 18 years\u2019 worth of income taxes, easing his path to his new career: leveraging his name and knack for publicity while minimizing the risks to his fortune. Trump-branded apartment buildings, golf courses, men\u2019s wear and steaks were followed by his lucrative hit reality television series.\u201cI was able to use the tax laws in this country and my business acumen to dig out of the real estate mess,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Monday in a campaign appearance in Colorado. \u201cFew others were able to do what I did.\u201dBecause he has broken with decades of American political tradition and steadfastly refused to release any full personal income tax returns, much about what Mr. Trump did remains unclear. But the disclosure of his 1995 tax maneuver has led to a rare moment in which the arcana of tax policy turned into a national political issue.And much like the admission by Mitt Romney in 2012 that he had paid an effective income tax rate of less than 14 percent in some years while amassing a $250 million fortune, the disclosure of Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitious tax maneuver was seized on by Democrats as an illustration of the huge advantages tax rules can bestow on the wealthy.More than 500,000 individual taxpayers took advantage of the same tax rule as Mr. Trump in 1995, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The average loss they claimed, however, was just $97,600. Mr. Trump\u2019s $916 million loss accounted for almost 2 percent of the national total.\u201cHe likes to say he does things in a big way, but I doubt he would boast about having what was likely the biggest net operating loss in the economy,\u201d said Lily Batchelder, a law and public policy professor at New York University.The rule that let Mr. Trump shelter almost $1 billion in income from taxation dates to 1918. It was enacted to prevent businesses from being penalized by the administrative convenience of calendar-year taxation: If a company loses $100,000 one year, and makes $100,000 the following year, the law allows the company to pay nothing in taxes, as it has only broken even.There is nothing unusual about business losses appearing on a personal tax return. Most American businesses are organized as \u201cpass-throughs,\u201d rather than corporations, meaning their profits are passed through to their owners, and taxed as personal income. Losses are passed through, too.\u201cIt\u2019s good policy,\u201d said Alan Cole, an economist at the conservative Tax Foundation. \u201cThis is just the astounding edge case that has everyone\u2019s eyes bulging as they look at that number.\u201dBut the rule also reflects an inequity in how income earned through labor is taxed compared with income earned through capital. Mere wage earners cannot avail themselves of the provision Mr. Trump and other business owners use to avoid taxes.\u201cAs individuals, we generally don\u2019t get this,\u201d said David Herzig, a tax law professor at Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana. \u201cIf you experience a loss in one year, you don\u2019t get to carry it forward or carry it back.\u201dMs. Batchelder said that it would be a boon to working families if they could carry over their deductions or spread out their taxable incomes over many years the way businesses do with their operating losses. \u201cVirtually every taxpayer would be better off if they were able to pay tax on their average income rather than their income in a given year,\u201d said Ms. Batchelder, who was deputy director of the White House National Economic Council under President Obama.It remains unclear exactly how Mr. Trump lost such a huge sum. But the rough outline of his business decline is well established. By the early 1990s, Mr. Trump had amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in personal financial liability and had lost money on casinos, his Plaza Hotel property in Manhattan and his airline, though precisely how he reflected those losses on his taxes is not known.But the federal government has made it particularly easy for real estate investors to avoid taxes. Investors, for example, can walk away from a property and record the investment as a loss \u2014 even if they were playing with borrowed money. While a profit from that same property would be treated as a capital gain, losses are treated as \u201coperating losses\u201d under a tax code provision that dates back to the Great Depression. Those losses can be deployed far more flexibly than capital losses to shield other income from taxation.\u201cHe was forced to sell many of his investments in the early 1990s, at pennies on the dollar, teetering on bankruptcy,\u201d Edward Kleinbard, a tax expert at the University of Southern California, said of Mr. Trump. \u201cThere were real economic losses from those investments \u2014 borne entirely by the lenders. Yet nonetheless he was able to emerge with a large net operating loss to carry forward, attributable primarily to losing other people\u2019s money.\u201dMr. Trump has defended his tax maneuvers over the years not only as legal and appropriate, but as proof of his business acumen. But whether the government agreed with that assessment is an open question. A letter to Mr. Trump from his lawyers, which the campaign released in March, indicated that the government may have examined those claims, several tax lawyers said.The letter said that an audit of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns for 2002 through 2008 was \u201cclosed administratively by agreement with the I.R.S. without assessment or payment, on a net basis, of any deficiency.\u201d That language suggests, the experts said, that the government may have reduced what Mr. Trump was able to claim as a loss without requiring him to pay any additional taxes.The revelation that Mr. Trump could have avoided paying federal income taxes for 18 years is likely to thrust into the spotlight a tax provision that has received little attention from Congress for decades. Members of both parties have argued in recent years for new limits on the use of past losses to offset profits. Democrats have called for reducing the number of years such a shield can be used.House Republicans have proposed a change that would prevent taxpayers from using past losses to avoid income taxes entirely.Mr. Trump did not include that proposal in his own tax plan. He did propose a large tax cut for businesses, including real estate investment firms, although Mr. Trump has not clarified the size of those cuts. His campaign continues to publicize competing versions of the plan.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "East Hampton Bar Is Set to Close, Taking More Than Its Stools", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byEAST HAMPTON, N.Y. \u2014 \u201cJungle Pete\u2019s Will Remain Open All Winter,\u201d reads the 1945 advertisement for an East Hampton bar in a local newspaper, setting it apart from the host of establishments in the gilded hamlets on the East End of Long Island that catered then, as they do now, to the summer set.Today it is renamed Wolfie\u2019s Tavern, but the bar in the down-home neighborhood of Springs still serves the year-rounders on the other side of the hedgerow \u2014 the people who catch the lobsters, clean the pools and keep the fairways trimmed. But this weekend Wolfie\u2019s will close for good, the resolution of a rent dispute between the owner of the shingle-style building and the bar\u2019s current proprietor.Among those clutching beers a few days before the closing, there was a sense that something more than a dive bar was slipping away. At a time when local refuges like Montauk at the very tip of Long Island have increasingly given up ground to the moneyed summertime crowd, it felt to the drinkers that, out east, the party\u2019s over for those who call it home.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for a local guy to find a decent place where he\u2019s going to feel comfortable \u2014 someplace where we blend in,\u201d Harry Stevenson, a taxi driver who grew up in Springs, said as he sat at the bar. \u201cEverything gets very high end, and becomes marketed to the \u2018Hamptons crowd\u2019 and not to the local crowd.\u201dMr. Stevenson said he planned to move in a few months to rural Pennsylvania, where his adult children had relocated after being priced out of the area. \u201cI\u2019m tired of trying to survive out here,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I would never give up, and I\u2019ve given up. I\u2019m done.\u201dIn one corner of the bar, Charlie Deering, 89, piped up to wax wistful about the decades he had been enjoying the bar in all its iterations \u2014 or at least he tried to.\u201cFirst time he came here,\u201d Mr. Stevenson said, cutting him off, \u201che fell off his dinosaur!\u201d The men at the bar roared with laughter.The camaraderie, the sense that you can arrive alone and someone you have known all your life will be waiting on a bar stool, has permeated Wolfie\u2019s through its many years. In the 1950s, the tavern was a watering hole for luminaries like Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock, painters drawn to Springs by the quality of light glinting off Accabonac Harbor and affordable land where they could set up their studios.It is the only bar in the working- and middle-class neighborhood, where the small houses are no longer within financial reach of the fishermen and farmers whose families are so deeply rooted here that their last names grace the street signs. In the third quarter of this year, the median price of a home in Springs had climbed to $850,000, on par with the rest of the town.While there are four Ralph Lauren stores along Main Street in East Hampton, the amenities for year-round living are slim. In 2013, a 54-year-old bowling alley closed, preceded a year before by Bucket\u2019s Deli, where men in work boots lined up each afternoon for sandwiches. In its place stands Mary\u2019s Marvelous, a coffee shop where a large latte costs $4.50. The change has been particularly striking in Montauk, once a sleepy fishing village, where lounges have replaced dockside fish shacks, and an upscale hipster scene threatens to edge out the local surfers plying the waves at dawn before work.Those changes have made the few remaining local haunts all the more vital, said Jack Hodgens, who arrived at Wolfie\u2019s after his shift ended at a restaurant. \u201cI think there are certain corners where we can reside, where you can feel real,\u201d Mr. Hodgens, 23, said. \u201cYou can feel a little less pressured by the stereotype of \u2018the Hamptons.\u2019\u201dThe impact goes beyond the bar scene. For the past two years, residents have battled over a change to the town code that would put restrictions on commercial vehicles parking in driveways. To locals, the law is another way they\u2019re being edged out of their own town, preventing plumbers and carpenters from keeping their work trucks at home.\u201cWhen they\u2019re here for a long enough time and there is money and influence, they start dictating things; they start dictating what bars open and close,\u201d said Paul Gallagher, 24, who works at an East Hampton gym. \u201cThey start dictating laws that even locals have to abide by, because they are kind of subject to the people that are bringing the money in.\u201d Yet, he added, most locals do not begrudge the summer people \u2014 most year-rounders rely on the tourist economy, after all. They simply yearn for a balance that takes their needs into account, too.Wolfie\u2019s is closing because of a disagreement over the terms of the lease, which was in court for several months, said Gino Bombace, the bar\u2019s proprietor for the past 12 years. In the end, the issue was settled with Mr. Bombace agreeing to terminate his lease this month. While he has made peace with his departure, he is concerned that what might replace the bar will be out of reach for locals like the restaurant workers who arrive en masse after their shifts end, some still wearing their aprons.\u201cThey don\u2019t want an upscale place. This is what they want,\u201d Mr. Bombace said, gesturing to the yellow walls and scuffed pool table. \u201cThey want to come here and sit down at a table and talk about, \u2018Oh, remember table 17? They were a real pain.\u2019\u201dBut even as the end neared for Wolfie\u2019s, some of the men at the bar believed they would always have a place where they were welcome. An octogenarian, Mr. Deering had drunk here alongside Pollock, he said, and hoped to imbibe again at whatever was coming next. \u201cThe only constant,\u201d he said, tipping back a drink, \u201cis change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He also says he has no heroes \u2014 not a Lincoln or Mandela, a Jackie Robinson or a Capt. Chesley Sullenberger.If you\u2019re an evangelical Christian, you\u2019re about to cast your lot with someone who goes against nearly everything you believe. I have a sister in this category. Her preacher told her that electing Trump is \u201cpart of God\u2019s plan.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if the plan is apocalyptic, but that sounds like a deity who\u2019s given up on all of us.I would tell my sister and all like-minded souls to look at whether Trump has tried to live by the Ten Commandments. He\u2019s consistently violated at least eight of them, from worshiping the God of Mammon to running up the biggest \u201cpants on fire\u201d liar score of any presidential candidate in history. As for adultery and coveting others, he\u2019s bragged about cheating on the mother of his children in one interview, and outlined his methods for hitting on married women in another.True, he hasn\u2019t committed murder, but he did say he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue, \u201cand I wouldn\u2019t lose any supporters.\u201d If that\u2019s who you want your children looking up to, those kids will be, like Trump, bereft of heroes.If you\u2019re a member of the white working class, \u201cthe poorly educated\u201d that Trump once professed to love, your sense of dislocation is real. The economic gap between the wealthiest cities and the rest of the country has widened. So has the divide between college-educated workers and those who never went beyond high school. More than 20 percent of American men under age 65 had no paid work last year.But a trade war, which Trump proposes, and his tax and immigration policies would bring widespread pain, and do nothing to help the most economically troubled of his supporters. Trump likes to remind people that he took business classes at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Well then, let\u2019s listen to a report from his alma mater: It predicts that Trump\u2019s policies could cost the United States four million lost jobs.His tax plan, a giveaway to the rich and a budget buster, would likely lead to another recession. His overall economic proposals could cost the United States economy $1 trillion over the next five years, according to a report from Oxford Economics, a forecasting firm.I should add that 15 million new jobs have been added under President Obama\u2019s watch, and that incomes grew across the board last year, especially at the bottom. Trump never mentions that, either.Vice President Joe Biden has made it one of his final missions to ensure that Democrats don\u2019t forget those living in places like his hometown, Scranton, Pa. One solution is to put people to work on roads, bridges, airports and other \u201cbig stuff.\u201d Hillary Clinton has at least put forth a $275 billion infrastructure jobs plan. Trump promises nothing more than a slogan on a silly hat and a pipe dream of a plan with no way to pay for it.Finally, if you\u2019re a true deplorable, I have nothing to say to you by way of persuasion. You should follow the endorsements of neo-Nazis, and current and former members of the Ku Klux Klan who say Trump is the embodiment of their beliefs. A vote for anyone but Trump, as the former Klansman David Duke says, is \u201ctreason\u201d to your heritage. He\u2019s talking about a lineage that goes directly back to slavery.For the rest of the Trump supporters, remember that resentment is not a political philosophy and hatred is not a sustainable force for governing. Remember, also, the words of a global citizen \u2014 Bono. \u201cAmerica is like the best idea the world ever came up with,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Art World, Globalism\u2019s New Spin", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Critic's NotebookIt feels like the right time to reassert global consciousness in the universe of art. Even some of New York\u2019s large and conservative museums have been thinking this.Supported byWhen the American economy bottomed out in the early 1990s, the contemporary-art market fell apart, and some gate-crashing occurred. Artists who were once denied entry, many of them nonwhite, came in. So did new kinds of art, much of it with roots outside Western traditions. An expansive new age of globalist art had begun, and it felt excitingly utopian. By forging links among far-flung people and cultures, art could do what politics could not: bring everyone to a communal table for share-the-wealth feasts, with museums serving as hosts.In the years since \u2014 with all the museum news about architectural expansion, technological enhancement and audience attraction \u2014 globalism as an ideal, in the 1990s sense, faded somewhat from view. The proliferation of international biennials and triennials dulled its edge. The concept had become shopworn from use as a marketing tool. And when globalism became confused with economic globalization, political questions arose: To what extent does sharing dilute difference? Who\u2019s in charge of building that communal table? Who decides the seating?Recently, globalism, as global consciousness, has come back into focus, at least for me, thanks to American politics: to the spreading plague of racially based violence, and to a presidential candidate who preaches \u2014 promises \u2014 a future of barrier-building and ethnic expulsion. It feels like the right time to reassert global consciousness in art, not just as a practical reality, but as a positive idea. And, as it turns out, even some of our large and conservative New York museums, in not always obvious ways, have been thinking this, too.If, in the early 1990s, your knowledge of art in the city was confined to what you regularly found in Manhattan\u2019s flagship institutions, you might never have known that something called global contemporary art existed. It was readily apparent if you looked elsewhere, to small, ethnically specific institutions like the Americas Society, Asia Society, El Museo del Barrio and the Studio Museum in Harlem. It was at the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the Queens Museum, institutions notably responsive to their culturally diverse communities. But the big museums were slow to respond to the era\u2019s globalist impulse. And the bigger they were, the slower they were.The Metropolitan Museum of Art, with its encyclopedic holdings, is the most intrinsically globalist of all. Yet nowhere has contemporary art been given less notice or looked less at home. Recently, this has begun to change, as the Met adjusts itself to the reality that in museums everywhere, contemporary art is an overwhelmingly popular audience draw, not to mention an area of interest to a high percentage of collector-trustees and other benefactors.But by far the most significant sign of a big push in a contemporary global direction came last spring in one of the two exhibitions chosen to inaugurate the Met\u2019s tenancy in the Breuer building, once home to the Whitney Museum of American Art and now generally assumed to be the platform on which the Met will stake a claim to contemporary relevance.Mohamedi was born into a Muslim family in Lahore, Pakistan; traveled internationally; and created a highly personal body of linear abstract work, mostly drawing. Some writers have compared it to the art of Agnes Martin or various American Minimalists; others have viewed it through the lens of Sufism and Zen Buddhism. Although Mohamedi\u2019s profile in Asia is high, she has scant recognition value in New York. And unfamiliarity, coupled with low-key, concentration-demanding work, led to the exhibition\u2019s being largely passed over by the news media and, you suspect, by the public.Visually, it was a gorgeous show, tenderly installed by its curator, Sheena Wagstaff, chairwoman of the Met\u2019s Modern and contemporary department. Historically, it was a crucial addition to the ever-expanding study of Modernism as an international phenomenon. And it may prove to be an indicator of a wide-reaching approach that the Met will take to contemporary collecting. It was, if nothing else, a daring gesture on the Met\u2019s part to put its weight behind the art of a little-known, non-Western Muslim female artist at a spotlighted moment in its history.Much is made of digital developments in the museum world, but when it comes to art and historical artifacts, as any curator will tell you, there\u2019s no substitute for being there. The thrill of discovery was palpable in both shows. (The curators were still abuzz with excitement when I spoke with them.) And \u201cTransmissions,\u201d in particular, projected a view of art as an instrument of ethical inquiry and political dedication, a perspective too rarely encountered in the market-fixated New York art world.Some good work has come into the collection through the initiative, though the whole endeavor feels somewhat arbitrary and scattershot, an exercise in instant globalism. The curators were assigned enormously broad swaths of cultural turf. If you judge their efforts by the Western market-vetted buys, they confined their searches to art fairs and biennials. The museum has announced no plans to continue the collecting once they\u2019ve departed, contributing to a hint of opportunism around the project.Maybe the museum feels that there\u2019s no need (or cash) for more than this short-term effort, particularly given the extensive buying that\u2019s been undertaken to fill the still-unbuilt Guggenheim Abu Dhabi. That franchise, part of the Saadiyat Cultural District, which also includes a branch of the Louvre, has been advertised as a virtual monument to cultural globalism, showcasing \u201cparallel bursts of creativity from around the world,\u201d in the words of Richard Armstrong, the director of the Guggenheim. But the superluxury setting has led to the project\u2019s being prejudged as an emblem of globalization rather than of global consciousness-raising.New or expanded architecture, increased digital access and social media outreach are, at bottom, about promotion. They pull audiences into a museum and can provide potent teaching tools. But global consciousness is what museums teach, or should teach: the simultaneous existence of many different cultures, and the equal value of those cultures, everywhere, through the centuries, and right now. It\u2019s a lesson that stands in exact opposition to the pall of intolerance in the air at present. In the end, art is small, pebble-size, not globe-size, and it can\u2019t do much. But if it can persuade people to gather for a meal instead of for war, that\u2019s something. And museums can play a part in that persuasion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Review of a Man Booker Prize Finalist, \u2018All That Man Is\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In the final story in \u201cAll That Man Is,\u201d an aging man sits in a cafe in Italy, listening to a 7-year-old girl sing a nursery rhyme. Long retired from an illustrious career in British government, he\u2019s recovering, slowly and uncertainly, from a heart operation. As the girl rhymes her way through the months \u2014 \u201cMay, fruits and flowers,\u201d she sings, \u201cJune, off to the sea\u201d \u2014 he ponders an inscription he\u2019s just seen in a nearby abbey: \u201cAmemus eterna et non peritura.\u201d Let us love what is eternal and not what is transient.It\u2019s a beautiful scene, and a characteristic one in a book constantly reaching for allegory. The publisher calls \u201cAll That Man Is\u201d a novel, but there\u2019s very little explicitly interlinking its separate narratives. The stories cohere instead through their single project: an investigation of European manhood. Each of the nine narratives features a different male protagonist hailing (by my count) from seven European countries. Each protagonist is on a journey: an English teenager traveling after graduation through Germany; a Belgian scholar driving to Poland; a Hungarian bodyguard accompanying a prostitute and her pimp in London.Transient things are the necessary purview of the novel as a genre \u2014 the very word \u201cnovel\u201d demands it \u2014 and Szalay\u2019s pages are full of markers of the current day: iPads, high-speed trains and GPS navigation devices. At the same time, the structure Szalay establishes for the book points to the cyclical, to the rhythmic working of time. The stories are arranged by the ages of their male protagonists, moving from 17 to 73; they also, like the little girl\u2019s song, progress through the calendar year. The first four stories concern themselves with the erotic and its complications; the fifth is preceded by an epigraph from Handel\u2019s \u201cOrlando\u201d \u2014 \u201cLascia Amor e siegui Marte,\u201d declaring a shift in allegiance from love to the god of war.Conflict, competition and mastery are at the heart of Szalay\u2019s understanding of manhood. In one of the finest stories, a Danish journalist travels to Spain to confront a vacationing government minister with evidence of an extramarital affair. He and the minister have known each other for years; they\u2019ve exchanged favors; they\u2019re nearly friends. But this veneer of amiability is stripped away in the thrill of the kill. \u201cC\u2019est la guerre,\u201d the journalist says repeatedly in defense of his muckraking. For his part, the official insists there\u2019s no legitimate public interest in his private life; the story is \u201cjust a way for people like you to have power over people like me.\u201dDriving from the airport, the journalist passes a bullfighting arena. \u201cAll the trappings of modernity,\u201d he thinks, \u201cand in the middle of it .\u2008.\u2008. slaughter as a spectator sport, as entertainment.\u201d The risk of heaviness in the symbolism, here and elsewhere, is nearly always avoided by Szalay\u2019s prose, which is frequently brilliant, remarkable for its grace and economy. He has a minimalist\u2019s gift for the quick sketch, whether of landscapes or human relationships. He studs his pages with sometimes startlingly lovely \u00adimages, as when crumpled bedsheets are compared to \u201cstiffly whipped egg white.\u201dIn age, class and nationality, Szalay\u2019s protagonists are diverse, but their homogeneity in other respects undercuts the expansiveness of his title. All of his men are white, all are straight (only in the last story is a more complicated sexuality suggested); most important, all of them enjoy a more or less easy sense of ownership over a classic and now outmoded idea of Europe. Though set in the present, there\u2019s a curious absence of reference to the contemporary crises of terrorism or the upheaval caused by mass immigration.And yet these limitations may be necessary. Szalay\u2019s subject is the loss of prestige afforded a certain kind of European manhood, the spuriousness of its foundations and the ease with which it is threatened. If manhood is an arena of struggle in the midst of civilization \u2014 something like that stadium the Danish journalist drives past \u2014 the sympathy of these stories lies firmly with the bull. The novel\u2019s characteristic mood is a kind of lambent melancholy, shot through with dark, sometimes savage humor.\u201cAll That Man Is\u201d was published in Britain in April, well before the Brexit referendum. But it has a new urgency now that the post-Cold War dream of a Europe of open borders and broad, shared identity has come under increasing question. The book\u2019s penultimate narrative features a Russian industrialist, a longtime London resident whose business empire spans the continent. From the deck of an opulent yacht, he contemplates his stratospheric rise after the fall of the U.S.S.R. and, thanks to a series of legal and financial disasters, his impending ruin. In a final touch of allegory, the yacht he can no longer afford is called Europa.Garth Greenwell is the author of \u201cWhat Belongs to You.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canada and E.U. Sign Trade Deal, Bucking Resistance to Globalization", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byCanada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had been forced to call off an earlier trip to sign the deal after Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, used its veto to withhold Belgium\u2019s approval of the deal. The pact required the support of all 28 European Union countries.Mr. Trudeau signed the pact on Sunday, joined by Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents the leaders of the member states; Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, which holds the rotating presidency of the body that runs the bloc\u2019s ministerial meetings; and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm.The deal will help to demonstrate that \u201ctrade is good for the middle class and those working hard to join it,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Brussels. Mr. Trudeau said he wanted to \u201cmake sure that everyone gets that this is a good thing for our economies but it\u2019s also a good example to the world.\u201dBut the Walloon intransigence has underlined the extent to which trade has become politically radioactive as citizens increasingly blame globalization for growing disparities in wealth and living standards. Across Europe and the United States, opposition to trade has become a rallying point for populist movements on the left and the right, threatening to upend the established political order.A compromise among the regions of Belgium, which persuaded Wallonia to drop its veto, called for language to clarify the handling of trade complaints brought by Canadian or European companies.Belgium pledged to refer the arbitration system to the Court of Justice of the European Union, where judges can assess its legality.That much larger deal, known as T.T.I.P., has already stalled amid opposition from large numbers of Europeans, including many Germans and Austrians. The protesters see the Canadian deal as a warm-up for a much larger battle.The spectacle of tiny Wallonia, with just 3.6 million people, holding up a deal that affects more than 500 million Europeans and 35 million Canadians and prompting European Union leaders to delay a summit meeting has rattled Western leaders.\u201cNow that we see the Canadian deal has made it over the finish line, the Atlantic trade deal still has a fighting chance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be easy. T.T.I.P. could similarly threaten traditional farming interests and arouse knee-jerk European suspicions about common trans-Atlantic health and environmental standards.\u201dAs a legal matter, the member states\u2019 legislatures still need to ratify the Canadian agreement. That could mean more hiccups before it goes into effect.Mr. Tusk, of the European Council, said he was cautiously optimistic that the deal would survive the ratification process and could send a positive message about globalization.\u201cToday\u2019s decisions demonstrate that the disintegration of the Western community does not need to become a lasting trend,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cFree trade and globalization have protected hundreds of millions of people from poverty and hunger. The problem is that few people believe this.\u201dEurope, Mr. Lee-Makiyama said, is pivoting to a position as \u201cneither an ally of East nor West.\u201dOnce ratified, the Canadian deal would cut many tariffs on industrial goods and on farm and food items, according to the European Commission. The deal also would open up the services sector in areas like cargo shipping, maritime services and finance to European firms, the commission said.The Canadian deal is also regarded by trade advocates as a template for advanced, industrial economies by making it easier for their regulators to recognize one another\u2019s rules, and by updating the rules on how companies can make sure governments protect their investments.If the Obama administration has its way, the next major regional trade accord to make it over the finish line will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes the United States, Canada, Japan and Vietnam.The Pacific deal \u2014 largely because it involves a number of emerging economies \u2014 is a more traditional trade accord aimed mainly at cutting tariffs and knocking down impediments to trade.But like the Europeans, many Americans do not want to make concessions that would lower wages or threaten jobs at home. The Asia-Pacific deal has become a hot issue in the United States presidential election; both major-party nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, oppose it.Mr. Funk Kirkegaard, the senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, said he gave the Pacific deal about a 30 percent chance of being concluded while President Obama is still in office. \u201cBeyond January,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s all dependent on the results of the election and who\u2019s the next president.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Doughnut Sales Are Probably Safe", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byThe coming election will give the United States new lawmakers and a new president. But what does it mean for fast food, leisure cruises and bulldozers?As the nation\u2019s bitter, bizarre campaign season builds to its November conclusion, companies across a range of industries are using the election as a data point \u2014 sometimes as an excuse \u2014 to explain what\u2019s happening in their business.Executives at Jack in the Box said uncertainty over the election could be affecting consumers\u2019 willingness to buy Jumbo Jacks and cheeseburgers. Commercial real estate brokers said the election was causing businesses to hold off on new office leases. Auto dealers said the results could determine how many people buy cars.From banking to oil to pharmaceutical companies, to real estate agents and even cruise ship operators, everyone seems to think wariness ahead of the election is affecting their business. Sometimes for the better, mostly for the worse.Economists aren\u2019t so sure.\u201cIt\u2019s essentially untrackable and unknowable,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.That is not to say that government policy doesn\u2019t matter over the longer run \u2014 Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are offering starkly contrasting prescriptions for improving the economy \u2014 just that worries about the outcome are probably not a big factor affecting coffee and doughnut sales these days.In late October, Nigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin\u2019 Brands, cited several reasons that quarterly revenues at the company that runs the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts chain fell short of analyst expectations, including \u201cchanges in gas prices, changes in food stamp regulations, and, of course, the overwhelming dampening effect of the presidential election.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ll all be pleased when that\u2019s passed,\u201d he said.Various research papers suggest that elections and policy decisions can weigh heavily on businesses\u2019 thinking. But for the most part, it seems limited to large-scale investment decisions that take years to show up in the data, and even then are hard to tease out from all the other things going on.\u201cWe have disappointingly weak economic growth, a labor market that in some sense is strong but is still leaving people behind,\u201d said Ed Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast in Los Angeles. \u201cPeople attribute what they see to one of several things that are displayed as being different: \u2018It\u2019s global warming. It\u2019s uncertainty about the election.\u2019 But I believe in evidence.\u201dWhat they add up to is harder to say. Office brokers in New England said leasing was flat, possibly because businesses were waiting until after the election. But real estate brokers in the region cited \u201clow interest rates and the impending presidential election as motivation for potential homeowners to buy now.\u201dThe Fed report also said auto dealers in Houston, who have been hit hard by cuts in the oil industry, were pessimistic about the future and had \u201cconcerns about how the presidential election will impact consumer spending.\u201dFor all the data economists have about how much consumers and businesses are spending, there is still an endless debate about why they are behaving the way they do. That is easier to gauge during boom times or a recession. It is harder during more normal times like these, when the economy is merely chugging along, with conflicting signs of optimism and pessimism almost anywhere you look.And for all the differences between Republicans and Democrats, Washington\u2019s effect on the vast American economy is far more muted than in many other countries, largely because the basic tenets of democratic capitalism are widely shared and the range of policy choices are constrained by popular opinion and the vast array of interest groups.\u201cIf I were to tell you that the people running for president were Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and someone else, you might say it\u2019s reasonable to start saving more,\u201d said Tarek Alexander Hassan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cOnce you start having to worry about the political system, it\u2019s pretty much the only thing you have to worry about.\u201dThey found that the more executives talked about risks associated with politics, the more likely they were to cut back on hiring and investment and to ramp up their spending on lobbying.That does not automatically mean politics is to blame. Some of those executives might be deflecting from company\u2019s poor performance, using government policy as an excuse for cuts they were likely to make anyway. Some might be angling for a political handout.Others might genuinely be worried about policy, regulation and taxes, but mostly because they are in an industry whose fortunes are more tied to federal spending.And given that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump plan to make changes to the nation\u2019s health care system \u2014 Mr. Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 it is no wonder that John Lechleiter, chief executive of Eli Lilly, said he and other health care executives were expecting changes of some sort.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear, whether you say you want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, something needs to be done if we\u2019re going to render a health insurance availability for everybody in this country sustainable on an ongoing basis,\u201d he said during an earnings call last week.But once you add up all these crosscurrents, how much does it matter to the $17 trillion American economy? Mr. Hassan is researching that now. His hunch is that it matters somewhat, but not too much.\u201cIn the last 20 years we\u2019ve learned a lot about why some countries are rich and some countries are poor, and a huge determinant is the political system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a different concept in developed economies, it\u2019s just a matter of degree.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s big things like blast furnaces and buildings \u2014 things that have a really long life and aren\u2019t easy to reverse,\u201d he said. \u201cGo ahead and buy the doughnut.\u201dDoris Burke contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

What You Can Do.", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The drought is not going away.While the situation has improved since last year, meteorologists say we are a long way from replenishing our groundwater supplies and reservoirs. And the drought shows no sign of ending.What does this all mean for Californians?\u2022 What should individual Californians be doing right now to help relieve the drought?Two things: replace inefficient appliances in our homes, businesses and farms, and change our water-using behaviors. The first option results in permanent improvements in water-use efficiency. The second offers temporary savings. For example, letting your lawn go brown is a temporary savings, but replacing your water-hogging lawn with a beautiful garden of drought-tolerant plants is a permanent improvement.\u2022 Is this a typical cyclical drought?No. Its length and severity are, in many ways, unprecedented, but perhaps the most significant new factor is the growing influence of human-caused climate change in the form of rising temperatures and changing storm patterns. The fingerprints of climate change are evident now and are forcing water managers to rethink old assumptions about how to tackle California\u2019s water problems.\u2022 What\u2019s the worst that can happen if things don\u2019t turn around?We already face a real risk that a wide range of fish species will go extinct. A continuing drought will lead to a reduction in the acreage we can reliably irrigate. And we may see rising numbers of people, especially in disadvantaged communities in the Central Valley, without access to safe and affordable water.\u2022 What\u2019s the most important step the state can take to mitigate the drought?Three critical steps: Improve water conservation and efficiency; expand the use of nontraditional sources of water, especially storm water and treatment and reuse of wastewater, and communicate to the public about the need to play a role in improving our water use.\u2022 How long can I take shower for without feeling guilty?Ha. A 10-minute shower with an old five-gallons-per-minute shower head uses 50 gallons. A 10-minute shower with a modern two-gallons-per-minute shower head uses 20. So the first step toward a guilt-free shower is replace your old shower head.

{"Headline": "Ignoring the Debt Problem", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsTogether, the two of us have 179 years of life experience and 13 grandchildren. We have served presidents of both parties. We have seen more campaign seasons than we care to count \u2014 but none as strange as this one.Insults, invective and pandering have been poor substitutes for serious debate about the direction in which this country is going \u2014 or should be going. And a sound and sustainable fiscal structure is a key ingredient of any viable economic policy.Yes, this country can handle the nearly $600 billion federal deficit estimated for 2016. But the deficit has grown sharply this year, and will keep the national debt at about 75 percent of the gross domestic product, a ratio not seen since 1950, after the budget ballooned during World War II.Long-term, that continued growth, driven by our tax and spending policies, will create the most significant fiscal challenge facing our country. The widely respected Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by midcentury our debt will rise to 140 percent of G.D.P., far above that in any previous era, even in times of war.Unfortunately, despite a brief discussion during the final presidential debate, neither candidate has put forward a convincing plan to restrain the growth of the national debt in the decades to come.Throughout the campaign, Donald J. Trump has called for a combination of deep tax cuts that appear to far exceed proposed spending reductions, at the clear risk of substantially increasing the ratio of debt to G.D.P. Hillary Clinton has set out more balanced and detailed proposals, but they would still fail to stabilize and reduce our debt burden.Whoever wins, the new president will eventually face fiscal realities that force him or her to develop strategies for decreasing the national debt as a share of the economy over the long term.Our current debt may be manageable at a time of unprecedentedly low interest rates. But if we let our debt grow, and interest rates normalize, the interest burden alone would choke our budget and squeeze out other essential spending. There would be no room for the infrastructure programs and the defense rebuilding that today have wide support.It\u2019s not just federal spending that would be squeezed. The projected rise in federal deficits would compete for funds in our capital markets and far outrun the private sector\u2019s capacity to save, to finance industry and home purchases, and to invest abroad.Instead, we\u2019d be dependent on foreign investors\u2019 acquiring most of our debt \u2014 making the government dependent on the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d who may not be so kind as the I.O.U.s mount up.We can\u2019t let that happen \u2014 not if we want an America that is able to provide growth and stability at home while maintaining global leadership. We would risk returning with a vengeance to stagflation \u2014 the ugly combination of inflation and economic stagnation that we tasted in the 1970s.The solutions are clear enough. A realistic approach toward the major entitlement programs is required, given that they are projected to account for all of the growth of future noninterest spending.We should make gradual adjustments to the Social Security system that still maintain present benefit levels for those at or near retirement, with particular attention to those most in need. Our health care systems can be made more efficient, with better approaches toward cost control. Since health care represents 70 percent of the growth of our major entitlement programs over the next 30 years, bending the cost curve is essential to the long-term well-being of our economy.It\u2019s no secret that our federal tax system is broken \u2014 unfair, inefficient and prone to political manipulation. It\u2019s filled with exclusions, deductions, exemptions and preferential rates \u2014 so-called tax expenditures \u2014 that are ripe for reform. Those policies cost about $1.5 trillion each year and disproportionately benefit the well off. Tax reform could provide better incentives for economic growth, while raising more revenue, even as the code is simplified.But we face an immutable fact. Fair and responsible reforms will take years to implement. And businesses and individuals will need time to adjust.Delaying action now will make the needed changes only more painful and difficult later on, while also increasing the risk of financial crisis before the reforms are even made. That is why the real debate should begin immediately.Yet at the final presidential debate, both candidates missed the opportunity to clearly lay out their visions for a fiscally responsible, long-term future for our country. There\u2019s still time to solve this problem. But our next president needs to show leadership in the first months.At our age, neither of us will personally suffer from a failure to act. It is those with long lives ahead \u2014 grandchildren and great-grandchildren \u2014 who deserve the benefit of prospering in a nation with sound finances.Take some advice from two observers who have been around for a while: The long term gets here before you know it.Paul A. Volcker is chairman of the Volcker Alliance and a former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Peter G. Peterson is founder and chairman of the Peter G.

The next year the 4,260-square-foot concrete-and-wood residence was a finalist in the Georgie Awards from the Canadian Home Builders\u2019 Association of British Columbia. It has geothermal heating, exposed fir beams, Gaulhofer sliding windows and Brazilian cherry wood floors.The open kitchen has Brazilian cherry wood cabinetry, stainless-steel appliances and a window backsplash. Blue eyes granite tops the counters and center island. A breakfast area shares a double-sided gas fireplace with the living room, which opens to a private courtyard. A black basalt stone fireplace punctuates a wall of windows in the formal dining room.A glass-walled walkway connects the entertaining spaces to the master suite, an office with an en-suite bath and fireplace, and a private glass-covered deck leading to a hot tub and garden. In the limestone-and-marble-lined master bath, a Mayan shellstone countertop has two vessel sinks. The steam shower has a bench; the tub is separate.Off the foyer, a powder room with tumbled marble floor tiles has a polished black fossil limestone countertop. Each of the two guest wing bedrooms has floor-to-ceiling windows and opens to the yard. En-suite baths have polished Mayan shellstone counters and showers with Mexican ceramic tiles.On the lower level is a media/game room with a wet bar, a bedroom and a hall bath with a tub/shower enclosure and a workshop. A temperature-controlled wine cellar has racks for 658 bottles.A two-car attached garage opens to a mudroom and laundry room.Used as a deck, a flat, green roof (with grass and vegetation) sits atop the garage. The guest wing is adjacent to the garage, through the laundry room and mudroom. The roof deck is accessible by stone steps from a ground-level sitting area. Roofs on the rest of the house are metal.This house, on a slightly more than half-acre lot, is in the mountainside Taluswood development with easy ski access to Whistler slopes. It is a five-minute drive to parking on the perimeter of the pedestrian-only village\u2019s boutiques, restaurants, spas and hotels, and equally close to Creekside village. The 75-mile drive north from Vancouver International Airport to Whistler takes about two and a half hours along the Sea to Sky Highway.MARKET OVERVIEWThe Whistler real estate market was touched by the 2008 global financial downturn, but the anticipation of the 2010 Winter Olympics temporarily lessened the effect.\u201cWe weren\u2019t hit as hard as other resort areas,\u201d Ms. Thornhill said.After the Olympics, a swell of listings caused a 25 percent price drop, according to Craig Mackenzie, an agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty Canada.But since the last ski season, fueled by a strong economy in Vancouver, demand has outstripped supply and prices rose sharply. There is a \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d for homes under a million Canadian dollars, Ms. Thornhill said, helped by a favorable exchange rate and low interest rates.Whistler is experiencing \u201ca seller\u2019s market,\u201d said Patrick Kelly, the president of the Whistler Real Estate Company. With about 250 listings, well below historical levels of 600 to 700, properties move \u201cpretty rapidly,\u201d he said.Sixty to 70 percent of demand is for townhouses or condominiums; about half for properties that can be rented nightly, according to Mr. Kelly.\u201cWe are seeing bidding wars,\u201d Mr. Mackenzie said, adding that about 5 percent of properties are selling over the asking price.The \u201cbest value\u201d is in the luxury market for homes 3 million Canadian dollars and up, where sales are \u201ca little slower,\u201d Ms. Thornhill said.The priciest listing, at 16.5 million Canadian dollars (about $12.35 million) is a 12,000-square-foot house on a lot two-thirds of an acre close to the village, Mr. Mackenzie said. One-bedroom condos start around 400,000 Canadian dollars (around $299,500).Though Whistler has \u201cvery severe restrictions\u201d on growth and development, many 1970s kit-built A-frame and Gothic arch houses, 800 to 1,200 square feet, are being knocked down and replaced with conventional homes up to 3,500 square feet, Mr. Mackenzie said.The Athletes\u2019 Village from the 2010 Winter Olympics now provides housing for locals.WHO BUYS IN WHISTLERVancouver residents who want a weekend home near the ski slopes or by Whistler\u2019s five lakes make up the bulk of buyers, agents say, followed by purchasers from the United States, largely Seattle and California.International buyers, which make up 20 percent of the market, also come from Hong Kong, China, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and Britain.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers, but Ian Davis, a lawyer with Race and Company based in Whistler, said it is \u201cnot quite so simple\u201d for foreign owners to sell. Foreign owners have to go through a federal \u201ctax clearance process\u201d during which up to 50 percent of sales proceeds can be held up to four months.It is generally \u201ca little more difficult\u201d for foreign buyers than local residents to get financing. Foreigners can receive up to about 65 percent of the purchase price compared with 80 percent for Canadians, Mr. Davis said.Property transfer taxes start at 1 percent of the first 200,000 Canadian dollars, 2 percent of the next 1.8 million, and 3 percent over 2 million.A goods and services tax equal to 5 percent of the value of the property is levied on new construction and triggered on resales used as vacation rentals by the current owner. Buyers who don\u2019t want to rent out their property, should instruct the real estate agent \u201cto look for properties that haven\u2019t rented before\u201d and are exempt from the goods and services tax, Mr. Davis said.TAXES AND FEESAnnual taxes on this property were 15,188 Canadian dollars ($11,374) for 2016, according to Ms. Thornhill.Legal fees are charged on a sliding scale, with a base fee of 1,100 Canadian dollars; closer to 1,500 if a mortgage is involved, Mr. Davis said. Title insurance, registration and search charges add another 500. Tax on legal fees is 12 percent.Real estate agent commissions, usually paid by the seller, vary from 6.5 to 7.5 percent of the first 100,000 Canadian dollars, with 2.5 to 3.5 percent charged on the balance.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, French; dollar (1 Canadian dollar = $0.75)CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Not Everyone\u2019s So Sure Low Oil Prices Will Stay Put", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byAs the bear market in oil approaches its two-year anniversary, a consensus is growing that stagnant growth worldwide and aggressive pumping by giant producers like Saudi Arabia will keep a lid on oil prices for some time.It\u2019s an easy assessment to make. Large emerging economies like those of China, Brazil, India and Russia, which represent about a quarter of global demand for oil, are no longer booming, and it has become accepted wisdom that Saudi Arabia wants to keep prices low to wipe out higher-cost shale producers in the United States.Nevertheless, a few experts have gone out on a limb, arguing that the market has become complacent in its outlook, just as it was when the price stayed above or close to $100 from 2011 to 2014.\u201cI think we will be in the 60s next spring and mid-70s by 2018, \u201d said Dwight Anderson, the founder of Ospraie Management, an energy-focused hedge fund. \u201cPrices will be higher for longer, and I know that puts me in the extreme. But what people are missing is that big markets like Mexico, China, Nigeria and Venezuela are in structural decline.\u201dAnd in 2014, with the price comfortably above $100, Zach Schreiber, then a fairly anonymous hedge fund investor, warned at an investment conference of a supply glut that would send prices tumbling, which is exactly what happened several months later.In the realm of commodities investing, few have experienced these vicissitudes more acutely than Mr. Anderson, who began his investing career in 1994 with hedge fund nurturer Julian H. Robertson Jr.By 2007, Mr. Anderson had $9 billion under management and, with investment banks clamoring for stakes in fast-growing hedge funds, Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse as shareholders.The financial crisis hit him hard, though. As the price of oil plunged more sharply than he had expected, he was forced to close his main fund because of steep losses.Now, with a smaller yet more manageable $550 million stash, Mr. Anderson is looking to make his mark again.The root of his thesis is that the recent drop in price from over $100 to the low 20s was unusually sudden and sharp, compared with price moves in the past. As a result, global oil giants that had planned large and expensive new projects when prices were high, will be very reluctant to renew these efforts in the years ahead.\u201cThe human mind-set will be: \u2018Wow, we just saw $26 \u2014 we are never going to overspend again,\u2019\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThere is a lot of scar tissue to overcome. And I think that capital expenditure decisions will be impaired for years to come.\u201dAlso, he says, a number of large oil producers will, for various reasons, be experiencing production declines of as much as 10 percent in the coming years. He cites Libya and Iraq, where political instability and cash shortages have taken their toll. The same could be said for Nigeria and Venezuela.Even in Iran, where experts have said that oil production will increase once the country becomes more integrated into the global economy, Mr. Anderson doubts that there will be a meaningful supply surge, given the lack of new foreign investment there.\u201cIran has been underinvested for years,\u201d he said.Mr. Anderson says, however, that the five million barrels that shale oil companies produce is not enough to have a material effect on a global market that produces 96 million barrels a day.Of those, 39 million barrels come from countries like Saudi Arabia that belong to the oil cartel OPEC and 56 million hail from countries like the United States and Russia.Economists who share Mr. Anderson\u2019s view about oil prices say they believe that Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to keep pumping hard in a weak market is aimed less at the shale producers than at companies like Chevron and BP.\u201cSaudi Arabia is trying to maximize its economic return by keeping prices low so that the high-cost companies like Chevron cut their supply,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cIn that way the market gets rebalanced so that they can get maximum market share.\u201dAt about $9 a barrel, Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s lowest-cost producer of oil, compared with $23 for shale producers and even higher for the ambitious excavations that the oil majors had been planning.Of course, such a strategy has its risks for the Saudis. With prices so low, their oil revenues have fallen strikingly, and its budget deficit has widened to 15 percent of total economic output.The Saudi government has also seen its cash reserves decline to $623 billion from $732 billion, and for the first time the country has been forced to borrow from international bond markets.In fact, to that very point, Mr. Schreiber, the hedge fund investor who predicted the recent oil price collapse, said this year that his next big bet was that the Saudi Arabian economy would collapse. Its young population, so accustomed to government handouts over the last decades, will resist new austerity measures and threaten the tenuous social compact that the kingdom has put in place since oil was discovered there in the 1930s, he said at the conference.\u201cIf you are long, I feel sorry for you,\u201d Mr. Schreiber said at an investor conference in New York last spring. \u201cSaudi Arabia has two or three years of runway before it hits a wall.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Airbnb Faces a New York Showdown", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byBitsAirbnb is a marquee company of the so-called sharing economy, but that doesn\u2019t mean it wants to share its own stuff.Sharing-economy companies employ technology that enables individuals to transform personal assets into profit-making entities. Uber and Lyft enable cars to become taxis. Airbnb turns apartments into hotel rooms.What they don\u2019t typically do is enter the thicket of licensing and regulatory issues that entangle traditional taxi and hotel businesses. In many cases, complying with some rules, like telling who used what asset for how long, would be much easier for the sharing companies, since they have a digital trail of every participant\u2019s actions in their networks.It was not a move Airbnb made easily. On Tuesday, the New York State governor, Andrew Cuomo, received a bill that would fine people who rent out their apartments on a short-term basis. The fines start at $1,000 and run as high as $7,500 for a third offense. Mr. Cuomo has until Oct. 29 to veto it or let it become law.Proponents of the bill said Airbnb\u2019s offer of a registry was intended to stop the bill\u2019s enactment. Airbnb also called on people listing on the service to call or tweet their protests to the governor. In a call with reporters, an Airbnb spokesman portrayed his company, valued at $30 billion, as a champion of the little guy against big government.There is something to that, after a fashion. In New York, or for that matter in any of the more than 34,000 cities in 191 countries where it has listings, Airbnb could easily provide regulators with a list of the most heavily rented locations, the people or entities listing the most apartments, and the individuals making the most money.If it were to do that, however, it would also put itself in a position to identify everyone committing \u2014 in a place like New York \u2014 a legal violation.Just as likely, it would expose Airbnb\u2019s biggest revenue generators, and possibly give its competitors lots of valuable data.How does this get fixed? Probably through some kind of compromise, where government accepts that sharing companies are here to stay, and sharing companies accept the responsibility of being a durable part of the economy.An earlier version of this article misstated who might be identified as committing a legal violation by Airbnb\u2019s proposal. While its list might identify people making modest revenue from a vacant room, they would not be commiting a violation of state law. Renting out whole apartments for less than 30 days is contrary to New York law, not renting out rooms.Advertisement"}

DiNapoli, the state comptroller, said the industry \u2014 one of the city\u2019s and state\u2019s biggest economic drivers \u2014 appears poised to benefit from a recent trend in large mergers and positive economic news, like the American economy\u2019s third-quarter growth of 2.9 percent reported on Friday. Wall Street reaps revenue from advising on deals as well as trading for clients, and robust deal activity and an expanding economy would bolster those businesses.\u201cOf course, no one has a crystal ball, and we know volatility is the name of the game. At this point, we just don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that causes concern,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said on a conference call Friday. \u201cI guess we see some overall signs as far as the economy that are positive. We expect Wall Street will benefit from that.\u201dBut Wall Street is not as dominant a factor in the everyday economy of New York City as it used to be. The securities industry cut 8 percent of its jobs from 2007 to 2015, while other private sector jobs grew 17 percent. From 2010 to last year, Wall Street accounted for 11 percent of wage growth, far less than the 39 percent attributed to it from 1990 to 2007.Technology, advertising, media and information and business services have picked up the slack, the report said.And New York City had 19 percent of the securities industry jobs nationwide last year, down from 32 percent in 1990. Texas and Pennsylvania have picked up the most securities industry jobs from 2010 to 2015, the comptroller\u2019s report notes.Still, the average salary of a New York securities industry employee dwarfs that of other local private sector workers even though salaries have been declining, falling another 4 percent last year, to $388,000. That compares with the average salary of $74,100 for other private sector workers.Bonuses are a big guessing game because factors can shift quickly as companies close their books on the year. Last year\u2019s bonuses were down for the second consecutive year, falling 9 percent to an average of $146,000.Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm, projected in August that incentive pay for investment bankers could fall 5 percent to 25 percent this year, while for traders, it could drop 5 percent to 15 percent.The finance industry is a crucial component of the state\u2019s and city\u2019s annual tax revenue, with profits on the line for luxury retailers, restaurants and real estate, among other industries that feel the ripple effects from Wall Street\u2019s waxing and waning fortunes. The securities industry accounted for 18.5 percent of the state\u2019s tax collections last year and 7 percent of the city\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet the Couple Who Helped Shape America\u2019s Nuclear War Policy", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The theories of Cold War defense intellectuals now seem the stuff of a surreal madness that seized Washington during the last half of the 20th century. The core doctrine of nuclear deterrence was Mutual Assured Destruction, aptly known as MAD. It postulated that the best way to prevent a nuclear war with the Kremlin was to build an enormous atomic arsenal that would annihilate the Soviet Union if it dared attack the United States. Effective, yes, but a White House or Kremlin miscalculation would have left millions dead, nations destroyed and the planet reeling.Albert Wohlstetter, an analyst at the RAND Corporation, was one of the most formidable of the nuclear policy savants. A combative champion of defense spending, he argued that the balance of terror inherent in MAD was unstable. Instead of assuming the MAD standoff would assure a durable cold peace, he feared a Pearl Harbor-like Soviet attack outside the imagined scenarios of defense planners, and he pressed for a nuclear war-winning policy. His ideas coursed through American defense strategy for decades, swaying presidents, attracting acolytes, infuriating opponents and igniting furious debates that ricochet through official circles to this day.Ron Robin\u2019s provocative, sometimes recondite examination of Albert Wohlstetter and his wife and fellow strategist, Roberta, is certain to fuel the debate. Robin confesses at the outset that he is horrified by the Wohlstetters\u2019 nuclear brinkmanship, but says he has made a diligent effort to provide a balanced, nonjudgmental account of their work. In reality, \u201cThe Cold World They Made\u201d is a withering indictment of the Wohlstetters and their influence on defense policy.Robin, president of the University of Haifa in Israel, recalls many of the thinkers and baroque theories of the nuclear age. Some attracted national attention at midcentury, including Henry Kissinger, whose 1957 book, \u201cNuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy,\u201d became an unexpected best seller, and Herman Kahn, whose chilling ruminations on winning and surviving a nuclear conflict made him an oracle of the unthinkable. Bernard Brodie, the intellectual father of nuclear deterrence theory, played a pivotal role in shaping Cold War nuclear policy.Robin reports that the Wohlstetters dabbled with leftist groups while college students in New York, then later flipped, becoming hard-line Cold Warriors. He devotes nearly equal time to Roberta\u2019s work (including her groundbreaking study of Pearl Harbor), freeing her from Albert\u2019s imposing shadow. But Robin\u2019s overall treatment of both Wohlstetters is unforgiving. While his discussion of their thinking is often informative, his scorn for them and their legacy grows by the page. By the epilogue, even a reader skeptical of Wohlstetter theories can\u2019t help feeling some sympathy for Albert and Roberta.The last part of the book is an extended broadside against three men who helped forge the expansive ideology behind George W. Bush\u2019s foreign policy and misguided 2003 invasion of Iraq: Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Zalmay Khalilzad. Wolfowitz was a primary architect of the invasion as Bush\u2019s deputy secretary of defense. Perle was an adviser to the Pentagon, and Khalilzad became the American ambassador first to Afghanistan and then Iraq. The three unquestionably owed an intellectual debt to the Wohlstetters, especially Albert. Still, holding Albert Wohlstetter indirectly accountable for the Iraq invasion is a reach. He died in 1997. (Roberta died a decade later.)What\u2019s more, Robin too easily dismisses Albert Wohlstetter\u2019s view that heavy American defense spending and new weapons technologies could force the Kremlin into crippling military investments. Although Ronald Reagan\u2019s defense buildup was not primarily responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union, it squeezed the Soviet leadership. Just days before meeting with Reagan in 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, said that if a new round of the arms race developed, \u201cthe pressure on our economy will be unbelievable.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a review on Oct. 23 about a book by Ron Robin on the nuclear defense strategists Roberta and Albert Wohlstetter misstated part of the title. It is \u201cThe Cold World They Made,\u201d not \u201cThe Cold War They Made.\u201d The error was repeated in the table of contents in the same issue.Philip Taubman, a former New York Times Moscow and Washington bureau chief, is an adjunct professor at Stanford\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Ensure the Iran Nuclear Deal Survives the Next President", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 With every presidential debate this year, Americans are reminded that the Iran nuclear deal remains as controversial as ever. Iranians, too, are watching the election, dreading the potential consequences for the deal \u2014 and for their country\u2019s future.With only three months before the Obama administration leaves office, the United States and Iran need to work fast to strengthen the deal\u2019s foundations and ensure that the improvement in relations that took place over the course of President Obama\u2019s tenure survives.Iran is also preparing for presidential elections, scheduled for May. The contenders haven\u2019t yet announced their candidacies, but President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, is likely to face tough conservative challengers, some of whom opposed negotiations with the Americans and believe he agreed to too many concessions. His opponents say that the deal affords Iran no tangible benefits because, although sanctions have been lifted, the economy has hardly recovered.Against this backdrop, the nuclear agreement will enter the second year of implementation in early 2017.But thanks to open channels of communication between Washington and Tehran, nothing yet has derailed the nuclear deal.To protect them, the United States and Iran should institutionalize their relationship. The State Department and Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry should have conversations not just at the highest levels, but across their diplomatic corps. By starting now to move interactions with Iran from top-level political appointees to others within the State Department, the United States can create the building blocks for the next administration.Iran and the United States should also work to tackle long-term challenges. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew met with Valiollah Seif, the head of Iran\u2019s Central Bank, in April, but there is still no formal mechanism for their agencies to talk. Creating one could help ease Iran\u2019s concerns about sanctions relief.These steps will allow the two countries to identify, clarify and address contentious issues before they turn into crises. Many of these challenges stem from domestic politics, so the two sides must be able to explain their own domestic pressures to each other. This will allow the two capitals to better understand and explain these challenges at home.This, in turn, will allow Washington and Tehran to strengthen the foundations of the nuclear deal and ensure its longevity. Without formalizing these relationships and ensuring that they can survive changes in government, the deal won\u2019t produce the optimal effect each side seeks: allowing Iran\u2019s economy to recover while ensuring Tehran doesn\u2019t acquire a nuclear weapon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ikea Strategy Ditches the Dream Home for the Daily Grind", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingTHE settings for the vignettes are workaday and unassuming: a living room where a man surrounded by file boxes and paperwork nods off on the sofa, a compact bedroom where two brothers\u2019 very different personalities are on display, an apartment where a father tiptoes from a crib in the single bedroom to a loft bed in the living room.For furniture ads, Ikea\u2019s new offerings say remarkably little about furniture. Instead, they say much more about the way the American dream has evolved to fit a postrecession economic reality.The company\u2019s new \u201cWe Help You Make It\u201d campaign eschews the aspirational gloss of master suites and two-story foyers in favor of embracing Americans \u2014 and their furniture needs \u2014 where they are today.Ikea\u2019s website promises, \u201cNo matter who you are, what you do, or how much you make, you can still make the dream yours.\u201d It\u2019s an inclusive message that, in this fraught political climate, could be a campaign slogan just as easily as a pitch for floor lamps and futons.\u201cSociety itself is quite ripe for this message because it is something people are thinking about,\u201d said Christine Whitehawk, Ikea\u2019s external communications manager for the United States, adding that the examples shown in the ads reflect the way many Americans live today.\u201cThat\u2019s the reality for many people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt resonates with people when you do speak to their life situation.\u201dLeslie Stone, director of strategic services at Ogilvy & Mather, Ikea\u2019s agency partner, said the goal was to show \u201creal people in real living situations that anyone could relate to.\u201d\u201cThe scene with the family who have given the bedroom over to the baby and the mom and dad are sleeping in the living room \u2014 people loved that we were being so empathetic,\u201d she said.Aside from the TV ads, which will be broadcast on local channels and cable outlets like HGTV and the Food Network, the \u201cWe Help You Make It\u201d campaign includes print ads in magazines like Architectural Digest, People en Espa\u00f1ol and Real Simple. Ikea is also sponsoring the first Home & Design special issue of InStyle magazine.Ikea, which is based in Sweden, is using its website, online ads and social media channels to promote the campaign as well. \u201cFacebook and Instagram are two of the platforms that work really well for us,\u201d Ms. Whitehawk said.Ikea plans to use Twitter to share data from research it commissioned from the Economist Intelligence Unit to find out about Americans\u2019 aspirations and concerns in terms of the economy, education and financial benchmarks like homeownership.\u201cWe started finding information that was suggesting to us that, postrecession, people\u2019s opinions on what it means to make it had changed,\u201d Ms. Whitehawk said, referring to a \u201cnew normal\u201d in which possessions take a back seat to experiences.The ads reflect this, said Kevin Lane Keller, a professor of marketing at the Dartmouth College Tuck School of Business.\u201cThis is the reality. They\u2019re not trying to romanticize any of this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of taking this more democratic view, this more down-to-earth view, talking about where people are,\u201d rather than possibly alienating potential customers by depicting an affluent lifestyle that many people feel is unattainable.\u201cThe idea really isn\u2019t selling you a dream of what your life should look like, but the dream you\u2019re living,\u201d Ms. Stone of Ogilvy & Mather said. \u201cPrice and accessibility kind of go hand in hand. We looked at this as a story of democratizing the American dream, and the fact that Ikea is so affordable was something we had never put into context.\u201dPart of that means emphasizing a panoply of ages, ethnicities and family living situations: A middle-aged woman makes a face when she opens up a compost bin in her kitchen; a bride flings herself onto a sectional sofa and digs into a carton of ice cream; a mixed-race same-sex couple cuddle up on the couch to watch TV.\u201cI think the diversity thing is clearly an angle they\u2019re bringing out,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cThat\u2019s modern life. People have lots of different things they care about, but basically everybody needs chairs and sofas.\u201dMiguel Sahagun, assistant professor of marketing at High Point University, said highlighting diversity and family bonding over consumerism was an especially smart way for Ikea to target younger people. \u201cThe messages they\u2019re using, they perfectly align with the way millennials, and some Generation X people, think about furniture and goods,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the experience.\u201dBecause of this, advertisements that play down the actual products can be surprisingly effective, he said.\u201cThat\u2019s the appropriate way to go if you\u2019re targeting that generation,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t focus on the technical aspects of the product.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Notes on Brexit and the Pound", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Originally, stories about a pound plunge were tied to that recession prediction: domestic investment demand would collapse, leading to sustained very low interest rates, hence capital flight. But the demand collapse doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be happening. So what is the story?Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an informal version: imagine a good or service subject to large economies of scale in production, sufficient that if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumed in two countries, you want to produce it in only one, and export to the other, even if there are costs of shipping it. Where will this production be located? Other things equal, you would choose the larger market, so as to minimize total shipping costs. Other things may not, of course, be equal, but this market-size effect will always be a factor, depending on how high those shipping costs are.In one of the models I laid out in that old paper, the way this worked out was not that all production left the smaller economy, but rather that the smaller economy paid lower wages and therefore made up in competitiveness what it lacked in market access. In effect, it used a weaker currency to make up for its smaller market.In Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d suggest that we think of financial services as the industry in question. Such services are subject to both internal and external economies of scale, which tends to concentrate them in a handful of huge financial centers around the world, one of which is, of course, the City of London. But now we face the prospect of seriously increased transaction costs between Britain and the rest of Europe, which creates an incentive to move those services away from the smaller economy (Britain) and into the larger (Europe). Britain therefore needs a weaker currency to offset this adverse impact.Does this make Britain poorer? Yes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just the efficiency effect of barriers to trade, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a terms-of-trade effect as the real exchange rate depreciates.Is there a policy moral here? Basically it is that a weaker pound shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be viewed as an additional cost from Brexit, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just part of the adjustment. And it would be a big mistake to prop up the pound: old notions of an equilibrium exchange rate no longer apply.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Third Debate", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byWALLACE: Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I\u2019m Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.WALLACE: This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.WALLACE: No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Let\u2019s get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court.You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.WALLACE: Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? And secondly, what\u2019s your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the founders\u2019 words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first. You have two minutes.CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have?And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women\u2019s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country\u2019s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.That\u2019s how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That\u2019s the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. Where do you want to see the court take the country? And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?TRUMP: Well, first of all, it\u2019s great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. Our country is so, so \u2014 it\u2019s just so imperative that we have the right justices.Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don\u2019t think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it\u2019s absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint \u2014 and I\u2019ve named 20 of them \u2014 the justices that I\u2019m going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they\u2019re people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that\u2019s very, very important.I don\u2019t think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It\u2019s all about the Constitution of \u2014 of \u2014 and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.WALLACE: We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, \u201cThe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.\u201d And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What\u2019s wrong with that?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country.But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t mean that I want people who shouldn\u2019t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There\u2019s other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn\u2019t accept that reasonable regulation, but they\u2019ve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people\u2019s lives and defending the Second Amendment.WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton\u2019s answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms? TRUMP: Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly \u2014 and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.WALLACE: Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?CLINTON: Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.But there\u2019s no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there\u2019s an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.And, you know, look, I understand that Donald\u2019s been strongly supported by the NRA. The gun lobby\u2019s on his side. They\u2019re running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we\u2019re going to protect and defend the Second Amendment. But we\u2019re going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?TRUMP: Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am \u2014 I don\u2019t know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I\u2019m very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA. And it\u2019s the earliest endorsement they\u2019ve ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I\u2019m very honored by all of that.We are going to appoint justices \u2014 this is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.WALLACE: Well, let\u2019s pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that\u2019s the issue of abortion.TRUMP: Right.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes \u2014 in fact, states \u2014 a woman\u2019s right to abortion?TRUMP: Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.WALLACE: But I\u2019m asking you specifically. Would you like to...TRUMP: If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.WALLACE: But what I\u2019m asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn \u2014 you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?TRUMP: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that\u2019s really what\u2019s going to be \u2014 that will happen. And that\u2019ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it\u2019s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what\u2019s happening right now in America.So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.Donald has said he\u2019s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women\u2019s rights to make their own health care decisions.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton... CLINTON: And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.WALLACE: I\u2019m going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why?CLINTON: Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.TRUMP: Well, I think it\u2019s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.Now, you can say that that\u2019s OK and Hillary can say that that\u2019s OK. But it\u2019s not OK with me, because based on what she\u2019s saying, and based on where she\u2019s going, and where she\u2019s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that\u2019s not acceptable.CLINTON: Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.You know, I\u2019ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I\u2019ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.WALLACE: All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...TRUMP: And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that.WALLACE: All right. Let\u2019s move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you\u2019re going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders.In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of \u2014 I mean, these are unbelievable people that I\u2019ve gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They\u2019re coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border.Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border \u2014 as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what\u2019s going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders.I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have \u2014 it\u2019s with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama. All of the problems \u2014 the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It\u2019s just pouring and destroying their youth. It\u2019s poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We are \u2014 right now, we\u2019re getting the drugs, they\u2019re getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute \u2014 we cannot give amnesty.Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones \u2014 we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We\u2019re going to get them out; we\u2019re going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we\u2019ll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we\u2019re going to get them out.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?CLINTON: Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.And you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t want to rip families apart. I don\u2019t want to be sending parents away from children. I don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here\u2019s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\u2019s an idea that would rip our country apart.I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they\u2019re most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\u2019t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\u2019re not paying for that wall.So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.WALLACE: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I want to follow up...TRUMP: Chris, I think it\u2019s...WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It\u2019s a disaster.Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn\u2019t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.WALLACE: Well, let me \u2014 wait, wait, sir, let me...TRUMP: We are a country of laws. We either have \u2014 and by the way...WALLACE: Now, wait. I\u2019d like to hear from...TRUMP: Well \u2014 well, but she said one thing.WALLACE: I\u2019d like to hear \u2014 I\u2019d like to hear from Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: I voted for border security, and there are...TRUMP: And the wall.CLINTON: There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can\u2019t exploit them and undercut Americans\u2019 wages.And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: \u201cYou complain, I\u2019ll get you deported.\u201dI want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.WALLACE: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They\u2019ve been deported. She doesn\u2019t want to say that, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happened, and that\u2019s what happened big league.As far as moving these people out and moving \u2014 we either have a country or we don\u2019t. We\u2019re a country of laws. We either have a border or we don\u2019t.Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it\u2019s very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They\u2019re on line. They\u2019re waiting. We\u2019re going to speed up the process, big league, because it\u2019s very inefficient. But they\u2019re on line and they\u2019re waiting to become citizens.Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.WALLACE: I want to...TRUMP: But what she doesn\u2019t say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to...CLINTON: We will not have open borders. That is...WALLACE: Well, let me \u2014 Secretary...CLINTON: That is a rank mischaracterization.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: We will have secure borders, but we\u2019ll also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, excuse me. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: ... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we\u2019ve learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote. \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.\u201d So that\u2019s the question...TRUMP: Thank you.WALLACE: That\u2019s the question. Please quiet, everybody. Is that your dream, open borders? CLINTON: Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what\u2019s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.CLINTON: So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past? Those are the questions we need answered. We\u2019ve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.WALLACE: Well?TRUMP: That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?WALLACE: Hold on \u2014 hold on, wait. Hold on, folks. Because we \u2014 this is going to end up getting out of control. Let\u2019s try to keep it quiet so \u2014 for the candidates and for the American people.TRUMP: So just to finish on the borders...WALLACE: Yes?TRUMP: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from.And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won\u2019t even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.Now we can talk about Putin. I don\u2019t know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I\u2019ll tell you what: We\u2019re in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads \u2014 1,800, by the way \u2014 where they expanded and we didn\u2019t, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she\u2019s playing chicken. Look, Putin...WALLACE: Wait, but...TRUMP: ... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.CLINTON: Well, that\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet as president of the United States.TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.CLINTON: And it\u2019s pretty clear...TRUMP: You\u2019re the puppet!CLINTON: It\u2019s pretty clear you won\u2019t admit...TRUMP: No, you\u2019re the puppet.CLINTON: ... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We\u2019ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17 \u2014 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: And I think it\u2019s time you take a stand...TRUMP: She has no idea whether it\u2019s Russia, China, or anybody else.CLINTON: I am not quoting myself.TRUMP: She has no idea.CLINTON: I am quoting 17...TRUMP: Hillary, you have no idea.CLINTON: ... 17 intelligence \u2014 do you doubt 17 military and civilian...TRUMP: And our country has no idea.CLINTON: ... agencies.TRUMP: Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.CLINTON: Well, he\u2019d rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: She doesn\u2019t like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: He\u2019s outsmarted her every step of the way.WALLACE: I do get to ask some questions.TRUMP: Yes, that\u2019s fine.WALLACE: And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don\u2019t know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?TRUMP: By Russia or anybody else.WALLACE: You condemn their interference?TRUMP: Of course I condemn. Of course I \u2014 I don\u2019t know Putin. I have no idea.WALLACE: I\u2019m not asking \u2014 I\u2019m asking do you condemn?TRUMP: I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn\u2019t be so bad.Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it\u2019s Syria, you name it. Missiles. Take a look at the \u201cstart up\u201d that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can\u2019t believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads, and we can\u2019t. The Russians can\u2019t believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin.And all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They\u2019ve taken over. We\u2019ve spent $6 trillion. They\u2019ve taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen in any government whatsoever.WALLACE: We\u2019re a long way away from immigration, but I\u2019m going to let you finish this topic. You got about 45 seconds.TRUMP: And she always will be.CLINTON: I \u2014 I find it ironic that he\u2019s raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He\u2019s...Reporters for The New York Times fact-checked the statements made by Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump during Wednesday\u2019s presidential debate.TRUMP: Wrong. CLINTON: ... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don\u2019t we use them, which I think is terrifying.But here\u2019s the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There\u2019s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that\u2019s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.TRUMP: I have 200 generals...WALLACE: Very quickly.TRUMP: ... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the \u2014 we\u2019re defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century.All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places. We cannot continue to afford \u2014 she took that as saying nuclear weapons.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: Look, she\u2019s been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie.CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m just quoting you when you were asked...TRUMP: There\u2019s no quote. You\u2019re not going to find a quote from me.CLINTON: ... about a potential nuclear \u2014 nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks. That kind...TRUMP: And defend yourselves.CLINTON: ... of language \u2014 well...TRUMP: And defend yourselves. I didn\u2019t say nuclear. And defend yourself.CLINTON: The United States has kept the peace \u2014 the United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to be able to keep the peace.WALLACE: We\u2019re going to \u2014 no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.TRUMP: Yes.WALLACE: We\u2019re going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent\u2019s plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.I want us to do more to help small business. That\u2019s where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not \u2014 who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\u2019s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.And we\u2019re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\u2019re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.WALLACE: Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton\u2019s?TRUMP: Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I\u2019m a big proponent. We\u2019re going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public\u2019s going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan.TRUMP: But I\u2019d like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I\u2019m \u2014 not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren\u2019t they paying?She immediately \u2014 when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren\u2019t the NATO questioned \u2014 why aren\u2019t they paying? Because they weren\u2019t paying.Since I did this \u2014 this was a year ago \u2014 all of a sudden, they\u2019re paying. And I\u2019ve been given a lot \u2014 a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they\u2019re starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We\u2019re protecting people, they have to pay up. And I\u2019m a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up.She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it\u2019s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama\u2019s regime, we\u2019ve doubled our national debt. We\u2019re up to $20 trillion.So my plan \u2014 we\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to have a lot of free trade. We\u2019re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back.I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can\u2019t make a great deal \u2014 then we\u2019re going to terminate NAFTA and we\u2019re going to create new deals. We\u2019re going to have trade, but we\u2019re going \u2014 we\u2019re going to terminate it, we\u2019re going to make a great trade deal.And if we can\u2019t, we\u2019re going to do it \u2014 we\u2019re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We\u2019re going to cut business taxes massively. They\u2019re going to start hiring people. We\u2019re going to bring the $2.5 trillion... WALLACE: Time, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: ... that\u2019s offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...WALLACE: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: ... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.CLINTON: Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...TRUMP: You can\u2019t.CLINTON: ... the fact is, he\u2019s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we\u2019ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I\u2019m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That\u2019s the kind of approach that will work.WALLACE: Secretary...CLINTON: Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we\u2019ve tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.TRUMP: Correct.WALLACE: Thank you, sir.You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn\u2019t get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus. So is your plan basically more \u2014 even more of the Obama stimulus?CLINTON: Well, it\u2019s a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I\u2019ve never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession.So now we\u2019ve dug ourselves out of it, we\u2019re standing, but we\u2019re not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work.That\u2019s why what I have put forward doesn\u2019t add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We\u2019re beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We\u2019ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that\u2019s what I believe I will be able to do.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don\u2019t add up, that your idea, and you\u2019ve talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...TRUMP: Over a 10-year period.WALLACE: ... growth is unrealistic. And they say \u2014 you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that\u2019s unrealistic, as well. Your response, sir?TRUMP: So I just left some high representatives of India. They\u2019re growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number.We are growing \u2014 our last report came out \u2014 and it\u2019s right around the 1 percent level. And I think it\u2019s going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad.Look, our country is stagnant. We\u2019ve lost our jobs. We\u2019ve lost our businesses. We\u2019re not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.I\u2019ve visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I\u2019ve gotten to know so many \u2014 I\u2019ve developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what\u2019s happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what\u2019s happened to these people in these communities.Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn\u2019t really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that\u2019s ever been signed by our country.Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn\u2019t call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored.WALLACE: I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...TRUMP: And that will be as bad as NAFTA. WALLACE: ... which is Obamacare. But go ahead, briefly.CLINTON: Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn\u2019t meet my test. I\u2019ve had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I\u2019m against it now. I\u2019ll be against it after the election. I\u2019ll be against it when I\u2019m president.There\u2019s only one of us on this stage who\u2019s actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that\u2019s Donald. He\u2019s shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.But he mentioned China. And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I\u2019ve stood up against it as secretary of state.Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.WALLACE: Mr. Trump?CLINTON: That\u2019s the kind of approach that is just not going to work.TRUMP: Well, let me just say \u2014 let me just say.CLINTON: We\u2019re going to pull the country together. We\u2019re going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we\u2019re going to enforce those agreements, and we\u2019re going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton? Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Let me ask a simple question. She\u2019s been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn\u2019t you do it over the last 15, 20 years?Here\u2019s how we analyzed in real time the last presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.CLINTON: No, I voted.TRUMP: You were very much involved \u2014 excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it\u2019s bad experience, because what you\u2019ve done has turned out badly.For 30 years, you\u2019ve been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I \u2014 make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn\u2019t mind.The problem is, you talk, but you don\u2019t get anything done, Hillary. You don\u2019t. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen. They don\u2019t know. It\u2019s gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me.CLINTON: Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it\u2019s been debunked numerous times.CLINTON: But I think it\u2019s really an important issue. He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women\u2019s rights are human rights. He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.TRUMP: Give me a break.CLINTON: And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d So I\u2019m happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I\u2019ve done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I\u2019ll let the American people make that decision.TRUMP: Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It\u2019s a $1 million loan. But I built a phenomenal company.And if we could run our country the way I\u2019ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it.And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria. Take a look at the migration. Take a look at Libya. Take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when \u2014 we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. And now I listen how she\u2019s going to get rid of ISIS. She\u2019s going to get rid of nobody.WALLACE: All right. We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States. Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you\u2019d never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up \u2014 you deny this \u2014 why would they all make up these stories?Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse. Mr. Trump, you go first.TRUMP: Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people \u2014 I don\u2019t know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She\u2019s the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people \u2014 they paid them $1,500, and they\u2019re on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.I would say the only way \u2014 because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn\u2019t even apologize to my wife, who\u2019s sitting right here, because I didn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t know any of these \u2014 I didn\u2019t see these women.These women \u2014 the woman on the plane, the \u2014 I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it\u2019s her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they\u2019re telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.And I\u2019ll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn\u2019t, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally \u2014 it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction.CLINTON: Well...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that\u2019s exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.TRUMP: I did not say that. I did not say that.CLINTON: In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes \u2014 sir, her two minutes. Her two minutes.TRUMP: I did not say that.WALLACE: It\u2019s her two minutes.CLINTON: He went on to say, \u201cLook at her. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d About another woman, he said, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be my first choice.\u201d He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her \u201cdisgusting,\u201d as he has called a number of women during this campaign.Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That\u2019s who Donald is.I think it\u2019s really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don\u2019t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.America is great, because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody.(LAUGHTER)Nobody has more respect...WALLACE: Please, everybody.TRUMP: And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn\u2019t fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.What happened to the FBI, I don\u2019t know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. She\u2019s lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He\u2019s going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general. And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States? That\u2019s really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it\u2019s not just about women. He never apologizes or says he\u2019s sorry for anything.So we know what he has said and what he\u2019s done to women. But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion. He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers \u201cpeople who aren\u2019t captured.\u201d He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn\u2019t be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.So it\u2019s not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is.And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what\u2019s at stake in this election. It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.TRUMP: So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. It\u2019s on tape.WALLACE: During the last...TRUMP: The other things are false, but honestly, I\u2019d love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I\u2019d love to talk about other things...WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: ... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.WALLACE: In this bucket about fitness to be president, there\u2019s been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I\u2019d like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have.Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you. Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee? And why isn\u2019t what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn\u2019t it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?CLINTON: Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country\u2019s interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that\u2019s been proven.But I am happy, in fact I\u2019m thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does. You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate \u2014 I know I don\u2019t have the time to do that.But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that\u2019s about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment. In partnership with the American Health Association...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: ... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is \u2014 this is an open discussion.CLINTON: Well, it is an open discussion. And you...WALLACE: And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?CLINTON: Well, but there is no \u2014 but there is no evidence \u2014 but there is...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I think that it\u2019s been very well...WALLACE: Let\u2019s ask Mr. Trump.CLINTON: There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...TRUMP: It\u2019s been very well studied.CLINTON: ... and the high rankings...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Please let me Mr. Trump speak.TRUMP: ... and it\u2019s a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.WALLACE: Please let Mr. Trump speak.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: It\u2019s a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women\u2019s rights? So these are people that push gays off business \u2014 off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.So I\u2019d like to ask you right now, why don\u2019t you give back the money that you\u2019ve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don\u2019t you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture.Because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what\u2019s happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent \u2014 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. I\u2019m very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I\u2019d be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we\u2019re going to keep working to help Haiti...WALLACE: All right.CLINTON: ... because it\u2019s an important part of the American experience.TRUMP: They don\u2019t want you to help them anymore.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I\u2019d like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent \u2014 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don\u2019t get anything. I don\u2019t buy boats. I don\u2019t buy planes. What happens \u2014 the money goes to them.WALLACE: Wasn\u2019t some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?TRUMP: No, it was \u2014 we put up the American flag. And that\u2019s it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.WALLACE: Right. But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...TRUMP: There was. There was. And, by the way...WALLACE: ... instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.TRUMP: ... the money \u2014 the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses \u2014 the money that you\u2019re talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.WALLACE: I want to get into one...CLINTON: But, of course, there\u2019s no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn\u2019t released his tax returns. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can\u2019t prove it. You can look at our tax returns. We\u2019ve got them all out there.But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris. You know, half of all immigrants \u2014 undocumented immigrants in our country \u2014 actually pay federal income tax. So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire. I find that just astonishing.WALLACE: I want...TRUMP: So let me just tell you very quickly, we\u2019re entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors \u2014 just about all of them \u2014 I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...WALLACE: We...TRUMP: Let me just explain.WALLACE: But, no, we heard this...TRUMP: Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, we \u2014 OK.TRUMP: You know what she should have done?WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...TRUMP: And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...TRUMP: ... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.CLINTON: Well, you know...TRUMP: You should have changed the law. But you won\u2019t change the law, because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...CLINTON: Made with Chinese steel.TRUMP: But I will tell you, I sat there...(LAUGHTER)... I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you\u2019re going to protect them. And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.WALLACE: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: If you don\u2019t like what I did, you should have changed the laws.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you \u2014 his words \u2014 \u201cwill absolutely accept the result of this election.\u201d Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing. I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely \u2014 sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?TRUMP: I will look at it at the time. I\u2019m not looking at anything now. I\u2019ll look at it at the time.What I\u2019ve seen \u2014 what I\u2019ve seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don\u2019t even care. It\u2019s so dishonest. And they\u2019ve poisoned the mind of the voters.But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they\u2019re going to see through it. We\u2019ll find out on November 8th. But I think they\u2019re going to see through it.WALLACE: But, sir, there\u2019s...TRUMP: If you look \u2014 excuse me, Chris \u2014 if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote \u2014 millions, this isn\u2019t coming from me \u2014 this is coming from Pew Report and other places \u2014 millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn\u2019t be registered to vote.So let me just give you one other thing. So I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people \u2014 tell you one other thing. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. It\u2019s crooked \u2014 she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run.And just in that respect, I say it\u2019s rigged, because she should never...WALLACE: But...TRUMP: Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.WALLACE: But, sir, there is a tradition in this country \u2014 in fact, one of the prides of this country \u2014 is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you\u2019re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you\u2019re not prepared now to commit to that principle?TRUMP: What I\u2019m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I\u2019ll keep you in suspense. OK?CLINTON: Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that\u2019s horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus. He lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn\u2019t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.TRUMP: Should have gotten it.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: This is \u2014 this is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s also really troubling.WALLACE: OK.CLINTON: So that is not the way our democracy works. We\u2019ve been around for 240 years. We\u2019ve had free and fair elections. We\u2019ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. You know, President Obama said the other day when you\u2019re whining before the game is even finished...(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Hold on. Hold on, folks. Hold on, folks.CLINTON: ... it just shows you\u2019re not up to doing the job. And let\u2019s \u2014 you know, let\u2019s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating \u2014 he\u2019s talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.TRUMP: I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it\u2019s disgraceful. I think it\u2019s a disgrace.WALLACE: All right.TRUMP: I think we\u2019ve never had a situation so bad in this country.(APPLAUSE)WALLACE: Hold on, folks. This doesn\u2019t do any good for anyone. Let\u2019s please continue the debate, and let\u2019s move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after? And that\u2019s something that whichever of you ends up \u2014 whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn\u2019t come back or isn\u2019t replaced by something even worse? Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.CLINTON: Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground. But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is in our interest, and I don\u2019t think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.The goal here is to take back Mosul. It\u2019s going to be a hard fight. I\u2019ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real \u2014 a really successful military operation. But we know we\u2019ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That\u2019s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don\u2019t let terrorists buy weapons. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun.And I\u2019m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will \u2014 would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?TRUMP: Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we\u2019re fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they\u2019re going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we\u2019re going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about \u2014 how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They\u2019ve all left.The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we\u2019re now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we\u2019re going in to get it.But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she\u2019s running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That\u2019s why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they\u2019re going in.But who\u2019s going to get Mosul, really? We\u2019ll take Mosul eventually. But the way \u2014 if you look at what\u2019s happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought.But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they\u2019re smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid \u2014 the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that\u2019s going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they\u2019ve wanted to do forever, but we\u2019ve made it so easy for them.So we\u2019re now going to take Mosul. And do you know who\u2019s going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they\u2019re making \u2014 I mean, they are outsmarting \u2014 look, you\u2019re not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.WALLACE: Sir, your two minutes are up.TRUMP: The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.CLINTON: Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn\u2019t support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I\u2019ve said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... a very clear fact that...TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: ... before the invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it. Google \u201cDonald Trump Iraq.\u201d And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.TRUMP: Wrong.CLINTON: And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.But what\u2019s really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and \u2014 just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership.But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. They\u2019ve been digging underground. They\u2019ve been prepared to defend. It\u2019s going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.This is what we have to do. I\u2019m just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that\u2019s how Donald thinks. You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.TRUMP: Chris, we don\u2019t gain anything.CLINTON: He has all the conspiracy theories...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, it\u2019s...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq. We don\u2019t gain anything.CLINTON: This conspiracy theory, which he\u2019s been spewing out for quite some time.TRUMP: If they did it by surprise...(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it\u2019s an open discussion.CLINTON: He says...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: We could have gained if they did it by surprise.WALLACE: Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak.CLINTON: ... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.TRUMP: No, you are the one that\u2019s unfit. You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out \u2014 John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. He said some beauties. And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do.And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we\u2019re going in, and all of the people that we really wanted \u2014 the leaders \u2014 they\u2019re all gone. If you think that was good, then you do. Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both.CLINTON: Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he\u2019s supporting for president. And he has said...TRUMP: Which is a big mistake.CLINTON: ... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he\u2019s right.WALLACE: Let\u2019s turn to Aleppo. Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo. And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there \u2014 in fact, there are... TRUMP: It\u2019s a catastrophe. I mean...WALLACE: It\u2019s a catastrophe, but there...TRUMP: ... it\u2019s a mess.WALLACE: There are a quarter of...TRUMP: Have you seen it? Have you seen it?WALLACE: Sir...TRUMP: Have you seen what\u2019s happening to Aleppo?WALLACE: Sir, if I may finish my question...TRUMP: OK, so it hasn\u2019t fallen. Take a look at it.WALLACE: Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.TRUMP: That\u2019s right. And they are being slaughtered...WALLACE: Yes.TRUMP: ... because of bad decisions.WALLACE: If I may just finish here, and you also said that \u2014 that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who\u2019ve been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?TRUMP: Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It\u2019s a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the \u2014 from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what\u2019s happened.And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what\u2019s happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she\u2019s going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He \u2014 he aligned with Russia.He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.Now they have \u2014 he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don\u2019t want ISIS, but they have other things, because we\u2019re backing \u2014 we\u2019re backing rebels. We don\u2019t know who the rebels are. We\u2019re giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don\u2019t know who the rebels are. And when and if \u2014 and it\u2019s not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with \u2014 as bad as Assad is, and he\u2019s a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.If she did nothing, we\u2019d be in much better shape. And this is what\u2019s caused the great migration, where she\u2019s taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases \u2014 not probably, who are definitely...WALLACE: Let me...TRUMP: ... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see \u2014 this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, you have talked about \u2014 and in the last debate and again today \u2014 that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it\u2019s going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you\u2019re going to get into a war \u2014 his words \u2014 with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone \u2014 first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?CLINTON: Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I\u2019m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.We\u2019ve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He\u2019s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let\u2019s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we\u2019ve got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.WALLACE: Folks, I want to get into our final segment.TRUMP: But I just have to...WALLACE: Real quick.TRUMP: It\u2019s so ridiculous what she \u2014 she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they\u2019re in 32 countries.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: We should have \u2014 wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don\u2019t want the cease-fire anymore.We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn\u2019t there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way \u2014 and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.WALLACE: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton \u2014 no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent. That\u2019s the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first.TRUMP: Well, I say they\u2019re wrong, because I\u2019m going to create tremendous jobs. And we\u2019re bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we\u2019re bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don\u2019t have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we\u2019re taking back jobs. We\u2019re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don\u2019t make our product anymore. It\u2019s very sad. But I\u2019m going to create a \u2014 the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We\u2019ve given it up. We\u2019ve become very, very sloppy.We\u2019ve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don\u2019t use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don\u2019t use those people. Those are the people \u2014 these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gave \u2014 they made a campaign contribution and they\u2019re dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people.But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they\u2019ll make a lot of money. And we\u2019ll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, \u201cYou know, before you and President Obama were there,\u201d I think it\u2019s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, \u201cYou know, I alone can fix it,\u201d as he said on the convention stage.But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I\u2019m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it\u2019s one of the issues we\u2019ve got to come to grips with.So when I talk about how we\u2019re going to pay for education, how we\u2019re going to invest in infrastructure, how we\u2019re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I\u2019ve made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We\u2019ll have what economists call middle-out growth. We\u2019ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That\u2019s where growth will come from. That\u2019s why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family.And I think that\u2019s the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. And we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...TRUMP: Yeah, yeah, we\u2019ve heard \u2014 we\u2019ve heard this before, Hillary.CLINTON: I started off with \u2014 my dad was a small-business man.TRUMP: We\u2019ve heard this before.CLINTON: And I think it \u2014 you know, it\u2019s a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.WALLACE: Time.TRUMP: Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond?WALLACE: Well, no, sir, because we\u2019re running out of time...TRUMP: Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I\u2019ve been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.WALLACE: OK.TRUMP: And frankly, now we\u2019re going to do it right.WALLACE: All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal \u2014 a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare\u2019s going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is \u2014 and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?TRUMP: I\u2019m cutting taxes. We\u2019re going to grow the economy. It\u2019s going to grow at a record rate of growth.WALLACE: That\u2019s not going to help in the entitlements.TRUMP: No, it\u2019s going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It\u2019s destroying our country. It\u2019s destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year \u201917, it is a disaster. If we don\u2019t repeal and replace \u2014 now, it\u2019s probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. It\u2019s \u2014 the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year they\u2019re going to go up over 100 percent.And I\u2019m really glad that the premiums have started \u2014 at least the people see what\u2019s happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can\u2019t get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.WALLACE: And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain \u2014 will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?CLINTON: Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That\u2019s part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald\u2019s, assuming he can\u2019t figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...TRUMP: Such a nasty woman.CLINTON: ... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.And I\u2019ll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after...TRUMP: Your husband disagrees with you.CLINTON: ... the long-term health care drivers. We\u2019ve got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.WALLACE: This is \u2014 this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you\u2019re going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven\u2019t prepared closing statements.So I\u2019d like you each to take \u2014 and we\u2019re going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary Clinton, it\u2019s your turn to go first.CLINTON: Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I\u2019m reaching out to all Americans \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, and independents \u2014 because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.You know, I\u2019ve been privileged to see the presidency up close. And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life\u2019s work.That\u2019s what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.Mr. Trump?TRUMP: She\u2019s raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn\u2019t work that way.But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It\u2019s called \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d We\u2019re going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don\u2019t take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. That can\u2019t happen.Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.All she\u2019s done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we\u2019ll see you in four years. We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you get when you get her.WALLACE: Thank you both.(APPLAUSE)Secretary Clinton \u2014 hold on just a moment, folks. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.That brings to an end this year\u2019s debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you.While millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. Thank you, and good night.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was Alan Greenspan Motivated by Politics More Than Economics?", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In 1959, at the annual meeting of the American Statistical Association, a 33-year-old economist named Alan Greenspan argued that central banks should beware of letting financial markets get too comfortable. The Federal Reserve\u2019s success in smoothing economic fluctuations in the 1920s, he said, had led to the dangerous belief that \u201cthe business cycle is dead.\u201d The crash and depression that followed were \u201cinevitable\u201d consequences of that cavalier attitude toward risk.Sound familiar? As Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, that same Alan Greenspan presided over what was called \u201cthe Great Moderation,\u201d a period when business-cycle downturns were muted and investors became convinced that the Fed had their backs. Greenspan hadn\u2019t forgotten his earlier worries: A few months before he stepped down, he cautioned that \u201chistory has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low-risk premiums.\u201d Sure enough, it didn\u2019t.The risk that financial excess would lead to trouble was a central theme in Greenspan\u2019s economic work, as Sebastian Mallaby reminds readers again and again in his excellent biography \u201cThe Man Who Knew.\u201d So why did this Man Who Knew fail to act upon his knowledge?Well, for one thing, there\u2019s the question of what exactly he should have done. Mallaby, whose previous book was a sympathetic (and engrossing) history of hedge funds, doesn\u2019t buy the argument that the deregulation of financial markets that began in the 1970s and accelerated in the 1990s was all a mistake \u2014 or that Greenspan could have stopped it if he wanted to. You may disagree.What Mallaby cannot forgive was Greenspan\u2019s tendency in his later years at the Federal Reserve to bend over backward to avoid upsetting financial markets. In 1994, Greenspan\u2019s Fed brought on a bond-market crash to stop a feared resurgence of inflation. But in late 1998 and early 1999, and again in 2004 and 2005, Greenspan steered the Fed away from actions that might have tamped down financial exuberance.Why? The answer at the time was that there was little threat of inflation, and the Fed\u2019s main job is keeping consumer prices stable. But Greenspan understood how asset bubbles could harm the economy. A more convincing answer is that while Greenspan was (and is) a more capable economist than he gets credit for these days, he was an even better politician. And committing the institution he ran to a battle that it might not win and that he wasn\u2019t absolutely certain needed fighting was not the kind of thing a smart politician did.This view of Greenspan as a political animal is central to Mallaby\u2019s account. It is also, along with the often amusing depictions of Greenspan\u2019s personal life, what makes it so much fun to read. In his autobiography, published in 2007, Greenspan depicted his rise to power as a series of lucky coincidences. Mallaby describes in detail how Greenspan climbed to the top, and it\u2019s a much more interesting story.It is not heroic like the biographies of 19th-century business titans that Greenspan read when he was young. It is instead an archetypical second-half-of-the-20th-century tale of a young man of modest means rising to lofty status in business and in government by dint of intelligence, diligence, quirky charm and a Machiavellian streak. Greenspan comes across in these pages (and in person; I\u2019ve met him twice) as a decent, thoughtful, likable guy. Just not as an innocent, and also not as a hero.You may be familiar with two landmarks of Greenspan\u2019s early years: He was a professional jazz musician and a disciple of the extreme-libertarian novelist/philosopher Ayn Rand. Greenspan\u2019s stint as a clarinet and saxophone player in a second-tier swing band started when he was 18; his Rand infatuation began in his late 20s.In between, he had excelled as an economics student at New York University, taken a job at the business group now known as the Conference Board and on the side started studying for a Ph.D. in economics at Columbia University with the famous empiricist Arthur Burns. Then the veteran economic consultant William Townsend, impressed by Greenspan\u2019s Conference Board writings, asked the 26-year-old to become his partner. Greenspan agreed, dropping his graduate studies, and the firm of Townsend-Greenspan remained his professional home until he went to the Fed 34 years later. After Townsend\u2019s death in 1958 it was his firm, and it provided a uniquely congenial platform. There was no corporate ladder to climb, no tenure committee to answer to, just clients \u2014 an ever-growing roster of investment firms and corporations \u2014 to impress with his reams of data and his insights into the truths they revealed.It was Greenspan\u2019s libertarianism that propelled him into politics, but his other attributes that made him successful at it. At Rand\u2019s urging, he delivered a series of lectures in 1963 and 1964 on the \u201cEconomics of a Free Society,\u201d inveighing against, among other things, \u201cone of the historic disasters in American history, the creation of the Federal Reserve System.\u201d A few years later, a Rand fan who had attended one of the lectures brought Greenspan into Richard Nixon\u2019s orbit. He signed on as a policy adviser to Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign, and learned quickly \u2014 when he drafted a position paper condemning farm subsidies \u2014 that a libertarian purist wouldn\u2019t get far in a presidential campaign. So he adapted, and found other ways to make himself useful, such as putting the IBM 1130 computer at Townsend-Greenspan to work collating and evaluating poll results, Nate\u202fSilver-style.Greenspan did not join the Nixon administration \u2014 he wasn\u2019t going to be more than a deputy something or other, and that had little appeal. But he did stay involved, serving on the famous presidential commission that recommended the end of the military draft and a less-famous one that called vainly for deregulation of interest rates. He also played a role in the notorious effort to get Arthur Burns, whom Nixon had appointed as Federal Reserve chairman, to stop raising interest rates and bad-mouthing the economy in the run-up to the 1972 election.Nixon\u2019s aides had been planting negative (and false) stories in the news media to pressure Burns, to no effect. So they asked the Fed chairman\u2019s former student to talk some sense into him. Greenspan insisted to Mallaby that he refused, but Mallaby offers ample evidence that Nixon and Co. believed that Greenspan had not only talked to Burns but had also done a bang-up job of it. In any case, Burns soon started saying positive things about Nixon\u2019s economic policies, the Fed stopped raising rates and the Great Inflation of the 1970s was unleashed.This is probably the biggest scoop in the book (Mallaby gives a research assistant, Jon Hill, most of the credit for it), but there are many other juicy stories about Greenspan\u2019s subsequent rise from chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Ford administration to informal minister without portfolio in the early Reagan years to boss of the Fed. These stories generally don\u2019t make Greenspan look bad, just politically astute to a fault.With the election of Bill Clinton, who proved endearingly willing to let Greenspan do his thing, the need for such maneuvering waned. By the time George W. Bush took office, Greenspan\u2019s reputation was such that he was pretty much untouchable. He had gained for himself and the Fed a remarkable amount of freedom. He just chose not to use it.Justin Fox is a columnist for Bloomberg View and the author of \u201cThe Myth of the Rational Market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Poland", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate17 Photos8,000,000 ZLOTYS ($2,088,773)The house, which encompasses around 7,500 square feet, was completed in 2005 and updated in 2015; it sits on a 0.62-acre lot. Past the front doors, the entry hall, which connects the living, cooking and eating areas, has a grand travertine staircase. There is a half-bath near the entrance. The living and dining rooms share a large rectangular space to the right of the entryway.Many of the furnishings were brought from France, where the sellers traveled and appreciated the architecture, and the home is being sold furnished, said Dorota Nowakowska, an agent with Poland Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which has the listing.To the left of the entrance are the kitchen, a two-car garage, a TV room and a full bathroom with a shower and a Turkish sauna. There is a second staircase near the garage.The ground floor has three fireplaces. One is in the entryway; another is the focal point of the living room; the third is in the kitchen, which is outfitted with white walls and dark teak countertops.Upstairs, just past the central staircase, is a sitting area that leads to the master bedroom. The master suite has two closets, a sloping ceiling with gabled windows and a bright bathroom with a claw-foot tub, a shower and white cabinets. A hallway leads to the other three bedrooms, of which two have en-suite baths. One bedroom is ideal for guests because it has a sitting room and can be reached by a door near the garage and the second staircase, Ms. Nowakowska said.Within a 15-minute drive are stables, a shopping center and restaurants. The forest, around 150 square miles, has trails and is popular for running and cycling. The property is about a 30-minute drive to the international airport and about a 25-minute drive to Warsaw\u2019s center.MARKET OVERVIEWPoland\u2019s housing market is still developing; prices are lower than in other European countries for comparable properties and the inventory is smaller, people working in the real estate market there said. As the Polish economy performs well, a wealthier population has been increasing demand for luxury homes in Warsaw and in other cities and resort areas.Prices for luxury properties have been stable since around 2013, said Arkadiusz Wojciechowski, a managing director of Poland Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. However, the volume of transactions has risen, as a handful of prestigious high-rise developments expanded the inventory at the market\u2019s high end.The luxury market for new construction is still small \u2014 there are around 90 to 100 new properties on the market in Warsaw with an asking price of more than $1 million \u2014 so sales in individual buildings can have an effect on price trends, Mr. Kirejczyk said.Mr. Wojciechowski estimated that new apartments cost an average of $4,000 to $5,000 per square meter, or $372 to $465 a square foot. Luxury apartments and single-family homes start at around $1 million, but $500,000 can purchase an apartment in a renovated building with a concierge and a doorman, Mr. Wojciechowski said. Luxury properties typically sell for slightly below asking price, but in exceptional situations there are steep discounts \u2014 as much as 50 percent, he said.In the luxury market, 90 percent of purchases are financed with cash, he added.Daniel Kopania, a Warsaw-based partner with the international law firm Clifford Chance and the head of its Polish real estate department, said that compared with many other countries in the European Union, Poland\u2019s housing prices are \u201cstill attractive.\u201d The residential property tax is relatively low in Poland, he added.WHO BUYS IN WARSAWForeigners who live in Warsaw for work tend to rent. The vast majority of luxury homes are being sold to wealthy Poles, Mr. Wojciechowski said.However, he said, the share of foreigners buying high-end homes in the city has been growing over the last two or three years. These buyers have been coming from the United States, Western Europe and Dubai, and they tend to have connections to Poland \u2014 for example, they have family there, or are of Polish ancestry.BUYING BASICSFor a prospective buyer who cannot obtain an exemption, a permit takes around two months, Mr. Kopania said, once all the necessary documents have been gathered for the application.Buyers typically cover most closing costs in Poland, and those costs vary significantly according to whether the property is new or previously owned, Mr. Kopania said. For a new house or apartment, the buyer typically pays a Value Added Tax of 8 percent. (For large new properties \u2014 houses of more than 300 square meters, or 3,230 square feet, or apartments of more than 150 square meters, or 1,500 square feet \u2014 there is a different tax structure, he said.) Parking spaces for apartments are often taxed at a higher rate of 23 percent, as are detached garages of single-family homes. For an existing house or apartment,there is no V.A.T., but a 2 percent tax commonly known as a transfer tax.Transactions are typically handled by notaries. Lawyers tend to be used in complicated or high-value transactions, meaning those above around a million dollars, Mr. Kopania said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYPolish; zloty ($1 = 3.83 zlotys)TAXES AND FEESAnnual property tax is 1,270 zlotys, or $332.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "My University Is on Fire", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byOn CampusThe answer to the question of how we arrived at this dark place is not simple, and begins alongside the project of post-apartheid South Africa itself.For more than 20 years the state has been asking universities to recruit more black students to redress the inequities caused by apartheid South Africa\u2019s racist restriction of quality education to whites. In one of the most unequal countries in the world, a university education can be an important impetus for class mobility, with a degree often helping to lift future generations out of poverty.While the comfortable, largely white middle classes criticize a \u201cculture of entitlement,\u201d student fees now make up a higher portion of university budgets than they did during my undergraduate studies in the 1990s. The state loan program, intended to help the most impoverished students, saddles them with crippling debt. Those who are granted loans find that the amount they have been given isn\u2019t enough to cover tuition and room and board.The situation erupted last year into the #FeesMustFall movement, which spread from my university to campuses across the country. The movement made a national call for accessible higher education that resulted in the cancellation of university fee increases for 2016. The #FeesMustFall movement also pushed for what students are calling the \u201cdecolonization\u201d of Eurocentric institutions and curriculums, as well as protections for janitors and other poorly paid workers on campuses.But the achievements of 2015 were not enough to create long-term change. The announcement earlier this year by Blade Nzimande, the minister of education, that universities could set their 2017 fee increases up to a maximum of 8 percent, led to a fresh round of protests, this time with demonstrators demanding free education for all. Protesters have become angrier and more militant, and university officials more intransigent. The movement is fractured and the response to it is hardening daily. Students are determined to close universities, whatever the consequences; in many cases, administrators are determined to keep them open, whatever the consequences. It\u2019s a tragic standoff.For the post-apartheid \u201cborn free\u201d generation, those born after 1990, when white-minority rule began to crumble, it\u2019s nothing short of shocking to witness clashes between young black protesters wielding stones and black police officers pointing rifles and wearing body armor. Students who live in dormitories report being harassed both by law enforcement agents and by protesters determined to stop classes. Reports and images of police brutality, racial profiling and sexual harassment by private security guards abound on social media.Studying is almost impossible, and my campus resembles a burned-out war zone when staff members return tentatively to their offices on Monday mornings. Trust between students and university officials has been destroyed. Statements and positions by professors are scrutinized from both sides. Students who aren\u2019t involved in the protests feel like collateral damage, let down both by student leaders and by university administrators who have a duty to care for them.Absent from all this anxious volatility is the state itself, locked in its own internal crises, with longstanding allegations of corruption at the highest levels, an economy in decline and a disgraced president clinging to power as calls to remove him from office mount even within his own party, the ruling African National Congress.Despite the extent of the damage and the risk to the 2016 academic year, with disruptions in areas of vital national interest like the placement of new medical students at public hospitals, we have yet to see Mr. Nzimande, not to mention President Jacob Zuma, appear on a university campus. The A.N.C. seems content to let universities burn and young people be brutalized, rather than step in with a coherent plan for increasing access to higher education.While some professors sit firmly on one or another end of the political spectrum, many of us who work at these institutions feel caught in an impossible bind. We believe strongly that quality education must be accessible to all, but we also want to do our jobs, which means teaching those who are desperate to learn and graduate. It\u2019s difficult not to feel that universities, held hostage by the student movement in the fight for free education, are being hung out to dry by a political inner circle that\u2019s more concerned with protecting a plundering president than with the economic and social stability that higher education can bring.The public university offers little benefit to society if only the wealthy have access to it. But institutions are precious and fragile things. Without negotiation and compromise their futures are uncertain. It remains to be seen whether the state, the students and university administrators have the collective will to save them, and with them the starry-eyed dream of a better South Africa for all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The E.U. Should Stick to Its Guns on Brexit", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byEditorialBritain and the European Union may be getting over the initial shock of the British demand for a divorce. Now comes the bitter fight. Already, both sides have staked out very different positions on immigration, an issue that promises to be the most contentious in the separation proceedings.The British prime minister, Theresa May, wants unfettered access to the European market, the world\u2019s largest. Under her vision, Britain\u2019s manufacturers would be able to sell products to customers in the bloc without paying duties, and bankers in London could serve businesses and investors anywhere in the union. But she and her colleagues insist on restricting immigration from other European Union countries.A common market cannot function properly if people are not allowed to move without having to obtain visas. Imagine how much more difficult it would be to do business in the United States if companies could not easily relocate employees to different states or if people could not freely move to take advantage of job opportunities.The indivisibility of the four freedoms is also necessary to send a clear message to politicians and voters in France, Italy and other countries in the bloc who argue that their countries should also leave the union. Allowing Britain to cherry-pick its membership rules would encourage these separatists, greatly undermining the European project and making the region less stable, less prosperous and less tolerant. It would also set a dangerous example for other, non-European countries, the United States included, where politicians have demonized immigrants at a time when many people have seen incomes stagnate and are increasingly fearful of terrorism.Even if it refuses to budge on immigration, Britain might still be able to negotiate a trade agreement with the union that gives it some modest economic benefits, like duty-free access for certain products. But the union is highly unlikely to give British banks and companies \u201cpassporting rights\u201d to operate throughout the bloc. Losing these privileges would be a big blow to the economy, which is one reason the pound has fallen nearly 18 percent against the dollar since the referendum. That should be reason enough for Mrs. May to compromise on immigration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jamaica, Long Opposed to Marijuana, Now Wants to Cash In on It", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byMONTEGO BAY, Jamaica \u2014 Jamaica has long bemoaned its reputation as the land of ganja.Now, its leaders smell something else: opportunity.Having watched states like Colorado and California generate billions of dollars from marijuana, Jamaica has decided to embrace its herbaceous brand.So, having done just about everything experts say a stupendously indebted nation should do \u2014 sticking to austere fiscal plans, adopting prudent macroeconomic policies and creating a friendly climate for outside investors \u2014 Jamaica is adding marijuana to its arsenal.The new world order has brought together an odd assortment of characters. At a recent conference at a luxury hotel in Montego Bay, besuited government officials and business leaders mingled with pot farmers and Rastafarian leaders like First Man, who kicked off the conference with a speech on the global benefits of ganja.\u201cWe are talking about a plant that bridges the gap between all of our relationships,\u201d First Man, barefoot with a Rasta scarf around his neck, said to a packed room. \u201cOur planet needs this relationship to happen.\u201d\u201cIn the past, the United States really left no room for maneuver,\u201d said Mark Golding, the former minister of justice who developed the legislation to permit medical marijuana production in Jamaica. \u201cBut with the Obama administration creating an opportunity for states to do what they wanted to, it created a window for all of us.\u201d\u201cWhere the real market is, and where the real money is, remains to be seen,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are all just preparing for it.\u201dFor some, society is at the beginning of a post-Prohibition era, much as it was with alcohol decades ago, when global brands and untold billions were still to be made.That\u2019s still a long way off. Jamaica began legalizing the use of medical marijuana last year, but has so far granted only a few licenses to cultivate marijuana for research purposes. No one, as yet, has sold any product legally, but the government is gearing up to meet whatever market presents itself.\u201cJamaica for so long has been associated with this plant,\u201d said the conference organizer, Doug Gordon. \u201cNow, it\u2019s a business, an opportunity, one that can change the future of this country through jobs and income, one that can change our G.D.P.\u201dOf course, all of this has stoked fears of inequality for poor rural farmers, who have long been targeted for doing exactly what the country is now trying to take advantage of. Many fear that big money will come in, monopolize the industry and leave those on the margins exactly where it found them.Iyah V, a Rastafarian leader who sits on the nation\u2019s nascent licensing authority, summed up concerns by pointing to the many suits and relatively few Rastas at the conference.\u201cIf we are not organized, and are not helped, the possibility exists for the ganja industry to become the next tourism, coffee or sugar industry, where our people are used as common laborers and the wealth is confined to a few,\u201d he said.Jamaican leaders say they are trying to heed the warning. Most agree there should be access to capital for small farmers, as well as breaks on expensive licensing fees and other upfront costs. But those, too, are yet to be determined. Even entrepreneurs agree that the playing field is not a level one.Varun Baker, a well-traveled and educated entrepreneur, has started Ganjagram, an application where users can read up on the laws regarding marijuana in Jamaica. Ultimately, he hopes to make it something of an Uber for marijuana smokers, allowing clients to order and select products for delivery through their phones.He is searching for partners and investors to help fund his ambitions, but the pitch remains difficult.\u201cThere is lots of gray area,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really understand what the government is doing.\u201dBali Vaswani, by contrast, is a prominent businessman in Jamaica who has created several brands, including Marley Brand Coffee on behalf of Marley\u2019s family. He is already working with a research license and last month harvested the first crop of legal marijuana in Jamaica.He is not only clear on the rules in place now, but is in a position to help shape those to come. He has ample capital to invest and business know-how, specifically in the marijuana industry in Colorado, so it is hard to imagine how he will not dominate the market here when it finally does open up.\u201cI\u2019m trying to bring a corporate structure to this, and do my part to build Brand Jamaica,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been given a set of rules, and all I do is follow it. It\u2019s not beneficial to knock the rules.\u201dTo date, there has been a lot of knocking of the rules. In fact, farmers, Rastafarians and academics have joined forces to slow the transformation underway, fearing small farmers will be railroaded.Kadamawe Knife, a Rastafarian academic, spent a significant portion of his presentation at the conference bashing the Cannabis Licensing Authority, the government\u2019s regulatory apparatus for ganja.\u201cHow do we make money on this? What is the growth strategy?\u201d he asked, directing his questions to a member of the licensing authority who was awkwardly sharing the stage with him. \u201cI have asked, and I haven\u2019t seen anything.\u201dThe licensing authority member, Delano Seiveright, took the accusations and jabs onstage with aplomb. Afterward, he said Dr. Knife had made some good points. But it did not change the fact that Jamaica was desperate for the funds that cannabis could provide.To claw its way back to prosperity and pay back one of the worst ratios of debt to gross domestic product in the world, the country is adhering to a strict austerity regime set out by the International Monetary Fund, which has meant little public spending in the last few decades.Now, leaders are desperate to find any means to expand the economy. And for some officials, earning the money quickly and efficiently means allowing the market to determine the winners, a strategy that favors those with resources.\u201cUltimately it\u2019s going to be hard to stop it,\u201d Mr. Seiveright said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t necessarily want to stop it.

{"Headline": "In Russia\u2019s \u2018Frozen Zone,\u2019 a Creeping Border With Georgia", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byBut while dismissed by most of the world as a make-believe border, the dirt track now running through this tiny Georgian village nonetheless means that Vephivia Tatiashvili can no longer go to his three-story house because it sits on land now patrolled by Russian border guards.That track marks the world\u2019s newest and perhaps oddest international frontier \u2014 the elastic boundary between Georgian-controlled land and the Republic of South Ossetia, a self-proclaimed breakaway state financed, defended and controlled by Moscow.Mr. Tatiashvili\u2019s troubles started early in the summer when earth-moving equipment turned up without warning and started digging a wide track through an apple orchard and a field of wildflowers on the edge of the village. He was out at the time, so he avoided being trapped.There is no fence or barbed wire, but Mr. Tatiashvili does not dare to cross the track to visit his house for fear of being arrested, as his elderly neighbor was, by Russian border guards.\u201cIt is too dangerous for me to go home,\u201d he said, complaining that the boundary has become so mobile that nobody really knows its final destination. Mr. Tatiashvili now lives in his brother\u2019s house, away from the border in the village center.The destitute mountainous area of South Ossetia first declared itself independent from Georgia in 1990, but nobody outside the region paid much attention until Russia invaded in August 2008 and recognized South Ossetia\u2019s claims to statehood. With that, the territory joined Abkhazia in western Georgia, the Moldovan enclave of Transnistria and eastern Ukraine as a \u201cfrozen zone,\u201d an area of Russian control within neighboring states, useful for things like preventing a NATO foothold or destabilizing the host country at opportune moments.The leader of South Ossetia, Leonid Tibilov, has said he plans to hold a referendum like the one in Crimea in 2014 on whether to request annexation by Russia.But even without a referendum, the nominally independent country is already Russian territory in all but name. It has its own small security force, but its self-declared frontiers are mainly guarded by Russia\u2019s border service, an arm of the Federal Security Service, the post-Soviet version of the K.G.B. It houses three Russian military bases with several thousand troops and, with no economy beyond a few farms, depends almost entirely on Russian aid for its survival.The green border signs that first appeared last year and now keep popping up along the zigzagging boundary warn that \u201cpassage is forbidden\u201d across what is declared to be a \u201cstate border.\u201d Which state is not specified, though locals are in no doubt about its identity.\u201cRussia starts right here,\u201d said Mr. Tatiashvili, pointing to the freshly dug track that separates his house from Georgian-held land.\u201cBut who knows where Russia will start tomorrow or the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they keep moving the line, we will one day all be living in a Russian-Georgian Federation.\u201dOne of the new signs \u2014 written in English and Georgian \u2014 is just a few hundred yards from Georgia\u2019s main east-west highway, and it puts a short part of an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to a Georgian port on the Black Sea within territory controlled by Russia.So tangled is the dispute over what land belongs to which side that each has its own definition of the line. Russia and South Ossetia insist that it is a border like any other \u2014 Venezuela, Nicaragua and Nauru also recognize it \u2014 while Georgia calls it \u201cthe occupation line.\u201d The European Union, which has around 200 monitors in Georgia to keep tabs on the agreement that ended the 2008 Russian-Georgian war, also says there is no actual border, only an \u201cadministrative boundary line.\u201dKestutis Jankauskas, the head of the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia, said it was hard to know where this boundary line exactly runs. It was never recognized or agreed upon, and its location depends on which maps are used. Russia, he said, is using a map drawn by the Soviet military\u2019s general staff in the 1980s.It demarcates what in the Soviet era was an inconsequential administrative boundary within the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia but what is now hardening into a hazardous frontier.The fitful movement of the boundary seems to be driven mostly by Russia\u2019s desire to align what it sees as a state border with this old Soviet map. So far, the movement has always been forward, often by just a few yards but at other times by bigger leaps.Because the line is so uncertain and, in many places, still completely unmarked, Georgian villagers sometimes find themselves on the wrong side and under arrest by Russian border guards or local security officers.To help get people out of detention, recover cattle that have strayed into Russian-controlled land and settle quotidian disputes like who owns which apple trees or vineyard, Europe\u2019s monitoring mission organizes a monthly meeting of Georgian, Russian and South Ossetian officials.As happened when the two pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine declared themselves independent states in 2014 and said they would like to be absorbed by Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin has mostly feigned ignorance of what his country\u2019s surrogates are up to in Georgia.Asked in April about South Ossetia\u2019s plans to hold a referendum on joining Russia, Mr. Putin suggested that Moscow was mostly a bystander. But if South Ossetia wants to hold a referendum, Mr. Putin said, \u201cwe cannot resist it.\u201dWhile Russian military, border and diplomatic personnel have poured into South Ossetia, the local population of Ossetians \u2014 an ethnic group whose language is distantly related to Persian \u2014 has steadily drifted away, shrinking by around half from a prewar level of roughly 70,000. An ethnic Georgian population of around 25,000 who used to live there have long since fled.Like Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, the border markings deep into what Georgia insists is its territory are slowly creating \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d that, no matter what the international community might think, are a reality that everyone has to deal with, particularly residents.Elizbar Mestumrishvili, 75, a farmer who lives next to Mr. Tatiashvili\u2019s now-marooned house, can still get to his home, as it lies on the Georgian side of the new dirt track.But he is wary of going to the bottom of his garden, which lies within a 60-yard frontier zone that Russian and South Ossetian security officers claim the right to patrol. Pointing to a row of vines drooping with plump grapes, he said it was unwise to walk any farther because \u201cthey might come and set up a border post.\u201dThe so-called borderization of a previously vague administrative boundary created political headaches for Georgia\u2019s government ahead of parliamentary elections on Oct. 8. It still won the election but had to fend off attacks from rivals who said it had responded too meekly to Russia\u2019s \u201ccreeping annexation.\u201dWhen it defeated supporters of former President Mikheil Saakashvili in elections four years ago, a coalition led by Georgian Dream, a party set up by an enigmatic billionaire, pledged to reduce tensions with Russia, which loathed Mr. Saakashvili. Instead, Russian border guards have moved deeper into Georgian territory.\u201cThere is no improvement. I would say the opposite,\u201d Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili said in an interview. \u201cUnfortunately, Russia never appreciates when you concede or make a step forward or compromise. They always take it for granted.\u201dAll the same, he insisted that even though his government had no intention of repeating Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s disastrous 2008 attempt to confront Russia militarily, the border will not last.\u201cIt has no prospect,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying to build this border, these fences, inside our country. We think it is temporary.\u201dAn article on Oct. 24 about Russia\u2019s elastic boundary with Georgia referred imprecisely to the approximately 200 European Union monitors who are in Georgia to keep tabs on the agreement that ended the 2008 Russian-Georgian war. They are unarmed police officers, former and current military personnel and civilians; not all 200 are police officers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "N.F.L. Stadium in Las Vegas May Be an Ego Boost, but Not an Economic One", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported bySports BusinessOn Monday, before flying to Houston for a two-day N.F.L. owners meeting, the Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis took a little trip to Las Vegas. He was not there to gamble, but to celebrate.The previous week, the Nevada Legislature had held a short special session, called by Gov. Brian Sandoval, to pass a bill that would commit a stunning $750 million in state money to a proposed $1.9 billion football stadium.Although the bill had plenty of opposition, all of the big corporate interests in Las Vegas, especially the casinos, wanted the stadium, which was intended to lure the Raiders. (The Oakland Coliseum, which the team shares with Major League Baseball\u2019s Athletics, is 50 years old.) Davis was on record as saying that if Las Vegas built it, he would come. The bill passed last Friday.The governor\u2019s signing ceremony Monday, which Davis had jetted in for, was a raucous event, by all accounts; it included cheerleaders shaking pompoms and a marching band that played \u201cViva Las Vegas\u201d when Sandoval signed the bill into law. Afterward, Davis reiterated that Las Vegas was where his team was headed: \u201cI made a commitment to the governor of Nevada,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never used another city as leverage.\u201dIt\u2019s not hard to understand why Las Vegas would want an N.F.L. team. It has never had top-tier professional sports; until recently, the various major leagues refused to consider it because gambling was so central to its economy. (Next year, however, the city will have an N.H.L. expansion team.)With gambling now so widespread, that stigma is largely gone. But an N.F.L. franchise could still help erase the Sin City image that Las Vegas has been trying to shed. \u201cThere is a huge inferiority complex in Las Vegas\u201d because of its history, said Richard Davies, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Nevada, Reno. \u201cI read an article within the last few days that quotes several people in Las Vegas saying: \u2018We are now in the big leagues. We needed a big-league team to be a big-league city.\u2019 \u201d\u201cMy point of comparison is with the Dodgers moving to Los Angeles,\u201d said Michael Green, an associate professor of history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \u201cTo a lot of people in Southern California, it marked the city\u2019s arrival.\u201dThe problem for cities like Las Vegas, desperate to land an N.F.L. franchise \u2014 or cities trying to hold on to a team that is demanding a new, state-of-the-art stadium \u2014 is that the billionaire owners of these franchises usually expect municipalities to pick up part of the tab for the new arena. There are few municipalities that don\u2019t succumb (though Oakland, to its everlasting credit, is one of them, which is why Davis wants to move). To justify using tax dollars to subsidize N.F.L. owners, officials invariably point to the jobs that will be added, the infrastructure that will be improved and the economic activity that will ensue.And in almost every case, those benefits are overstated or bogus. The academic literature on this point is nearly unanimous. Brad Humphreys, who has done a number of such studies as an economics professor at West Virginia University, told me bluntly that a new stadium brings \u201cno economic benefit.\u201d All it does is move spending to a football game that was otherwise being spent somewhere else.Over the years, Davis had mentioned Las Vegas as a possible relocation site. In January, after the Raiders\u2019 plans to move to Los Angeles were thwarted by N.F.L. owners, who went with the Rams instead, some Sands executives approached Davis. The deal they eventually struck called for the Raiders to put up $500 million for a new stadium, most of which would have to come from the N.F.L., since Davis lacks the wealth of many of his fellow owners. Adelson would contribute $650 million, and the final piece, $750 million, would come from Clark County, where Las Vegas sits. What Adelson would be getting for his $650 million was not explained.The group then went to the tourism committee, which, of course, included one of the presidents in Adelson\u2019s company. Not surprisingly, the committee wholeheartedly embraced the stadium idea and commissioned an economic study. The study concluded \u2014 shocker! \u2014 that the combination of a small increase in the hotel tax and the upsurge in economic activity thanks to the new stadium would cover the county\u2019s $750 million commitment. Indeed, because it was a hotel tax, the tourists would be paying, not the Las Vegas taxpayers. It was the equivalent of a free lunch.Or was it? Getting to that number required some rather unusual assumptions. One was that a third of the 65,000 fans at any Raiders game \u2014 including preseason games \u2014 would not be Las Vegans but out-of-towners. They would stay in a hotel for 3.2 days and spend collectively, on an annual basis, $375 million. In other words, 217,000 people each year would fly to Las Vegas for the primary purpose of watching the Raiders play football. Even if there were that many seats set aside for tourists (highly unlikely), that seems implausible.The tourism committee also accepted assumptions that the new stadium would attract a second bowl game in addition to the one it has now \u2014 and that the attendance would double. It would attract two neutral-site college football games each year. (There are usually fewer than a dozen each year.) Oh, and it would land signature events like the N.C.A.A. Final Four, the Republican National Convention and the Academy Awards ceremony (seriously).And then there were the job assumptions, which swayed many Democrats. \u201cThey said it would take 25,000 people to build it, when it is usually more like 3,000,\u201d said Roger Noll, a Stanford University sports economist who advised some stadium opponents. \u201cThey claim it will add 40,000 permanent jobs,\u201d he added. \u201cNo sane person would believe a number like that.\u201dNoll concluded: \u201cThe fix was in.\u201dAnd so it would seem. When the tourism committee held a meeting to allow critics to have their say, they were given three minutes each. After the committee issued its report, the governor called the Legislature into a special session to ram through the bill authorizing the $750 million expenditure. Only after the session began were legislators informed that the stadium would require nearly $900 million in road improvements. That meant that other, overdue improvements would continue to be delayed.The bill required a two-thirds vote. In the Assembly, the stadium supporters appeared to be short several votes. But after some behind-the-scenes lobbying, some nays became yeas, and it passed by one vote.At the owners meeting in Houston, Davis insisted that he was going to move to Las Vegas, and he told his fellow owners that he would submit his relocation plans in January. Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, pushed back and said that all things being equal, the league would prefer to keep the Raiders in Oakland. Davis, who is not the most-liked owner, can\u2019t move the team without getting the votes of 24 of the league\u2019s 32 owners.Still, so long as Oakland won\u2019t hand Davis a public subsidy, chances are the Raiders will move in a few years, once the Las Vegas stadium is completed. We still don\u2019t know what Adelson\u2019s role is \u2014 though one can assume he is not putting up $650 million out of the goodness of his heart. Indeed, we know very little about the deal. What we do know is that if the Raiders move, it will be one sweet deal for Davis. Despite handing over the largest public subsidy in the history of arenas, Clark County will get none of the cash flow from the stadium, none from the parking, none from the naming rights, none from the gate \u2014 nothing. It all goes to the team.And if the economic projections turn out to be pie in the sky, as many believe they will, and the hotel tax can\u2019t cover the $750 million, the Clark County taxpayers will be on the hook.Welcome to the big leagues, Las Vegas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Debate in One Scary Answer", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byO.K., Donald Trump won\u2019t promise to accept the results of the election. That\u2019s truly \u2026 good grief.\u201cI will tell you at the time. \u2026 I\u2019ll keep you in suspense,\u201d he told Wednesday\u2019s debate moderator, Chris Wallace. The word \u201crigged\u201d came up. Yow.Hillary Clinton noted that Trump tends to presume that whenever he loses anything, the system was rigged: \u201cThere was even a time when he didn\u2019t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.\u201d\u201cI should have gotten it,\u201d Trump retorted.This is obviously what we should have known was coming when the host of \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\u201d wound up as a presidential nominee. But jeepers, people, this is serious. Trump was refusing to acknowledge it was even possible for him to lose a fair fight. At one point, he announced the election was rigged because Hillary Clinton was in it. (\u201cShe should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails.\u201d)The rigged-election moment overshadowed everything else in the debate, during which Trump made very strange faces while Clinton was talking, but did manage to avoid going completely off the rails. Does that make him a success? We are once again faced with the problem of the very, very low bar. Still, no.He did manage, particularly in the early part of the debate, to ignore Clinton\u2019s effort to get his goat. When she claimed he \u201cchoked\u201d at his meeting with the president of Mexico, he kept pretty calm. Although Trump did observe, weirdly, that when it came to immigration, under President Obama \u201cmillions of people have been moved out of this country. \u2026 She doesn\u2019t want to say that, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happened \u2026 big league.\u201d Is moving people out not the whole Trump plan?They also had a whopping argument about \u2014 guess who? Vladimir Putin! \u201cPutin from everything I see has no respect for this person,\u201d Trump said, referring to Clinton. The fight went on for a while, until she cannily managed to divert the discussion to the possibility of placing Trump\u2019s \u201cfinger on the nuclear button.\u201dO.K., two critical takeaways. Trump won\u2019t promise to concede if he loses, and if he wins, he gets control of the nukes. These are the only things you need to think about for the next two and a half weeks.We have been down this debate road before, and we knew before the evening started that when Trump was asked about groping women, he\u2019d deny everything, blame it on Hillary Clinton and then bring up the emails. And that when the emails came up, Clinton would mention the way Trump insulted John McCain\u2019s war record, the Mexican-American judge and the parents of the dead war hero.\u201cSuch a nasty woman,\u201d Trump said at one point. As the debate went on, he got more sullen, his expressions stranger. One of the things we have now learned for sure, three debates running, is that he has a serious stamina problem. Hillary Clinton has many faults. She tends to give long, rather boring answers. She has never learned how to deal with the email question. But the woman is an absolute rock in these long-running, high-stress critical encounters.Also, she made it very clear that she would accept the results of the election, even if she lost. God help us all.Clinton was not particularly good in defending the Clinton Foundation. However, it did seem fair for her to point out that Trump used some of his own foundation\u2019s money to purchase a six-foot portrait of himself. (\u201cWho does that?\u201d)If you were totally ignoring the entire event, you might want to know that nobody shook hands, that it took Clinton an hour to mention that Trump had never released his tax returns, and that whenever she pointed out that he had purchased the very same Chinese steel and aluminum he complained was ruining the economy, he said that it was her fault for not changing the laws.She did bring up the Miss-Universe-is-fat moment, and Trump said \u201cgive me a break.\u201dHe promised to run the country \u201cthe way I run my company,\u201d and a great part of the listening public contemplated the fact that this is a guy who\u2019s declared bankruptcy six times. But we\u2019ve already forgotten all about it.Only one thing matters. The man says he won\u2019t promise to accept the results of the election. All those establishment Republicans who\u2019ve been hoping to get through this ordeal by just being quiet and looking sad have got some work to do. Fast.Nicholas Kristof is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Did the Obamas Fail to Take On Corporate Agriculture?", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "A food system organized around subsidized monocultures of corn and soy, I explained, guzzled tremendous amounts of fossil fuel (for everything from the chemical fertilizer and pesticide those fields depended on to the fuel needed to ship food around the world) and in the process emitted tremendous amounts of greenhouse gas \u2014 as much as a third of all emissions, by some estimates. At the same time, the types of food that can be made from all that subsidized corn and soy \u2014 feedlot meat and processed foods of all kinds \u2014 bear a large measure of responsibility for the steep rise in health care costs: A substantial portion of what we spend on health care in this country goes to treat chronic diseases linked to diet. Furthermore, the scale and centralization of a food system in which one factory washes 25 million servings of salad or grinds 20 million hamburger patties each week is uniquely vulnerable to food-safety threats, whether from negligence or terrorists. I went on to outline a handful of proposals aimed at reforming the food system so that it might contribute to the health of the public and the environment rather than undermine it.\u201cI was just reading an article in The New York Times by Michael Pollan about food and the fact that our entire agricultural system is built on cheap oil. As a consequence, our agriculture sector actually is contributing more greenhouse gases than our transportation sector. And in the meantime, it\u2019s creating monocultures that are vulnerable to national security threats, are now vulnerable to sky-high food prices or crashes in food prices, huge swings in commodity prices, and are partly responsible for the explosion in our health care costs because they\u2019re contributing to Type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease, obesity.\u201dWas it possible that the food movement \u2014 the loose-knit coalition of environmental, public-health, animal-welfare and social-justice advocates seeking reform of the food system \u2014 might soon have a friend in the White House?They also cheered when, at a 2007 agricultural meeting in Iowa, Obama declared that Americans had a right to know where in the world their food came from and whether it had been genetically modified. In ways small and large, Obama left the distinct impression during the campaign that he grasped the food movement\u2019s critique of the food system and shared its aspirations for reforming it.But aspirations are cheap \u2014 and na\u00efvet\u00e9 can be expensive. A few days after the candidate\u2019s interview with Time, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, a.k.a. the Senior Senator from Corn, blasted Obama for his heretical views on American agriculture, suggesting he was blaming farmers for obesity and pollution. A campaign spokesman quickly walked back Obama\u2019s remarks, explaining that the candidate was merely \u201cparaphrasing an article he\u2019d read.\u201d Big Food had spoken, and the candidate \u2014 an urban politician from Chicago \u2014 got the first of what would turn out to be many unpleasant tutorials on the industry\u2019s sway in Washington.Each of these sectors is dominated by a remarkably small number of gigantic firms. According to one traditional yardstick, an industry is deemed excessively concentrated when the top four companies in it control more than 40 percent of the market. In the case of food and agriculture, that percentage is exceeded in beef slaughter (82 percent of steers and heifers), chicken processing (53 percent), corn and soy processing (roughly 85 percent), pesticides (62 percent) and seeds (58 percent). Bayer\u2019s planned acquisition of Monsanto promises to increase concentration in both the seed and agrochemical markets.Each industry sector is represented in Washington by one or more powerful lobbying organizations. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (G.M.A.) represents the household brand names, like General Mills, Campbell\u2019s, PepsiCo, Nestl\u00e9, that make and market the packaged foods and beverages in the supermarket. The North American Meat Institute represents Big Meat, working alongside each animal\u2019s dedicated trade association (the National Pork Producers Council, the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association and the National Chicken Council). The American Farm Bureau Federation ostensibly speaks for the growers of the commodity crops. The National Restaurant Association is the voice of the fast-food chains. The euphemistically named CropLife America speaks for the pesticide industry.These groups each have their own parochial furrows to plow in Washington, but they frequently operate as one \u2014 on such issues as crop subsidies, which benefit all, or the labeling of genetically modified food, which disadvantages all. In recent years the various sectors have been driven closer by the emergence of a common adversary: a food movement bent on checking their dominance in the marketplace and their freedom to operate with a minimum of oversight. So while it is something of a simplification, it does make sense to talk about Big Food as a single entity \u2014 and an impressively powerful one at that.Big Food had a big problem with the first lady\u2019s food talk, and especially with one modifier: organic. In fact, she seldom if ever used that word to describe her garden, but the White House news release announcing the garden made much of the organic practices they were using \u2014 fertilizing with compost, using beneficial insects instead of chemicals to control pests and so on \u2014 so the press invariably referred to it as the White House\u2019s \u201corganic garden.\u201dA spokesman for the American Council on Science and Health, a chemical-industry front group, called the Obamas \u201corganic limousine liberals,\u201d warning that organic farming would lead to famine and calling on the first lady to use pesticides in her garden \u2014 evidently whether she needed them or not. The Mid-America CropLife Association wrote a letter to the president suggesting that, by planting an organic garden, his wife had unfairly impugned conventional agriculture. A minor skirmish, perhaps, but also a shot across the bow.At considerable risk to their livelihoods, ranchers and farmers testified to the abuses they suffered at the hands of the small number of companies to which they were forced to sell, often on unfavorable terms. In many regions, the officials heard, there were so few buyers for cattle that the big four meatpackers were able to dictate prices, impose unfair contracts and simply refuse to buy from ranchers who spoke out. Chicken farmers testified about how they had been reduced to sharecroppers by the industry\u2019s contract system. Companies like Tyson and Perdue make farmers sign contracts under which the companies supply the chicks and feed and then decide how much to pay for the finished chickens based on secret formulas; farmers who object or who refuse any processor demands (to upgrade facilities, for example) no longer receive chicks, effectively putting them out of business. Holder, Varney and Vilsack expressed sympathy, voiced concern, vowed action and promised the farmers who came forward that they would suffer no retaliation for their testimony. Varney even offered to give one skittish chicken farmer her phone number at Justice.Big Meat, in particular, was not happy. It opened its wallet, spending roughly $9 million on lobbying in 2010, not including political contributions to members of the agriculture committees in Congress. One of those committees called Edward Avalos, a U.S.D.A. undersecretary, to Capitol Hill to defend the new rules in a hearing at which the poor fellow was grilled mercilessly for doing his job. (The story is well told in Christopher Leonard\u2019s recent book, \u201cThe Meat Racket.\u201d) Vilsack apparently got the message; he consented to postpone the new regulations. This gave the industry time to mount a \u201cgrass roots\u201d lobbying campaign against the Gipsa rules, in which contract chicken farmers were recruited by the National Chicken Council to send Congress letters drafted by lobbyists. Vilsack, in retreat, offered to scale back the new rules to make them more palatable. But the industry would accept nothing less than complete victory: It succeeded in killing any new curbs on its market power when the House Appropriations Committee stripped funding for Gipsa enforcement from the U.S.D.A.\u2019s spending bill for 2012. And 2013, and 2014, and 2015.But what about the listening tour and the public hearings? Even though the hearings had established a pattern of anticompetitive behavior, the entire antitrust effort was quietly and ignominiously dropped. No more was ever heard of it. The farmers who testified were left to fend for themselves in the marketplace. (As for dialing up Christine Varney? Forget it: She returned to private practice in 2011, seven months after the last public hearing.) Obama had launched the most serious government challenge to the power of Big Food since Teddy Roosevelt went after the Meat Trust a century ago, but in the face of opposition it simply evaporated.In response, the industry adopted a clever two-track strategy to deal with the challenge laid down by the first lady. On a very public track, industry leaders engaged the foundation that she formed, the Partnership for a Healthier America, in negotiating a series of private-sector partnerships \u2014 a series of voluntary efforts that the industry hoped would help avert new regulations \u2014 a possibility that Obama raised in her speech. Supermarket retailers pledged to promote more healthful foods in their stores, like fresh produce. A group of 16 leading food makers pledged to reduce the total number of calories in the food supply by a whopping 1.5 trillion. Food makers pledged to reduce harmful ingredients in processed food, like salt and sugar, while boosting healthy ingredients, like whole grains. In exchange for entering into these agreements, several industry partners were granted invaluable photo ops with the first lady. In the case of Subway and Walmart, she made appearances in their stores.Michelle Obama has celebrated these partnerships as significant achievements, but do they match the ambitions of her 2010 speech, with its call for industry to do more than \u201ctweak around the edges\u201d and instead to \u201centirely rethink the products you\u2019re offering\u201d? Removing unhealthful ingredients from processed foods is undeniably a good thing. Yet making junk food incrementally less junky is a dubious achievement at best. It tends to obscure the more important distinction between processed food of any kind and whole foods. What began as a cultural conversation about gardens and farmers\u2019 markets and real food became a conversation about improved packaged foods, a shift in emphasis that surely served the interests of Big Food. While it can be argued that this was simply a concession to reality \u2014 because most Americans eat processed foods most of the time \u2014 to give up on real food so fast was to give up a lot.As for Big Food\u2019s ballyhooed 2010 agreement with the first lady to remove 1.5 trillion calories from the American food supply by 2015, well, what does this even mean? Precious little, it turns out. The Healthy Weight Commitment partnership agreement stipulated an independent evaluation of the results, sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and recently completed. It concluded that total calories in the food supply were already declining by more than a trillion a year \u2014 soda sales, for example, have been plunging \u2014 and the evaluators determined that market trends would have guaranteed greater declines even in the absence of any pledge by the industry. The dean of the School of Nutrition at Tufts characterized the whole initiative as \u201can easily publicized but deceptive \u2018sham\u2019 pledge\u201d and \u201can apparent industry charade\u201d \u2014 at the public\u2019s and the first lady\u2019s expense.At the time, the White House, spooked by the Tea Party election of 2010 (which cost the Democrats control of the House) and by charges from Republicans and business leaders that the president was unfriendly to business, had begun an effort to repair relations with corporate America. In January 2011, Bill Daley, the former commerce secretary and investment banker, was installed as a business-friendly chief of staff. That spring, the G.M.A. waged an aggressive lobbying campaign to water down the marketing guidelines, aimed at both Congress and the White House. In the months that followed, the G.M.A., along with leaders of food and media companies, was granted a meeting with Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president, in the White House to discuss the issue. Public-health advocates and congressional supporters of the guidelines were surprised that neither the first lady nor the president spoke out in support of them. \u201cI\u2019m upset with the White House,\u201d Senator Tom Harkin, chairman of the Senate Health committee, told Reuters. \u201cThey went wobbly in the knees.\u201dThe White House had left the administration\u2019s own interagency task force to the mercies of a Republican-controlled House, which effectively killed off the voluntary guidelines. Faber, who as the G.M.A.\u2019s chief lobbyist helped orchestrate this rout, told me he was \u201cfrankly surprised the administration never came back with a revised set of guidelines.\u201d Evidently the White House had lost its stomach for this particular fight.Big Meat also prevailed when challenged on the misuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture \u2014 a problem that Margaret Hamburg, the F.D.A. chief, likened to having your \u201chair on fire,\u201d since it is leading to antibiotic resistance and compromising the drugs we depend on. But when the F.D.A. finally acted in 2013, it came forth not with regulations but with a voluntary program, one that has so far failed to reduce the use of antibiotics in the meat industry. The food industry even managed to undermine the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, Michelle Obama\u2019s signature legislation, which the Republican Congress is refusing to reauthorize.But perhaps we will look back on Big Food\u2019s single most important victory during the Obama years as one it didn\u2019t even have to break a sweat achieving, since it involved an issue on which it wasn\u2019t even challenged. The administration undertook an ambitious campaign to tackle climate change by stringently regulating industries responsible for greenhouse gases, notably energy and transportation. For whatever reason, though, the administration chose not to confront one of the largest emitters of all: agriculture.These battles have exposed weaknesses in the facade of Big Food\u2019s power, soft spots that some grass-roots food activists have recently figured out how to exploit. One example: Since the 1990s, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers has been organizing the tomato pickers of South Florida, some of the most underpaid and ill-treated workers in the country. In their decades-long quest to improve pay (by 1 cent per pound) and working conditions (until recently some Florida tomato pickers were effectively enslaved by their employers), the coalition tried every strategy in the book: labor strikes, hunger strikes, marches across the state. But the growers would not budge.\u201cThen we found the unlocked door in the castle wall,\u201d Lucas Benitez, the farmworker who helped establish the coalition, told me. \u201cIt was the corporate brand.\u201d Instead of going after the anonymous growers and packers, who had nothing to lose by rejecting their demands, the coalition trained its sights on the Big Food brands that bought their tomatoes: McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Chipotle, Subway, Walmart. In 2011 the coalition drafted a Fair Food Agreement guaranteeing a raise of a penny per pound and spelling out strict new standards governing working conditions. They then pushed the big brands to sign it, using the threat of boycotts, marches on fast-food outlets, even the public shaming of top executives and their bankers. One by the one, the Big Food brands have given in, signing the agreement and, for the first time, accepting a measure of responsibility for the welfare of farmworkers at the far end of their food chain. The coalition achieved victories that never could have been achieved in Washington.Surely there is a lesson here for the food movement \u2014 a collection of disparate groups that seek change in food and agriculture but don\u2019t always agree with one another on priorities. Under that big tent you will find animal rights activists who argue with sustainable farmers about meat; hunger activists who disagree with public-health advocates seeking to make soda and candy ineligible for food stamps; environmentalists who argue with sustainable cattle ranchers about climate change; and so on. To call this a movement is an act of generosity and hope. But whatever it is, it has been no match for Big Food, at least in Washington.Whenever the Obamas seriously poked at Big Food, they were quickly outlobbied and outgunned. Why? Because the food movement still barely exists as a political force in Washington. It doesn\u2019t yet have the organization or the troops to light up a White House or congressional switchboard when one of its issues is at stake.Big Food knows it has a serious story problem, and early in the administration it began an aggressive P.R. effort. The immediate impetus appears to have been the 2009 release of the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201cFood, Inc.\u201d (for which I was interviewed and served as a consultant). The film made the case that the entire food system, from the Midwestern monocultures of G.M.O. corn to the fast-food meals wrecking America\u2019s health, was sorely in need of reform. In response to the film, and facing an administration that appeared sympathetic to such views, a coalition of agribusiness corporations, along with the Farm Bureau and various commodity groups got serious about defending the industrial food system and going after its critics. According to a September 2010 article in Agri-Pulse, a trade publication, not only was the industry gearing up for \u201ca pre-emptive strike against a long list of new regulations\u201d expected from the new administration, but, just as important, it also felt the need to confront \u201cpeople like Michael Pollan.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve seen so many attacks,\u201d a corn industry spokesman was quoted as saying. \u201cWe see Michael Pollan go on Oprah\u201d \u2014 as I did after \u201cFood, Inc.\u201d came out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when those people ... start to have an impact in Washington on policies and regulations?\u201d Thus spooked, a coalition of Big Ag companies and trade groups, including Monsanto, DuPont and the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, hired Ketchum Communications, the New York P.R. firm, to organize a multimillion-dollar campaign. Ketchum promoted something called the U.S. Farmers and Ranchers Alliance, ostensibly a group of independent farmers and ranchers \u2014 though much of the funding came from agribusiness corporations \u2014 who would speak out, in public forums and on op-ed pages, to counter the writers and filmmakers who, at the time, had a big and largely uncontested microphone.It was around this time that some of my speaking engagements at agriculture schools began falling prey to unexpected snafus and changes in plan. An invitation to speak at Washington State University in 2009, which had organized a community read of one of my books, was suddenly withdrawn, supposedly because of a budgetary crisis but according to media reports at the behest of a wheat grower on its Board of Regents. (When a prominent alumnus, a lawyer and food-industry gadfly named Bill Marler, stepped forward offering to cover my expenses, the school abruptly reversed course.) In 2010, an invitation to speak at Cal Poly, another ag school, was transformed into a debate after a donor to the school, the chairman of the biggest cattle feedlot in California, wrote to the president of the university threatening to withdraw his gift if I was allowed to speak without challenge. The University of Wisconsin, Madison, also made my book a community read and invited me to talk about it. To protest my presence, the Wisconsin Farm Bureau bused in several hundred farmers from across the state, all of them wearing the same T-shirt, printed with the legend \u201cIn Defense of Farmers.\u201d Only the fabled niceness of Midwesterners saved me from a hail of rotten tomatoes that night.Surely Big Food was overreacting to the threat posed by a handful of writers and filmmakers, yet the fact that they did suggests that, behind the industry\u2019s wall of political power, there indeed lurks a vulnerability. That vulnerability is the conscience of the American eater, who in the past decade or so has taken a keen interest in the question of where our food comes from, how it is produced and the impact of our everyday food choices on the land, on the hands that feed us, on the animals we eat and, increasingly, on the climate. Though still a minority, the eaters who care about these questions have come to distrust Big Food and reject what it is selling. Looking for options better aligned with their values, they have created, purchase by purchase, a $50 billion alternative food economy, comprising organic food, local food and artisanal food. Call it Little Food. And while it is still tiny in comparison with Big Food, it is nevertheless the fastest-growing sector of the food economy.While Big Food can continue to forestall change in Washington, that strategy simply will not succeed in the marketplace. There, Big Food is struggling to adapt to a rapidly shifting landscape it cannot control. That\u2019s why it\u2019s gobbling up organic and artisanal brands, hoping to learn the secret of their success \u2014 which, of course, is simply that they understand and respect the values of the new food consumer better than Big Food does. Some large food companies are voluntarily changing their practices in response to the concerns of these consumers, whether about antibiotics, animal welfare or the welfare of farmworkers. One future of food politics may lie in grass-roots campaigns targeted not at politicians in Washington but directly at Big Food and its consumers, taking aim at its Achilles\u2019 heel: those precious brands.For all the disappointments, the Obamas deserve credit for celebrating and nourishing Little Food. If nothing else, the spotlight of their attention helped elevate the idea of food as something worthy of public attention. As the Obamas prepare to leave the White House, Big Food can congratulate itself on retaining its political grip on Washington. It seems very unlikely that the next occupant of the White House is going to pose as stiff a challenge. Donald Trump professes to love fast food, and Hillary Clinton has longstanding ties to Big Food: Tyson was one of Bill Clinton\u2019s first political patrons, and as a lawyer in Arkansas, Hillary Clinton served on the board at Walmart. (Though as a New York senator, she worked hard on behalf of small upstate farmers, so perhaps there is hope.) But like Goliath, Big Food can\u2019t afford to be complacent about its size or power, not when the culture of food is shifting underfoot. Perhaps it is a sign of things to come that Scott Faber, the lobbyist who helped the industry navigate the first Obama administration, has left the G.M.A. to work for the Environmental Working Group, where he now plies his skills on behalf of the food movement\u2019s David. Politics and policy in Washington seldom move before the larger culture does, but when that happens, it can sweep away everything in its path \u2014 Goliath included.Michael Pollan is a contributing writer and the Knight professor of journalism at U.C. Berkeley, and the author, most recently, of \u201cCooked: A Natural History of Transformation.\u201dAn\u00a0article\u00a0on Oct. 9 about the Obama\u00a0administration\u2019s failure to take on corporate agriculture misattributed a quotation\u00a0in the publication Agri-Pulse about the\u00a0agriculture industry\u2019s gearing up for \u201ca\u00a0preemptive strike against a long list of\u00a0new regulations\u201d expected from the Obama\u00a0administration.

He had a balcony and liked the view.When I was promoted in 2013, it was a coincidence that I was already in the chairman\u2019s suite.

When I moved here, I rented a small apartment near Chinatown, a 20-minute walk from the office. In Southern California, people drive everywhere, and I often joked that we even drove to get our newspaper. I drive to work here. The job keeps me so busy that every minute counts.By the bookI brought very few personal items with me because I had a short time to move. I was a litigator before this, and one of the things I brought to the office was a reference book on federal rules of litigation that private practitioners frequently use in California.2.

It showcases our seal, which was designed by Tiffany & Company in 1915 when the agency got its start. Often, when guests visit, especially from other countries, they want a photo taken with the flags. Protocol matters in Washington, even in the way flags are positioned. The American flag should be first, closest to the desk. Once they were switched when furniture was moved. A staff member walked in and immediately noticed the mistake.3.

{"Headline": "Third Heathrow Airport Runway Backed by British Government", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 After decades of delay, the British government endorsed the expansion of London\u2019s Heathrow Airport on Tuesday. The decision to build a third runway at the airport provoked a ferocious response that illustrated why a succession of politicians have ducked the issue since the 1970s.The announcement was meant to end years of political paralysis over aviation planning in southeast England, where Heathrow is now operating at 98 percent of its capacity, causing Britain to lose ground to airline hubs on the European Continent.But the decision announced on Tuesday by Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is just the start of a lengthy process that is sure to face legal challenges. It also presents Theresa May, the new prime minister who has opposed a Heathrow expansion in the past, with a crucial political test.The government has bought some time by delaying a parliamentary vote on the matter until next year. Two of Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet ministers \u2014 Justine Greening, the education secretary, and Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary \u2014 oppose the project; Mr. Johnson called it \u201cundeliverable.\u201dZac Goldsmith, another lawmaker from the governing Conservative Party, said he was resigning his parliamentary seat in protest . The move will prompt a special election that would reduce the Conservatives\u2019 already slim majority in the House of Commons. Mr. Goldsmith said he would run for his old seat as an independent.A strong environmental campaigner who lost the contest this year to become the mayor of London, Mr. Goldsmith called the runway decision \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d but also said that the project \u201cis almost certainly not going to be delivered.\u201dCaroline Lucas, a Green Party lawmaker, said that the government could not expand Heathrow if it \u201cis remotely serious about climate targets.\u201dMr. Grayling acknowledged that, given the consultation process that the project must undergo, the new runway would not be open for nine years.Still, he insisted that the expansion was vital to Britain\u2019s prosperity. The government has sought to present the expansion as a symbol of the economic self-confidence of an outward-looking trading nation, after the referendum vote in June to quit the European Union.British governments invariably struggle to deliver big infrastructure projects, from airport expansion to high-speed rail. Because of its location, Heathrow is a particularly toxic issue and arguments about its expansion have raged since the 1970s, when a government document described its capacity as \u201crestricted.\u201dPart of the problem is its history: Heathrow began life in an era when the scale of modern aviation could not be imagined. Located to the west of central London, its busy flight paths cross many residential districts, and the parliamentary constituencies of influential politicians.They include Mr. Johnson, a former mayor of London, whose opposition to a new runway is so vehement that he has said that he will lie down in front of the bulldozers to prevent the expansion. On Tuesday, he said that \u201cthe day when the bulldozers appear is a long way off, if indeed they ever materialize.\u201dAcknowledging the strength of feeling in her government, Mrs. May gave ministers like Mr. Johnson the freedom to oppose the government\u2019s decision \u2014 at least for a time \u2014 and pushed back a parliamentary vote on the project, probably for a year.Political sensitivities had paralyzed decision making on the plan by David Cameron, who resigned as prime minister after Britain\u2019s surprise \u2018Brexit\u2019 decision, in the June 23 referendum, to leave the European Union.En route from London to Tokyo, a pilot\u2019s-eye view of life in the sky.Three main options had been under consideration: building a third runway at Heathrow; extending one of its existing runways; or building a second runway at Gatwick Airport, which is south of London.Gatwick, with its single runway, has half the traffic of Heathrow. The main European rivals airports already have more runways than Heathrow: Schiphol in Amsterdam has six; Frankfurt and Charles de Gaulle in Paris each have four.A Heathrow expansion is not a cheap option, financially or politically. It comes with a price tag of 18 billion pounds \u2014 around $22 billion \u2014 and will involve the demolition of hundreds of homes.But Heathrow has been considered the most viable option, because of the surrounding infrastructure and because it is already a global aviation hub and the biggest handler of cargo.It emerged as the top choice in a report by Sir Howard Davies, the chairman of the Airports Commission, who concluded that a new northwest runway for Heathrow was a much better alternative for expansion than a new runway at Gatwick, both for passengers and freight.On Tuesday, Mr. Grayling\u2019s department said the new runway at Heathrow would bring economic benefits to passengers and the wider economy worth up to \u00a361 billion. Up to 77,000 additional local jobs are expected to be created over the next 14 years, it said in a statement.\u201cThe country has waited nearly 50 years for this decision,\u201d said Paul Drechsler, the president of the Confederation of British Industry.He called the proposal a relief, adding, \u201cOur aviation capacity is set to run out as early as 2025, so it\u2019s crucial we get spades in the ground as soon as possible.\u201dThe expansion, he said, \u201cwill provide not only a welcome economic stimulus but will show the world that we are well and truly open for business as we negotiate our exit from the E.U.\u201dOlivier Jankovec, the director general of ACI Europe, a trade association of European airports, said the announcement \u201cbrings us closer to the end of one of the longest, most publicly consulted infrastructure planning processes anywhere in the world.\u201d\u201cAn island economy lives or dies by its air connectivity,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the U.K. government is serious about its focus on economic growth and preserving the country\u2019s global positioning, it needs to truly embed air connectivity and sustainable airport development in its economic strategy.\u201dOpponents vowed to fight on. Tania Mathias, the Conservative member of Parliament for Twickenham in southwest London, near Heathrow, said she was \u201ccertain\u201d the expansion would not happen.\u201cThe initial reaction of people living under the flight path is one of despair and desolation,\u201d added John Stewart, the chairman of Hacan ClearSkies, a group representing west London residents who are against any expansion of Heathrow.But opponents said they saw Mrs. May\u2019s decision to postpone a parliamentary vote on the plan as a chance for powerful politicians like Mr. Johnson to press for alternatives.\u201cThere are political allies for us at the very highest levels,\u201d Mr. Stewart said.Nicola Clark contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Brexit, Nissan Will Build New Car Model in Britain", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The Japanese carmaker Nissan, one of Britain\u2019s largest overseas employers, announced on Thursday that it would build a new car at its existing plant in Sunderland, giving Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain a considerable political gift.Sunderland has been a symbolic flash point in Britain\u2019s decision to leave European Union.The Nissan deal will be closely dissected for early indications about how Ms. May will potentially navigate the thorny negotiations with major industries. Nissan acted after getting reassurances from Mrs. May that the company would be protected from any negative economic impact from the so-called Brexit.Mrs. May called the announcement \u201cfantastic news for the U.K.,\u201d saying that Nissan was \u201cat the heart of this country\u2019s strong automotive industry,\u201d which is almost entirely foreign-owned and ships more than half its exports to the European Union.\u201cThis vote of confidence shows Britain is open for business and that we remain an outward-looking, world-leading nation,\u201d Mrs. May said in a statement. \u201cIt is a recognition that the government is committed to creating and supporting the right conditions for the automotive industry so it continues to grow.\u201dNissan\u2019s chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, warned in September that the carmaker needed British guarantees before it would commit to further investment at its plant, which produces some 500,000 cars a year for the regional market. Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union is likely to mean an end to duty-free participation in the European single market, potentially making it uncompetitive for Nissan to continue to invest here.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Mr. Ghosn clearly got guarantees from the British government, but there were no details about what those might be. It is particularly complex because there is no way of knowing what kind of trade deal Britain might negotiate with the European Union over the next two or more years.Mrs. May also benefited on Thursday from early figures showing that the British economy grew faster than expected in the three months after the referendum to leave the European Union on June 23.Despite fears of an early recession, the economy expanded by 0.5 percent from July to September, down only 0.2 percent from the previous quarter. The figures were helped by the service sector, which represents 80 percent of the economy.\u201cThe fundamentals of the U.K. economy are strong and today\u2019s data show that the economy is resilient,\u201d said Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer.Although the figures will be used as ammunition by those who favored the decision to leave the European Union and those who did not, they underline the largely postindustrial nature of the British economy. Still, the car industry is an important symbol of Britain\u2019s ability to prosper in a highly competitive sector, which is why Nissan\u2019s importance outweighs the size of its investment here.Despite the risks of leaving the European Union, Sunderland voted by a surprisingly large margin in June for the British exit, known as Brexit; 61 percent favored quitting, despite the 7,000 Nissan workers there. The Sunderland vote, which came early in the counting, was taken as a strong indication that Britain would vote to leave. It ultimately did, by 52 percent to 48 percent, despite fears that the economy would suffer badly.\u201cNissan\u2019s decision follows the U.K. government\u2019s commitment to ensure that the Sunderland plant remains competitive,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, Nissan will increase its investment in Sunderland, securing and sustaining the jobs of more than 7,000 workers.\u201dMr. Ghosn, who met with Mrs. May this month, said on Thursday that \u201cthe support and assurances of the U.K. government enabled us to decide that the next generation Qashqai and X-Trail will be produced at Sunderland.\u201d He then praised the workers there, saying that they \u201ccontinue to make the plant a globally competitive powerhouse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It had recently gotten its first decent road link to the rest of the country, a new highway through the rugged mountains that brought development. Cellphone service had finally begun, enabling farmers and businesses to flourish. The city was racing into the 21st century, dreaming of advanced agriculture and tourism in one of Haiti\u2019s few nature preserves.The rich forests and vegetation are now splinters and a saltwater swamp. Roads are blocked with detritus, trees turned to tinder, homes reduced to mounds of stone and rusted tin shards cleaved from roofs. J\u00e9r\u00e9mie\u2019s ambitious economic plans have been eviscerated.\u201cInstead of going forward, we have to restart,\u201d said Marie Roselore Auborg, the minister for commerce and industry in the Grand Anse department, where J\u00e9r\u00e9mie is the capital. \u201cThis storm leveled all of the potential we had to grow and reboot our economy.\u201dHurricane Matthew\u2019s toll in Haiti has been hard to measure: the deaths and injuries, the number of people still stranded, the cases of cholera contracted in the week since winds of 145 miles an hour blew the country back to a tragically familiar state of disaster.So, too, is the economic impact of the devastation on the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.For J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, isolated and underdeveloped for decades, recent history had been relatively kind, bringing new hotels and a robust coffee crop. But as so often in the past, whenever Haiti tries to pick itself up, something always seems to knock it back down, including, and perhaps especially, the forces of nature.\u201cIn 2010, before the earthquake, we had a growth rate of 5.7 percent,\u201d said Jude C\u00e9lestin, a presidential candidate who toured the devastated area on Sunday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in J\u00e9r\u00e9mie. It was going up. People from Port-au-Prince were investing here.\u201dAs a crowd shouted in the background, trying to get closer to the candidate in the scrum, Mr. C\u00e9lestin looked around at the homes stripped to their foundations and the mounds of refuse piled up to his shoulders.\u201cAnd now, this,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s the way it is.\u201dThe vista in J\u00e9r\u00e9mie was a familiar one, of devastation more profound than the sum of its parts. Fetid water pooled along the only entrance and exit from the town, and just about everything on the wind-strafed hillsides had been leveled \u2014 trees, houses, cellphone towers. Helicopters and convoys of sport utility vehicles descended on the city on Sunday, choking it with traffic after the highway, blocked for the better part of a week, was reopened.Collecting the dead in J\u00e9r\u00e9mie has become a cruel pastime. The government tally for all of Grand Anse was up to 191 on Sunday, but locals put the figure closer to 450, and the grim work of counting the dead has only begun. New outbreaks of cholera were reported in stretches of the south that were still inaccessible by road, and dozens of victims were said to be making their way to hospitals on foot to seek care.In J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, cholera may be one of the hurricane\u2019s worst aftereffects. Of all departments in Haiti, Grand Anse has the least access to fresh water and modern sanitation, according to the World Bank. The smell of feces and soured storm water filled the streets closest to the city\u2019s waterfront, a recipe for a sustained crisis.For now, though, residents were more focused on the immediate problem of shelter.Gary Guerrier, 36, a schoolteacher, saw the storm rip the metal roof off his house, leaving him, his wife and their week-old baby daughter exposed to the elements. After being driven back twice by the raging winds, he finally wrapped the infant in a bundle of bedsheets to protect her for the journey to a neighbor\u2019s house.\u201cI\u2019m still in a state of shock,\u201d Mr. Guerrier said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky we didn\u2019t lose anyone. But as for material things, I lost everything.\u201dHouses in Beaumont, a town on the outskirts of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, fared even worse. Constructed of white stones and red earth, they were no match for the winds and pounding rain, and few were left standing among the felled coffee plants and orange trees after the storm passed.Residents farther up in the hills were still hunting for family members, while those along the lower rungs of the mountain had already interred their loved ones.The storm killed hundreds of people and left a path of destruction in western Haiti. Entire towns were turned into a mix of mud and debris.\u201cWe found my father in his home, suffering several broken bones,\u201d said Desir Luckner, 49, pointing to what remained of the house \u2014 a concrete foundation with one timber beam still upright. \u201cWe carried him down the hill to find help, but he died on the way.\u201dFor all the shattered lives, the city of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie was bustling on Sunday. Vendors squeezed between the wreckage on the roadsides, selling bread patties and overpriced spring onions magically procured from somewhere. A few businesses were operating, mostly out of necessity, to begin earning back what was lost.Claudia St. Louis opened her small bakery, selling comparettes, a local sweet bread, to those who could pay.\u201cI lost my home, but I have to keep going, because it\u2019s my livelihood,\u201d she said, swatting at bees whose hive had been crushed during the storm. \u201cThere will be fewer people to buy these now, but there is nothing to be done about it.\u201dMs. St. Louis said her business had been booming before the storm, with sales up 50 percent in the last year, and she was planning to expand into other baked items and perhaps even open a cosmetics shop as well.\u201cI can\u2019t do that now,\u201d she said.The head of the chamber of commerce in Grand Anse, Monode Joseph, said the situation would be dire for a while. Along with the stores, hotels and small restaurants that gave the city its ambience, the farmers of the region were struggling, he said.Mr. Joseph traveled to Port-au-Prince, the national capital, after the storm to ask investors to keep supporting the coffee planters and bean farmers of the region as they tried to restore their land and start over.\u201cThe people were beginning to better organize themselves, which was increasing our business,\u201d and he persuaded the investors only last year to put in more capital, Mr. Joseph said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to get the credit we need now.\u201dWithout that money, he said, the repercussions for farming will be catastrophic: \u201cWe don\u2019t even know everything that\u2019s been lost.\u201dAn article on Oct. 11 about damage in Haiti from Hurricane Matthew misspelled, at one point, the surname of a schoolteacher who led his family to safety. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Gary Guerrier, not Gurrier. The key to a map with the continuation of the article reversed the symbols for destroyed buildings and damaged ones. Black dots marked the destroyed ones and white dots represented the damaged ones.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 May Hurt Britain Where It Thrives: Science and Research", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 When Adam Durant started his company analyzing climate-related threats to aircraft, he and his team of researchers symbolized the possibilities offered by the European Union.Soon after graduating from college, Mr. Durant received a prestigious European Union grant to study atmospheric chemistry and conduct climate-related research. When he started his business, he hired staff members from Belgium and France without having to sponsor their visas.But since Britain voted in June to leave the bloc, Mr. Durant has become the archetype of something very different: a nervous entrepreneur, unsure about future funding and even considering leaving the country.His worries mirror those of the British business community at large, and the concerns appear to be weighing on the country\u2019s economy.Technically, nothing has changed since the referendum. But a vast number of questions remain, including the shape of Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the European Union and the long-term rights of European nationals now working in the country.The widespread uncertainty, and the challenges that arise from it, are acutely felt in the scientific community, dependent as it is on long-term funding, cross-border mobility and international collaboration.\u201cIt\u2019s probable that the opportunities that existed pre-Brexit won\u2019t exist next year,\u201d Mr. Durant, 37, said. \u201cThings are becoming more difficult.\u201dBritain has long been a global leader in scientific research because of world-class universities that produce top scientific papers.In particular, the country excels at health sciences and advanced engineering, areas that have thrived partly because of factors tied to Britain\u2019s membership in the bloc.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Though much of the debate before the referendum focused on Britain\u2019s financial payments to the European Union, the science sector has unquestionably benefited from membership, receiving net contributions of 3.4 billion euros, or about $3.7 billion, from a variety of European Union programs from 2007 to 2013.European Union money accounted for 40 percent of funding for cancer research in Britain over the last decade, according to Digital Science, a consulting firm based in London. In nanotechnology research, that figure is 62 percent, and in evolutionary biology, it is 67 percent.Those resources have plugged the gap in falling British government funding, adjusted for inflation, and low levels of investment from Britain\u2019s private sector, figures from Digital Science show. British businesses contribute the equivalent of 1.06 percent of their country\u2019s gross domestic product toward research and development, 80 percent less than what German companies contribute toward research and development in Germany.The country has also attracted talent from across Europe. That is largely because of the relative ease of doing business in Britain, coupled with ecosystems developed around top universities, and that the bloc\u2019s free movement of labor means no citizen of a European Union member country requires a visa to work in Britain.Around 30,000 scientists and researchers from member states are employed by British universities \u2014 equivalent to 20 percent of their teaching and research staff \u2014 and a full 60 percent of research papers in Britain are written with partners in the European Union.All of those factors are crucial to Mr. Durant and his fledgling business.After getting his degree, he went on to obtain a Ph.D. In 2007, he received a Marie Curie Fellowship, which finances research across the bloc. Then, after the eruption in 2010 of an Icelandic volcano that disrupted global air travel, he started Satavia.The company was founded in 2013 with initial funding of \u20ac500,000 from the European Space Agency \u2014 which is partly funded by the European Union and works closely with the bloc \u2014 along with a promise of up to \u20ac4 million more. Satavia, which helps aircraft detect threats like ice and volcanic ash, now employs four scientists in Cambridge.\u201cEuropean funding has been critical to the success\u201d of the company, Mr. Durant said.But shortly after the Brexit vote, he was turned away from a research network involving European partners. He has since stopped writing research proposals because of the uncertainty. He is even considering moving Satavia\u2019s headquarters from Britain.His experience is not unique.C-Tech Innovation, a company focused on energy efficiency and renewables that is involved in 15 energy and biotech projects funded by the European Union, has similar worries.The company has 44 employees and is based in the northern town of Chester. Without the funding, its model \u201cwould not operate,\u201d said Rob Bell, C-Tech\u2019s director of research and innovation. Businesses tend to shy away from the early stages of a technology because of the high risk involved, Dr. Bell explained, and that gap is generally plugged by European money.Some companies are already moving, like Herba Invest, a small drug company in southern England that is relocating to Spain.Across the industry, 40 foreign researchers have turned down positions or are thinking of doing so, while another 100 are planning to leave Britain or have already left, according to Scientists for E.U., a British group that is campaigning to keep the country in the bloc. In all, it has logged 371 such \u201cadverse effects.\u201dThough those figures may be low, some worry they may be a harbinger of things to come.There are also fears that the European Medicines Agency, which has overseen regional drug approvals since 1995 from its offices in London, could move to the Continent once Britain leaves the European Union, and drug companies could follow suit to streamline the regulatory process.Some research outfits also worry they will lose access to European researchers.\u201cMobility of people drives the issues and with that the mobility of ideas, of investment,\u201d said Keith Burnett, vice chancellor of the University of Sheffield, a major recipient of European Union grants, particularly in evolutionary biology, physics and astronomy. Building a scientific community, he said, is like building a city.A lot will depend on how the government of Prime Minister Theresa May negotiates for Brexit.It has so far given assurances that it would safeguard the scientific community\u2019s funding, at least through 2020. Supporters of Brexit have also said that the government can use money that would otherwise have been sent to Brussels on scientific research.She has said that Britain would not accept the bloc\u2019s rules that allow the free movement of labor. And despite pledges of financial support from pro-Brexit politicians, promises have been made to spend on causes that have broader appeal, like Britain\u2019s National Health Service. An expected slowdown in economic growth could also hurt tax receipts, putting still more pressure on the budget.But not everyone is downbeat. Some are even raising their bets, like the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, which has said it will invest 275 million pounds, or $341 million, in Britain.Darrin M. Disley, the chief executive of the Horizon Discovery Group, a biotech company in Cambridge, supported Britain remaining in the European Union. But even after the result, he said the country could find new opportunities further afield.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got the innovation, the right links to universities, the right links to industry, the right entrepreneurial environment, the right funding, that\u2019s an outstanding recipe,\u201d he said.\u201cThe concern is will the government fill the gap in funding?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Chinese Women Still Can\u2019t Get a Break", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byOpinionBEIJING \u2014 On a Saturday afternoon in late September, I sat in the brand-new auditorium of my former high school in Beijing, watching the gala for my 10-year reunion. Near the end, teachers stepped onto the stage to deliver speeches.\u201cGirls, I hope you will focus on finding your life partners,\u201d said the Chinese-language teacher, with the same stern air as when she urged us to succeed on the college entrance exam. \u201cMarriage cannot be delayed,\u201d the biology teacher said. The physical education teacher offered to set up single alumnae with eligible bachelors at her husband\u2019s company.At the dinner afterward, the conversation at my table turned to career changes. A friend surprised everyone by announcing that she would move to Shenzhen, a southern city, to look for a new job. Marveling at her courage but concerned about her decision, another classmate asked if she was aware of the \u201ccomplications\u201d faced by a childless woman seeking employment in her late 20s.My female classmates and I, beneficiaries of China\u2019s economic boom, are cruising along exciting professional paths. Yet the country\u2019s shifting social conditions carry more complex implications for our lives than first meets the eye. Social changes that have given urban Chinese women new liberties and ambitions often impede our freedom in other ways, erasing policies and ideologies that had helped diminish gender differences.What are the barriers or opportunities you\u2019ve experienced?Decisions about having children can serve as leverage for women in domestic bargaining. This power is amplified by the government\u2019s recent move to scrap the one-child policy and allow all couples to have two children. And sometimes women resort to extraordinary measures to share in homeownership.Two years ago, the elderly couple who lived next door with their son and daughter-in-law unexpectedly traded their spacious apartment for two humbler dwellings. I later learned that the young woman had been refusing to conceive until her husband\u2019s parents gave her a home of her own.But the overall impact of these social changes on women\u2019s work-family choices is distressing.Housework and child-rearing have always fallen on women\u2019s shoulders, even during the Mao era, when women were held up by the government as men\u2019s equals. Their responsibilities increased in the reform period, beginning in early 1980s, as the state rolled back child care support and the middle class began to invest in early-childhood education. In the meantime, women also began to pursue careers of their choosing, and to compete with men under the new rules of the market economy.While many mothers, like my own, managed to juggle their domestic duties and professional tasks with remarkable grace, the demands on women without significant spousal support or social policy protection create an impossible balancing act.\u201cRaising two children in Beijing would definitely cost me my job,\u201d a friend who works in marketing at Google in Beijing confessed to me, explaining why she would not take advantage of the end of the one-child policy.Also daunting is the widespread pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. \u201cA woman used to have an easy time finding a job after she had given birth once,\u201d said a classmate at my high school reunion. \u201cNow employers have reasons to worry twice.\u201dBut the decree merely reflected what was already taking place. Married couples care for their elderly parents in most urban families, studies show, with the bulk of the responsibilities falling on women. Wives are often expected to care for their own parents as well as their husbands\u2019.A few days ago, a female acquaintance who works in a state publishing house told me, matter-of-factly, that she had rejected a well-qualified female job applicant for an editor position because the woman, being single at 36, clearly \u201chas severe personality flaws\u201d or \u201cpsychological issues.\u201dIn 2013, a 23-year-old female college graduate from Beijing filed a lawsuit against a tutoring firm for turning down her job application. The company rejected her, she explained to the news media, because it said that the post of executive assistant required a man, someone who could carry out physical tasks such as refilling the bottle on a water dispenser.\u201cFinally someone is standing up to protest,\u201d said the woman\u2019s lawyer.Helen Gao is a social policy analyst at a research company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Glut? Here Comes Some More!", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 Global oil markets are flooded with cheap crude, and concerns about climate change are growing louder. The last thing the world seems to be craving is the discovery of new large oil and natural gas fields.But such fields have been found in the last month. And two of them are in the United States \u2014 one in Texas and the other off Alaska.The new finds, while still preliminary and in need of more testing, could further cement two realities of the energy business: oil prices could stay low for a long time, and oil companies will keep seeking to increase their reserves for future production.The discoveries have been hailed by the oil industry, even though companies have largely cut back on exploration over the last two years in an effort to reduce costs as oil prices fell from over $100 a barrel to roughly $50 a barrel. Along with that enthusiasm is the view that prices will recover by the end of the decade.In addition, some of those experts say demand for oil will never fully recover because of the emergence of electric cars and conservation measures.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\u201cIn today\u2019s energy world, there is a distinctive clash between those who are pushing forward technologies to keep oil and gas squarely under the ground and those who are deploying capital to ensure that there is enough oil and gas if we stay with the internal combustion engine that we have today,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, director for energy and sustainability at the University of California, Davis.\u201cIn the short term,\u201d she said, \u201cboth sides are going to have victories but, in a long time scale, my belief is we will transition away from oil and gas.\u201dThe new discoveries now fall into the center of that debate. On Tuesday, Caelus Energy announced it had found a field in the shallow waters off the North Slope in Alaska that could produce as much as 2.4 billion barrels of oil, more than half the reserves of Ecuador, an OPEC producer.A few weeks earlier, Apache Corporation said a long-overlooked field in West Texas contained at least three billion barrels of oil and 75 trillion cubic feet of gas.Together, the discoveries are relatively modest compared with the new-field production earlier in the decade from shale fields opened up by hydraulic fracturing \u2014 the high-pressure mix of water, sand and chemicals that blasts hard oil-bearing rocks. But some analysts say they could well be precursors to more discoveries in West Texas and Arctic Alaska.Both companies began plowing money into exploring their prospects before the price of oil collapsed, and their new fields may have economic advantages lacking in other places. They have ample existing pipeline networks to take products to market, for example.The Caelus find is in Alaska state waters, giving the state government a strong incentive to encourage drilling to earn royalty and tax benefits and to aid the state\u2019s slumping economy. Under Alaska law, new oil production does not have to begin to pay taxes until North Slope oil prices reach $73 a barrel \u2014 more than $20 above current prices.Apache took advantage of the low oil prices to quietly buy 350,000 acres of drilling rights for as little as $1,300 an acre in an area that is adjacent to the giant Permian Basin oil fields but has long been overlooked. Acreage in the Permian Basin can cost nearly 40 times that much.Apache explored its new find, called the Alpine High, at a time when it was cutting back investments in exploration and production elsewhere and selling off assets to raise cash.\u201cOur discovery is a testament to American ingenuity,\u201d said John J. Christmann IV, Apache\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThrough technology and innovation, the oil and gas industry continues to innovate and find opportunities even in mature areas like the Permian Basin.\u201dCaelus, a private firm backed by the private equity fund Apollo Global Management, reported that it based its resource claim on two exploration wells and 126 square miles of three-dimensional seismic testing. It said that the field could produce 200,000 barrels a day of oil, more than 60 percent of what Alaska\u2019s giant Prudhoe Bay field currently produces.The discovery has particular significance for Alaska, whose production has declined steadily since 1988, when Prudhoe Bay\u2019s 1.6 million barrels a day of production was the backbone of the American oil industry. Alaska missed out on the doubling of national oil production between 2006 and 2014, a rise that resulted mostly from a drilling frenzy in shale fields in other states.\u201cThis discovery could be really exciting for the state of Alaska,\u201d Caelus\u2019s chief executive, James C. Musselman, said in a statement. \u201cIt has the size and scale to play a meaningful role in sustaining the Alaskan oil business over the next three or four decades.\u201dThe new discoveries have also reinforced the confidence within the industry that the United States will remain a major oil power \u2014 capable of producing substantial amounts for itself and exporting major quantities around the world.\u201cI definitely believe that finding a lot of oil is going to give us national security,\u201d said Melvin Moran, manager of Moran Oil Enterprises in Oklahoma. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn back.\u2019\u2019Meaningful amounts of oil will probably not be produced from the two fields for at least several years. Caelus has said that it needs to build a 125-mile pipeline, at a cost of $800 million, to attach production from its new find to existing pipelines.Still, the two finds are good news during hard times for the industry.Last year, American petroleum producers wrote down $177 billion in assets, according to a recent report by IHS Energy, a leading consulting firm. A new report by the international law firm Haynes and Boone noted that 102 American and Canadian oil and gas producers have filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2015, involving more than $50 billion in debts. As of Sept. 7, 58 producers had filed for bankruptcy this year.Industry executives express skepticism that the countries will succeed in getting commitments from individual members to cut production. They add that even if there is a final agreement, cheating by many countries can be expected.Already there are signs that Libyan exports are growing, and there is little hope that Iran will curb its production and exports now that nuclear sanctions have been lifted.But oil executives also note that with the industry cutting investment in exploration and production by $250 billion last year, and $70 billion more this year, it is only a matter of time before demand outstrips supplies and prices rise again significantly, although not until 2018 to 2020 at the earliest. That is when more oil will need to be available, from Texas, Alaska and other places.\u201cYou do need new discoveries to feed the supply system,\u201d said Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas producer. \u201cWe have very little supply coming on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Were He Seeking Any Other Job, Trump Would Be Flagged by H.R.", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byDealBookDonald Trump describes himself as a businessman. And he says he wants to run the government more like a business.But would any business hire Mr. Trump?It isn\u2019t a trivial question. Given the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s vulgar boasts about sexually assaulting women and trying to coerce a woman to commit adultery with him \u2014 among other things \u2014 it is hard to believe he could get past the human resources department of a Fortune 500 company.Over the last decade, much of corporate America has put in place strict policies to deal with sexual harassment and other offensive behavior, trying to make amends for an abhorrent history of letting such conduct go unchecked (remember \u201cMad Men\u201d?). Hiring procedures at large companies, particularly for senior positions, include extensive background checks, which typically include interviewing former colleagues and combing through articles, court records and, yes, social media.Thousands of employees have been fired or pushed out for using far less repugnant language than Mr. Trump\u2019s words about how he gropes women.Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest employer, with some 2.2 million employees, has explicit policies, for example, that prohibit \u201csexually explicit language, off-color jokes, remarks about a person\u2019s body\u201d as well as \u201cusing slurs or negative stereotyping,\u201d \u201cverbal kidding, teasing or joking\u201d and \u201cintimidating acts, such as bullying or threatening.\u201dBy those definitions, it is not clear if Mr. Trump would qualify to be hired as a janitor, let alone a senior executive. A spokesman for Walmart, asked whether Mr. Trump\u2019s comments would disqualify him from employment there, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a policy of not entertaining hypotheticals.\u201dMr. Trump has apologized for his language, which he described as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d But he used the language while on the job; he was recorded on a live microphone while working to promote \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d his popular reality show.Many actors\u2019 and \u201ctalent\u201d agreements include a \u201cmorality clause\u201d that explicitly makes using such language a fireable offense. Here\u2019s the standard, boilerplate language that\u2019s often included in such agreements, according to a sample published by Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law: \u201cThe actor shall not commit any act or do anything which might tend to bring actor into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which might tend to reflect unfavorably on the network, any sponsor of a program, any such sponsor\u2019s advertising agency, any stations broadcasting or scheduled to broadcast a program, or any licensee of the network.\u201dBy that definition, an employer might be able to use Mr. Trump\u2019s catchphrase: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201dJack Welch, the former chief executive of General Electric, which owned NBC when Mr. Trump started \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d was an impassioned supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign before the lewd comments were made public. Afterward, he took to Twitter to say, \u201cParty must change nominee now.\u201dMr. Trump says the country has become \u201ctoo politically correct.\u201d His surrogates, like Rudy Giuliani, have defended him by saying he shouldn\u2019t be held accountable because he wasn\u2019t running for president when he made those statements over a decade ago.But times have changed. The days of corporate America and Wall Street as swashbuckling, cigar-chomping, liquor-swilling \u2014 and female harassing \u2014 playgrounds \u00e0 la the 1980s and \u201990s are long over. Susan Antilla wrote a book, \u201cTales From the Boom-Boom Room: Women vs. Wall Street,\u201d that chronicled a pattern of horrific behavior at Smith Barney. The tale ended with $150 million in awards and settlements.Mr. Trump says his words were just words, and that he has never assaulted any women.Still, that\u2019s not the standard to qualify for a job \u2014 either in the private sector, or as the highest official in the land.\u201cIt would be a significant risk for a Fortune 500 company to bring in someone like this,\u201d said Tom Spiggle, a former prosecutor who is now a discrimination lawyer who has sounded the alarm about Mr. Trump on social media. \u201cIt could be a tremendous liability,\u201d he added.Lawyers say that hiring Mr. Trump now could pose huge problems for a company because if an employee were to ever accuse him of harassment, his earlier comments could be used not only to show a pattern, but also that the company was aware of the issue when it signed him on. \u201cWe have these statements,\u201d Mr. Spiggle said, adding that if he were litigating such a case, \u201cWe\u2019d use them all day long.

{"Headline": "Another Ryder Cup Rookie Is Bedeviling the Americans", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byOn GolfCHASKA, Minn. \u2014 The Europeans unleash a rookie at every Ryder Cup and sic him on the Americans. This year\u2019s fresh-faced foe is Thomas Pieters, a lanky, 24-year-old Belgian who made the team as a captain\u2019s pick.Pieters has a record of 3-1-0 heading into Sunday\u2019s singles matches at Hazeltine National Golf Club. He is the latest in a long line of non-American rookies to perform in the Ryder Cup as if born for the big stage.Phil Mickelson, one of Pieters\u2019s victims on Saturday, could be forgiven if he looked at him and saw Nicolas Colsaerts, Philip Walton, Phillip Price and Ignacio Garrido \u2014 resplendent rookies from Europe who had tripped up American opponents over the years.The mild-mannered Pieters morphs into an animated character on the course. When he flexed his scrawny arms during a 4-and-2 victory with Rory McIlroy in their foursomes match against Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, Pieters resembled Sheriff Woody from the movie \u201cToy Story.\u201d If he had opened his mouth and Tom Hanks\u2019s voice had come out, nobody would have blinked.Pieters\u2019s favorite deputy is McIlroy, 27, under whose tutelage he has thrived. Their 3-0-0 collaboration began with a four-ball victory Friday afternoon against Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar, and it culminated Saturday afternoon with another four-ball tour de force. In dispatching Johnson and Brooks Koepka by 3 and 1, Pieters and McIlroy played the front nine in seven under par. They never trailed in 49 holes spread over three matches.The fans in Minnesota did not react kindly to the pair\u2019s dominance. A few hecklers took their frustrations out on McIlroy, and as the comments grew coarser, he became more focused. If the fans wanted to throw McIlroy off his game, they would have been better off showering him with love. The unruly crowd, he said, \u201cfueled me a lot.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe more they shouted, the better we played.\u201dPerhaps because he expended so much energy quieting the crowd, McIlroy faded in the stretch, but Pieters was there to pull him along. At Nos. 15 and 16, Johnson and Koepka won consecutive holes for the second time in the match to whittle their opponents\u2019 lead to 2-up.Pieters responded with a match-clinching birdie at 17. With the point, the Europeans moved into a tie with the United States in the overall score, 6 \u00bd to 6 \u00bd. (The Americans won the final three four-ball matches to take a 3-point lead into the Sunday matches.)\u201cI sort of disappeared for the last few holes,\u201d McIlroy said, \u201cand Thomas took over.\u201dPieters, who stood shoulder to shoulder with McIlroy as they were interviewed, grinned. In sentences and in strokes, he is a man of economy. Asked how he felt about his performance, Pieters said, \u201cI feel fine, thank you.\u201dPieters and McIlroy were the first pair that the European captain, Darren Clarke, sent out Saturday, and Pieters gave the Europeans an early psychological lift when he followed a 25-foot birdie putt by Fowler with an 18-foot putt to halve the first hole. But he did not stop there. He put his forefinger to his lips to shush the crowd in imitation of Patrick Reed, who used the same gesture in Scotland as a Ryder Cup rookie on enemy soil in 2014.A fired-up McIlroy brought his finger to his lips in sync with Pieters, whose exuberance made Mickelson smile as he walked off the green. In 2014, after the Americans\u2019 third consecutive loss, Mickelson, an 11-time team member, pushed for an overhaul of the United States\u2019 Ryder Cup system. It involved fine-tuning how the players and support crew were chosen, giving more input to the team members. A task force was created, which McIlroy mockingly called \u201cthe best task force ever, that\u2019s for sure.\u201dIn a conscious effort to create camaraderie, the Americans have been reading one another\u2019s putts here. They also picked some of their two-man teams well in advance. In contrast to Mickelson\u2019s shotgun pairings of the past, he knew that he would be teamed with Fowler in foursomes well ahead of this event, affording them time to synchronize their games.For the Americans, it was bond or bust. The Europeans, meanwhile, seemed to forge connections effortlessly. Consider how McIlroy and Pieters settled on who was going to hit first at No. 1 in their Saturday foursomes match. They eschewed the analysis embraced by the Americans and opted for a simple coin toss.Pieters, who is 6 feet 5 inches and 176 pounds, finished fourth at the Rio Olympics and has won three times on the European Tour. He is one of six rookies on the European squad \u2014 and the only one on either side to have played in every session. (He lost his Friday foursomes match with the 10-time team member Lee Westwood, who was not in form.)\u201cThomas is the real deal,\u201d said Clarke, who also described Pieters as the most talented young player in men\u2019s professional golf since McIlroy.Pieters hardly came out of nowhere. He attended college roughly 500 miles from Hazeltine, at the University of Illinois. As a sophomore, he defeated a field that included Jordan Spieth, a member of the current American team, to win the 2012 N.C.A.A. Division I men\u2019s individual title.For the Europeans, less conscious thought seems to equal more success.\u201cI didn\u2019t really have any expectations,\u201d Pieters said. \u201cI just came here to have fun, to be a team player, and it\u2019s been great.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Dangers of Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byThis is a challenging thing to explain because Trump is, among recent American politicians, sui generis. The mistakes and blunders that an establishment liberal like Clinton is likely to make can be envisioned by looking at peers like Angela Merkel, at recent occupants of the White House, at Hillary\u2019s own record. But there are no obvious analogues for a President Trump; all the comparables, from Arnold Schwarzenegger to Silvio Berlusconi, only reflect part of what we would get with the Republican nominee as a superpower\u2019s president.So considering the dangers of Trump requires a grounded speculation, which is what I\u2019ll attempt here. These are not my worst-case scenarios: They do not involve Trump making baldly authoritarian moves or accidentally touching off nuclear war. Rather, they\u2019re three baseline dangers for a Trump administration, three perils that we would very likely face.The second peril is major civil unrest. Some of Trump\u2019s supporters imagine that his election would be a blow to left-wing activists, that his administration would swiftly reverse the post-Ferguson crime increase. This is a bit like imagining that a President George Wallace would have been good for late-1960s civil peace. In reality, Trump\u2019s election would be a gift to bad cops and riot-ready radicals in equal measure, and his every intervention would pour gasoline on campuses and cities \u2014 not least because as soon as any protest movement had a face or leader, Trump would be on cable bellowing ad hominems at them.The third likely highly-plausible peril, and by far the most serious, is a rapid escalation of risk in every geopolitical theater. It\u2019s probably true that Trump, given his pro-Russia line, would be somewhat less likely than Clinton to immediately stumble into confrontation with Vladimir Putin over Syria. But it\u2019s silly to imagine Moscow slipping into a comfortable d\u00e9tente with a President Trump; Putin is more likely to pocket concessions and keep pushing, testing the orange-haired dealmaker at every opportunity and leaving Trump poised, very dangerously, between overreaction and his least-favorite position \u2014 looking weak.There is no algorithm that can precisely calibrate how to weigh global instability against the reasons that remain for conservatives to vote for Trump. No mathematical proof can demonstrate that the chance of a solidly-conservative Supreme Court justice isn\u2019t worth a scaled-up risk of great power conflict.But I think that reluctant Trump supporters are overestimating the systemic durability of the American-led order, and underestimating the extent to which a basic level of presidential competence and self-control is itself a matter of life and death \u2014 for Americans, and for human beings the world over.I may be wrong. But none of my fears (and I have many) of what a Hillary Clinton presidency will bring are strong enough to make me want to run the risk of being proven right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank\u2019s Appetite for Risk Throws Off Its Balance", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byThe global banking giants \u2014 think of JPMorgan Chase or HSBC \u2014 make a nice return by capturing their share of the trillions of dollars that course through financial markets each day.But few are as reliant on this business \u2014 be it swapping currencies, selling bonds or structuring derivatives \u2014 as Deutsche Bank, the giant lender that has made its name not as a home for German savers but as a place for hedge funds and other risk-loving investors to put on some of their boldest financial bets.And that is why its swooning stock price last week set off alarm bells in finance ministries, central bank suites and trading floors from Hong Kong to New York.More than eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shock waves around the world, the fear is whether Deutsche Bank and its highly leveraged balance sheet of 1.6 trillion euros might teeter and set off another bout of financial contagion.There has also been a growing realization that Deutsche Bank, even with its thin cushion of cash, is in much better financial shape than Lehman Brothers was. In a letter to employees on Friday, Deutsche\u2019s chief executive, John Cryan, highlighted the \u201cstrong fundamentals\u201d of the bank.It has \u20ac220 billion, or $247 billion, in ready liquidity, compared with $45 billion for Lehman in 2007, and the bank can also tap central banks in the United States and in Europe for a financial lifeline if need be.That does not mean, however, that traders and regulators will stop fretting about, among other things, the \u20ac42 trillion worth of derivatives that sit on its books, an amount about 11 times the size of the German economy. The market value of that figure, \u20ac18 billion, is a lot lower, but as a headline sum it still scares.More than all other universal banks \u2014 those institutions that collect deposits and also have investment banking businesses \u2014 Deutsche Bank has cultivated bankers with an expertise in conceiving of, promoting and trading some of the most cutting-edge financial instruments around.Its past leader, Anshu Jain, came to the firm in the 1990s from Merrill Lynch and rose to the top through his success in selling derivatives to hedge funds.Long before he became co-chief executive in 2012, Mr. Jain and a loyal cadre of like-minded bankers and traders consolidated power in London (the bank\u2019s headquarters are in Frankfurt), where they established the bank as a behemoth in the markets. Deutsche Bank became one of the few banks large and aggressive enough to put its capital at risk by trading and housing derivatives, securitized mortgages and credit default swaps for those who wanted to deal in them.\u201cWhat makes Deutsche Bank systemic is their sheer size combined with the leverage that is required to stay in the flow and be an intermediary,\u201d said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr., an expert in the structure of financial markets at TABB Group, a consulting firm. \u201cBut as capital becomes more scarce, this becomes a fragile equation.\u201dA simple calculation bears this out. Deutsche Bank has \u20ac67 billion ($75 billion) in equity that supports assets of \u20ac1.6 trillion ($1.8 trillion), which mean it is levered at a ratio of 25 to 1.By comparison, JPMorgan has $224 billion in cash backing $2.4 trillion in assets, which produces a far healthier ratio of 9 to 1.According to the last annual report, Level 3 assets stood at \u20ac32 billion \u2014 about half the amount of the bank\u2019s equity buffer, although that figure has come down sharply in recent years.To get a better sense of how these types of assets ended up on its balance sheet, it is worth taking a closer look at the professional makeup of Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank.In good times this unit of the bank drove its profits. It was also the investment bank that was largely responsible for the $7.5 billion in losses that Deutsche Bank showed last year.Because of new European Union regulations, Deutsche Bank is required to disclose the number of those who take significant risks with the bank\u2019s capital and how much they are paid.Last year, the bank reported that its investment bank employed 1,871 so-called material risk takers, or M.R.T.s as they have come to be known in European regulatory circles, who were paid \u20ac1.7 billion.That was down from a year earlier, when 2,057 M.R.T.s took home \u20ac2 billion.Stuart Graham, a banking analyst with Autonomous Research in London, says that Deutsche Bank has more high-paid risk takers than any other bank \u2014 including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.Barclays, a longtime Deutsche rival, is also a deposit-taking bank that relies on traders to increase revenues. But the British bank reports having just 842 maximum risk takers in its investment bank.While this culture of making big bets with the bank\u2019s cash may have worked in a previous era, in today\u2019s market, where a premium is placed on managing risk as opposed to taking it, such an aptitude becomes a liability.So, even though Deutsche Bank may have a \u20ac220 billion cash cushion, it is this unknown liability that is causing some investors to play it safe and ask for their money back.\u201cIf you are a counterparty, you have to trim back exposure as fast as you can,\u201d said David Hendler, a credit analyst with Viola Risk Advisors.Most analysts believe that Deutsche Bank needs to raise an extra \u20ac5 billion to \u20ac7 billion from investors in order to calm concerns about its financial health, especially in light of the fact that the Justice Department may require the firm to pay a penalty of at least this amount.But there are a few who think that for Deutsche Bank to be able to survive a crisislike atmosphere, it needs a lot more money than that.Robert Engle, an economist at New York University who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on volatility and capital markets, has designed a model that ranks financial institutions in terms of their systemic risk.The barometer takes into consideration leverage, the bank\u2019s stock price and its equity base, and as such it represents a real-time measure of the dangers a bank poses to the financial system at a given moment in time.Global regulators use it as well to complement their own internal models.Other European banks, like BNP Paribas and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, rank closely behind Deutsche Bank in this regard. What sets Deutsche Bank apart from its European and American peers is its reliance on debt, the N.Y.U. model shows.Since September, the bank\u2019s risk, calculated on the basis of its leverage, has increased sharply relative to other comparable institutions, according to the N.Y.U. gauge.\u201cThere is just a lot of risk for Deutsche Bank right now,\u201d Mr. Engle said. \u201cWe have been worried about European banks for quite a while.\u201dAn article on Monday about concerns over Deutsche Bank\u2019s riskier assets misstated a comparison for the amount of derivatives on the German company\u2019s books. The amount \u2014 about \u20ac42 trillion in derivatives \u2014 is equal to about 11 times the size of the German economy; it is not equivalent to the size of the country\u2019s economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The White House Rule: No Tax Returns, No Job", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIf a presidential candidate cannot meet that standard, then we question his qualifications for the highest office in the land.In both the Bush and Obama administrations, a bad attitude about paying taxes was a deal killer. Both of us saw instances of nominations that were doomed by the arguably legal but unsavory use of tax loopholes, as well as by the failure to pay Social Security taxes, the taking of excessive deductions for home offices or the sidestepping of sales taxes on out-of-state purchases. Explaining to the Senate and to the American people how a billionaire could have a $916 million \u201closs carry-forward\u201d that potentially allowed him to not pay taxes for over a decade, perhaps for as long as 18 years, would have been far too difficult for the White House when many hard-working Americans turn a third or more of their earnings over to the government.There is also no fiduciary duty to one\u2019s family to minimize taxes by taking advantage of loopholes. Quite to the contrary, many of us want to set an example that teaches our children the responsibilities as well as the enormous benefits of being an American.Even in large public companies, the argument that there is a fiduciary duty to shareholders to structure deals to minimize taxes is false. The law does not require corporate officers and directors to avoid taxes, much less to aggressively take advantage of strategies to eliminate them for years to come.The final deal killer here is Mr. Trump\u2019s objection to the release of even the limited information that has come out, and his refusal to disclose more. At the White House we asked nominees for Senate-confirmed positions to sign a waiver so we could get tax information from the I.R.S., and we also asked nominees to be ready to provide their tax returns to the Senate upon request. Several of the committees most important to national security and the economy \u2014 such as the Armed Services Committee and the Committee on Finance \u2014 routinely insist on receiving tax returns. Neither of us can recall a single nominee who refused, and with good reason. If the White House were to so much as delay in disclosing the tax returns of a nominee, much less tell the Senate that a nominee did not want to disclose them, the nomination would be dead on arrival.No presidential nominee with Mr. Trump\u2019s tax situation, his years of undisclosed tax returns, and his attitude toward paying taxes could have been approved by the Senate. Indeed, no president would have dared nominate him. All of us should weigh that heavily in assessing Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for the Oval Office.Norman Eisen, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2009 to 2011 and ambassador to the Czech Republic from 2011 to 2014.

{"Headline": "A Great Fight of Our Times", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byThink, for a moment, about the stories that your family likes to tell about itself. They are probably miniature versions of the American story, with progress as the central theme.Maybe your great-grandparents arrived here as striving immigrants, and you now talk about how proud they would be. Maybe you\u2019re the first college graduate or doctor in the family, and your parents brag about you. Maybe your grandparents couldn\u2019t vote because of their skin color \u2014 and then had the thrill of voting for a president with the same skin color.These stories aren\u2019t about only your family. They are also stories of tribal pride \u2014 about Italians, Irish, African-Americans, Jews, Asians, Latinos and others \u2014 that make people feel part of something larger.When progress is the norm, it feeds on itself. People can trust that their own sacrifices will usually pay off. They can endure hard times without becoming cynical and can be generous toward others.Now, imagine a different reality: one in which your family \u2014 or whole community \u2014 had known scant progress for decades.You couldn\u2019t tell stories of upward mobility, because they wouldn\u2019t be true. Instead, you would be frustrated, about hard work gone unrewarded, and anxious, for your future and your children.Such stagnation is the reality for much of the country\u2019s population \u2014 roughly one third by many measures, closer to half by others. Some of the statistics are familiar. But as a group, they\u2019re chilling.This column is my first for the Op-Ed page, which is why I\u2019m devoting it to the great American stagnation. That stagnation is a central challenge of our time.And we don\u2019t feel nearly enough urgency about it.One reason is that many Americans don\u2019t have daily contact with it. College graduates who live in a major metro area \u2014 those who tend to read a national newspaper, to put it another way \u2014 do enjoy a rising standard of living.Obviously, the past year has highlighted the depth and breadth of the frustration. It takes different forms and crosses demographic and political boundaries.The country\u2019s immediate task is to reject Trump \u2014 for each of us to help ensure that his deeply un-American campaign remains un-American. I\u2019d encourage everyone to find one concrete way over the next four weeks to play a part.But rejecting Trump isn\u2019t enough. If that is all we do, Trumpism will return, with a savvier frontman.The real answer has to involve ensuring that a large majority of Americans enjoy a rising quality of life. Doing so means better, more equal schools. It means a tax code less favorable to the rich and, yes, the upper middle class. It means criminal justice reform. It means a bigger emphasis on good-paying jobs.The moral case for a fairer society is clear. But there is also a self-interested case. If the trends continue, the United States will ultimately become a worse place to live, for all Americans, no matter how insulated they may feel today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Protests and Storms Make North Carolina\u2019s Election Year \u2018a Bizarre Experience\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byRALEIGH, N.C. \u2014 With three excruciatingly close races for president, governor and United States Senate after four years of pitched political battles, it is not as if North Carolina needed much more to concoct enticing story lines this election year.There may be no other state with as much to sort through \u2014 or as much at stake this year \u2014 as North Carolina. Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are in a tight battle here, one of the most contested swing states. The governor\u2019s race between Mr. McCrory and his Democratic challenger, Attorney General Roy Cooper, may be the closest in the country, as well as being a sort of referendum on the state\u2019s sharp right turn in recent years. And control of the United States Senate could be determined by an equally close race here between Richard Burr, an incumbent Republican, and his Democratic challenger, Deborah Ross.The presence of the mercurial Mr. Trump atop the Republican ticket is only one of many narrative wild cards in a state where Democrats and Republicans are evenly matched, and where handicapping statewide races is a challenge even in a normal year.\u201cIt has truly been a bizarre experience, to the point where I\u2019m not making any predictions anymore, and generally I\u2019m somebody who looks at the data, sees trends, sees patterns,\u201d said J. Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C. \u201cAnd what I have seen since the beginning of 2016, if not earlier, has basically been a coin toss, at all levels. It\u2019s just astounding to me how bitterly divided this state is becoming, and has become.\u2019\u2019What might tip the balance is anyone\u2019s guess. And the yawning uncertainty is magnified by the fact that many voters here, as in much of the rest of the nation, seem full of passionate intensity \u2014 while others are just not that into their marquee candidates.At lunchtime on Thursday, the first day of early voting here, Fred Ames, 73, was standing in a line of more than 120 voters waiting to cast ballots. His T-shirt had a picture of Mr. McCrory and the words \u201chuman garbage.\u201dHe faulted the governor, who earned a reputation as a moderate in his 14 years as mayor of Charlotte, for failing to stand up to the more conservative Republicans in the Legislature.\u201cEssentially,\u201d Mr. Ames said, \u201che has no backbone.\u201dThe night before, Alan Riley, 57, a cigarette company worker from Timberlake, N.C., was among a pool of North Carolina state fair visitors checking out the pro-Trump and anti-Clinton merchandise at a booth sponsored by the Wake County Republican Party.Mr. Trump has garnered the support of Mr. McCrory and Mr. Burr, and Democrats have relentlessly attacked the Republican incumbents for sticking by him.Turnout is also a chief concern among Republicans. Last week, a couple of big rectangular lapel pins could be found on the desk of Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the state Republican Party. They proclaimed, \u201cRepublicans who stay at home elect Democrats.\u201dMr. Woodhouse, a garrulous, gravel-voiced man, propped a pair of black cowboy boots on the desk, radiating nonchalance. Whether it was feigned was anybody\u2019s guess.\u201cMr. Trump has glommed on to some issues that are very important,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s also viewed uniquely, by voters, as Donald Trump. That means if you like him, you don\u2019t necessarily like every Republican. And if you dislike him, you don\u2019t necessarily like every Democrat. Whether that\u2019s good or bad, I don\u2019t know the answer to that yet.\u201dMr. McCrory seemed annoyed when asked, after his third debate with Mr. Cooper last week, what effect Mr. Trump might have on the governor\u2019s re-election prospects. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. McCrory said. \u201cI have no idea. If you know, let me know, will you? I have no idea.\u201dThe season of Trump seems to be a poor match for Mr. Burr. He is the epitome of an establishment Republican officeholder, after two decades in the House and the Senate, in what is an anti-establishment election for many Republican voters.Many in Washington also view Mr. Burr, 60, as what Mr. Trump would call a \u201clow-energy\u201d politician, a glad-handing, golf-playing insider whose main congressional role \u2014 chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 is not one that garners much appreciation in his home state.Ms. Ross, 53, who most recently served as in-house counsel for the regional transit authority here in the liberal Research Triangle, has managed to outhustle Mr. Burr in fund-raising throughout the year. This is despite outside Republican groups\u2019 coming to Mr. Burr\u2019s aid; the Senate Leadership Fund, run by allies of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, has committed $9 million.But in a thematic inversion of the presidential race, Ms. Ross has taken out ads that are almost Trumpian in their criticism of Mr. Burr as the consummate Washington insider, while Mr. Burr has accused his Democratic opponent for being lax on sensitive issues of sexual assault.His campaign\u2019s television ads say that Ms. Ross, a former state director of the American Civil Liberties Union, opposed the creation of the North Carolina sex offender registry when she was in the state Legislature. (Ms. Ross fought back with an ad featuring the sponsor of the registry bill, who said that she had actually \u201cworked to make it stronger.\u201d)There is a similar inversion in the governor\u2019s race: Mr. McCrory can sound like many national Democrats when he argues that North Carolina has rebounded from the recession in the last four years, with a growing economy and plummeting unemployment. Mr. Cooper, the attorney general since 2001, can sound much like Mr. Trump when he argues that many working- and middle-class people have not benefited from the recovery.The backlash generated international headlines, as businesses canceled expansion plans and big sports leagues \u2014 including the National Basketball Association, the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Atlantic Coast Conference \u2014 moved events elsewhere.Late last week, leaders of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group in Washington, were overseeing rooms full of phone-banking volunteers in Raleigh and Charlotte who urged people to vote for Democrats.But at a crucial moment, Hurricane Matthew appears to have given Mr. McCrory an opportunity to display his crisis-management skills on television. Mr. Woodhouse said that the governor might have also been given a boost by his responses to the protests and riots that followed the Sept. 20 fatal police shooting of a black man, Keith Lamont Scott, in Charlotte, and the unsolved Oct. 16 firebombing of the local Republican headquarters in the town of Hillsborough.At the state fair last week, the Wake County Republican Party was doing a brisk business with its stickers and T-shirts. One of them read \u201cHillary for Prison.\u201d A number of the patrons were wearing Confederate battle flag stickers they had picked up at the Sons of Confederate Veterans booth around the corner.Sapphire Scott, 19, an African-American, stood out among the largely white crowd. As it turned out, Ms. Scott is a supporter of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s. She had come to simply observe the scene \u2014 \u201cjust to see the craziness,\u201d she said \u2014 and, like so many North Carolinians this year, to wonder.Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Paid $2,500 for a \u2018Hamilton\u2019 Ticket. I\u2019m Happy About It.", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewConsumers of goods and services do not typically wish that producers charged higher prices. But that was exactly my desire on a recent trip to New York City.The story begins with a basic mismatch: I am a big fan of theater, and I live just outside Boston. While Boston is a good city for the arts, it is not the mecca that New York is. Unfortunately, I\u2019m in New York only a few times every year. But when my professional or personal life takes me into the city, I always try to squeeze a play into my schedule.That occurred most recently over Columbus Day weekend. I was in New York visiting colleges with my wife and younger son, who is a high school senior. Most colleges don\u2019t give tours on Sunday, so we had Sunday afternoon free \u2014 perfect timing to see a matinee.We had no doubt about what we wanted to see. \u201cHamilton\u201d had received rave reviews from both critics and our friends who had seen it. We had much enjoyed \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d an earlier musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the genius behind \u201cHamilton.\u201d And as an economist, I have always viewed Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary, as one of the most important and intriguing founding fathers.We, however, had no problem getting tickets. Two weeks before our trip, I logged into StubHub, the online ticket marketplace owned by eBay. I found the performance we wanted, located some great seats and within a few minutes was printing our tickets.Now, at this point, some people might object to this price. Terms like \u201cscalping\u201d and \u201cprice gouging\u201d are pejoratives used to demonize those who resell tickets at whatever high prices the market will bear.To be sure, most people can\u2019t easily afford paying so much for a few hours of entertainment. That is indeed lamentable. The arts expand our horizons, and in a perfect world, everyone would have the opportunity to see a megahit like \u201cHamilton.\u201dYet there is another way to view the situation. It was only because the price was so high that I was able to buy tickets at all on such short notice. If legal restrictions or moral sanctions had forced prices to remain close to face value, it is likely that no tickets would have been available by the time my family got around to planning its trip to the city.High prices are a natural reflection of great demand and scant supply. In a free market, in which private individuals can engage in mutually advantageous gains from trade, they are inevitable until demand subsides or supply expands.Yet zero is not, as economists put it, the equilibrium price to see a live performance by Jay Leno. Some of the unemployed who received free tickets tried to turn around and sell them on eBay for about $800. When Mr. Leno learned about this, he objected, and eBay agreed to take down offers to resell the tickets.But why should Mr. Leno have objected? Some unemployed workers, presumably short on cash, thought that the $800 in their pockets was more valuable than an evening of laughs. Similarly, the ticket buyers would voluntarily give up their $800 for a seat. The transaction makes both buyer and seller better off. That is how free markets are supposed to work.The only person made worse off by the sale is, perhaps, Mr. Leno himself. He wanted to be seen performing before an audience of the unemployed. Doing a show for higher-income residents of Michigan might not be viewed as altruistic, even if it left the unemployed better off. In other words, Mr. Leno\u2019s objection to the eBay resale was arguably a rationally self-interested act in that the resale impeded his ability to appear selfless to others and, even, to himself.Although I don\u2019t object to ticket resales above face value, and I think it is pernicious when others do, I was saddened by my \u201cHamilton\u201d transaction in one important way. About 80 percent of what I paid went to the ticket reseller, rather than to Mr. Miranda and his investors.Such a move would surely increase the show\u2019s profitability. From my standpoint as a theater consumer, that\u2019s a good thing. Future talents like Mr. Miranda would find it easier to fund their innovative theater projects. And with more projects funded, those consumers who don\u2019t buy \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets \u2014 perhaps deterred by its uniquely high prices \u2014 would find a greater variety of other shows from which to choose.N.

{"Headline": "Dario Fo, Whose Plays Won Praise, Scorn and a Nobel, Dies at 90", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byHis death was confirmed by his Italian publisher, Chiarelettere.Mr. Fo wrote more than 80 plays, many of them in collaboration with his wife, Franca Rame, who died in 2013, and his work was translated into dozens of languages.He was best known for two works: \u201cAccidental Death of an Anarchist\u201d (1970), a play based on the case of an Italian railroad worker who was either thrown or fell from the upper story of a Milan police station while being questioned on suspicion of terrorism; and his one-man show \u201cMistero Buffo\u201d (\u201cComic Mystery\u201d), written in 1969 and frequently revised and updated in the decades that followed, taking wild comic aim at politics and especially religion.After a 1977 version of \u201cMistero Buffo\u201d was broadcast in Italy, the Vatican denounced it as \u201cthe most blasphemous show in the history of television.\u201dThe church\u2019s attitude toward Mr. Fo had not mellowed a generation later, when he was awarded the Nobel. \u201cGiving the prize to someone who is also the author of questionable works is beyond imagination,\u201d the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano said.Many critics felt differently. \u201cImagine a cross between Bertolt Brecht and Lenny Bruce and you may begin to have an idea of the scope of Fo\u2019s anarchic art,\u201d Mel Gussow wrote in The New York Times in 1983.Basing their art on the tradition of the medieval jester and the improvisation techniques of commedia dell\u2019arte, Mr. Fo and Ms. Rame thrilled, dismayed and angered audiences around the world. Together they staged thousands of performances, in conventional theaters, factories occupied by striking workers, university sit-ins, city parks, prisons and even deconsecrated churches.\u201cWe\u2019ve had to endure abuse, assaults by the police, insults from the right-thinking and violence,\u201d Mr. Fo said in his Nobel lecture.The worst episode occurred in 1973 \u2014 after a Fo play criticizing the police was presented in Milan \u2014 when his wife was kidnapped, tortured and raped by a fascist group later found to have links to members of the carabinieri, the Italian federal police. But Mr. Fo and Ms. Rame riled opponents across the political spectrum.In 1968, Mr. Fo became persona non grata in much of Communist Europe after he withdrew all rights to the performance of his plays in Czechoslovakia to protest the Soviet-led invasion that toppled the reform Communist government there.He and his wife were also repeatedly denied entry into the United States because of their ties to the Italian Communist Party.The couple finally received a brief waiver for the 1984 Broadway opening of \u201cAccidental Death of an Anarchist.\u201dMr. Fo attributed the State Department\u2019s change of heart to the intervention of President Ronald Reagan, a former actor. It was, Mr. Fo said dryly, \u201cthe gesture of a colleague.\u201d Two years later Mr. Fo and his wife were again allowed to visit, this time to make their joint American debut as performers.Mr. Fo was nevertheless often critical of American military and economic might and what he saw as its deleterious impact on the world. Days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he drew considerable attention, and condemnation, for a widely circulated email in which he bluntly wrote:\u201cThe great speculators wallow in an economy that every year kills tens of millions of people with poverty \u2014 so what is 20,000 dead in New York? Regardless of who carried out the massacre, this violence is the legitimate daughter of the culture of violence, hunger and inhumane exploitation.\u201dDario Fo was born on March 24, 1926, in the small northern Italian town of Sangiano. His father, Felice, was a railway stationmaster, socialist and amateur actor, and his mother, Pina Rota, wrote an acclaimed autobiography, \u201cIl Paese delle Rane\u201d (\u201cThe Country of Frogs\u201d), about her peasant family.As a child, Dario would travel in a horse-drawn wagon around the countryside peddling vegetables with his maternal grandfather, who attracted customers by telling them stories spliced with news accounts and anecdotes about local events. Mr. Fo would later do much the same thing onstage.Another important influence was the tragicomic narrative tradition of the glass artisans near his native town.\u201cThey were the old storytellers, the master glassblowers who taught me and other children the craftsmanship, the art, of spinning fantastic yarns,\u201d Mr. Fo recalled in his Nobel speech. \u201cWe would listen to them, bursting with laughter \u2014 laughter that would stick in our throats as the tragic allusion that surmounted each sarcasm would dawn on us.\u201dIn 1940, Mr. Fo moved to Milan to study at the Brera Fine Arts Academy. During World War II, he volunteered for the army but later deserted and went into hiding with the help of his parents, who were active in the resistance.His father helped Italian Jews and British prisoners of war escape into Switzerland by train, while his mother tended to wounded partisans who fought against Mussolini and against the Nazi occupation forces after Mussolini was deposed in 1943.After the war, Mr. Fo became a stage designer and was swept up by the piccolo teatri (small theaters) movement, which emphasized improvised monologues on social issues presented at affordable prices.He met Ms. Rame in 1951 while they were acting in a Milanese theater troupe. They married three years later. Their son, Jacopo, born in 1955, became a left-wing political activist and a prolific writer, best known for his 12-volume \u201cEncyclopedia of Sublime Sex.\u201d Mr. Fo is survived by his son.In the 1950s, Mr. Fo staged productions at the Piccolo Teatro in Milan, though many of them were shut down because of opposition from politicians and the church authorities. He also began writing screenplays for Italian films and occasionally acting in them.In 1962, Mr. Fo was hired by the Italian state television network, RAI, to write, direct and host \u201cCanzonissima,\u201d a long-running variety show that had a different host every year. Working with Ms. Rame, he wrote sketches that introduced biting social commentary to the show.His version of \u201cCanzonissima\u201d was extremely popular, but not with everyone. Sketches that addressed worker safety and other serious issues were censored.After a sketch about the Mafia killing of a journalist was aired \u2014 and condemned by an Italian senator, who told Parliament that \u201cthe honor of the Sicilian people is insulted by the claim that there exists a criminal organization called the Mafia\u201d \u2014 Mr. Fo and Ms. Rame received death threats and were given police protection.A final confrontation over censorship led them to walk off the show, and they were barred from the network for 15 years.Their work became even more politically radical in the 1970s, when they formed the theater group Collettivo Teatrale La Comune. The company presented the premiere of \u201cAccidental Death of an Anarchist\u201d in 1970 and followed it with Mr. Fo\u2019s \u201cFedayin\u201d (1971), a play about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict that included members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the cast.In 1974 they staged \u201cWe Won\u2019t Pay! We Won\u2019t Pay!\u201d (1974), a satire in which housewives, angered by rising prices, steal food from a supermarket and set off events that bring Milan to a standstill.His work brought Mr. Fo increasing fame worldwide over the next two decades, but even so the Nobel Prize came as a surprise to him and his supporters; in their view his eclectic, unorthodox art and his reputation as an onstage jester seemed far removed from the more conventional oeuvre of other literature laureates.But Mr. Fo was grateful, telling the Swedish Academy, \u201cYours is an act of courage that borders on provocation.\u201dThroughout his long career, Mr. Fo encouraged directors in Italy and around the world to tailor performances of his plays to local issues. \u201cA theater, a literature, an artistic expression that does not speak for its own time,\u201d he said in his Nobel lecture, \u201chas no relevance.\u201dAn obituary on Oct. 14 about the Italian playwright Dario Fo misstated the circumstances of his entry into the Italian Army in World War II. He volunteered; he was not conscripted.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Washington Should Stop Militarizing the Pacific", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 Americans often assume that Chinese military aggression is increasing the likelihood of a clash between China and the United States. But many policy makers in Washington ignore that Beijing has good reason to be troubled by the United States\u2019 military footprint in its neighborhood. President Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia \u2014 which includes doubling down on Washington\u2019s already-robust military presence in the region \u2014 further stokes the potential for conflict between China and the United States.If the United States wants to avoid strife in Asia, it should resist antagonizing China by encircling it with ever more military partners and bases.Washington and its allies counter that the American presence in Asia since World War II has stabilized the region, adding that the United States protects smaller countries from China, which seeks to dominate them and flouts international law.As for America\u2019s role as a protector of small states against China, Beijing is quick to point out Washington\u2019s hypocrisy.As the United States military doubles down in Asia, the chances increase that one side will cross a red line. It is easy to imagine, for instance, that China could respond with force to joint American-Japanese naval patrols.That does not mean Washington should abandon its allies. But it should avoid creating extensive, untenable defense agreements.Washington should maintain a manageable number of security commitments and take steps toward balancing power with China in the Western Pacific \u2014 and it should do so while it has the power to shape that balance in its favor. This would not come about through any grand bargain, but would require a gradual shift with clear stages over a long time.The United States should also put more effort into communicating with China in an unprovocative way. American leaders should note when they are expanding the United States military presence in response to allies\u2019 requests, emphasizing Washington is not acting unilaterally. In the case of the its Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the Philippines, for example, Washington should stress it is revitalizing the Mutual Defense Treaty, which was signed in 1951.Washington should also put more focus on developing nonmilitary connections throughout the region. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a good example of how a free-trade agreement can be used to strengthen political ties.A more nuanced approach to the Asia-Pacific region would allow the United States to pursue goals like democracy promotion and secure long-term stability.

{"Headline": "Rethinking Franco-German Relations", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsEuropeans are coming to realize that Brexit is changing Europe. Britain has long been a semidetached part of Europe, but in that capacity it played a crucial role. It was partly a balancing power, partly a therapist for the Franco-German couple that constituted the core of European politics. In Germany and France, it is a common refrain that they each need Britain as a counterweight to the other.The European integration story began in optimism, but now seems mired in misunderstanding and miscommunication. French and German people don\u2019t speak each other\u2019s language, and literally don\u2019t understand one another. That\u2019s not just a linguistic issue; it is one that appears in every political and economic discussion. It also follows that politicians and central banks talk about economics in English, a foreign language in both nations, and so it\u2019s hardly surprising that ordinary people feel excluded and lost.The question Europe currently faces is what kind of shock do France and Germany need to get them to start communicating effectively? There are plenty of challenging issues and bad events to which they might and should respond collectively: from energy and the environment to refugees to the terrorist threats that at first seemed a French peculiarity but have recently hit Germany hard, too.The root of the tension between Paris and Berlin is their different understanding of economics and politics. They each think about the state in contrasting ways. The clash remained beneath the surface as long as there was economic growth, but during the European debt crisis, it erupted into the open.The essence of each national position is easy to describe. The French vision likes to draw on the Anglo-American Keynesian tradition, in which state activity is the great stabilizer. In the French account, the state is good because it provides central planning and management, and large-scale public expenditure is a useful way of getting out of cyclical crises. France\u2019s industrial policy also protects its national champions.By contrast, Germany is skeptical about public-sector interventions; instead, its policy aims to support a broad group of middling-size enterprises rather than pick a handful of winners. German politicians typically worry more about creating moral hazards by featherbedding businesses.A look back at the two countries\u2019 histories reveals that these modern German and French beliefs are not, as many people like to imagine, the outcome of an inevitable destiny or ancient tradition. Their current standpoints are actually a reversal of the dominant beliefs that prevailed in the two countries until the middle of the 20th century.Nineteenth-century France had an economic philosophy largely dominated by the doctrine of laissez-faire, as expounded by the great economists Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat and L\u00e9on Say. At the same time, German thinkers developed the theories of Staatswissenschaft, or political science, and applied them to a broad range of economic and social problems.Then, something dramatic happened. In both countries, the two older traditions became discredited: in Germany, by the disasters of the Third Reich; in France, by the disintegration of the Third Republic after its military defeat and occupation. On both sides of the Rhine, these catastrophes determined a fundamental change of course.The builders of postwar Germany \u2014 above all, the Christian Democrat economics minister (and later, chancellor) Ludwig Erhard \u2014 saw Nazism as the outcome of the older German tradition of thinking. They wanted to establish rules that would curb not only the state\u2019s abuse of power, but any concentration of power.The deeper question that faces both the French and German traditions is whether it is possible to think of a better approach, now that Britain will no longer play the role of broker. Can the institutions of the European Union control and monitor interventionist policy and ensure that it does not simply breed corruption and inefficiency? In what ways can the private sector contribute?Private-sector involvement can clearly bring important public benefits and gains. One obvious example is that free enterprise can help with the task of integrating Europe\u2019s new populations of refugees. There are sound precedents for this in earlier crises: Germany in the aftermath of 1945, and France following decolonization. In both cases, millions of newcomers, employed, generated prosperity and dynamism.Another genuinely European project would be to build new infrastructure to connect local and national energy networks, which would help smooth out the incompatible pricing structures that currently exist in Europe. There would be clear gains from integration. At the same time, the greater diversity of supply there is, and the more market alternatives (including different forms of energy) there are, the more resilient Europe\u2019s energy economy is \u2014 especially against external shocks.Post-Brexit, the European Union has to look as if it can work. It needs a vision, but just as important, it needs to show results. Without that, people in its member states will lose confidence in the idea of the union and in the idea of themselves as its citizens.A challenge like Brexit should elicit neither technical tweaks nor popular despair. Above all, Europeans need persuading as to how productive a crisis can be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Populist Wave Likely to Lift Iceland\u2019s Pirate Party", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byREYKJAVIK, Iceland \u2014 Spain has Podemos. Italy has its Five Star Movement, and Greece its Syriza. Now, the populist insurgency sweeping through Europe is finding a foothold in Iceland, where the Pirate Party, with its pirate flag logo and anarchist leanings, is poised to make big gains in a general election on Saturday.Iceland is one of the most prosperous, equitable and accountable democracies in the world, and has recovered strongly from the 2008 financial crisis. Even so, the nation\u2019s political elite has been far from immune to public anger. Many voters are willing to risk it all by choosing the Pirate Party, which has spectacularly captured a chunk of the Icelandic electorate despite its niche origins as a hacktivist group.\u201cWhen I think about politics in Iceland, it makes me want to vomit,\u201d Sigmundur Knutsson, 62, said in a deli as he ate fermented shark, an Icelandic delicacy. \u201cIt\u2019s all about corruption among a very small elite,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something that is not right. Something smells bad.\u201dThe Pirate Party, best known for its activism over copyright law and the protection of civil liberties, is expected to gain significantly in Saturday\u2019s election. It is riding on a wave of anti-establishment fervor spreading across Europe and the United States, upending traditional politics and fracturing mainstream parties.For the first time in Iceland\u2019s long political history \u2014 its Parliament was founded in 930 \u2014 a dozen parties were jostling for power over this frozen volcanic landmass. Iceland, which is the size of Kentucky, has an electorate of about 260,000, barely enough people to fill three football stadiums.Although support for the Pirates had since fallen by half, opinion polls conducted by Gallup in the run-up to the election showed that they remained the second most popular group after the mainstream, center-right Independence Party, which was in power when Iceland\u2019s economy collapsed in 2008.The Pirate Party is unlikely to win an outright majority, but could still gain enough seats to form part of a coalition in the horse-trading that is likely to follow the election.About 40 percent of Pirate supporters are under 30, and they were pinning their hopes on a party that has promised to install a more inclusive, transparent government.The Pirates have pledged to enhance direct democracy by passing the world\u2019s first \u201ccrowd-sourced constitution,\u201d drafted by Icelandic civilians rather than politicians. Parliament blocked the document in 2013.\u201cWe want to see trickle-down ethics rather than make-believe trickle-down economics,\u201d Birgitta Jonsdottir, 49, the leader of the Pirate Party and a former WikiLeaks activist, said in an interview the day before the election.Sporting sharp black bangs that sliced across her pale brow,Ms. Jonsdottir wore a black dress and black Doc Martens embroidered with red roses, fitting her self-description as an anarchist \u201cpoetician.\u201d (At age 14, she published her first poem, \u201cBlack Roses,\u201d about a nuclear holocaust.)\u201cWe need to reboot politics,\u201d she said in her parliamentary office, next to a strip club on a narrow street. She worked on a laptop covered with a sticker that read: \u201cNational Security Agency Monitored Device.\u201dHer party has granted citizenship to Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who stole a trove of highly classified documents after he became disillusioned with the agency\u2019s reach into the lives of millions of Americans.In Iceland, a nation where internet penetration is among the highest in the world but social media is still a relatively new political tool, a strategist who once worked to help elect Senator Bernie Sanders president of the United States was helping push the Pirate Party\u2019s message through Facebook and Twitter.Winnie Wong, who created the viral political hashtag #FeelTheBern, spent a few months training the Pirates\u2019 tiny media team on how to create viral content, and working with party leaders to improve their media presence. (She said her Icelandic was not good enough to create a Nordic equivalent of the Sanders campaign\u2019s famous hashtag.)\u201cThey needed a bit of structure, and we gave them an intensive training on the mechanisms of what it takes to stage a successful insurgent campaign,\u201d Ms. Wong said in a coffee shop near Hallgrimskirkja, a silvery Lutheran church shaped like a gigantic rocket ship.Soon, videos the party posted on Facebook gathered on average 26,000 views each, she said, equivalent to about 10 percent of Iceland\u2019s voting population.\u201cWe really want them to win,\u201d she said, partly so that the next generation of American lawmakers can draw inspiration from Iceland for a better type of government.Opponents had criticized the Pirate Party as political lightweights with little experience governing. The party focuses on more abstract, esoteric issues like the crowd-sourced constitution, critics say, when most voters are interested in more pressing topics like rising housing prices, student debt, pensions and the effects of climate change.Still, those critics, like Birgir Armannsson, a member of the Independence Party, recognize that the political class shares part of the blame for such strong anti-establishment feeling. His party has been in power since 2013, and it was in the governing coalition in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.\u201cPeople lost confidence in traditional politics, institutions, society,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPeople are still shocked. It\u2019s kind of like post-traumatic stress.\u201dWhen the crisis hit, Icelanders were plunged into debt and banks racked up losses of $100 billion, which amounted to roughly $330,000 for every Icelandic man, woman and child, according to Michael Lewis, the author of \u201cThe Big Short.\u201dSince then, Iceland has rebuilt its economy, thanks in part to booming tourism, becoming something of a model of recovery for crisis-hit countries.\u201cThe economy has been recovering,\u201d Mr. Armannsson said, adding that Iceland has low unemployment, low inflation, low inequality and healthy growth.\u201cYou could say we are well off and our outlook is quite good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut part of the population is still not satisfied.\u201dDespite efforts to remedy past mistakes and improve governance, \u201cwe are still in a political storm in the aftermath of the financial crisis,\u201d Mr. Armannsson said, sounding genuinely puzzled.\u201cThis is a little bit extraordinary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Sense of the Two Candidates\u2019 Plans on Student Debt", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byThe challenge of making higher education more affordable is now front and center in national politics in a way it hasn\u2019t been in recent memory. It was a signature issue that drove Bernie Sanders\u2019s surprisingly successful campaign in the Democratic primaries, and it has mobilized millions of young adults who are starting their careers burdened by debt, and the parents who share that burden.After decades of college tuition rising faster than inflation or middle-class families\u2019 incomes, something had to give. And now looks like that moment: Expect a debate over how to fix the system of providing and paying for higher education in the 115th Congress and in the administration of the nation\u2019s 45th president.To understand that debate, it helps to step back from campaign slogans and look at the underlying economics of higher education \u2014 both the ways it has gone wrong and the various philosophical approaches to fixing it.What makes education different from any other expensive thing people buy? Why is buying a college education so different from, say, buying a car?For one, because education is the path to higher-paying work, society has decided that it\u2019s important to help lower-income people attain it. By contrast, there\u2019s not much case for government intervention to make sure people have access to a nice car. Also, when buying a car, it\u2019s a lot easier to predict whether you\u2019re getting a good deal. You can test-drive the car and read consumer reviews and pretty much know what you\u2019re getting. With a college degree, the payoff \u2014 a more lucrative career \u2014 is distant and uncertain.Finally, for students who must borrow to afford college, private sector lending doesn\u2019t work as well as it does for other types of purchases. With a car loan, collateral can be repossessed if the borrower doesn\u2019t pay. Students have only that uncertain future. If banks were willing to lend to every student who\u2019s in need, the cost \u2014 skyscraping interest rates, loan defaults \u2014 would be too great for an economy that relies on an educated work force. So an entire structure of federally subsidized loans was created to try to fix that market failure.Put all this together and you get a market with some weird flaws. In that sense, higher education is more like health care or housing than autos.A guide to student loans at various universities, and what it takes after graduation to repay that debt.Think of it as a triangle. There is the student who pays tuition for an education. There is the college dispensing the education and collecting that tuition. And then there is the government \u2014 state governments, which provide part of the operating budget of public institutions, and the federal government, which provides Pell grants for low-income students and backs loans for students of all income levels.And once you draw that triangle, the differing approaches of conservative and liberal thinkers to the problem \u2014 and the approach that a President Trump or a President Clinton might pursue \u2014 become clearer.\u201cStudents should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford,\u201d he told a crowd bused in from campuses around the state. \u201cThe debt,\u201d he said, \u201cshould not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.\u201dTo help young graduates pay off their federal loans, his plan would cap repayment at 12.5 percent of their income and eliminate remaining debt entirely after 15 years. The idea is similar in philosophy to what the Obama administration has done: That program caps debt payments at 10 percent of disposable income and any remaining debt is forgiven after 20 years.Pundits immediately took to Twitter to frame Mr. Trump\u2019s plan as \u201cleft of Obama\u201d and more generous (thus potentially more costly to the government). But the devil \u2014 and the politics \u2014 is in the details, and the campaign did not respond to requests for an interview.In Columbus, Mr. Trump also spoke in broad terms about pushing colleges to cut costs more aggressively, particularly by limiting spending on \u201cadministrative bloat.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s not enough incentive for these colleges to cut,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the federal government is going to subsidize student loans, it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their students.\u201d One incentive: threaten to end their endowments\u2019 tax-free status. He also wants to loosen federal regulations, reducing the cost of compliance \u201cso that colleges can pass on the savings to students,\u201d and he wants universities to tap more of their endowment money.On one end, then, Mr. Trump intends to tweak the terms of student lending and use federal funds to make debt burdens more manageable; on the other end, he would use the power of the federal government to force colleges and universities to clamp down on tuition increases.\u201cTrump is essentially trying to deal with the effects of the student loan problem by proposing a new policy somewhat similar to what we have already,\u201d said Mark Huelsman, a senior policy analyst at the liberal think tank Demos. \u201cBut his diagnosis of the root causes are misaligned and incorrect.\u201dThe focus on administrative salaries, he said, neglects the bigger problem: the role that the decline in state government support, especially when measured on a spending-per-student basis, plays in the burdens facing college students. Mr. Trump has mentioned no plans to encourage states to spend more to support their public universities.If Mr. Trump is attacking one linkage in the triangle of students, government and schools, Mrs. Clinton is going after the entire triangle.Her central pledge is for students from families with an income of under $125,000 a year to be able to attend their state school tuition-free. She wants to do it with a mix of carrots and sticks: new federal resources for tuition grants, for example, but ones that would be available only in states that fund public universities at a high level \u2014 an attempt to reverse the drop in per-student state spending over the last decade.Similarly, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposal includes financial penalties for universities that fail to trim costs, reduce tuition and ensure students are able to get good jobs. She wants a contribution from the third corner of the triangle as well, expecting students to work 10 hours a week as part of the debt-free college calculations.\u201cThe problem of rising costs has deep roots,\u201d said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cWe need both new funding and new measures of accountability. Most of all, we need everybody to be part of the solution.\u201dBut every government policy can have unintended consequences. For example, incentives put in place to reward schools that have high graduation rates might, paradoxically, cause schools to refuse admission to lower-income students who are more likely to drop out \u2014 and who most need a college education to lift themselves into the middle class.Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute, raised an additional concern: \u201cWe could design a free tuition regime in which the federal government said, \u2018We\u2019ll pay your tuition at a public college,\u2019 but then states would have a huge incentive to reduce the money they put into their own institutions.\u201dTo some extent, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach echoes the Obama administration\u2019s health care overhaul: In trying to keep existing institutions intact and minimize the financial cost, it ends up being quite complex and creates risks of miscalibration. Incentives for states to increase funding could be too generous, leading to cost overruns, or not generous enough, undermining the goal: to improve the ability of Americans to get an education debt-free.To conservatives, the proposals amount to excessive confidence in the ability of the federal government to micromanage the sprawling higher education system. \u201cThis has kind of been the theme from the left on federal higher education policy, which is: We can make everything better if we just get the formula right,\u201d said Jason D. Delisle, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.There\u2019s a similar argument from the left: that a simpler, blunter federal program to reduce college costs, while more expensive for taxpayers, would prove more effective and longer lasting. To carry forward the Obamacare metaphor, it\u2019s the equivalent of arguing that a single-payer health system \u2014 one where the government funds all health care \u2014 would be better than the current, complex system involving private insurers.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a certain style on the left of doing this sort of policy for a very long time, and I think she\u2019s still kind of caught in the old mode,\u201d said Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education at Temple University and author of \u201cPaying the Price,\u201d a new book about college costs and financial aid. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach focuses so much on targeting aid carefully that it could be less effective at reducing costs for everyone.For a voter deciding between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton based only on how they would approach student debt, the differences are stark. Both set goals of using federal policy to reduce debt burdens for future students, but they adopt different philosophies of government to get there.Do you think that colleges and universities have become bloated spendthrifts and that the government should deploy a set of threats to force cost cutting? Or do you think that states should shoulder more responsibility, and that greater federal control can encourage them, and their colleges, to fix the problem?Whatever the outcome, as long as student debt levels keep rising, so will the political pressure around the issue. Whether meaningful legislation results, of course, is a different question.Neil Irwin is the senior economic correspondent for The Times. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Video Review: VW Dresses Up the Alltrack for the Hard Road", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byDrivenAdding ground clearance, all-wheel drive and rugged Ranger Rick cladding to a station wagon is a well-known path for automotive profit.Volvo turned the ordinary V70 into the XC70 Cross Country. Audi took the A6 and A4 Avant and made the all-road models. Subaru turned the Legacy wagon into the Outback, making the Australian actor-pitchman Paul Hogan eternally grateful in the process.Now it\u2019s Volkswagen\u2019s turn. From the Golf Sportwagen \u2014 yes, the auto formerly known as the Jetta \u2014 comes the Golf Sportwagen Alltrack, a name long enough to cut into this article\u2019s allotted space.In keeping with VW\u2019s overall design ethos, Alltrack comes to this segment down the conservative side of the trail. Its pressed and starched urbane look is less Eddie Bauer, more Banana Republic. The cladding is subtle. Its ride height is raised 1.4 inches over a standard Sportwagen, giving the Suburu Outback a ground clearance advantage of nearly two inches.But less height is not entirely a bad thing. Alltrack\u2019s roof is about 6 inches lower than the Subie\u2019s, making it easier to lash a kayak up top. And the only modest lift job keeps the Alltrack\u2019s center of gravity closer to the standard Sportwagen\u2019s. Go ahead, toss it into turns. It\u2019s fun.I drove an Alltrack during a two-day Volkswagen event in Seattle. Shuttled to Bainbridge Island by ferry, I found that the initial highway miles proved to be quiet and comfortable. That led to miles of gravel road, the kind many owners will navigate. Soft fender liners muffle the din of rocks. A brake torque vectoring system similar to the one on the Volkswagen GTI pulses all four wheels to keep Alltrack\u2019s trajectory true. You\u2019ll feel like a rally-car driver.VW provided a light off-road course to test the wagon. Although this car is hardly a Jeep slayer, there were enough technical challenges to test the Alltrack\u2019s 4Motion all-wheel-drive system. Its front-drive bias automatically and instantly routes power to the rear as needed.Sure, the rugged trail was cherry-picked by the company, but most owners would turn around at the sight of it. Alltrack tackled it like a champ, and the undercarriage never scraped. Trips to the mall should be worry free.The powertrain is a 1.8-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder providing 170 horsepower and 199 pound-feet of torque. Drive modes, including one optimized for rugged conditions, are selectable. For now, Alltrack motors exclusively with Volkswagen\u2019s crisp dual-clutch automatic transmission. A manual is to arrive in early 2017. Both are 6-speeds. All-wheel drive is available on standard Golf Sportwagens for those who want to skip the camping clothes.Mash the throttle and Alltrack is quick enough. I\u2019ll guesstimate 0 to 60 acceleration to be just under 8 seconds. Initially light, the steering heft increases as speed rises. Over all, the driving vibe is stout, polished and refined, as are all VW products built on its new MQB platform.This car feels expensive. But prices begin at $27,770, while top-shelf SEL models rise to more than $35,000 with major options.The E.P.A.-rated fuel economy is 22 city, 30 highway, which is fine. Understand, though, that the Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 and Subaru Forester are slightly more efficient.That brings diesel to mind. That will not be happening with the Alltrack. An acquaintance was impressed during a quick look at this lifted wagon, but VW\u2019s diesel transgressions have somewhat tainted the brand for him. He can\u2019t be alone.Still, the well-crafted cabin will tempt shoppers. Volkswagen\u2019s top-shelf interior materials are unmatched in class. The firm, supportive seats are swathed in faux leather (the good kind, not vinyl). Sturdy interior door releases are not hollow. The improved touch-screen user interface comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A panoramic roof is standard on all but the base model.The back seat will accommodate two average hiking pals. Squeezing in a third means their hiking boots will be dealing with the large drive shaft tunnel. When camping gear is not filling up the decent-size cargo area, a medium-size dog will find it habitable.Volkswagen\u2019s sport utility vehicle lineup is becoming old, so this is the first of three crossovers the company plans to introduce in North America in the next year or so. While Alltrack is not an all-new approach, it\u2019s on the right trail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trumpism After Trump", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byAt times, watching was like rubbernecking a hideous accident. Trump\u2019s was a good performance, performance being the operative word. It was also shot through with viciousness and ignorance. Trump invokes but does not understand the Constitution; he understands a business and a TV show where he can fire anybody, anytime. He knows no other modus operandi, which is why debate is really a misnomer for anything in which he is involved.\u201cYou\u2019re jailed!\u201d Maybe that will be Trump\u2019s next TV act. Call it \u201cThe Warden.\u201d He has demonstrated beyond doubt that the human inclination to bow to an all-powerful master endures.This has been one long, strange trip for the Republican nominee. I don\u2019t think that he can fool all Americans all of the time. Still he\u2019s come a very long way with a single idea: I, and I alone, can channel your anger into an American renaissance. Policies have never really come into the Trump phenomenon. Saviors don\u2019t have policies. They have energy.It now behooves America, whatever the outcome next month, to address that anger mixed with fear. It is widespread. Trump understood this and went to work. He grasped that many people in a polarized America, whipped up by Fox News and ushered into a post-fact world by the antics of the Republican Party, were ready for a straight-talking outsider prepared to offer scapegoats for every frustration. Trump\u2019s has been a single-note campaign; that note is rage. It has been particularly effective against the ultimate insider, Clinton.There is something rotten in the state of the West. It is not one single thing; it is a feeling of downward drift in societies unjustly skewed.People know this. They feel the tectonic plates shifting, not only of America\u2019s place in the world after two wars without victory, but also of production, employment, their livelihoods. Precariousness is the new normal. Everything is visible, including the immense wealth of the rich. Tossed here and there by dimly understood global forces people revert to nativism, nationalism and ethnocentrism \u2014 in a word, to Trumpism.A political counter-disruption is now in full swing from the losers to turbo-capitalism. Its message: We will no longer listen to self-serving elites. Witness Brexit, a revolt fed by lies that delivered disaster.The creative economy is a catchy phrase but in many cases, for those without the education or connections to benefit, what is created is misery. Technology is wonderful when it\u2019s useful but less so when it puts an end to your usefulness. Its whirlwind has left humanity with their heads bowed gazing at desolate little screens.The stooped yearn then to look up and perceive a man who promises deliverance. Trump has been that man. Who cares if he questions Clinton\u2019s stamina one day and says, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up,\u201d the next?He never made any damn sense anyway.His rise is a warning sign.

{"Headline": "Greek Homeowners Scramble as Repossession Looms: \u2018It\u2019s Like a Horror Movie\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byNow he has joined the tens of thousands of Greeks fighting to save their homes as a sudden wave of repossessions has struck this year, prompting mounting protests across Greece.\u201cIt\u2019s like a horror movie,\u201d said Mr. Hanis, 63, who takes antidepressants and sleeping pills to cope. \u201cYou can never relax. I just want to protect my home.\u201dThe country\u2019s creditors have pressed the government to allow the auction of delinquent debtors\u2019 properties, collecting billions of euros that could be used to prop up tottering Greek banks.Greek banks hold 108 billion euros, or about $119 billion, in bad loans, just under half of all loans given out. Of these, 41 percent are delinquent mortgages.The real challenge is to address the problem of bad loans in a way that offers some hope to debtors like Mr. Hanis but does not undermine the banking system.That circle may be impossible to square.The country has been given three international bailouts worth more than \u20ac300 billion over the past six years, but it cannot recover if its banks are foundering.Government officials have insisted that homes are safe. Giorgos Stathakis, the economy minister, said in a statement that \u201cfirst homes are already protected as regards debts to banks.\u201dThe authorities, he added, are also \u201cexamining further intervention for debts exclusively to the state,\u201d meaning debts like unpaid taxes.Yet in the spring, the government lifted a ban on the sale of delinquent mortgages and loans to small businesses. In the summer, new laws were passed that allowed banks to initiate foreclosures if debtors are regarded as uncooperative.Every Wednesday, when foreclosure auctions are held, protesters gather outside Greek courts, blocking access to legal staff, barging into courtrooms and, on occasion, clashing with the riot police.Among those protesting are groups like the left-leaning Repossessions Stop and Den Plirono (I Won\u2019t Pay), as well as right-wing groups.Stefanos Grigorakis of the United Pan-Popular Front, a nationalist group, joined one recent Wednesday protest outside the Athens county court. He said the government\u2019s reassurances were disingenuous.\u201cIt\u2019s deception, so people sit back on their couches,\u201d he said. \u201cGreeks have to wake up. They handed over the public wealth,\u201d he added, referring to the government\u2019s plans for state privatizations. \u201cNow they\u2019re coming to take our houses.\u201dSuch protests have blocked dozens of repossessions in recent weeks. Auctions began in September, when Greek lawyers returned to work after a nine-month strike over cuts to their pensions.In a speech in Parliament this month, Mr. Tsipras defended his government\u2019s efforts to protect homeowners. He said there had been only 500 repossessions this year and none in 2015, when his leftist Syriza party came to power, compared with thousands under previous governments.Greek notaries and the association of Greek borrowers said the numbers were higher, though they did not have exact figures.The head of the borrowers\u2019 association, Vangelis Kritikos, said about 50,000 properties would be up for repossession next year. \u201cPeople are panicking,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day we get about 500 calls.\u201dAfter violent clashes in Thessaloniki at a planned foreclosure auction in the first week of October, Greek notaries said they would no longer attend auctions for primary residences and urged the government to pass a law categorically protecting them.The deputy finance minister, Tryfon Alexiadis, declared a ban on foreclosures of primary residences with a taxable value of \u20ac300,000 or more. Strong words aside, the authorities stopped short of legislation. According to the political opposition and other critics, that was because creditor representatives were in Athens and would have objected.Negotiations between Greece and its creditors have several times touched on the huge burden that nonperforming loans have placed on Greek banks, but the issue remains unresolved.Unless it can be solved, Greek banks will be unable to pump money back into the economy. They have already been recapitalized three times in three years.As is customary, officials of the eurozone countries, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund would not comment publicly while bailout negotiations were underway. Privately though, officials said it was not the first time that the Greek government had ventured a \u201cunilateral action\u201d that it had then revoked.All three institutions have pointed to bad loans as a major problem, calling for a crackdown on delinquent debtors, particularly strategic defaulters (who have money but do not pay) and the development of a market where bad loans could be traded.Yannis Stournaras, the head of Greece\u2019s central bank, also highlighted the issue last month, saying that \u201ctackling the high stock of nonperforming loans is the greatest challenge facing the Greek banking system and the Greek economy.\u201dGreek bank officials, in talks with foreign envoys, have proposed that auctions be conducted electronically to overcome the problem posed by angry protesters at courthouses.In the meantime, Greek homeowners like Mr. Hanis, the retired accountant, remain in limbo. He took out two mortgages, in 2001 and 2012, worth \u20ac71,000. Once his pension was cut, he asked for help from banks, which advised him to take out new loans to pay off the old ones.\u201cIt\u2019s like Greece getting more loans from the lenders,\u201d he said. \u201cJust more debt to pay the old debt, but what else could I do?\u201dMr. Hanis applied to a government program introduced in 2010, at the peak of the crisis, that aims to reduce monthly payments for people with serious financial problems. The program has since been qualified by so many conditions that inclusion is difficult.About 150,000 applications are pending. His hopes now hang on a court case in November.Mr. Hanis\u2019s lawyer, Dimitris Anastasopoulos, said he had represented \u201cabout 1,000 people\u201d during the crisis years, \u201cnot including the hundreds of people who walked in here to seek advice.\u201dA key problem, he said, is that the Greek authorities have focused more on giving homeowners a false sense of security than providing them with information about their options.\u201cSuccessive governments convinced people that they won\u2019t lose their homes while they tried to figure out what to do,\u201d Mr. Anastasopoulos said. \u201cThey issue a law saying, \u2018We can take your house.\u2019 Then, they reassure you that it\u2019s protected.\u201dMany homeowners are desperate, he said, citing a client who recently told him that he had contemplated suicide.Mr. Hanis fears a rejection, but said he would continue to fight.\u201cI\u2019m going to appeal for a reprieve,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I just can\u2019t make the payments.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Hails Enforcement on Trade Deals to Win Support for T.P.P.", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration has used a flurry of tough-sounding trade enforcement announcements in recent weeks to counter complaints from the left and right that free trade is not fair trade \u2014 and to assist President Obama in the struggle to win approval of his trade pact with 11 Pacific Rim nations.As evidence that past trade agreements are being policed, Mr. Obama and his cabinet members have trumpeted new complaints filed against nations alleged to be cheating, as well as the administration\u2019s latest victories in previous cases taken to the World Trade Organization, the referee of global commerce.Days apart in September, for example, actions were taken against Chinese grain exports, India\u2019s barriers to solar-power parts, European subsidies for airliner manufacturing and foreign fishing subsidies. On Monday, the administration announced that it would press the W.T.O. for a special hearing demanding \u201cthe rapid enforcement\u201d of the organization\u2019s favorable rulings on exports of airliners and solar products.With each announcement, administration officials have added a good word for the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, arguing that it would raise trade standards and provide more tools to enforce them.Since Mr. Obama took office in 2009, his trade office has lodged 23 challenges at the World Trade Organization and won or settled favorably all 16 cases decided so far. Fourteen of the 23 cases have been against China, three against India and others have involved the European Union, Argentina, the Philippines and Indonesia.\u201cIn previous administrations, the enforcement record was basically miserable,\u201d Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat who opposes the Pacific pact, told the Council on Foreign Relations last week. \u201cNow I think there\u2019s been an improvement in enforcement,\u201d he added, \u201cexcept it isn\u2019t nearly enough.\u201dThea Lee, deputy chief of staff at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said she saw \u201ca mixed record.\u201d She praised administration efforts against maneuvers by other nations to underprice their manufacturers\u2019 exports, which have harmed American manufacturing. But she criticized the record on enforcing labor rights and on combating nations that hold down the value of their currencies to lower the cost of their exports.\u201cOn certain issues like antidumping and subsidies, and some of the issues dealing directly with China, the administration has done a good job, has been aggressive in bringing cases, winning cases and getting relief for workers and businesses that have been affected by unfair trade practices,\u201d Ms. Lee said.\u201cWe\u2019re going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we\u2019re going to hold people accountable,\u201d she said.On his first full workday in office, President Trump delivered on a campaign promise by abandoning the enormous trade deal that had became a flashpoint in American politics.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., stumping for the agreement at the port of San Diego in July, said the administration had been enforcing trade pacts \u201cmore aggressively than any administration in the past.\u201d He added, however, \u201cOne of the reasons so many Americans are upset about trade is because we have not adequately enforced them\u201d over time.A desire for vigorous enforcement is perhaps the one thing that unites trade skeptics and pro-trade business groups.John G. Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said he often speaks to state and local chambers, \u201cand when I say that the agreements we sign aren\u2019t worth the paper they\u2019re written on if they aren\u2019t enforced, I regularly get applause.\u201dThe administration has \u201ca strong record,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, and he criticized trade opponents who favor tough enforcement but oppose the trade agreements that established the policing regimes.\u201cWe have to ensure America plays a leading role in setting the highest standards for the rest of the world to follow,\u201d Mr. Obama said, before adding, \u201cThat\u2019s what the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or T.P.P., is all about.\u201dIn the same week, the United States and a dozen other nations united in a campaign to ban government subsidies blamed for overfishing. China is considered a main culprit. That announcement, too, included a plug for the Pacific accord \u2014 for \u201cincluding the first enforceable prohibitions on harmful fishing subsidies\u201d in a trade pact and eliminating foreign taxes on American fish exports.The W.T.O. also handed the administration two victories that it was quick to broadcast.Such actions against other countries\u2019 subsidies, dumping and market barriers, however, do not address two big concerns of trade skeptics: currency manipulation and workers\u2019 rights.Currency practices are tricky to police; other nations could counter with complaints about the monetary policies of the independent Federal Reserve, which affect the value of the dollar. Instead of writing mandates into the Pacific accord, negotiators attached a side agreement spelling out disclosure requirements and a consultation process for disputes between nations.On workers\u2019 rights, Ms. Lee of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said, \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are at stake.\u201dThe administration did require Colombia to change its labor practices before the United States-Colombia trade pact could be approved, but Ms. Lee said improvements have come slowly or not at all. In Guatemala, where union organizers have suffered violence and assassinations, she said a case filed by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and local unions was ignored in the George W. Bush administration and, despite some attention, has languished under Mr. Obama.The Pacific agreement includes concessions from Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei on labor and human rights. But, Ms. Lee asked, \u201cCan we stop and figure out how to get that piece of it right before we take the leap of tying our economies together permanently?\u201dAdvertisement"}

He asked one poll worker whether a group of reporters could see his ballot. She assured him that the reporters could not.When asked for whom he voted, Mr. Obama just smiled. In one form or another, the selection of the next president occupied much of his day.Earlier Friday, Mr. Obama spoke at a political fund-raiser, where he opened his comments by saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend a lot of time talking about Trump.\u201dThe line led to a burst of laughter at the home of Fred Eychaner, a media executive and one of the most significant Democratic donors in the nation.Mr. Obama flew into his adopted hometown Friday for a three-day weekend \u2014 perhaps his last hurrah here as president \u2014 to hold a series of fund-raisers and express appreciation to some of the people who helped him start his political career.At the start of the lunch \u2014 attendees paid $10,000 and up \u2014 Mr. Obama gave his standard stump speech, ticking off a list of accomplishments over nearly eight years: reviving a moribund economy, cutting unemployment in half, getting health insurance to 20 million people and passing legislation to reform Wall Street.Maintaining that progress, he said, would require electing not only a Democratic president but a Democratic Congress, as well.\u201cNow I\u2019m confident we will have an incredibly capable Democratic successor in the White House, by the name of Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Obama said to applause. \u201cWhen I say I\u2019m confident, I\u2019m not overconfident. We really got a lot of work to do.\u201dMr. Obama said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ability to protect and build on his legacy would depend on Democrats retaking Congress.\u201cIt\u2019s an uphill battle,\u201d Mr. Obama conceded, citing gerrymandering among other challenges. But he added, \u201cI think we got a real shot.\u201dRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, were among a handful of members of Congress in the audience. The fund-raiser was held to benefit the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.Mr. Obama said that much effort will be necessary to protect his legacy and enlarge it by passing immigration reform, investing in the nation\u2019s infrastructure and expanding early childhood education and clean energy.The White House has yet to announce how Mr. Obama will spend his Saturday here or whether he will attend a baseball playoff game. Mr. Obama has long been a White Sox fan but has said he is rooting for the Cubs in the team\u2019s series against the San Francisco Giants.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New True-Crime Books for Fall", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byNonfictionNot all true-crime books are created equal. Some explore the criminal mind. Others focus on the lives of the victims. And then there are the ones that look beyond the crime to the historical period and social conditions in which it\u2019s rooted. But one thing can be said for them all: True crime is hardly ever boring.Although by 1868 the formerly quiet town of Indianapolis was becoming \u201ca city of strangers,\u201d nearby Cold Spring was a more inviting place to settle \u2014 except for that blood-soaked patch of ground on the west bank of the White River where the bodies of Jacob and Janey Young were found on the morning of Sept. 13. To an excitable reporter for The Indianapolis Sentinel, it was \u201ca picture of grisly horror seldom seen except upon the battlefield.\u201dJacob and Janey Young had been great friends of Frank and Nancy Clem, who lived in their genteel neighborhood and shared their \u201cexemplary social qualities.\u201d But Jacob and Nancy had something else in common \u2014 a good head for business. As \u201cstreet brokers\u201d working outside an established firm, the friends dealt in stocks, mortgages and promissory notes. And if some of their transactions seemed a bit dicey, they made plenty of money for themselves and their clients. The first ones, anyway, because what the partners were shilling turned out to be an early, if not the earliest, Ponzi scheme.The murder of a business partner doesn\u2019t sound very sexy. But Gamber raises a provocative issue when she studies the era\u2019s disapproving attitude toward any woman who dared to benefit from the commercial opportunities of a postwar world \u2014 especially if that commerce happened to be illegal. At Mrs. Clem\u2019s fifth murder trial, court attorneys were still exchanging fierce arguments over \u201cthe respectability of \u2018working women.\u2019\u2009\u201dTo be sure, Mrs. Clem speculated in dubious investments and openly consorted with cardsharps, forgers and other scam artists. Then again, as Gamber dryly notes, \u201cPerhaps a woman known for eagerly scanning the real estate pages was bored with domestic life.\u201dLowry lays out the basics of the case in a chillingly concise fashion: \u201cGirls. Kids. Bound, gagged. Naked. Stacked. Burned to the bone.\u201d The city of Austin was still a laid-back place in 1991 \u2014 until the sixth day of the last month of the year, when someone assaulted four teenage girls who worked at the I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Yogurt (ICBY) store, shot them and set their bodies on fire. Lowry works the case from a human rather than a forensic angle. She even deals sympathetically with the lead detective, whom the case had rendered \u201cobsessed, single-minded, snarly, socially incapacitated and a total loser as both husband and father,\u201d according to a speech he gave in 2014 at a convention of the Texas Citizens Police Academy.By 2009, when Lowry became interested, there had been years of appeals, reversals and higher-court decisions concerning the four young men who were eventually charged with the crime, and retrials were being lined up. A final suspect was still at large in 2010, when he was shot dead while running away from a routine traffic stop. This is the kind of case a writer takes up in the hope that she might be of some help.The eight victims were killed between 2005 and 2009 by a person or persons unknown \u2014 although the author has come up with a likely suspect. They were all prostitutes and drug addicts, which made them vulnerable and defenseless, expendable in a jurisdiction that\u2019s centrally positioned along the route of the Gulf Coast drug trade. Brown is especially enlightening when it comes to this region of swampland, where the Spanish banished the original Acadians and the land is currently fouled by oil and gas refineries, coal-fueled power plants and petrochemical facilities that \u201crelease high levels of cancer-causing chemicals into the environment, contaminating fish and leaking toxins into groundwater.\u201dBrown gives the victims more respectful attention than they probably got in life, and he believes he has identified their killer in Frankie Richard, \u201ca onetime pimp, strip-club owner, drug dealer, meth addict and muscle for hire.\u201d His contempt for Richard is palpable, but the brunt of his crusader\u2019s fury is aimed at law enforcement: \u201cThere were credible reports of tampered and destroyed evidence, unethical cash deals, an epidemic of sexual assaults in the jail, whistle-blowers pilloried.\u201dSheriff Ricky Edwards is one of the people Brown claims to have the goods on. Elected to office after his predecessor was indicted in a federal investigation into widespread corruption in the parish, he immediately got to work by adopting a predatory practice of traffic stops and searches that resulted in the town being slapped with numerous civil rights lawsuits. More disastrous was his dismantling of the drug-interdiction program that had become the last line of defense against the traffickers. He even got rid of Armin, the department\u2019s drug-sniffing dog. \u201cYou can buy him or we kill him,\u201d he is said to have told the dog\u2019s handler, who paid the sheriff $10,000 to save the German shepherd\u2019s life.Lord Byron presented written testimony that he had seen no sign of lunacy when he served in the wedding party. But in the autumn of 1822, when Byron was out of the country, Portsmouth\u2019s 22-year-old nephew successfully petitioned for the commission. The financial stakes were higher for Mary Ann and her grasping family, since she had given birth to a girl earlier that year and the earl had to be ruled sane in order for the child to be legitimate. Portsmouth, it should not surprise us to learn, was close to tears throughout the proceedings.Just when the machinations of these two rapacious clans begin to make your blood boil, Foyster switches to a straightforward biographical treatment of John Charles, third earl of Portsmouth, who deserves our attention and our sympathies. Compassion, of which he got precious little in his life, is exactly what Portsmouth receives from Foyster. And from Jane Austen\u2019s mother. As a child, he was boarded and tutored in the rectory home of the (as yet unborn) novelist, where he was judged to be simple-minded but teachable, like the Austens\u2019 own son George. To make matters worse, he stuttered badly and was bullied at boarding school, not only for his stammer but for wetting his bed and being such a poor scholar. Needless to say, he never went on to Eton. Foyster is a historian who studies family dynamics, which might explain why she seems so sympathetic to her subject, a grown man, but so very much like a child.Thorpe was besotted with a 19-year-old stableboy named Norman Josiffe, whom he cleaned up and kept in a long-term clandestine relationship that suited him but asked too much of his mentally fragile paramour. At one point, Josiffe made the mistake of sending a blackmail letter to Thorpe\u2019s formidable mother, threatening to expose their relationship. To his credit, Thorpe didn\u2019t immediately hire a hit man to plug the blackmailer, although it did eventually come to that. Thorpe found numerous jobs for his \u201cbunny,\u201d but Josiffe usually skipped out on them, carrying a bundle of incriminating love letters for security. He was, however, briefly happy in a Trappist monastery, which should have told Thorpe something.Preston has written this page-turner like a political thriller, with urgent dialogue, well-staged scenes, escalating tension and plenty of cliffhangers, especially once the trial begins. But no matter how hard he tries to convince us of Thorpe\u2019s \u201cmagnetic personality,\u201d his central character comes off as selfish, arrogant and manipulative, expecting his close friend, Peter Bessell, another Liberal M.P., to clean up after him. Bessell, who seems to be the truly tragic figure in this unsavory affair, is so loyal that he agrees to commit perjury and sets himself up as a possible suspect in the murder plot: \u201cThe only explanation Bessell himself could offer is that he was flattered to be asked. Despite everything, he yearned to feel the warmth of Thorpe\u2019s approval.\u201dStrange as it seems, until the late 19th century, \u201cthe whole system was based on trust.\u201d Ladies and gentlemen were simply not expected to do such things and generally did not. But after the Civil War, when many of the traditional verities seem to have broken down, a certain lassitude crept into the American ethic, allowing the professional con artist to stride upon the stage.The whole point about being a con man (or woman) was the ability to inspire confidence in your victims. That described Nancy Clem in 1868 in Indianapolis, and it describes Austin Biron Bidwell, \u201can international man of mystery\u201d whose many aliases included \u201cFrederick Warren.\u201d His partner, George Macdonnell, was thought to be \u201cone of the most slippery con men in the world.\u201d There were five Bidwell brothers all told, but only George and Joseph joined Austin in practicing the art of the con. When William Pinkerton, son of the legendary detective Allan Pinkerton, came face to face with Austin in Havana, the criminal shared more of his personal history. But, as Pinkerton later discovered, it was mostly a pack of lies. Apparently, a con man is constitutionally unable to tell the truth.The brothers established themselves by working a long firm fraud (selling wholesale goods acquired on credit) in Cincinnati. But the family business didn\u2019t flourish until they moved the operation to Chicago (\u201cthe sort of town where you could not help becoming involved in crime\u201d) and they honed their skills by selling real estate they didn\u2019t own. Although the Bidwells were occasionally caught dead to rights, these scoundrels were adept at eluding justice through bribery, impersonating one another or simply walking off into the sunset \u2014 and eventually to New York, in those days serving as Boss Tweed\u2019s piggy bank.If it makes readers feel better to hear it, Austin Bidwell announced that \u201cwe did not save a dollar of the millions secured from the Bank of England.\u201d As for me, I\u2019m more fascinated by the gang\u2019s meticulously detailed plot to engage in this plunder, and by Austin\u2019s frequently surprising and seemingly out-of-character conduct. In the course of pulling off the heist, Austin was forced to bamboozle a gentleman banker named Col. Peregrine Madgwick Francis. On the stand, Austin took the extraordinary step of apologizing to Colonel Francis for causing him to be ridiculed in court and in the banking world.Once these \u201cdude\u201d thieves, as Pinkerton called them, were put away, Booth notes that the detective became \u201calmost nostalgic for this vanishing breed of gentlemen who were defined by their relative intelligence and sophistication.\u201d I\u2019m with him.Marilyn Stasio writes the Crime column for the Book Review.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bundy Brothers, Who Sought to Rally a Nation, Draw Scant Support at Trial", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 It has been a difficult few months for the Bundys.Ten months after two brothers from this country\u2019s most notorious ranching family staged an audacious, armed occupation of a wildlife sanctuary in eastern Oregon, their call to shift federal land to local control has softened to a whisper. Some of their allies have abandoned them, and almost a dozen fellow occupiers have pleaded guilty to federal charges.\u201cI had hoped there would be hundreds of people here, but there\u2019s not,\u201d said Jason Patrick, 44, tugging on a cigarette not far from a Black Lives Matter rally that had more than 100 participants. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you come to the most pressing court case of your time?\u201dAs he sits facing an American flag in a federal courthouse, Ammon Bundy, 41, is choosing to wear blue-and-pink prison scrubs and depict himself as a political prisoner. Judge Anna J. Brown, however, has repeatedly rejected his lawyer\u2019s attempts to turn the trial into a referendum on land control, chiding the lawyer, Marcus R. Mumford, each time he strays from the central question: Did the occupiers conspire to prevent federal workers from doing their jobs?\u201cThe ownership of the refuge is not up for discussion,\u201d Judge Brown told Mr. Mumford last week, when he asked a refuge employee on the witness stand about land acquisition. \u201cPlease move on.\u201dThe Bundys and their co-defendants face up to six years in prison. Eleven other occupiers have pleaded guilty, and most are in custody pending a sentencing hearing. Seven others will go to trial in February. And those who have not been indicted are scattered around the country, wondering when their turn will come.\u201cThey\u2019re probably going to arrest me,\u201d said one of them, Case Fisher, 33, a former machine operator who joined the occupation after learning about it from internet videos. He said he has bounced from state to state since the end of the takeover, finding work off the books and avoiding putting his name on a lease. \u201cYou\u2019re always looking over your shoulder,\u201d he said, adding a note of defiance. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be defeated. You can\u2019t defeat an idea and a cause.\u201dThe episode \u2014 and the fact that the Bundys were not arrested \u2014 emboldened activists in pockets of the West where anger at the federal government has long run deep, and it helped give rise to the Oregon takeover.\u201cAmmon Bundy and his father basically handed their heads on the platter to the federal government,\u201d said Stewart Rhodes, 51, the founder of a militia group called the Oath Keepers that claims to have 35,000 members across the country. The Oath Keepers were active in Nevada, he said, but he instructed members to stick to the sidelines in Oregon. \u201cIt was an \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019 viewpoint: \u2018This land is ours, now that we occupy it.\u2019\u201dThe Oregon occupation has also complicated the political landscape for state leaders who have attempted to use legitimate means to acquire federal land.The Republican Party platform calls on Congress to \u201cconvey certain federally controlled public lands to states.\u201d But neither major presidential nominee has shown interest in such a transfer. Critics say the idea would be prohibitively expensive, saddling states with the responsibility of hiring hundreds of rangers to care for mountainsides and fire-prone forests. And they worry that legislatures would simply start auctioning off the country\u2019s most striking landscapes.In a twist, the Oregon occupation seems to have encouraged a revolt the Bundy brothers never expected: In recent months, counties around the West have begun passing resolutions specifically affirming their support for keeping federal lands from being turned over to the state. Some of them have been helped by the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, a group that supports the rights of hunters and fishermen.\u201cIt was backlash against this notion that all Westerners don\u2019t like the federal government owning public land,\u201d said Whit Fosburgh, the organization\u2019s president. \u201cThe whole Bundy invasion probably set back the transfer movement significantly. Because it displayed this movement as a bunch of kooks.\u201dCommissioners in at least 21 places from New Mexico to Wyoming have signed pro-public lands resolutions. In interviews, several said they had become concerned that their state leaders, if given control of federal lands, would start selling the ski slopes, river rapids and trekking trails that drive their communities\u2019 economies and souls.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Noam Chomsky and the Bicycle Theory", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byEd TalkAt 87, Noam Chomsky, the founder of modern linguistics, remains a vital presence in American intellectual life. An emeritus professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he still teaches, he has a dual identity, reflected in his several dozen books. Many are on theoretical linguistics and the philosophy of mind. Others are sharp, leftish polemics on American politics. Dr. Chomsky is back in the news, thanks to a pair of high-profile attacks. In \u201cThe Kingdom of Speech,\u201d Tom Wolfe pairs Dr. Chomsky (\u201cNoam Charisma\u201d) with Darwin as the malign Ur-theorists of evolution. In \u201cDecoding Chomsky: Science and Revolutionary Politics,\u201d the British anthropologist Chris Knight explores \u201cthe Chomsky problem\u201d \u2014 the paradox of a thinker who belongs to the \u201cprofessional and scientific elite\u201d even as he espouses populist political ideas. It will soon be 60 years since your first book, \u201cSyntactic Structures,\u201d was published. Where was the study of linguistics then and what did you see that could be done?The belief at the time was that languages can vary arbitrarily, so when you study a new language you should come to it without any preconceptions. Such views are still held, although the evidence to undermine them, I think, is simply overwhelming. Studies have shown that the diversity and complexity is superficial, while the internal system, which yields the fundamental properties of language as a system of thought, may be close to uniform among humans \u2014 basically following very simple genetically determined properties and general laws, like principles of computation. Some of the most exciting work in the field is going in that direction.Are you as convinced now as when you were younger that understanding language is essential to understanding the human mind?I think that\u2019s clearer and clearer. The emergence of language as a system of creative thought was sensed by Descartes and Galileo. But it was not really addressed till the mid-20th century because the tools weren\u2019t available to formulate it properly. You needed the modern theory of computability, which was developed by Alan Turing and other great mathematicians of the 1930s and \u201940s. I was lucky that I was becoming an undergraduate at just the time that all these great insights were emerging. Have you read Tom Wolfe\u2019s book?It\u2019s so uninformed and distorted that it hardly rises to the level of meeting a laugh test. In the Harper\u2019s Magazine excerpt, there\u2019s exactly one paragraph that is accurate, quoted from an interview we had in which I explain why his crucial example, the Amazonian language Pirah\u00e3, is completely irrelevant to his conclusions and claims because what he says about Pirah\u00e3 \u2014 correct or not \u2014 is about the language itself, not about the common human faculty of language. To take an analogy: If some tribe were found in which everyone wears a black patch over one eye, it would have no bearing on the study of binocular vision in the human visual system. How about Chris Knight? He connects your theory of language to Pentagon-funded work you did at M.I.T. during the Cold War.The Pentagon was the means by which the government carried out industrial policy and developed the high-tech economy of the future. M.I.T. was almost entirely funded by the military, including the music department. Does this mean we were doing military work? There was a study in 1969, the Pounds commission \u2014 I was a member of it \u2014 to investigate whether any military or classified work was being done on campus. Answer? None.Why do you think we\u2019re seeing this resurgence of analysis? You must tire of defending your work.I\u2019ve been defending the legitimacy of this work, extensively and in print, for 60 years. In earlier years, the discussions were with serious philosophers, linguists, cognitive scientists. I\u2019m sorry to see that the resurgence you mention does not begin to approximate that level \u2014 one reason why, unlike earlier years, I don\u2019t bother to respond unless asked.Let\u2019s talk about your politics.I supported Bernie Sanders. The most important issue we face, a real question of species survival, is climate change. I\u2019ve been criticized for advocating a politics of fear, which is correct. That\u2019s not a criticism. That\u2019s sanity.What do you make of the political climate today? Of the student protests?Humans face critical problems that have never arisen before in their history, problems of survival of organized human life on earth. They are barely mentioned in the current electoral extravaganza and the voluminous commentary about it. Fortunately, young people are often deeply concerned and directly engaged.You\u2019ll be teaching two classes next semester at the University of Arizona.Yes. An undergraduate course will focus on the current stage of globalized state capitalism and ways of approaching \u201cthe common good\u201d as it has been conceived in various ways since the Enlightenment. The graduate seminar will explore critical topics at the boundaries of current inquiry into the nature of language, its acquisition and use, its evolution. Every class is a challenge and often leads to rethinking and exploration of new directions.How do you account for your amazing stamina and energy level at age 87?The bicycle theory. As long as you keep riding, you don\u2019t fall.Bono of U2 called you the Elvis of academia. Students wait hours to hear your lectures. Then there\u2019s all that Chomsky memorabilia \u2014 mugs, T-shirts, even luggage tags.Seems strange to me. It can only mean that my activist engagements and professional work somehow relate to what many people are looking for and don\u2019t appear to find elsewhere.Do you own a Chomsky coffee mug?No. But I get things from friends. The one I like is one my grandchildren like. It\u2019s a little figure of a gnome you can put in a garden. \u201cGnome Chomsky.\u201dSam Tanenhaus is a former editor of The New York Times Book Review.

{"Headline": "Next \u2018Renewable Energy\u2019: Burning Forests, if Senators Get Their Way", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe president\u2019s plan to reduce emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the nation\u2019s power sector could be undone within a matter of weeks by an unlikely bipartisan collection of senators that includes staunch Republican climate change deniers as well as Democrats who support the administration\u2019s strategy.What\u2019s the problem? They want to force the government to assume that burning forests to generate electricity does not add carbon dioxide to the air but is instead \u201ccarbon neutral.\u201d As long as forests that have been cleared are regrown rather than turned into, say, subdivisions, language proposed by the senators argues that the Environmental Protection Agency and the Agriculture Department should recognize the wood and other organic matter pulled from a forest \u201cas a renewable energy source.\u201dThat amounts to 48 million additional tons of carbon dioxide a year, on average, about three-quarters of what was produced by forest fires in the lower 48 states in 2013. It makes for a big hole in a plan that is supposed to cut annual emissions from the power sector by some 250 million tons between now and 2030.\u201cThe Senate has strongly supported the benefits that biomass utilization can have, including instances in which it is a carbon-neutral source of energy,\u201d they wrote in a statement. \u201cConversations about the amendment are expected to continue among the bill conferees, the amendment sponsors and other congressional colleagues as the energy bill moves through the conference process.\u201dWhile it is hard to handicap its chances, the biomass proposal could become law within weeks. Members of Congress are now working to reconcile the Senate\u2019s bill with the one that passed in the House, which does not include this provision. Even if it fails to make it through, similar language has been attached to appropriations bills for the Interior Department, passed by both chambers and now undergoing reconciliation.And there is the problem of timing. Sure forests regrow. But it takes many decades for seedlings to grow into trees and recapture all the carbon emitted.\u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy, because you remove an active sink that was sucking carbon out of the air,\u201d said Mary S. Booth, director of the Partnership for Policy Integrity, which opposes the assumption that biomass is carbon neutral. \u201cUnder the most conservative assumptions you are worse off for 40 to 50 years.\u201dThe world simply does not have that kind of time.Biomass proponents say more forests would be planted if timber were considered carbon neutral. Still, that is perhaps too speculative a proposition on which to base such a critical decision.It is not crazy that members of Congress from states with big forestry industries would try in a big way to draw wood into the nation\u2019s efforts to combat climate change. They must worry, too, about economic development and jobs. And yet creating the fiction that burning forests won\u2019t contribute to climate change would defeat the purpose of climate policy.Burning forests won\u2019t help recover the lost ground.The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about a proposal in the Senate that would force the Obama administration to assume that the burning of biomass is \u201ccarbon neutral,\u201d misstated several estimates on carbon dioxide emissions, using information from the Partnership for Public Integrity. If the proposal takes effect, it would add at least 620 million metric tons \u2014 not 830 million metric tons \u2014 of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That amounts to 48 million additional tons a year, not 64 million tons, which is equal to about three-quarters of what was produced by forest fires in the continental United States in 2013; it does not equal the amount that forest fires produced that year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "15 Years in the Afghan Crucible", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 There is an end-of-an-era feel here these days. Military helicopters rattle overhead, ferrying American and Afghan officials by air rather than risk cars bombs in the streets. The concrete barriers, guarding against suicide attacks, have grown taller and stronger around every embassy and government building, and whole streets are blocked off from the public.It has been 15 years since American forces began their bombing campaign against the Taliban and Al Qaeda on Oct. 7, 2001, and sometimes it feels as if we are back to square one, that there is nothing to show for it.The recent American military drawdown has been drastic \u2014 from over 100,000 troops a few years ago to a force of 8,500 today. Thousands of Afghans have been made jobless as bases and assistance programs have closed. Meanwhile tens of thousands of Taliban are on the offensive in the countryside, threatening to overrun several provincial towns and staging huge bombings here in the capital.Afghan forces have been bearing the brunt, suffering unsustainable casualties. Communities talk of hundreds of coffins returning from the front line. Civilians have suffered no less \u2014 thousands of families have been displaced anew by fighting, and aid workers warn that their access is deteriorating. Business executives have been leaving, selling off their property, and whole families have swelled the refugee columns heading to Europe.The political mood is shifting, too, as Afghans sense the declining American influence and start casting around for new patrons or renewing old alliances. The politicking is intense: \u201cHot, very hot,\u201d as a former minister described the political climate.For Afghans, and for many of us who have followed Afghanistan for decades \u2014 I have been visiting the country since the early 1990s \u2014 the times are reminiscent of the Soviet Union\u2019s withdrawal in 1989 after a 10-year occupation. The Communist government and army that the Soviets left behind survived only three years before they were overthrown by the mujahedeen in 1992.The Taliban, supported by Pakistan, seem intent on repeating that scenario, hoping to seize control of a section of territory along the Pakistani border and declare once more their Islamic Emirate. Since the Taliban temporarily overran the town of Kunduz last fall, many Afghans have lost confidence that the government can protect them.It looked easy enough at the beginning. The Taliban were swiftly defeated in 2001 and fled in disarray, as did Al Qaeda\u2019s forces. I saw thousands of their fighters \u2014 including hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters \u2014 surrender in northern Afghanistan, and there was no doubt they were at the end of their strength and had lost popular support.But they were allowed to regroup just over the mountains in Pakistan, and from there they still menace Afghanistan and the wider region. In Pakistan they started teaching young men how to build pressure-cooker bombs filled with ball bearings and suicide belts, and later truck bombs, and sent them out by the hundreds against targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan.They are still recruiting and training bombers, including Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in a series of bombings last month in New York City and New Jersey, who spent months in a madrasa in a Taliban stronghold near the Pakistani frontier town of Quetta.Despite years of denials from Pakistan, it is now widely understood that the Taliban has all this time been mentored and equipped by the Pakistani intelligence agency. Yet President Obama has failed, as did his predecessor, President George W. Bush, to end Pakistan\u2019s long flirtation with Al Qaeda and its brand of terrorism.Osama bin Laden\u2019s successor, Ayman al-Zawahri, is still believed to be living in Pakistan, alongside the top Taliban leaders \u2014 and continues directing mayhem through his adherents across the Middle East, Africa and Asia. American Special Operations forces have been raiding Al Qaeda groups infiltrating back into Afghanistan over the last two years.And the Pakistani military is ever more brazen in its support for the insurgents, even flying in retired military officers to train the Taliban by chartered helicopter \u2014 one crash-landed in a Taliban-controlled area of eastern Afghanistan in August bearing six retired military personnel and a Russian pilot.Watching so many deadly attacks continue over the years with little done to prevent them at their source has been one of my hardest experiences as a reporter. And it is increasingly difficult to answer Afghans when they wonder how America could have been so blind or careless to ignore Pakistan\u2019s role in sponsoring terrorism.\u201cFor a long time America did not understand Afghanistan,\u201d Commander Gadda, a grizzled jihadi commander and long opponent of the Taliban, told me. \u201cNow they are beginning to, but after how long?\u201dIn America and Europe, I detect general weariness with the Afghanistan campaign. I often hear people describe it as the \u201cAfghan disaster.\u201d Certainly there have been many blunders: the corruption, the poor leadership and the unremitting casualties. But I would never term it a disaster.The United States has essentially lifted the entire country from the dark ages. Afghans are still grateful to America for ending Taliban rule, and the terror, poverty and backwardness that it entailed. \u201cWe are tired of always running with our children on our backs,\u201d one father told me.There was barely a paved road or an undamaged government building back in 2001, and widespread hunger after a seven-year famine. I remember a village elder weeping as he told me that American food aid had saved the village from starvation.Half of Kabul was in ruins and uninhabited. I used to ride horses in western Kabul because it was mostly deserted and we could canter through broken compounds and ruined gardens. Now the whole area is rebuilt and thick with people. The campus of the American University of Afghanistan stands across from a new Parliament building (built by India) and across the street from the renovated Kabul museum and government compounds. Much of the public building has been done with American money.The capital was dark and cold for years, but the World Bank helped bring electricity from Central Asia, turning on the lights in Kabul. Suburbs sprawled in every direction, and the small houses that climb the steep, craggy hills were repaired and painted. You could see people had work and were building and renovating.Reconstruction was frustratingly slow at first \u2014 even now, most of the country still does not have electricity \u2014 but has grown steadily. For years the roads were an agonizing trial of bumping and jolting, but these days journeys that used to take several days can now be completed in hours. In the provinces, administration buildings, schools, hospitals, clinics, police stations and even prisons have sprouted.Over time I began to notice a new generation of trained professionals working in government offices: Young men with degrees in charge of district offices, teenage women teaching classes to the younger students, female graduates working in private universities, and officials in the ministries and embassies returning from abroad with master\u2019s degrees and doctorates.Afghanistan once had only two provincial universities, and now it has more than 30, offering graduate courses for the first time. Scores of private schools and universities are filling the thirst for education. \u201cThe young people have found their voice and are speaking out like never before,\u201d says Nancy Dupree, a former American diplomat who founded the Afghan Center at Kabul University, which holds a vast digital archive of research material.After a lifetime in Afghanistan, she is racing to complete a bundle of projects \u2014 collating the anthropological slides of her husband, Louis Dupree, reopening a royal palace and seeking to digitize Afghanistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry archive.\u201cThey do not know their own history,\u201d she laments of the young Afghans who have traveled little outside their homes. \u201cThey have no sense of belonging and what it means to be Afghan. And they do not know what a beautiful country they have.\u201dForeign funding has saved much of Afghanistan\u2019s endangered heritage, repairing the mosques and townhouses of the old city that were ruined in the civil war, for example, and renovating the gardens and tomb of Emperor Babur in Kabul, the citadel in Herat and the Buddhas\u2019 niches in Bamiyan that were blown up by the Taliban. Even with security as it is, archaeologists are quietly at work around the country.When I ask foreign professionals working in Afghanistan about the American era, they tend to say that far too much money was wasted and that it was a mistake to expect change quickly.Yet Afghan friends and acquaintances rarely hesitate when asked whether the American intervention was worth it: \u201cNo question\u201d is the usual response. There have been many painful mistakes, of course, but the building, the education, the defense and diplomatic support have all helped Afghanistan rise from the ashes.Women especially have gained confidence. A friend laughingly recounted how she recently called relatives in Germany who had always boasted about their sauna to tell them she was enjoying the hotel sauna during a working trip to Bamiyan, in central Afghanistan.There is still a great disparity between the city and countryside, and in many areas women are struggling to feed their children. Nearly a quarter of the country\u2019s districts \u2014 90 out of a total of nearly 400 \u2014 are under Taliban sway.Yet there is a new awareness among Afghans that the boom years created by so much American assistance did not occur organically, and that now they have to find an organic way to grow the economy. They talk of Afghanistan\u2019s mineral wealth, its talent for trade and its ideal position as a transit route for energy and goods from China and Central Asia to the Persian Gulf.There is a sense that if, in the early years, the Americans were making the decisions in Afghanistan, now the Afghans are. And the mistakes and disputes will be for them to work out, too. Despite many complaints about the dysfunctional government, there is still hope that President Ashraf Ghani has the ideas to lift the economy.Most Afghans say they will need American support in defense and diplomacy to counter the continuing threat of terrorism and to protect them from predatory neighbors beyond the 2017 deadline that President Obama has made for the drawdown. There is a real danger the Afghan Army could collapse next year if the fighting and casualties remain as intense, and so a continued United States military commitment will remain essential.If the United States could go a step further and redouble efforts to secure peace in Afghanistan with the Taliban and with Pakistan \u2014 a process started in 2009 by Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy to Afghanistan under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and still sputtering along \u2014 it would avoid a gigantic failure of having the country relapse into Taliban control.Peace will be a tall order and require a high level of American commitment for years more. But the result would be welcomed overwhelmingly by Afghans who have endured decades of war, and serve as a lasting tribute to the families of the American soldiers who died there.Carlotta Gall, a senior foreign correspondent for The New York Times, spent nearly 12 years reporting in Afghanistan since 2001.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Options Does the U.S. Have After Accusing Russia of Hacks?", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisTechnologically, that would not be too difficult, American officials say. But as a matter of strategy and politics, formulating the right kind of counterstrike is not that straightforward.Or Mr. Obama could sign a secret intelligence finding \u2014 similar to many he has issued to authorize Central Intelligence Agency efforts in Syria or drone strikes against the Islamic State \u2014 to attack and disable Russian computer servers or expose the financial dealings of President Vladimir V. Putin and his oligarch friends.While the last option is tempting, officials say, it would carry risks with the election just a month away. Attacks on online voter registration rolls could sow chaos at polling places, and the election infrastructure has never truly been tested against a power like Russia. The system that underpins American democracy is not even listed as an element of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure, a list that includes movie theaters and the Jefferson Memorial, among other monuments.Just as Henry Kissinger and other American strategists argued decades ago whether it was possible to wage a limited nuclear war, officials at the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, as well as outside experts, have been debating whether it is possible to control the escalation of a cyberconflict.In the nuclear era, seven decades passed with no answer, despite some close calls. Online, where the damage is less lethal but cheap, and attacks are hard to trace and easy to carry out, Mr. Obama and other top officials are proceeding cautiously. Well-armed cyberpowers face few limits to their ability to escalate attacks. And it is unclear how the United States can establish what the generals call \u201cescalation dominance\u201d \u2014 the assurance that America can ultimately control how a conflict ends.Michael J. Morell, a former deputy director of the C.I.A. and a veteran of many debates on the growing cyberweapon arsenal in the Bush and Obama administrations, said on Saturday that the American response had to strike at something that Mr. Putin held dear. But, he added, unleashing a counterattack may not be the answer.\u201cOur response needs to be proportionate to the attack,\u201d said Mr. Morell, who now advises Hillary Clinton on national security matters and is widely believed to be in line for a top intelligence post if she is elected president. Criminal indictments and sanctions against individuals \u201care only a slap on the wrist,\u201d he said, adding that \u201coffensive cyberactions can\u2019t be seen and are inconsistent with the norms we want to set in the world on cyber.\u201dMr. Morell advocated two approaches: deep sanctions on the entire Russian economy and an \u201caggressive Voice of America program in Russian to tell the Russian people that Putin is only interested in his own aggrandizement\u201d and is threatening the only hope for the country\u2019s economy: integration with the West.But the challenges, as Mr. Morell acknowledges, are clear. Europe is unlikely to go along with sanctions if that means cutting off their access to the Russian gas that keeps them warm. And Voice of America programs, a relic of the Cold War, are slow to work, if they can work at all in the internet age.At its core, the problem that the Obama administration faces is this: What the Russians have done in hacking into American political institutions \u2014 and perhaps accessing voter registration rolls \u2014 is a digital form of hybrid warfare. In Ukraine, this took the form of Russian soldiers engaging in quiet guerrilla actions out of uniform to undermine the government. (Russia also turned off the electric grid in part of Ukraine last December, mostly to show that they could.)Leaking emails and phone conversations, and generally stirring chaos around elections, have been a well-honed Russian art form in Europe, especially in former Soviet states. Such actions walk the line between harassment and low-level state-versus-state conflict. Now, they have come to American shores.In background conversations, officials strongly hinted that the evidence had come, in part, from data collected by the National Security Agency\u2019s implants in foreign computer networks, presumably including Russia\u2019s.\u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily want to start a war with Russia,\u201d he said.Mr. Lewis said he doubted that using intelligence findings to embarrass Mr. Putin \u2014 leaking details of his financial dealings, his personal life or his relationships with the moneyed elite who help keep him in power \u2014 would be the solution.\u201cIf we couldn\u2019t deter Moscow from going into the Ukraine, we\u2019re not going to deter them from hacking us,\u201d Mr. Lewis said.For a declining power like Russia, whose economy has been battered by falling oil prices and economic sanctions, cyberattacks are an easy answer. They usually happen below the radar. And for the past two years, Russian hackers operating at the behest of, or directly for, the state have had a string of successes against foreign targets, even testing the limits of the American doctrine that destructive hacking attacks could be considered acts of war.Russian hackers were identified by German intelligence officials as the culprits behind a cyberattack that damaged a blast furnace owned by ThyssenKrupp, Germany\u2019s biggest steel maker. Forensics experts discovered malware in the plant\u2019s system that had previously been tied to a well-known Russian espionage group.Mr. Obama decided not to name the Russians in those attacks. \u201cThe Russians have had a string of unbroken successes against U.S. targets, and they haven\u2019t paid much of a price,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. That may have created an impression in the Kremlin that cyberattacks would carry no consequences.Mr. Obama seems likely to invoke some kind of financial sanctions under the new executive order, which allows the Treasury secretary to freeze the financial assets of individuals tied to hacking attacks or prevent them from conducting financial transactions.The White House considered applying the sanctions against the Chinese companies and individuals involved in the hacking of the Office of Personnel Management last year, but ultimately decided against it after China pledged that it would not conduct economic espionage against the United States and arrested several individuals.But a similar deal with Russia seems hard to imagine. \u201cHow can we choose not to use the sanctions?\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cThe question is if we name and punish these guys, will Russians take the hint? My sense is no.\u201dDavid E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

She had just read \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Stornoway Way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kevin MacNeil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novel about a busker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frustrated return to his island home, when she came across a tourism pamphlet for the Outer Hebrides.

Ms. Vancon called her resulting project \u201cAt the End of the Day,\u201d the English translation of a Gaelic phrase.\u201cThe islanders can refer to it simply as the end of a working day when people find themselves in community or in family, playing traditional music in the pub or lighting up a fire fed with peat,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut it is also the moment of reflection.\u201d  She arrived on the Isle of Lewis last January. After meeting a few people, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a snowball effect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas everybody knows everyone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She took time getting to know her subjects, mostly young islanders, and started photographing when it felt right. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go straight into the intimacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to gain trust. It is a question of respect.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer photographs came from two trips, one in winter and one in summer. The vast difference in daylight hours between the seasons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the sun sets at around 4 p.m. in the winter and 11 p.m. in the summer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 revealed various social rhythms of island life against a backdrop of pubs, homes, windswept peaks and glassy waterways beneath gray skies.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cJuly and August is the high season for ceilidhs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, referring to the festive gatherings with traditional music and dance.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo they go on every ceilidh they can and enjoy every possibility of events, which go on for longer than they do in the winter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Vancon found that life for many residents involved leaving the islands for college or learning a profession. Yet despite better opportunities for careers elsewhere, most wanted to return to the islands. The communities of the Outer Hebrides have shrunk over the decades. The latest figures estimate a total population of 27,070, which, coupled with environmental and market impacts on local industries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 oil extraction, hunting, fishing, crofting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 leaves the island economies fragile. Opportunities can be elusive.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is really rare that it matches what they want to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Vancon said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither they have to choose a career or they have to choose the place where they grew up.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor example, Melanie MacDonald, 22, earned a nursing degree, but has yet to find a job on the island because the few positions that exist rarely open up. Holly Pearson, an 18-year-old student, is facing the same situation when she returns from university.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOpportunities for women on the island are rare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Vancon said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really give you a chance to blossom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet Ms. Vancon saw strength in her subjects. Danielle MacGillivray, 26, a single mother with multiple sclerosis, is a volunteer firefighter on Benbecula Island, where she grew up and still lives.Not everyone wishes to remain.

{"Headline": "Vladimir Putin Exits Nuclear Security Pact, Citing \u2018Hostile Actions\u2019 by U.S.", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Saying relations with the United States have deteriorated in a \u201cradically changed environment,\u201d President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia withdrew Monday from a landmark nuclear security agreement, in a troubling sign that the countries\u2019 cooperation in a range of nuclear areas could be threatened.It required Russia and the United States to destroy military stockpiles of plutonium, a deal that represented another encouraging step away from nuclear doomsday and an insurance policy against the materials falling into the hands of terrorists or rogue states.The deal has no bearing on the numbers of nuclear weapons deployed by Russia or the United States. Instead, it concerns 34 tons of plutonium in storage in each country that might go into a future arsenal, none of which has yet undergone verifiable disposal.Still, the abrogation signals that the nuclear agreements that accompanied the breakup of the Soviet Union and were to lead the world back from the hair-trigger brink of atomic conflict could be open to revision, as Russia\u2019s relations with the West sour on a range of disputes today, including Syria and Ukraine and the Kremlin\u2019s interference in the domestic politics of Western democracies.Times have changed, Mr. Putin wrote in the decree signed on Monday. \u201cThe threat to strategic stability posed by the hostile actions of the U.S. against Russia, and the inability of the U.S. to deliver on the obligation to dispose of excessive weapons plutonium under international treaties\u201d forced Russia\u2019s hand, he wrote.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the administration was disappointed by the Russian decision since \u201cboth leaders in Russia and the United States have made nonproliferation a priority.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve also been quite disappointed by a range of Russian decisions both in Syria and inside of Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, adding that the decision on the plutonium deal was part of a problematic pattern.Russia will withdraw from the original pact and subsequent amendments, the decree says, meaning that the country will no longer be treaty-bound to destroy its plutonium stockpiles. But the decree also offers an assurance, backed by no bilateral agreement, that the plutonium will not be used for military purposes.Mr. Collins, who was the United States\u2019 ambassador to Russia when the agreement was signed, called the abrogation a \u201cstrange move,\u201d given the extraordinary danger, not least to Russians, should plutonium fall into terrorist hands. He added that it was \u201cin my understanding the first time they have withdrawn from a specific nuclear agreement,\u201d highlighting the slide in relations lately.Russia and the United States had reaffirmed the plutonium disposal agreement in 2009, as President Obama pursued the \u201creset\u201d policy with Dmitri A. Medvedev, then the Russian president.Russia had viewed the agreement as rendering disarmament irreversible by destroying the fissile materials accumulated during the Cold War. In this light, the Russians had interpreted the treaty as requiring that the plutonium be irreversibly transformed into nonexplosive materials by using it in civilian nuclear power plants as a type of fuel, called mixed oxide fuel, or mox. Russia is pressing ahead with that.But glitches and cost overruns in the mox plant at Savannah River, S.C., delayed the American program. This year, Mr. Obama proposed canceling the program in the 2017 budget and instead sending the plutonium for long-term storage at a nuclear waste site in Carlsbad, N.M.The State Department has said the move complies with the treaty, but the Russians have said it does not, as Mr. Putin reaffirmed on Monday.In Mr. Putin\u2019s second term in office, Russia pulled out of a treaty governing conventional forces in Europe in retaliation for the Bush administration\u2019s abrogation of the antiballistic missile treaty that prohibited missile defense systems.Russia and the United States last signed a nuclear disarmament accord in 2009, when both sides agreed to a new limit on delivery vehicles such as bombers or cruise missiles of 500 to 1,100, and a limit on deployed warheads as low as 1,500.In the chaos surrounding the end of the Cold War, the United States embarked on a sweeping program to secure the former Soviet Union\u2019s nuclear arsenal and fissile materials by returning them to Russia from former Soviet states and upgrading security at storage areas.The Soviet nuclear program was so entwined with the economy and society that slowing the Cold War military machine took years and cost United States taxpayers billions of dollars.In several cities, specialized nuclear reactors, for example, continued to pump out plutonium because they were also used to heat water for residential use in showers and space heating in nearby towns.Advertisement"}

That strategy depends on American allies to counter China\u2019s increasing power in the region.On the South China Sea, Mr. Duterte\u2019s move has already tilted the balance of power, said Richard Javad Heydarian, a political scientist at De La Salle University in Manila. By declining to press claims against China over disputed territory there, despite a favorable ruling by a United Nations tribunal, Mr. Duterte has made it hard for the United States to galvanize international pressure on China over the issue.\u201cAlmost single-handedly Duterte has reshaped the regional strategic dynamics, with both Beijing and Washington recalibrating their next move in the South China Sea as they try to anticipate the Filipino strongman\u2019s foreign policy trajectory,\u201d Mr. Heydarian said.Mr. Duterte, who is expected to visit Beijing this month, has made no secret of his worldview.\u201cI will be reconfiguring my foreign policy,\u201d he said in a speech last week. And at some point, \u201cI will break up with America.\u201dOften after Mr. Duterte makes an over-the-top pronouncement, an aide emerges to walk it back. But in this case, the retreat was slight.Mr. Duterte was not seeking a breakup with the United States, the president\u2019s spokesman, Ernesto Abella, explained, so much as \u201can open relationship.\u201dPresident Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has a reputation for frank speechmaking that often angers the international community.Since the Philippines won independence from the United States, its former colonial master, in 1946, Mr. Yasay wrote, \u201cthe United States held on to invisible chains that reined us in towards dependency and submission as little brown brothers not capable of true independence and freedom.\u201dAmerican officials have sought to deflect and diminish the significance of these statements, and emphasize the benefits to the Philippines of the American presence.\u201cOur history of cooperation spans 70 years, and our commitment to this country remains unchanged,\u201d the United States ambassador, Philip S. Goldberg, said Wednesday in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines here. \u201cThe Philippines is a key strategic partner of the United States, and our military alliance, development assistance and commercial cooperation continue.\u201dAlthough Mr. Duterte declared last month that the annual joint military exercises now underway on the island of Luzon would be the last during his administration, American officials said his government had made no formal requests to halt any programs. Nor has it followed up on Mr. Duterte\u2019s threat to eject American forces from the southern Philippines, where a rotating force of 50 to 100 troops helps combat Abu Sayyaf, an Islamic-themed kidnap-for-ransom gang.\u201cAs it has been for decades, our alliance with the Philippines is ironclad,\u201d the American defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, said late last month.The United States is giving the Philippines over $90 million in military aid this year and has provided more than $1 billion in nonmilitary support over the last five years, much of it for disaster relief, American officials said.On Friday, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that \u201cwe can live without\u201d the military aid.Some of the tension between the allies has come from international outrage over Mr. Duterte\u2019s bloody campaign against drugs, which has led to the killing of about 1,400 suspects by the police and hundreds of other extrajudicial killings. It was his concern that Western powers would lecture him over the policy that prompted Mr. Duterte\u2019s denunciation of Mr. Obama, as well as similar tirades against the United Nations and the European Union.Mr. Duterte, 71, identifies himself as a socialist and views the West through the lens of the Cold War and the Philippines as the victim of historic American imperialism.But the recalibration also provides an opportunity to improve ties with China, the region\u2019s biggest military power and largest economy. China was the Philippines\u2019 second-largest trading partner last year, with total trade of $17.6 billion. (The United States was third and Japan first.)China has been making inroads in the region with promises of investment and with its military expansion in the South China Sea, where it has occupied islands claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam and other countries, in some cases building forts.That dispute led to deteriorating relations under the previous Philippines administration, which filed a claim against China with the United Nations maritime tribunal over the Scarborough Shoal, a reef claimed by both nations and occupied by China.But the victory has given Mr. Duterte a stronger hand in negotiations, where he is expected to use the ruling as leverage in reaching his own deal with China in a way that will allow its leaders to save face.In August, he sent former President Fidel Ramos, 88, to Hong Kong to meet with officials in what Mr. Ramos described as an effort to build trust and find common interests.Advisers to the president say one potential deal would be to let China maintain control of Scarborough Shoal if it made concessions such as restoring access to Filipino fishermen and investing in infrastructure development in the Philippines.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to provoke China any further,\u201d Jesus G. Dureza, a longtime friend of Mr. Duterte\u2019s who holds the cabinet post of peace adviser, said in an interview. \u201cHe feels aligning with our allies against China is not going to benefit the country.\u201dMr. Dureza said he and other cabinet members favored opening direct talks with China in part because of fear that, despite a 65-year-old mutual defense treaty, the United States would not be willing to defend the Philippines.\u201cThe idea is that our allies are not going to go to war for us, so why should we align with them?\u201d he said.Relations with Beijing have already grown warmer, he said, with Chinese officials saying that now \u201cwe can talk like Asians across the table with Asians.\u201dAt the same time, despite the sometimes harsh words, Philippine officials have made it clear that the new president does not want to abandon the United States.That statement may suggest a future in which the Philippines plays the big powers against each other.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art Deco Los Angeles", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "The architectural treasures scattered throughout the city are no skyscrapers, but they still soar.Supported byCalifornia\u2019s broad landscape suggests endless possibility, a chance to realize your dreams. You can backpack in the Klamath National Forest within Siskiyou County. You can find a slice of Denmark in the Santa Ynez Valley. Or you can immerse yourself in the glittery landscape of the Hollywood hills, the place that has applied a practicality to its dreams by making an industry of them.You tend to forget about reveries, though, when the 101 freeway slows to a crawl, as it did when I began to navigate the road in Hollywood this spring. Time on my hands, I looked up and caught a glimpse of the 73-story U.S. Bank Tower, referred to as Library Tower by many locals for the 90-year-old actual library and architectural gem across the street that it dwarfs.Some cities have a single architectural identity but Los Angeles is known for many. It was an incubator of the American Craftsman style, and it embraced Beaux-Arts, as well as Spanish Colonial Revival and Mayan Revival, which found a powerful advocate in Frank Lloyd Wright. But then Art Deco arrived and proliferated during the decades when movie studios became the cornerstone of an economy that had previously relied primarily on oil. It left a stunning cache of public buildings in its wake.Most of the Art Deco buildings are smaller than the modern skyscrapers rising in the area, but they still soar. To explore them is to witness a grandeur that inspires you, unlike many skyscrapers, which merely surprise you. Because they arrived at a moment of economic expansion, they suggest the sense of endless possibility that permeated the city. I set off to get a glimpse of what those architectural dreamers were able to accomplish.On an otherwise mild morning, I found myself holding an umbrella in Pershing Square, a public park. The rain quickly tapered off, sparing me the embarrassment of having chosen to visit California on a weekend when the weather was worse than it was in New York.In the early 1920s, Los Angeles was in an enviable position. There was a burgeoning retail market downtown, with stores including A. Hamburger & Sons, Bullock\u2019s and the J. W. Robinson Company strengthening their economic footholds. Automobiles brought so many people here that multiple parking garages were constructed to alleviate the constant traffic backups. The robust Pacific Electric Railway system connected downtown to nearby cities like Pasadena and Whittier, as well as more far-flung places such as Colton and Redlands in San Bernardino County. These developments made the area all the more attractive for architectural innovation.From the late 1920s until the early 1940s, Art Deco was at the height of its popularity in the city. The design style included Zigzag Moderne \u2014 characterized by classic zigzag patterns and setbacks, where buildings featured a wide base, becoming narrower as they rose in height. It also included Streamline Moderne, a subdued style that emphasized horizontal design elements and often had flat roofs and curves.As I walked to the northeast edge of Pershing Square, one the finest examples of Art Deco architecture in the city came into view.It soared, just not excessively. Citywide height ordinances, in place from 1905 until 1957, were enacted to prevent Los Angeles from becoming a carbon copy of skyscraper-laden cities like New York and Chicago.As I looked up from the base of the Title Guarantee Building, I took in the bas-relief sculptures depicting two kneeling men and a central figure that adorned the exterior. John B. Parkinson and Donald Parkinson, the influential father-son team of architects who designed this building and several others, commissioned the artist Eugene Maier-Krieg to design the sculptures. Hugo Ballin, a noted American muralist, designed six panels in the lobby that chronicle the history of the city.I admired the zigzag motif that formed part of the design above the main entrance on West Fifth Street. Because the building is now private, only residents and their guests can enjoy its full glory. Still, the facade alone was engrossing, so it was hard to leave.The Bunker Hill neighborhood, which offers some of the most commanding views of the surrounding area, is just a few paces from the Title Guarantee Building. There, the extent of Art Deco craftsmanship in downtown Los Angeles was on full display.One Bunker Hill, built as the headquarters for Southern California Edison, the electric supply behemoth, rests on a steep slope. When completed in 1931, it was one of the first buildings with an all-electric heat and cooling system in the Western United States. An illuminated \u201cEdison\u201d sign at the top of the building solidified the region as an emerging economic power.One Bunker Hill is now almost surrounded by the U.S. Bank Tower and the 26-story 400 South Hope building, two 1980s-era skyscrapers. It now looks diminutive by comparison, many say. But I was drawn to it, rather than to its tall bookends.The granite and limestone building was designed in a setback style, with architectural offsets on two lower floors, along with two of the upper floors. The central tower at the top of the building is fronted with terra cotta. The corner entrance, featuring a stately octagonal rotunda, has three bas-relief figures on the exterior. The figures, created by the sculptor Robert Merrell Gage, depict power, light and hydroelectricity.One Bunker Hill was envisioned as a monument to energy. The two-story lobby only reaffirmed the intent of architectural grandeur. Natural light poured into the multicolored room, highlighting its indelible features: over a dozen types of marble; gold-leaf ornamentation on the ceiling; and murals by the artists Barse Miller, Conrad Buff and, once again, Hugo Ballin.Mr. Ballin\u2019s mural, \u201cThe Apotheosis of Power,\u201d features the English physicist William Gilbert, a pioneer in the research of magnetism and electrical attraction, and Benjamin Franklin.The building gives you a sense of what Los Angeles wanted to be, and what it has become, part of a huge megalopolis that still shows no signs of slowing down.Bertram Goodhue, designer of the Nebraska State Capitol, and Carleton Winslow Sr. were the architects of the Central Library. The building is topped with a mosaic pyramid-shaped tower. Limestone figures, including a bust of Leonardo da Vinci, are featured on the exterior. The interior of the main rotunda has prominently arched ceilings. The Central Library incorporated so many architectural styles, in addition to Art Deco, that it was almost an early precursor to what the city has become: one of the most culturally diverse places in the world.Beginning in the 1960s, the threat of demolition loomed over the Central Library. In 1978, the Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit organization committed to the preservation of historic buildings in the city, was established largely because of opposition to the proposal. The bulldozers never came. This was an almost unheard-of civic victory in an era when downtowns were rapidly depopulating.As I walked into the rotunda, I noticed that people were enthralled with murals designed by the illustrator Dean Cornwell. Each mural depicts an aspect of the history of California, including the 1781 founding of El Pueblo de los \u00c1ngeles, the Spanish settlement that eventually grew to be modern Los Angeles. The murals prompted conversation, even among strangers. I overheard a man recall being taken to the library as a child, influencing him to do the same for his children.Not all of the buildings survived long enough to inspire memories of family legacies. The Richfield Oil Company Building, which was demolished between late 1968 and 1969, according to Mr. Gleye, \u201cwas one of the most magnificent Art Deco structures anywhere.\u201d Richfield Tower was clad in glazed black architectural terra cotta and gold trimming, with the top of the building resembling an oil derrick. It was the epitome of Zigzag Moderne.But it wasn\u2019t so appealing at the time of its demolition. \u201cIn 1968, people looked back at Art Deco and thought it was ugly and too decorative,\u201d Mr. Gleye said. \u201cA generation has to pass before things are appreciated. After modernism became the leading style, there were very few defenders of Art Deco.\u201dIn place of Richfield Tower sprouted twin 52-story skyscrapers now known as City National Plaza. You can still get a hint of Richfield Tower from two tall zigzag elevator doors that were salvaged in the demolition and have been incorporated near a lobby entrance at the Plaza.The one Art Deco building allowed to exceed height restrictions was City Hall. The architectural team of John C. Austin, Albert C. Martin and John Parkinson created a tall central tower, built with concrete mixed with sand from each of California\u2019s 58 counties. It rises majestically. The building\u2019s upper floors feature symmetrical setbacks, with an eccentric ziggurat top.An open-air observatory on the 27th floor is free and accessible to the general public. From this perch, the city is devilishly inviting. If the visibility is good, you can see Santa Catalina Island. I was not as lucky. However, I did see Los Angeles Union Station, my next stop.Marlyn Musicant, author of \u201cLos Angeles Union Station,\u201d said that the building\u2019s Art Deco elements \u201ccome across so clearly, yet are subtle.\u201dThe white entrance signs have an aesthetically pleasing Streamline Moderne look. In the main waiting area, the vaulted steel-truss ceiling, which gives the appearance of simple wooden beams, radiates a collegiate feel. The red-tiled roof, interior courtyard spaces, arched windows and white stucco create a distinct Mission Revival look.\u201cThe architects wanted to go with a more modern influence,\u201d Ms. Musicant added, \u201cso instead of utilizing wrought-iron chandeliers, the designers went with bronze chandeliers.\u201dUnion Station was designed to serve as a combined rail terminus for the Santa Fe, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railways. With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in Southern California, along with the advent of commercial air travel, rail ridership began to decline sharply in the mid-1950s. The station was becoming a place that, while still remarkable, was seemingly lost in another place and time.\u201cBy the 1960s, Union Station was neglected and had fallen into a sad state,\u201d Ms. Musicant said. \u201cAt one point, there were only 15 trains going out of the station each day.\u201dBeginning in the 1970s, increased Amtrak service gave Union Station some long-overdue energy. The building was restored in 1992, the same year that Metrolink, a regional rail service, began to operate in the station. Metro Rail, the rail system that serves Los Angeles County, has three lines with stops at the station.At some train stations, a cold bench would be a prize, but not in Union Station, which reveals the romanticism of rail travel. Its waiting room has upholstered wooden chairs on the main floor. The travertine walls, doors with Moorish accents, and colorful glazed floor tiles have alluring patterns. The long exterior walkways and outside tower evoke Spanish Missions, while the courtyard areas maintain an aura of tranquillity.As I headed back closer to Pershing Square, the Oviatt Building on South Olive Street came into view. The Art Deco building, named for the entrepreneur James Oviatt, incorporates Italian Romanesque elements, with tiled roofs, cornices, marble and a three-faced French-imported clock. With his business partner Frank Alexander, Mr. Oviatt opened the upscale Alexander & Oviatt haberdashery in 1912.Inspired by a 1925 visit to the Art Deco Exhibition in Paris, Mr. Oviatt commissioned his namesake 1928 building, which housed his store on the lower floors, along with an ornate penthouse apartment where he lived. The penthouse, which also played host to many luminaries during Hollywood\u2019s golden age, is now a popular venue for private events.When the building opened, it featured work from the French designer Ren\u00e9 Lalique and the glassmaker Ga\u00ebtan Jeannin. Much of their original work is gone but the entrance arcade still radiates an Art Deco feel. The arcade, with unique etched-glass panels, immediately caught my eye. Intricate mailbox and elevator doors made from maillechort, an alloy of copper, nickel, and zinc, were designed by Lalique.The footprints of the retail past of downtown Los Angeles are one of the more interesting characteristics of the neighborhood. The area around South Hill Street and South Broadway near Pershing Square boasted some of the busiest and most fashionable stores in the entire region in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1960s, urban decline and rapid population growth in the western edges of the city lured many customers away from downtown, but the buildings remained.The area\u2019s Art Deco legacy gave me a true sense of the walkable nature of downtown. In addition to residential and retail developments, there are various markets and restaurants that have sold ethnic food in the neighborhood for many years.Robert D. Herman, a retired professor of sociology at Pomona College, stressed the importance of the work of the urban studies activist Jane Jacobs and her belief that \u201cmixed-use\u201d developments maintain the vitality and viability of cities.\u201cUniformity and isolation will kill a neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Herman said. \u201cPeople in urban areas expect streets to be part of the urban environment.\u201dThe buildings, though, are what draw your eye. On South Hill Street, the Sun Realty, William Fox, and Harris & Frank buildings are all part of the city\u2019s jewelry district. The buildings opened between 1925 and 1932, and while many of the upper floors featured office space for various businesses, the lower floors all had well-trafficked jewelry stores. And just as I expected, the Art Deco elements were still there.Private lofts now occupy the blue-green Eastern Columbia Building, the 1930 classic designed by Claud Beelman. Formerly the headquarters of the Eastern Outfitting and Columbia Outfitting companies, which sold appliances and clothing, respectively, the building sets the tone for decorative architecture in the city. The entrance extended inward, with a terra cotta sunburst detail that evoked optimism. Topped by a clock tower that loomed over the immediate area, the gold-trimmed building staked its position as a center of commerce.There are many other hidden treasures downtown like the now-shuttered Roxie Theater, the only theater built in downtown Los Angeles solely in Art Deco style; the Title Insurance and Trust Building, now being converted into modern offices; and the beige terra cotta Ninth & Broadway Building, an anchor of the revitalized retail core. The Foreman & Clark Building, formerly the flagship location of the Foreman & Clark department store and recently acquired by a developer, and the Beelman-designed Garfield Building, now vacant, await new futures.As I walked on South Broadway, I noticed an Art Deco building that at one time housed a F & W Grand-Silver Stores retail location and a Hartfield\u2019s Department Store. Now being renovated, the handsome midblock six-story building in many ways represents the resurgence of downtown. Art Deco defined the heights that downtown Los Angeles sought to reach in its infancy as a major city. Generations later, those heights are being unveiled once again.An article on Oct. 9 about Art Deco Los Angeles quoted incorrectly from comments by the author Marlyn Musicant about the design of Union Station. She said that by utilizing bronze chandeliers, the architects wanted \u201ca more modern influence,\u201d not \u201ca more Spanish influence.\u201dJohn L. Dorman is a contributor and a senior news assistant for the Travel section of The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "MetLife Again Faces Off With Regulators Over Its Too-Big-to-Fail Status", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Three judges at Washington\u2019s federal appeals court on Monday questioned the government\u2019s analysis that led to MetLife\u2019s designation as a \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial company, as the Justice Department appeals a lower court\u2019s decision to strip the insurance giant of that label.During arguments that lasted a little more than an hour, the judges explored whether banking regulators should have more explicitly examined the likelihood that MetLife would have failed \u2014 one of the insurer\u2019s central arguments \u2014 rather than just looking at what would happen if it did.They also questioned whether regulators delved deeply enough when analyzing how the insurer\u2019s hypothetical failure would impact the financial system as a whole.Judge Patricia Millett of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the regulators\u2019 conclusions lacked \u201cconcreteness.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not specific enough when you say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s a really bad situation so we assume bad things are going to happen,\u2019\u201d she said.It was the second time lawyers for the regulators and MetLife faced off in court in the fight over whether the insurance company deserved to be labeled a so-called systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, something that brings new standards and extra regulatory oversight.The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act empowered a group of regulators known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate some nonbank firms that could pose a risk to the financial system in times of trouble as SIFIs.But Judge Rosemary Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia threw out MetLife\u2019s SIFI designation in March, arguing that regulators had failed to adequately assess the likelihood that the insurer would experience severe financial distress or the consequences a failure would have on the broader economy. She also noted that regulators did not consider the potential costs of the designation.All three judges at Monday\u2019s arguments pressed Mark B. Stern, a lawyer for the Justice Department, on the issue of vulnerability, including whether regulators had a duty to look at a firm\u2019s likelihood of failure.\u201cThe prediction is a 100 percent chance that it will fail,\u201d said Judge A. Raymond Randolph. \u201cThat\u2019s what the assumption is.\u201dIn response, Mr. Stern argued that the council considered a host of \u201cinterrelated factors\u201d such as leverage that go to the issue of vulnerability, asserting that regulators were never required to assess the likelihood of distress on its own.\u201cWhat the council is trying to determine is not whether but how distress will affect an institution \u2014 in this case, MetLife,\u201d he said.He added that predicting the likelihood of failure was tremendously difficult, noting that very few people, except perhaps those featured in the recent movie \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d would have forecast the collapse of American International Group before the financial crisis. But Mr. Stern argued that its near-failure in September 2008 and the consequences were devastating.\u201cA.I.G. is instructive,\u201d Mr. Stern said.While the line of questioning at the hearing appeared sympathetic to MetLife\u2019s arguments, the judges also asked some pointed questions of the insurer\u2019s lawyer, Eugene Scalia, son of Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court justice. They pressed him about whether regulators had acted within the law in applying the SIFI designation, even if they did not conduct the exact analysis that the insurer itself would have preferred.In addition, the judges asked Mr. Scalia about whether it was the job of the regulatory council to estimate the potential costs and benefits of the SIFI label.Mr. Scalia emphasized that the designation itself had already posed significant costs on the firm, including millions of dollars in assessments to the government. He said that MetLife had hosted about a dozen examiners who were overseeing its activities before the March ruling.\u201cWhat the council did was trigger\u201d the duties and burdens now facing MetLife, he said.Any court ruling could have broad implications for the council\u2019s designations process going forward, including the handling of firms it has already labeled. In addition to MetLife, regulators have named A.I.G., Prudential Financial and General Electric\u2019s finance unit as SIFIs, though G.E. succeeded in removing the label earlier this year after shedding significant assets.Before the arguments, analysts had predicted the federal government had a slight edge in its appeals case, because two of the judges, Ms. Millet and Sri Srinivasan, were appointed to the court by President Obama; this potentially makes them more inclined to defer to the expert judgment of the regulators who came to assume these new regulatory mandates during the Obama administration. Judge Randolph is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, and Judge Collyer of the Federal District Court was appointed by former President George W. Bush.The tough questions posed at the hearing suggested the court may not be so lenient, though there is a high bar for judges in deciding that regulators have acted inappropriately.The government has also tapped some financial policy heavyweights on its behalf. The former Federal Reserve chairmen Ben Bernanke and Paul Volcker filed a friend-of-the-court brief this summer that supported the council\u2019s conclusions. And more than a dozen current and former members of Congress \u2014 including former Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and former Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, the primary authors of the Dodd-Frank Act \u2014 submitted their own filing.\u201cThe district court\u2019s decision, if upheld, would fundamentally undermine the program that Congress put in place when it enacted Dodd-Frank to try to prevent such financial crises from occurring in the future,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.Advertisement"}

A couple of variations on Mr. DeBellevue\u2019s name contribute to the impression of a gifted but bored student doodling during a lecture.So do the paintings, which mimic round-faced clocks and hang high on the wall as they would in a classroom. Another series of \u201ctime-based works\u201d (as Mr. DeBellevue calls them) consists of rectangular panels evoking shadowy surveillance footage or aerial landscapes and bearing bright-orange, faux-digital time signatures. Mr. DeBellevue may be trying to conjure a brooding, Nauman-esque vision of the artist\u2019s life, with lots of productive puttering and vacillating in the studio. But you sense that his inspiration comes more from interaction with materials (like the pistachio shells and plaid plastic bags that make up another, more promising group of paintings) than from 3 a.m. ruminations.KAREN ROSENBERGObjects in the show are called tools, and include a 1962 Yoko Ono proposal with instructions to carry on a dialogue composed entirely of questions, hence, an open-ended exchange in which no one has the answers.

The vehicle had a starring role in \u201cLa Suburban Negra,\u201d or \u201cThe Black Suburban,\u201d his 2012 installation and video about the drug trade, in which he plays a drug lord, a hit man and a cop.\u201cThe police, the bad guys, the C.I.A., the soccer moms \u2014 everybody with authority has a black Suburban,\u201d he explained as he barreled down Interstate 5 toward the border, making a slight detour for a strawberry ice cream cone.For young men growing up in Tijuana, as Mr. Ram\u00edrez did, the three characters he portrays in \u201cThe Black Suburban\u201d are potential life choices. He eventually opted for a fourth path: as a Conceptual artist whose work grapples with \u201cthe frictions produced by human interactions\u201d in the dual worlds on either side of the United States border with Mexico.Even amid calls by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, for building a wall at that border, the art scene in the San Diego-Tijuana megalopolis has assumed a consciously and exuberantly binational ethos.The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, a mere 17 miles from the Western Hemisphere\u2019s busiest land border crossing, has been at the forefront of collecting and exhibiting the work of Tijuana-based artists. The museum\u2019s leadership views the proximity to the border as a \u201csweet spot\u201d that helps lure younger audiences, said Hugh M. Davies, the museum\u2019s director.Mr. Ram\u00edrez, an internationally recognized artist whose work has appeared at the Whitney Biennial, made headlines in 1997 by installing a 33-foot-high two-headed Trojan horse in the fume-choked highway median on the American side of the border crossing. He is a ringleader of an increasingly visible fraternity of artists \u2014 Mr. Davies calls them \u201cthe straddlers\u201d \u2014 who ricochet back and forth across \u201cla linea,\u201d as the border is colloquially known.To reach his studio in the Colonia Libertad section, where he grew up, Mr. Ram\u00edrez leaves the relatively somnolent streets of downtown San Diego for a city of 1.3 million, where it\u2019s not uncommon to encounter fire jugglers, Michael Jackson impersonators or teetering clowns on stilts at traffic stops.Resonantly, perhaps, Mr. Ram\u00edrez has received a commission from the United States General Services Administration to create a work for the expanded Port of Entry in San Ysidro, Calif., the busiest border crossing.Their pilgrimage began in Brookings, Ore., where the two artists, accompanied by a filmmaker, Jos\u00e9 Inerzia, traipsed through sand and fog to plant the first obelisk on a windswept beach. For the Mexican-born Mr. Ram\u00edrez, the treaty that severed Mexico from over half its territorial lands represented a wound. \u201cIt was a wound with no scar,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo we acknowledged the loss by making a scar for the wound\u201d \u2014 with the location of each obelisk mapped on Google Earth.Mr. Taylor was game for the project after spending seven years photographing the 276 cast-iron and stone monuments, now lonely, that defined the present-day border before the fence was built. Many are in desolate wilderness areas that required Indiana Jones-style derring-do to locate. \u201cWe talk about the border as this monolithic phenomenon,\u201d he observed. \u201cBut it\u2019s a series of places with unique identities.\u201dIn a nondescript Tijuana building painted with a red heart, the 44-year-old artist Alida Cervantes explores the stratification of Mexican society. On a recent morning, her studio brimmed with paintings of voluptuous women in classical attire, inspired by glittery Oaxacan folk ceramics.Ms. Cervantes, who was born into affluence in Tijuana, grew up with the notion that it \u201cwas just dust, gas stations and prostitutes, and not a real cultural place,\u201d she said. Now her hometown fortifies her.She lives in San Diego but commutes daily to Tijuana. She views the border as a metaphor for \u201ccollisions, for things that aren\u2019t meant to be together put together.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m addicted to both worlds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a boyfriend on the side.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Migrant Workers in Recreational Vehicles", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byRetiringEAST GRAND FORKS, Minn. \u2014 Michael Shoemaker is sitting at a picnic table in front of his recreational vehicle on an early October evening here at the Red River State Recreation Area. \u201cI woke up to a realization this morning,\u201d Mr. Shoemaker, who is 69, says with a deadpan expression. \u201cThe only way I will have a smoking hot body is when I\u2019m cremated.\u201dHe cracks up. \u201cI love telling jokes,\u201d he says.Mr. Shoemaker is a work camper, one of thousands of modern-day nomads who live in their motor homes or trailers, traveling from campground to campground for seasonal jobs. A majority of work campers are in the second half of life, many well into the traditional retirement years.Mr. Shoemaker, who has worked, among other places, behind retailing counters at Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, as well as the spring training camp for the Kansas City Royals and Texas Rangers in Arizona, has joined 550 work campers hired to help stack and store the sugar beet harvest for American Crystal Sugar along the border of North Dakota and Minnesota.The work-camping community illuminates many trends shaping and being shaped by baby boomers, including the search for both money and meaning in life as they grow older. Work campers (often shortened to workampers) run the gamut from low-income retirees to the well-heeled. But they all seem to thrive on a mobile lifestyle that works for those who prize their independence but may strike many of their peers as rootless.\u201cThey\u2019re retired and need money,\u201d says Al Sorensen, 70, the work-camper liaison for the sugar beet harvest for Express Employment Professionals in Grand Forks, N.D. \u201cBut they\u2019re tired of the plain old corporate life.\u201dThe work combines elements of the gig economy, telecommuting and contingent labor increasingly commonplace among American workers. Like the gig economy, the schedule is flexible and, in a sense, work campers do their job from their home \u2014 that is, a mobile home.The pay is low, typically $7.25 to $12 an hour. And a lot of the jobs are hard: One of the more popular is working during seasonal peaks in an Amazon warehouse fetching orders. Most work campers do not put in enough hours to make a living wage.On the other side of the equation, the rewards include traveling America\u2019s highways and byways, working at a variety of tasks and spending time in campgrounds near beautiful scenery. Work camping also comes with a measure of freedom, particularly for those who have Social Security and a pension to fall back on. Bad manager? Rev up the R.V. Don\u2019t like the work? Head for the hills.Wearing a blue hard-hat and a yellow safety vest at an American Crystal storage and processing facility, Bill McClain is working the harvest for the sixth time. He is 60 years old and a self-described \u201ceconomic refugee.\u201dMr. McClain owned a Harley-Davidson shop in Hesperia, Calif., for 22 years. The disheartening combination of the economic downturn and increased state regulations, he said, pushed him and his wife to sell everything in 2010, buy a Holiday Rambler R.V. and join the work-camping community.\u201cI like the lifestyle 90 percent of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I hate the job, I just do it. But we don\u2019t go back.\u201d When the sugar beet harvest is done, they plan to hit the road and spend time with family. After that, seasonal jobs in Arizona and California beckon.\u201cThere is work all over the country,\u201d Mr. McClain said. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2018cruising the 70s.\u2019 You try and stay at 70 degrees as much as possible.\u201d\u201cMost, I believe, are motivated by the general impression that their savings may be gone before they are,\u201d she emailed from her 28-foot Safari Trek R.V. on the road near Las Vegas. \u201cWorkamping allows them to enjoy their years on the road without fear of depleting their savings.\u201dThe sugar beet harvest is considered good pay. Newcomers start out at $12.85 an hour for 12-hour shifts. (Experienced workers and machine operators get more.) Four of those hours are overtime Monday through Friday; Saturday is at 1.5 times pay and Sunday two times. The campsite fees are paid for by the employer, a common arrangement.Many of the jobs involve assisting the operators stacking sugar beets in piles 30 feet high, about 80 feet across and a quarter-mile to a half-mile long. Other jobs include picking up sugar beet bags weighing roughly 30 pounds for testing at the quality lab. The harvest lasts only 10 to 12 days, depending on the weather.Vicky Loftis, formerly of Caruthers, Calif., says she is enjoying the experience. She is 50 and a first-timer in the Red River Valley. \u201cI wanted the adventure of the harvest,\u201d she says. \u201cIn 20 years I can say I worked the sugar beets.\u201dMs. Loftis had a small business helping disabled people learn computers. She owned her \u201cbricks and sticks\u201d home (a common phrase among work campers for a traditional house). She was deeply unhappy. \u201cI was drowning,\u201d she recalled.Single and with no children, Ms. Loftis decided to significantly change her life. She walked away from her business, sold her home and possessions and now lives full time in her weather-beaten R.V., previously owned by her father.She generally works from her motor home on computer-based jobs. Her first seasonal job before the harvest was at a campground high in the mountains near Tucson. It was a change of pace. Among her tasks were checking in campers and cleaning toilets. The extra money is earmarked toward her long-term project of remodeling and upgrading her R.V.\u201cI gifted this lifestyle for myself on my 50th birthday,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is so much to see. I am free to go where I want to go.\u201dSome work campers say they don\u2019t really need the money. For Buddy and Cindy Ward, it\u2019s mostly about having fun and allowing them to pay for their children and grandchildren to visit them over holiday periods. They enjoyed a number of adventures after selling a successful glass installation business they had built from scratch in Georgia. Married 51 years, they became work campers five years ago with their sleek black-and-gold R.V. around the time Mr. Ward, who is now 71, had a stroke.\u201cHis stroke was an eye-opener,\u201d Ms. Ward, 69, said. \u201cIf you want to do something, do it. We love this.\u201dAs for Mr. Shoemaker, the jokester, he retired in 2010 from his job as a machine operator making armor for the Abrams tank at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. Following in the footsteps of his brother and his sister-in-law, he now travels in his R.V. with two Shih Tzus, Kobie and Katie.His previous job was at the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota. He had never worked the sugar beet harvest and he thought he would give it a try since it was only about 600 miles from Crazy Horse.Since he is experienced and comfortable working with machinery, he was hired to operate a beet piler \u2014 a large, elongated yellow machine reminiscent of a praying mantis. \u201cI can still shovel and work with the best of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI am enjoying the heck out of this.\u201dMr. Shoemaker has a pension from Idaho National and receives Social Security. His R.V. is almost paid off. The seasonal work supplements his income.But the real lure for him, he says, is that the lifestyle keeps him engaged and active. He is intrigued by a job opportunity at a fishing camp in Montana for his next gig after the harvest.\u201cI watched my dad retire, sit in a chair and die a miserable death,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI won\u2019t do that. You have to have a purpose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Russia-U.S. Partnership, Driven to a New Low", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byThe Russia of the past two years seems to no longer care about lasting partnerships or international agreements. It scorns predictability and dependability as weaknesses. Its one successful reform since 2000 has been to revamp and re-equip its armed forces. Russia\u2019s resources are stretched, but Mr. Putin seems determined to overcome those disparities with the West with political and military agility.The depth of harm this has done to efforts to build a partnership between Russia and the West was evident last week, when a Syrian bombardment of a hospital near Damascus, in the wake of the failure of a cease-fire, prompted the American secretary of state, John Kerry, to suggest that Russia and its ally Syria be investigated for potential war crimes.In an extraordinary move, the Kremlin on Tuesday canceled a visit by Mr. Putin to France; a comment by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande the day before that Russia might have committed war crimes was seen here as the likely reason.The Kremlin\u2019s intensifying confrontation with the West has already put the Russian economy under severe strain. But the Russian population seems to accept falling incomes and general uncertainty as the price of what its leaders portray as a national resurgence. Encouraged by the jingoistic state-run media, Russian society seems to applaud war policies that would subject a Western leader to fierce inquiries or removal from office by a disapproving electorate (the British prime minister Tony Blair\u2019s fate after his acquiescence in the American-led Iraq war is one example).Arguably, Russia is the only major power that no longer hesitates to shatter longstanding relationships with others. Mr. Kerry\u2019s latest condemnation followed by a few days Mr. Putin\u2019s decision to withdraw Russia from a longstanding treaty under which Russians and Americans were reducing their stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium. The bill Mr. Putin sent to Parliament for approval included a list of unrealistic conditions under which Moscow might return to honoring the treaty \u2014 a clear signal that the matter was closed. The conditions included a lifting of all sanctions imposed on Russia over Ukraine, compensation for all losses suffered in Russia as a result, and the reduction of America\u2019s military presence in Central and Eastern Europe.Mr. Putin\u2019s decision to withdraw from the agreement was announced soon after an American decision to suspend negotiations with Russia for a new cessation of hostilities in Syria, where the Obama administration said Moscow had broken its previous commitments. In turn, Russia accused the United States of shifting blame for the cease-fire\u2019s breakdown.All of this took place in the shadow of horrific violence in the rebel-held eastern parts of the Syrian city of Aleppo, where 275,000 people are besieged and under Russian and Syrian government bombardment. The health and water supply systems neared the verge of total destruction amid reports that the pro-government forces were going after whatever was left of eastern Aleppo\u2019s medical clinics and infrastructure.The scenario was straight from Mr. Putin\u2019s playbook. Pushing talks into a tight corner while intensifying the use of force was a tactic Russia used repeatedly during the hot phases of the Ukrainian war in 2014. Strobe Talbott in February contrasted the American use of \u201cdiplomacy backed by force\u201d in the Balkans in the 1990s to Russia\u2019s current use of \u201cforce backed by diplomacy.\u201dIn Syria, Russian officials pay lip service to the humanitarian aspect of the siege, but dismiss it in practice. \u201cThe rebels of Aleppo are interested only in a kind of cease-fire that allows them to bring in more arms and replenish ammunition,\u201d the daily Vedomosti quoted an unnamed source in the Russian Ministry of Defense as saying last weekend, in an effort to explain why a new cease-fire would be hard to reach. \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the source continued, \u201cthe government army is not strong enough to take Aleppo quickly.\u201d The result: an agreement and an end to the carnage are as distant as ever.Still, the Kremlin is convinced it is playing a winning game, so long as the United States is reluctant to intervene and Syrians, not Russians, absorb most of the casualties and damage. Even with the painfully slow pace of progress by Syrian government forces, Russia is unlikely to introduce ground forces (a politically dangerous move back home), and just as unlikely to abandon its ally, President Bashar al-Assad.What Mr. Putin seems to think Syria offers is a magic portal that will help Russia leap to a new level of international recognition. Russia no longer sees itself as a power seeking to escape isolation imposed by the West for occupying Crimea and intervening in Ukraine. Instead, it pursues the claim of a victorious power whose transgressions become irrelevant because winners don\u2019t have to justify themselves.In hindsight, it is clear that the Russian and American administrations have both contributed to the current bilateral freeze. Just calling Russia a declining regional power, or counting on that status to bring it to heel, is not a strategy. At this point, it would be a herculean task for any new president to re-establish trust. Aleksandr Baunov, a Russian writer on foreign policy, has suggested that Mr. Putin had an unacknowledged goal for the impossible conditions of his legislation: He would drive the American-Russian relationship so low that a new American president would have no room to drive it lower. Releasing the tension would be hard too, because that would look like complying with Mr. Putin\u2019s legislation. And Moscow seems to prefer the current state of unnerving alarm to seeking a new easing of tensions.In short, the Kremlin has made its decisions: Put the onerous domestic problems aside, play the power game, do not blink, and call everything the West says a bluff. A victory, this thinking goes, will one day recoup all costs.But what kind of victory would that be? Is there a city or a region that Russia might occupy that would bring Russia\u2019s own citizens prosperity? Any regime presiding over a backward oil-dependent economy will not be able to modernize it by waging wars and poisoning every relationship it still has. It may not happen soon, but someday in the future, Russia will have to take up the hard work of fixing both its economic base and its position among its peers.Maxim Trudolyubov, editor at large at the business newspaper Vedomosti, writes The Russia File blog for the Kennan Institute and is a fellow at the Bosch Academy in Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rodrigo Duterte, Pushing Split With U.S., Counters Philippines\u2019 Deep Ties", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported by\u201cI want them out,\u201d he said of the American troops in his country.While his threats have tapped a deep strain of resentment among Filipinos who feel as if they are treated like a second-class ally, the country\u2019s deep cultural, economic and military ties to the United States make it unlikely that they will follow him on the path to divorce.Especially not, as Mr. Duterte suggested in Beijing last week, all the way to China.The close relationship between the Philippines and the United States, while complicated and at times acrimonious, has existed for more than a century, and the Philippines has been the closest American ally in the region for 70 years.Mr. Duterte\u2019s vow to upend that kinship has frustrated even some of his supporters.\u201cI voted for him, but I\u2019m not sure what he is doing right now,\u201d said Jess Custodio, 56, a bank executive in Manila. \u201cIt is baffling to me. It would tear out the heart of many Filipinos to separate.\u201dThe bonds with the United States run wide and deep. About four million Filipinos and Filipino-Americans live in the United States, and the money they send home to relatives is a mainstay of the Philippine economy.Another major sector of the economy \u2014 call centers, largely serving American companies \u2014 employs more than one million Filipinos. Partly because of the high level of English spoken in the Philippines, the industry is one of the fastest-growing segments.American movies, music, fashion and consumer goods are popular here. In an earlier era, Filipinos working in the United States would send \u201cbalikbayan boxes\u201d filled with hard-to-get American food and gifts. Now, shopping malls are packed with American-brand clothes, cosmetics, appliances, foods and other products.Whenever the Philippines has been included by Pew in surveys dating back to 1999, more Filipinos have had a favorable view of the United States than people in any other country.That support extends to the military, where there is considerable backing for the partnership with the United States, especially the assistance that American forces have provided in combating extremists in the southern Philippines. Many Filipino military officers were trained in the United States, and the two nations have staged joint military exercises for decades.\u201cPresident Duterte risks creating a lethal combination of adversaries if he moves to truncate the alliance with the United States,\u201d said Ernest Z. Bower, the president of the consulting firm BowerGroupAsia. \u201cHe would alienate his military, which wants the help of the U.S.\u201dThe military has at times played a major role in political affairs and has twice sided with civilian protesters in ousting presidents.The talk of separation has also caused anxiety among some foreign businesses, which may become more cautious in investing or expanding operations here, analysts said.And after he returned from Beijing last week, he sought to soften his call for separation. He did not mean cutting diplomatic relations, he explained, which would not be feasible.\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause the Filipinos in the United States will kill me.\u201dThe Obama administration did not respond directly to Mr. Duterte\u2019s latest threat, but the White House repeated its concerns about what it called his unhelpful rhetoric. The administration has sought to play down the prospect of a rupture in the alliance, in part because officials are not yet certain whether Mr. Duterte\u2019s comments will translate into lasting policy changes.The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said on Wednesday that the threats \u201ccontribute to some uncertainty, and that uncertainty is inconsistent with what has for the last seven decades been a rock-solid alliance that\u2019s benefited people and governments in both countries.\u201dTo Mr. Duterte, those seven decades are largely about abuse and exploitation. His foreign minister, Perfecto Yasay Jr., recently said the Philippines must shake off the \u201cinvisible chains\u201d of being the Americans\u2019 \u201clittle brown brothers.\u201dThe United States took the Philippines from Spain in 1898, inheriting Spain\u2019s war against Muslim rebels who were seeking independence. Fighting continued for decades in the southern Philippines, where Islamic rebels still operate today.When Japan occupied the Philippines during World War II, Gen. Douglas MacArthur famously returned to drive out the Japanese forces. Many Filipinos still see him as a hero.The United States granted the Philippines independence after the war. Since then, the countries have maintained close economic ties and a strong military alliance, including a mutual defense treaty that dates from 1951.Another low point in the relationship resulted from Washington\u2019s support for the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. After his ouster in 1986, the Philippines adopted a new constitution banning foreign military bases, which led to the eviction of American forces from Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base.Relations later recovered, and the 2014 agreement allowed the United States to maintain a small force on five Philippine military bases. It was that agreement that Mr. Duterte threatened to cancel on Wednesday.His policy shift has put Japan, another important ally of the United States in Asia and the Philippines\u2019 largest trading partner, in the delicate position of trying to retain a balance in an increasingly tense region where Japan fears any further tilt toward China.In a meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Duterte and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan discussed the importance of both the alliance between Japan and the United States and the alliance between the Philippines and the United States.If the Philippines is the most American-friendly country in the world, the anti-American view has a strong constituency as well. Even among the military, there are complaints that the United States often provides outdated hardware, second-rate hand-me-downs.\u201cDuterte has indeed tapped into a deep and atavistic frustration of many Filipinos that the U.S. approach to their country has been paternalistic,\u201d Mr. Bower said. \u201cThese feelings are real, and sharpened by the coexisting affinity for U.S. culture, brands and people.\u201dMr. Duterte has long said he believed Mr. Meiring was a terrorist spirited away illegally by American operatives to avoid a trial on criminal charges.Only recently have American officials begun speaking publicly about the case. Ambassador Philip Goldberg said in a television interview on Tuesday that he understood the president\u2019s concern but that he believed that no laws were broken.\u201cHe was transported by international air ambulance with no stop order, no arrest order, for further treatment because his family wanted to make sure his life was saved and wanted advanced medical care,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said.For all Mr. Duterte\u2019s talk, the United States has not received any request to curtail programs, reduce cooperation, cut aid or sever ties, the embassy here said. But if Mr. Duterte\u2019s goal was to receive more attention from Washington, he has succeeded.Assistant Secretary of State Daniel R. Russel, a top State Department official, visited Manila this week and met with Mr. Yasay.Afterward, Mr. Russel told reporters that the United States fully supported the Philippines\u2019 having an independent foreign policy and welcomed a reduction in tensions between Manila and Beijing. But he also cautioned that confusion created by Mr. Duterte\u2019s comments was \u201cbad for business.\u201d\u201cThe succession of controversial comments, and a real climate of uncertainty about the Philippines\u2019 intentions, has created consternation in many countries, not only in mine, and not only among governments,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is growing concern in other communities and the expat Filipino community, in corporate board rooms as well. That\u2019s not a positive trend.\u201dMr. Duterte responded true to form on Tuesday, lashing out at the American business community before leaving for Japan.\u201cGo ahead, pack your bags,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will sacrifice. We will recover, I assure you.\u201dMotoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Plants Go to Mexico, but U.S. Jobs Stay Around", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 In the summer of 2008, with the Great Recession underway and Detroit\u2019s auto industry in a free fall, Ford Motor took a big gamble: It would switch three of its North American assembly plants from building trucks and sport utility vehicles to making small passenger cars.With gasoline prices rising above $4 a gallon at the time and truck sales plummeting, Ford was losing billions and \u2014 along with General Motors and Chrysler \u2014 teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.The centerpiece of Ford\u2019s transition was its plant in Wayne, Mich. There, the company would replace production of big S.U.V.s with that of compact cars, on the assumption that consumer demand had shifted permanently toward smaller vehicles.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a sustainable company if we don\u2019t do this,\u201d Alan R. Mulally, then Ford\u2019s chief executive, said at the time.But eight years later, Ford, the nation\u2019s second-largest automaker after G.M., is once again reversing course in Wayne.Mr. Trump and others have criticized Ford for creating jobs in Mexico rather than in the United States. Seldom mentioned by Ford\u2019s critics, though, is an essential fact. The Wayne factory will remain fully staffed, with 3,700 workers, to build what Ford really needs now: more trucks and S.U.V.s.There is no doubt that Nafta has played a role in the migration of many American manufacturing jobs to Mexico in the last 22 years. Before the trade agreement, United States automakers barely had a presence in Mexico. Now, Mexico\u2019s car-making work force is about 675,000 strong, according to the Mexican auto industry\u2019s trade association.But the story of Ford\u2019s Wayne plant makes clear that many factors determine the number of auto-making jobs in the United States \u2014 a figure that according to federal labor statistics has actually grown by 200,000 jobs, to around 900,000, since the recession gave way to economic recovery in 2009. The reasons include the state of the economy, the profitability of the vehicles being produced, the strength of the dollar, and how well or not each carmaker\u2019s products are faring in the marketplace.One big consideration now is the same as it was in 2008: the price of gasoline. But this time it is historically cheap gas \u2014 in the $2 range \u2014 that is helping determine the kind of cars that consumers want and that automakers therefore need to make.About three in five new vehicles sold in the United States in September were trucks or sport utility vehicles, according to the research firm Autodata. Analysts see no sign that demand for roomy, utilitarian pickups and S.U.V.s will abate as long as gas prices remain low.Rather than a frenzied Nafta-driven flight to the bottom of the labor market, in other words, Ford\u2019s retooling of its Wayne factory is more a nuanced reflection of the industry\u2019s desire to keep pace with growing demand for high-profit trucks and S.U.V.s, while continuing to produce less expensive car models at lower costs with the cheaper wages paid in Mexico.Ford\u2019s Wayne factory signifies the reality of the marketplace. Simply put, Detroit cannot make money producing small cars in the United States, where an established union worker \u2014 not counting entry-level employees \u2014 might earn about $29 an hour, more than triple the wages of a Mexican employee.Ford\u2019s chief executive, Mark Fields, has vigorously defended the company\u2019s Mexico strategy. He cites the 55,000 hourly workers the company employs in the United States and the 25,000 jobs it has added since the depths of the recession.But he does not back down on the business rationale for moving the slow-selling Focus to Mexico and devoting higher-paid American workers to making popular trucks and S.U.V.s. The Focus has experienced a decline of almost 20 percent in annual sales in the last four years.Mr. Trump and his advisers are not persuaded by Ford\u2019s rationale, though.\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that Ford and other companies are offering consolation prizes while shipping tens of thousands of jobs overseas,\u201d Scott Hagerstrom, the director of the Trump campaign in Michigan, said in an email message on Monday.\u201cHowever, when you look at the devastation and job loss caused by Bill Clinton\u2019s Nafta in places like Detroit and Flint,\u201d Mr. Hagerstrom continued, \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that American workers would prefer to have new jobs created in the United States, instead of Mexico and elsewhere.\u201dFord does not release profit margins on its various vehicles. But analysts generally say that each small car generates less than $2,000 in profit for an automaker, compared with as much as $10,000 for option-laden S.U.V.s.\u201cYes, we are moving small-car production out of Michigan down to Mexico, but we have to be customer-driven,\u201d Mr. Fields said during a recent taping of the public television show \u201cAutoline.\u201d \u201cIn the lower segment of the market, customers want to have certain value, and we have to deliver that.\u201dBesides, Ford has its own market struggles to contend with. The United States auto market, after its heady six-year recovery, has recently started slowing and over all was essentially flat in September. But Ford\u2019s vehicle sales were actually down sharply, by 8 percent, from the same period last year.\u201cFord\u2019s struggles on the car side are pulling its total numbers down, even as most automakers hold steady with the overall market,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an analyst for the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.G.M. and Fiat Chrysler \u2014 despite also downsizing their American work forces and factories during the last recession \u2014 share Ford\u2019s desire to keep their remaining plants in the United States thriving.After the painful cutbacks during the recession, the Detroit companies are loath to close any existing facilities, in part to keep peace with the United Automobile Workers union. What is more, plants like the one in Wayne are staffed by experienced workers and able to deliver high-quality products. The automakers are also intent on protecting their billions of dollars of assets in factories in the United States that are already up and running.It is unlikely, though, that any Detroit automakers will invest in new manufacturing plants in the United States. Mexico is simply too attractive an option for carmakers looking to add to their overall North American production capacity.\u201cNine of the last 11 auto factories built in North America have been in Mexico,\u201d said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied auto production trends over the last 30 years. \u201cThe fact is Mexico offers high productivity and low wages, and that is a hard combination to beat.\u201dFord is hardly alone in expanding its Mexican production.G.M. is investing $5 billion to upgrade its plants in Mexico. Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda and BMW are all adding jobs and new products at their Mexican facilities. And as with Ford, any manufacturing those companies keep in the United States will probably involve more expensive vehicles whose profit margins justify the higher labor costs of building them.Given the broad industry trends, Ford has found it vexing to bear the brunt of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks. The company notes that it revamped its operations during the recession without resorting to bankruptcy and government bailouts as G.M. and Chrysler did.The company\u2019s executive chairman, Bill Ford, recently said he had met with Mr. Trump to state Ford\u2019s case that it had been a responsible corporate citizen.\u201cWe are everything he should be celebrating in this country,\u201d Mr. Ford said at an automotive forum earlier this month in Detroit. \u201cWe pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps.\u201dNeal E. Boudette contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Takes Advantage of a Republican Party Pitted Against Itself", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaFour years ago, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, won the first fall debate with a smoothly delivered promise of cooperation. While President Obama had rebuffed Republicans, Mr. Romney would \u201cwork on a collaborative basis\u201d with Democrats.That upbeat message, fanciful then, has now lost any veneer of plausibility. As Donald J. Trump approaches his second debate with Hillary Clinton, Republicans are struggling more than ever to work with each other, much less the other side.Instead of negotiation, the party\u2019s story in the Obama era has been one of gathering anger within a conservative base increasingly dominated by working-class whites.That anger won Republicans control of Congress, but also led to the ouster of a House speaker, set the rank-and-file against other party leaders and was crucial to the nomination of a presidential candidate who burdens the rest of the ticket.It wasn\u2019t always that way, as Republican leaders were able to harness that negative energy at first. After Mr. Obama inherited an economy in crisis, they fanned the Tea Party rebellion against his stimulus program, his health care plan and bailouts for Wall Street and the auto industry.Less noticed was the fact that Mr. Trump was building a political profile by questioning the birthplace and thus constitutional legitimacy of the first African-American president.As Republicans gained responsibility for governing, the flames turned inward. In 2011, after regaining a majority in the House, they shoved leaders aside and caused a credit downgrade by balking at an increase in the debt limit. Then the government was shut down; the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, was defeated by a Tea Party challenger in Virginia; and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, resigned under pressure.After Mr. Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat exposed the limits of relying on white voters in a diversifying nation, the Republican National Committee called for outreach to Latino voters through new immigration policies. Hostility from working-class conservatives, irate over cultural change and diminished economic prospects, scuttled that effort.In the 2016 primaries, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, two champions of Latino support, were punished, and the party was left with Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, two finalists for the presidential nomination that Republican officeholders loathed but could not stop.Mr. Trump prevailed by channeling Republican anger most skillfully \u2014 against foes inside the party, like Mr. Cruz, and out. To the chagrin of fellow Republicans now facing general election battles, he hasn\u2019t stopped.Since securing the nomination, Mr. Trump has openly denigrated a Mexican-American federal judge, the Muslim parents of a fallen American soldier and a former Miss Universe. He offers sweeping condemnations of life in African-American communities.Political researchers, and some Republican intellectuals, have identified a correlation between support for Mr. Trump and racial resentment of nonwhites. \u201cThe gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism,\u201d Avik Roy, an Indian-American who has been a policy adviser for Mr. Romney and Mr. Rubio, lamented this summer.The rise of Mr. Trump threatens fellow Republicans who must appeal to broader constituencies, now and in the future. Prominent voices within the party, including editorial writers at conservative newspapers and top officials in past Republican administrations, have strongly denounced him.Asked in a debate this week whether Mr. Trump represented a role model for children, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, answered \u201cabsolutely.\u201dWithin hours she found that answer such a liability that she withdrew it, explaining \u201cI misspoke.\u201dMitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, in theory allied with his party\u2019s nominee, tried this week to avoid that pitfall altogether.Asked to discuss Mr. Trump, who currently draws support from more than eight in 10 Republicans, Mr. McConnell told reporters, \u201cI choose not to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Debate That Wasn\u2019t: So Many Words, So Few About Policy", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byThe three presidential debates had no shortage of discussion about groping, beauty queens and Twitter habits. A question on energy policy this month was memorable only because it gave rise to a meme about the red sweater sported by the voter, Ken Bone, who asked it. Even on Wednesday, when the moderator made policy a priority, the discussion between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton remained skin deep.Lost in the bluster and bombast has been the kind of detailed policy talk that traditionally consumes candidates this time of year. While onstage stalking and shimmying kept body-language experts busy, many who care about tax policy, immigration, health care and climate change were left with little to chew on.Undecided voters curious where the candidates stood on American relations with Israel or their views on the Keystone XL oil pipeline were left to look elsewhere. But even the subjects that did come up didn\u2019t result in robust discussions of how the nation\u2019s most pressing problems should be solved.Following are some of the issues that got short shrift.Debate audiences have heard much jousting over how little Mr. Trump has paid in income taxes, but far less about how much voters will have to pay if he or Mrs. Clinton is elected.Mr. Trump accused her of wanting a big tax increase; Mrs. Clinton said his tax plan would send the country spinning into a recession. A minor tussle about the future of \u201ccarried interest\u201d was pretty much it: more finger food than main course.Mr. Norquist, who prefers Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan, has been clamoring to hear more about how it will help businesses and spur economic growth. And why was no attention paid to the taxation of companies in the \u201csharing economy,\u201d like Uber and Airbnb?The construction of a wall along the United States\u2019 border with Mexico has been a centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and an immigration overhaul is an important priority for Mrs. Clinton, yet the topic received scant attention.Mr. Trump promised to get \u201cbad hombres\u201d out of the country. But little light was shed on how he or Mrs. Clinton would prioritize the removal of undocumented immigrants, or what must be done differently to secure the border beyond existing measures.The future of the Supreme Court is one of the biggest concerns among Republicans and Democrats, but only cursory commentary was given to the sorts of questions that the court, and any new justices the next president appoints, may have to consider.Mrs. Clinton has said that Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama\u2019s pick to fill the current vacancy, should be approved by the current Congress, but she still has not been clear about how she would handle his nomination if she is elected and he has not yet been confirmed. On Wednesday night, she spoke only generally about how she would appoint judges who would stand up for the American people.Mr. Trump has offered little detail about what he prizes in potential Supreme Court justices, other than to say that he would fill the court with jurists in the mold of Antonin Scalia and those who are likely to overturn Roe v. Wade.Republicans have been fighting to repeal the Affordable Care Act since President Obama signed it into law, but in 2016 it has become something of an afterthought.Mr. Trump wants to replace the health law with something, he says, that \u201cworks.\u201d Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that parts of the law need fixing, but said nothing specific about how she would curb rising health care costs.Still, Mr. Rother said he sympathized with the desire to keep things simple. \u201cHillary has to be cautious given her history and her wonk tendencies,\u201d he said, \u201cand Trump is uninformed on health policy.\u201dWith so little focus on deficits, the national debt and funding for Social Security, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote to Chris Wallace, the moderator of Wednesday\u2019s debate, imploring him to press the candidates about their plans.\u201cWe have heard very little to this point,\u201d the chamber wrote, adding that \u201cwhat we have heard has been distressing, with the candidates proposing to either do nothing or actually expand (rather than reform) these programs.\u201dAt the debate, Mr. Trump said that his tax cuts would stimulate economic growth and finance entitlement programs. Mrs. Clinton said that she would tax the rich and reduce entitlement spending by making \u201charder decisions.\u201d But the discussion ran aground when Mrs. Clinton, in an aside, poked at Mr. Trump over his tax avoidance, and he called her a \u201cnasty woman.\u201dMrs. Clinton hit Mr. Trump for suggesting that global warming was a \u201choax\u201d perpetrated by the Chinese, yet she offered few solutions beyond the deployment of more solar panels. Mr. Trump underscored his support for domestic drilling and burning coal, and in the second debate he dismissed alternative energy sources by saying the United States could not be powered by wind and solar energy alone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Drivers Ruled Eligible for Jobless Payments in New York State", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byTwo former drivers for Uber are eligible for unemployment payments, New York State regulators have ruled, finding that they should be treated as employees rather than independent contractors, as the company has maintained.Unlike contractors, employees are entitled to a variety of rights and protections, including a minimum wage and workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and are typically more costly for companies to rely on.The decision could make it more difficult for Uber, its rival Lyft and other new businesses operating in what is known as the gig economy by raising their costs and challenging their business model.The rulings by the New York State Department of Labor were sent to the two Uber drivers (one also worked for Lyft) in August and September but have not previously been reported. They apply only to their unemployment insurance claims and do not directly affect other drivers or extend to other protections normally accorded employees.But worker advocates say they plan to pressure the state to extend the logic of the unemployment rulings to other areas.\u201cI think this is a game-changer,\u201d said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which filed a federal lawsuit with the two drivers in July to force the Labor Department to make a determination in their cases. \u201cUber has depended on the political structure turning a blind eye. What these decisions do is force a microscopic review\u201d of drivers\u2019 employment status by elected officials and government agencies.It is not clear how far the advocates will be able to push the ruling. Tiffany Portzer, a spokeswoman for the New York Labor Department, said: \u201cUnemployment determinations are made on a case-by-case basis and, depending on the facts, decisions have been made supporting both drivers as employees and drivers as independent contractors.\u201dState regulators recently deemed a third driver who is a member of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance to be a contractor after he filed an unemployment claim. The labor group said it was because of his confusion in filling out the necessary paperwork. It is asking for a hearing and reconsideration of his case to reverse the decision.Uber said that drivers were contractors who \u201cwould lose the personal flexibility they value most\u201d if they were classified as employees.\u201cWhile the Department of Labor has ruled that several drivers are independent contractors, we have appealed the other determinations,\u201d the company said in a statement.The New York cases could prove problematic for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who in 2015 aligned himself with Uber in helping to beat back a temporary cap on the number of licenses New York City would issue for cars affiliated with ride-hailing companies.In February, after one of the two Uber drivers recently deemed eligible for unemployment benefits checked on the status of his claim, a state supervising Labor Services representative told him by email that Uber claims are \u201cunder executive review, which means the Department of Labor is not making the decision whether or not this employment is covered,\u201d hinting at possible intervention by the governor\u2019s office.Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, denied any intervention, saying that the senior ranks of the Labor Department had reviewed the Uber claims. Mr. Azzopardi declined to comment on the broader issue of the employment status of drivers.The New York Taxi Workers Alliance argued that Uber\u2019s control over drivers participating in its low-cost service, Uber X \u2014 the major question in resolving employment status \u2014 is similar to the control that many black-car dispatching services exert over their drivers, who in many cases have previously been ruled eligible for jobless benefits in New York.Some of the ride-sharing cases probably will end up in New York State\u2019s appellate courts, said Gary D. Friedman, a management-side employment lawyer at Weil, Gotshal in New York. Mr. Friedman said that if the courts, in clarifying the relevant portions of New York common law, find that many Uber drivers are employees for the purposes of receiving unemployment insurance, this could affect other areas, like application of minimum wage laws.The New York unemployment case is not the only recent decision on whether online on-demand workers like Uber drivers are employees or contractors. Last Thursday, the National Labor Relations Board office in Chicago formally issued a complaint, which a board representative said was the first of its kind, against Postmates, an on-demand delivery platform, over allegations that Postmates impeded workers\u2019 ability to exercise their labor rights.In issuing the complaint, which The New York Times obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, the board\u2019s lawyers had to first conclude that Postmates couriers are employees, since the agency\u2019s mandate does not extend to independent contractors.The N.L.R.B. is investigating several charges by individuals against Uber and Lyft.The two former Uber drivers in New York, Levon Aleksanian and Jakir Hossain, waited for months after they filed unemployment benefit claims for a determination about their eligibility, a process that normally takes a few weeks.They filed a federal lawsuit against the state Labor Department in late July, and during the next two months each finally received what is known as a Monetary Benefit Determination stating they were employees of Uber \u2014 a necessary but not sufficient condition for receiving benefits.The department subsequently granted benefits to Mr. Hossain, who has received them retroactively. But Mr. Aleksanian, who said he ran up thousands of dollars in debt during months of unemployment, has still been denied benefits because of the circumstances of his separation from Uber. He is appealing the decision.\u201cIt was a very scary moment,\u201d Mr. Aleksanian said of his initial separation. \u201cUntil recently, I didn\u2019t have any employment. I was applying continuously every day, but I couldn\u2019t find anything.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Assails His Accusers as Liars, and Unattractive", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump wielded his presidential candidacy on Friday as a weapon for savaging detractors and venting personal grievances, attacking the women who have accused him of sexual assault and unwelcome advances and railing against what he described as a vast conspiracy against him by the news media and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.With a campaign speech in North Carolina that whirled from one target to the next, Mr. Trump accelerated his shift away from courting swing voters or delivering a message aimed at the political mainstream.Instead, after weeks on the defensive, battered by disclosures about his treatment of women and about his business dealings, Mr. Trump appeared increasingly consumed with the idea that he has been wronged and bent on convincing his fans that sinister forces are to blame for his political decline.Mr. Trump told the restive crowd that his advisers wanted him to focus on his core economic message, but that he had no intention of allowing his critics to go unanswered.\u201cMy people always say: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t talk about it. Talk about jobs. Talk about the economy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cBut I feel I have to talk about them, because you have to dispute when somebody says something,\u201d he added of the allegations against him. \u201cFortunately, we have the microphone. We\u2019re able to dispute; some people can\u2019t.\u201dEven as two more women came forward on Friday to say he had groped them, Mr. Trump dismissed the mounting accusations as \u201ctotal fiction\u201d and \u201clies, lies, lies.\u201d He assailed the motives of the women speaking out against him, and seemed to mock two of them as not attractive enough to draw his interest.15 PhotosHe was similarly dismissive of Natasha Stoynoff, a former writer for People magazine, who accused Mr. Trump of physically accosting her during an interview. \u201cCheck out her Facebook page, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump also ridiculed his opponent in the presidential race, Mrs. Clinton, for saying that he had crowded her physically during their last debate, and he seemed to offer an insult about her physique. When Mrs. Clinton walked in front of him, he told a crowd in Greensboro, N.C., \u201cBelieve me, I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201dAnd as he blasted the women who have made allegations against him as fabricators, Mr. Trump suggested that perhaps someone should make similar claims against President Obama next.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t some woman, maybe, come up and say what they say falsely about me \u2014 they could say it about him,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Though Mr. Trump has said he will provide information to refute his accusers\u2019 stories wholesale, he offered no such evidence in North Carolina. He has also loudly threatened to sue multiple publications for printing the stories of his accusers, but as of Friday evening no such suit had been filed.Mr. Trump made only passing reference to the newest accusations against him. In an interview with The Washington Post, a woman named Kristin Anderson said Mr. Trump had slipped his hand beneath her skirt and grabbed her genitals at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s.Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman denied the account, and Mr. Trump said in his speech that certain details were implausible because he rarely sits alone at nightclubs. But The Post did not say Ms. Anderson had described Mr. Trump as being alone.A second woman, Summer Zervos, a Republican and a former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d said at a news conference in Los Angeles that Mr. Trump had tried to seduce her over dinner at a hotel in 2007, grabbing her breasts and thrusting his pelvis into her body. Ms. Zervos, 41, appeared alongside Gloria Allred, the celebrity litigator and a Democrat who was a delegate for Mrs. Clinton.We\u2019d like to hear how the allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald J. Trump are playing out in people\u2019s relationships. Please share your story with us.Mr. Trump denied in a statement several hours later that he ever had a meeting with Ms. Zervos at a hotel or \u201cgreeted her inappropriately.\u201d He again attacked the media and said he would \u201ctake my message directly to the American people.\u201dThe claims against Mr. Trump have gained a momentum of their own since the revelation on Oct. 7 of a recording in which he boasted to a television host about sexually assaulting women. That tape led to the direct questioning of Mr. Trump, at Sunday\u2019s debate, about whether he had ever actually done the things he described. Mr. Trump\u2019s denial prompted Ms. Leeds to come forward in an interview with The New York Times; Ms. Anderson said Ms. Leeds had inspired her to tell her story.After learning of Ms. Leeds\u2019s story, Ms. Anderson told The Post, she decided: \u201cLet me just back these girls up.\u201dBy lashing out in multiple directions and presenting himself as the target of a corrupt plot, Mr. Trump may deepen his emotional bond with voters who have turned to him as a kind of political wrecking ball aimed at Washington. But it is an unlikely strategy for improving his standing with the majority of voters who say in polls that he is ill-suited to the presidency and biased against women and minorities.Democrats have called the charges women have made against Mr. Trump disqualifying. On Thursday in New Hampshire, Michelle Obama said she had been shaken by Mr. Trump\u2019s cavalier bragging about assault.Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood and a prominent Clinton supporter, predicted women would revolt against Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks in North Carolina.\u201cIf they weren\u2019t already convinced, today proved to Americans that Donald Trump is an abusive and vindictive monster,\u201d Ms. Richards said. \u201cWith every ugly and violent insult that comes out of his mouth, Trump loses a vote, and our country gains a feminist.\u201dLeading Republicans have already pulled back from his campaign, and new signs of distance emerged on Friday between Mr. Trump and the party he nominally leads.Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is seeking re-election, released a television commercial saying he has \u201ca lot of disagreements\u201d with Mr. Trump. And in a closely fought congressional race in central New York, the National Republican Congressional Committee has an ad vowing that its candidate, Claudia Tenney, will \u201cstand up to Hillary Clinton\u201d \u2014 implying that Mrs. Clinton will be the next president.Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, who announced this week that he would no longer defend Mr. Trump, ignored him entirely in a speech to college Republicans in Wisconsin. Mr. Ryan criticized Mrs. Clinton and Democratic policies, but made no case for his own party\u2019s nominee.Mr. Trump, who has savaged Mr. Ryan repeatedly this week, declined to revisit their conflict on Friday afternoon.But Mr. Trump escalated his war on the news media, and unveiled a theory that The New York Times was attacking him at the behest of a Mexican billionaire, Carlos Slim, who is the largest individual holder of New York Times Company common shares.Reporters for the newspaper, Mr. Trump said, should be seen as \u201ccorporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and Hillary Clinton.\u201d\u201cNo media is more corrupt than the failing New York Times,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s bitter attacks on the news media, and Mr. Slim in particular, seem to echo the precise language used by two of his advisers, Stephen K. Bannon and Roger Stone, who have long cast Mr. Slim as an ominous presence in the American news media.In a statement, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times, said Mr. Slim had no involvement in the paper\u2019s news coverage. \u201cCarlos Slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism,\u201d Mr. Sulzberger said. \u201cHe has never sought to influence what we report.\u201dMr. Trump has spoken in ever more apocalyptic tones in recent days as his poll numbers have fallen: describing Mrs. Clinton as deserving incarceration; warning that the election will be rigged; and suggesting that international bankers are colluding to bring about his defeat.On Friday, he repeated his pledge to prosecute Mrs. Clinton and encouraged his crowd in chants of \u201cLock her up.\u201d \u201cFor what she\u2019s done,\u201d he said, \u201cthey should lock her up.\u201dNick Corasaniti reported from Greensboro, N.C., and Alexander Burns from New York.

{"Headline": "The Lonely Life of a Republican Woman", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Gingrich unleashed this boorish attack after Ms. Kelly tried to pin him down on whether the many accusations of sexual assault against Donald J. Trump, and his own words on the matter, should disqualify him from the presidency.That Mr. Gingrich (with whom I once hosted a television show) thought the best way to deflect attention from Mr. Trump\u2019s awful behavior with women was to attack another woman tells you so much about the depths to which Mr. Trump has dragged the Republican Party.It\u2019s also a sobering harbinger of how hard it\u2019s going to be for the party to win back Republican women, let alone appeal to new female voters in the future.As a conservative woman who wanted very much to support the Republican nominee, it\u2019s been a deeply disappointing year and a half. After helping the Republican National Committee address some of the troubling deficiencies the party faced after 2012, as outlined in its so-called autopsy report, and witnessing some real progress in our outreach to women in the ensuing years, I did not expect an egomaniacal arsonist to come along and set all that ablaze.Mr. Trump has sent the party back to the Dark Ages \u2014 or at least the 1950s \u2014 with his provincial notions of masculinity and misogynist notions of femininity, his cartoonish bombast, his vulgar jocularity and his open hostility to women who question him. In short, he\u2019s reaffirmed the worst stereotypes about Republicans that Democrats have pushed for decades.It would be nice to be able to argue that Mr. Trump is an aberration, but clearly he has found a great deal of support. Who will believe us when we say that he does not speak for us?The stench of Mr. Akin hung around the party for months, if not years. Mr. Trump is neither unknown nor inconsequential. His will be the stink of a hydrogen sulfide explosion. Containment will be impossible.What\u2019s surprising is just how many Republicans \u2014 men and women \u2014 have been all too happy to smell like him. Political operatives feigned ignorance about whether grabbing a woman\u2019s genitalia is sexual assault (it is), while female supporters claimed these weren\u2019t important issues to women (they are). Voters will punish the party for this collective shrug.Women are not unwinnable for Republicans. Ronald Reagan won a majority of them in both of his elections, and by 10 points in 1984. The largest spread in recent history was in 1972, when Richard Nixon, even with that mug, won women by a whopping 24 points.Still, more than 20 years is a long time to go without women. I\u2019d argue conservative policies were badly explained and liberals benefited from more emotional messaging. But it\u2019s going to be much harder to make that case now.When women flee the Republican Party in the coming years, no autopsy will be necessary. The explanation is all too clear.And yet we have to try to repair the relationship between the Republican Party and women. Not just so that Republicans can be competitive in national elections, but because I believe our policies are genuinely better for women.Democrats\u2019 lofty language about empowering women sounds great (and way better than Mr. Trump\u2019s), but President Obama\u2019s economy has done just the opposite. By many metrics, women (and men) are worse off. The poverty rate is higher than it was in 2007. Real median household income is down. More Americans are dependent on the government for assistance. Homeownership is down. Student debt has skyrocketed, along with the national debt. We now know that Obamacare is becoming unaffordable.None of this is empowering, not for working women, mothers, small-business owners or students. Whether you\u2019re a veteran or a millennial, it\u2019s hard to argue that big government has solved your problems efficiently, if at all.But before we can make that case to women, Republicans will have to earn the right to be heard at all. That will require emptying the party of Mr. Trump\u2019s enablers. Who knows how long that will take, but in the meantime, women would frankly have to have been lobotomized to believe anything the Republican Party tells them.We will also need better communicators. There are plenty of good, rational, compassionate and talented conservatives who deserve a microphone and a platform. It\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation of leaders who don\u2019t speak \u2014 or think \u2014 like Archie Bunker.I was first drawn to the Republican Party as an 18-year-old at a liberal university. The party\u2019s appeal wasn\u2019t about barring Muslims, arming our enemies with nuclear weapons or joking about sexual assault. I didn\u2019t become a conservative because someone told me to hate liberals, or to blame people who didn\u2019t look like me for my problems.I became a conservative because of words like \u201cself-reliance\u201d and \u201cindividualism,\u201d because it actually seemed the more optimistic philosophy. Conservatism measured compassion by how much you gave, not by how much you told other people to give. Conservatism believed that individuals, not bureaucracies, produced the best solutions. And conservatism saw American democracy as a beacon of hope to share with the world\u2019s oppressed, not something to apologize for.Now that I\u2019m a mother, those ideals matter more to me than ever. In the era of Donald Trump, it\u2019s hard to argue to the women of America that the Republican Party deserves their vote this year. But we must return to our aspirational roots if we\u2019re going to have a party left at all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Politicians So Obsessed With Manufacturing?", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyWhen Donald J. Trump landed in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago, the city was buzzing about Uber\u2019s deployment of the world\u2019s first fleet of driverless taxicabs. Political leaders were thrilled that Silicon Valley was hiring highly paid workers and investing hundreds of millions of dollars in western Pennsylvania. Local taxi drivers were understandably less excited that robots were coming for their jobs.Pittsburgh\u2019s football team may still be called the Steelers, but the city has, like the rest of the country, become predominantly a service economy. More than 80 percent of local jobs are in the service sector, roughly on par with the national average. The largest private-sector employer is not U.S. Steel but the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The city\u2019s jobs, however, increasingly are divided between a prospering college-educated elite of lawyers and doctors and bankers and a struggling mass of fast-food workers and security guards and nannies.Uber\u2019s arrival suggests those disparities are likely to intensify. The com\u00adpany says it plans to create a total of 1,000 high-paying jobs at a Pittsburgh research center, presumably with the goal of eliminating the region\u2019s 1,360 taxi-driving jobs. That may be a good deal, in the end, for the regional economy: Workers earning higher wages are also consumers who spend more money. But the trade-off would be little comfort to drivers, who are unlikely to move from that job to programming robots. And cabbies aren\u2019t the only ones with cause for alarm. Self-driving vehicles presumably will also begin to replace the region\u2019s 19,490 truck drivers and 9,390 bus drivers.The Republican presidential nominee had not come to western Pennsylvania to talk about any of that. He looked out over his audience and promised, as he does at most of his rallies, that he would revive the American steel industry.There\u2019s nothing new about nostalgia in politics. American presidential candidates spent the better part of the 20th century promising to help family farmers in the face of urbanization. Now they promise to help factory workers in the face of globalization. Trump has made the revival of American manufacturing a signature issue, presenting his economic plan in an August speech in Detroit, the nation\u2019s official postindustrial wasteland. Hillary Clinton has campaigned on a broader economic agenda, but when it came time to describe those plans, she chose a fac\u00adtory outside Detroit as her backdrop.Manufacturing retains its powerful hold on the American imagination for good reason. In the years after World War II, factory work created a broadly shared prosperity that helped make the American middle class. People without college degrees could buy a home, raise a family, buy a station wagon, take some nice vacations. It makes perfect sense that voters would want to return to those times.From an economic perspective, however, there can be no revival of American manufacturing, because there has been no collapse. Because of automation, there are far fewer jobs in factories. But the value of stuff made in America reached a record high in the first quarter of 2016, even after adjusting for inflation. The present moment, in other words, is the most productive in the nation\u2019s history.Politicians of all persuasions have tried to turn back time through a wide range of programs best summarized as \u201cthrowing money at factory owners.\u201d They offer tax credits and other incentives; some towns even build whole industrial parks, at taxpayer expense, so they can offer free space for manufacturers. By and large, those strategies haven\u2019t helped. One of Trump\u2019s keynote proposals is to encourage domestic production by taxing imports \u2014 an idea more likely to cause a recession than a manufacturing revival. Clinton is promising to basically extend the efforts of the Obama administration, which said it would create a million factory jobs. With just a few months left, the president is still more than 600,000 jobs short.This myopic focus on factory jobs distracts from another, simpler way to help working Americans: Improve the conditions of the work they actually do. Fast-food servers scrape by on minimum wage; contract workers are denied benefits; child-care providers have no paid leave to spend with their own children.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 64,000 steelworkers in America last year, and 820,000 home health aides \u2014 more than double the population of Pittsburgh. Next year, there will be fewer steelworkers and still more home health aides, as baby boomers fade into old age. Soon, we will be living in the United States of Home Health Aides, yet the candidates keep talking about steelworkers. Many home health aides live close to the poverty line: Average annual wages were just $22,870 last year. If both parties are willing to meddle with the marketplace in order to help one sector, why not do the same for jobs that currently exist?Each candidate has walked down this road, Clinton significantly farther than Trump. He has suggested he might support a $10 federal minimum wage, and he has proposed new tax benefits to reduce the cost of child care. She has backed a $12 minimum wage and more generous tax benefits for child care. She has also promised to support paid leave and increased protection for unions. In August 2015, she met with a group of home health care workers in Los Angeles, and returned to the issue in her Detroit speech. \u201cThe people taking care of our children and our parents, they deserve a good wage, good benefits, and a secure retirement,\u201d she said. But no one is basing an entire presi\u00addential campaign around ideas like this.The manufacturing boom of the postwar years was an oddity, and there will be no repeat of the concatenation that made it happen: The backlog of innovations stored up during the Great Depression and World War II; the devastation of other industrial powers, Germany in particular, which gave the United States a competitive edge. Yet some parts of the formula that created the middle class may be possible to replicate. Unions played a large role in negotiating favorable work rules, many of which have since entered into law. Stronger unions \u2014 or federal regulators, who have increasingly replaced unions as the primary advocates for workers \u2014 could improve conditions in the service sector, too.The enduring political focus on factory workers partly reflects the low profile of the new working class. Instead of white men who make stuff, the group is increasingly made up of minority women who serve people. \u201cThat transformation really has rendered the working class invisible,\u201d says Tamara Draut, the author of \u201cSleeping Giant,\u201d a recent book about this demographic transformation and its political consequences.The old working class still controls the megaphone of the labor movement, in part because unions have struggled to organize service workers. Manufacturing was, logistically speaking, easier to organize. There were lots of workers at each factory, and most knew one another. Service work is more dispersed and done in smaller crews. Workers living in the same city and employed by the same retail chain, for example, would likely know only a handful of their compatriots. Fostering a sense of trust and shared purpose under these conditions is difficult.At the same time, more and more men are plopping down on the sidelines of the economy. The Harvard economist Lawrence H. Summers estimates that by midcentury, one-third of men in their prime working years, between the ages of 25 and 54, will not be working. Politicians are paying attention to them perhaps because they\u2019ve demonstrated a willingness to switch parties. David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., says in a recent paper he helped write that voting patterns have been disrupted in the parts of the country that lost the most jobs to trade with China. The study, which focused on congressional elections, found that voters in those areas have tended toward ideological extremes. In predominantly non-Hispanic white districts, voters have tended to install conservatives in place of moderates.This is a dynamic that Trump, in particular, has capitalized on. \u201cPeople are tired of lies, they\u2019re tired of losing their jobs, they\u2019re tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places,\u201d he said at a rally in Erie, Pa. \u201cThat\u2019s why the steelworkers are with me, that\u2019s why the miners are with me, that\u2019s why the working people, electricians, the plumbers, the Sheetrockers, the concrete guys and gals, they\u2019re all \u2014 they\u2019re with us.\u201dBinyamin Appelbaum is an economics reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Faulting Term Limit, South Korean Leader Proposes Revising Constitution", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byOpposition leaders immediately accused Ms. Park of making the surprise proposal to divert attention from a growing scandal that involved some of her close associates and helped push her approval ratings to a record low. But they did not immediately reject the idea of amending the Constitution.During a nationally televised speech, Ms. Park cited recent surveys in which 70 percent of respondents voiced frustration with deeply polarized domestic politics and supported a constitutional revision as a potential remedy. Ms. Park said she hoped that the next government would be formed under a new constitution and asked rival parties to start discussing a draft revision.Under the Constitution, Ms. Park is limited to a single five-year term that ends in February 2018. She is barred from seeking re-election even if the Constitution is changed to allow a second term.Constitutional revision requires approval by two-thirds of the 300-member National Assembly and then majority support in a referendum. Ms. Park\u2019s governing party, Saenuri, controls only 122 seats in the assembly. But some opposition lawmakers have also called for a revision. Some want the current presidential system to be replaced with a parliamentary government.During her election campaign in 2012, Ms. Park said she would try to revise the Constitution to allow the president to seek a second term.But until now, she has repeatedly opposed discussing a possible amendment. She previously said it would only create a political \u201cblack hole\u201d that would disrupt the government\u2019s efforts to rejuvenate a slowing economy.Park Jie-won, an opposition leader, accused Ms. Park of creating a \u201cblack hole\u201d to distract public anger from the government\u2019s scandals. Choo Mi-ae, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, demanded that Ms. Park keep herself from any discussion of a constitutional revision.Ms. Park\u2019s approval ratings plummeted to 25 percent last week, the lowest since she took office in early 2013, as she grappled with scandals involving her associates, including a woman named Choi Soon-sil. Ms. Choi is a daughter of the late religious figure Choi Tae-min, whose close ties with Ms. Park have spawned lurid rumors.For weeks, the news media has described Ms. Choi as a Rasputin-like figure who used her ties with Ms. Park and Ahn Chong-bum, one of her top presidential aides, to force big businesses to donate millions of dollars each to foundations she was believed to control. Ms. Choi was also accused of forcing Ewha Womans University to change its regulations to give preferential treatment to her daughter.The president of the university resigned last week during student protests. Prosecutors were looking into the accusations after Ms. Park called for an investigation. But Ms. Park and Mr. Ahn have denied involvement in the scandal.Ms. Choi could not be reached for comment. News outlets reported that she and her daughter were staying in Germany, where they recently bought several houses.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Iran, Exerting Force While Making Nice Is Part of the Plan", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byWhat would seem to be a puzzling contradiction is in fact a carefully thought-out, two-track policy being pursued by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the circle of leaders around him.In addition to sanctioning the country\u2019s more aggressive military footprint in the region, Ayatollah Khamenei regularly issues broadsides against the United States, promising there will be no softening of Tehran\u2019s stance against the Great Satan, while quietly opening the door to Western capital and expertise.And yet, when President Hassan Rouhani faces attacks from hard-liners, Ayatollah Khamenei almost always has his back, at least in private.With the region in such turmoil, this might seem like an inopportune time to soften restrictions on business dealings with the West and personal freedoms at home. But that seems to be exactly what is happening. The changes are incremental and can be turned back at any moment, but they are unmistakable, analysts say.The most obvious change is in politics. After dominating for 15 years, Iran\u2019s hard-line faction \u2014 a conservative elite of clerics, military leaders and politicians \u2014 has suffered a string of defeats.Their figurehead, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the former president, became the symbol of a nation refusing any form of compromise. \u201cNever, ever will Iran compromise on its nuclear program,\u201d Mr. Ahmadinejad often promised.But in 2012, a year before Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s term ended, Ayatollah Khamenei allowed his representatives to contact the United States to discuss exactly such a compromise.Since then, the hard-liners have lost battle after battle to a group of technocrats and moderates who were the only ones in the country\u2019s small establishment able to talk to the West.For two years during the nuclear talks with the United States and other world powers, the hard-liners spoke out against any compromise. They lost. Parliamentary elections? Lost.The hard-liners spoke out against foreign investment, internet freedoms, more visits by foreigners, concerts and fewer morality police on the streets. On all those issues, they lost or were largely ignored.And that is no accident, analysts say.It stems from Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s decision to ease Iran away \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 from a rigid interpretation of its revolutionary ideology and end the isolation that has hampered the economy and frustrated young Iranians yearning to live in a \u201cnormal\u201d country.At 77, and with at least one hospitalization in recent years for prostate cancer, Ayatollah Khamenei appears determined, while he still has full power, to make the changes essential for Iran to realign relations with the world, analysts say.\u201cIn Mr. Khamenei\u2019s view, we should be like China,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, an analyst with close ties to the hard-liners. \u201cHave economic relations with the West, but without their political influence and neo-colonization.\u201dThus, visa restrictions have been eased and foreign investment policies relaxed, while Iranian diplomats are spreading a message of Iran as the last major untapped market in the world.\u201cWe need Western know-how and Western investments,\u201d said Mr. Laylaz, the economist. \u201cNow that the sanctions no longer stand in our way, we are reaching out to the West for their money and knowledge. But, of course, we do not want their politics.\u201dRene Harun, a German expatriate and the managing director of the German-Iranian Chamber of Industry and Commerce, speaks of \u201ca new era\u201d in the Islamic republic. \u201cThe government is taking big steps in order to improve business,\u201d he said.In recent months, average Iranians have noticed some welcome changes, too. The internet, long kept at a snail\u2019s pace by the authorities, is noticeably faster \u2014 enough to watch videos online, something that never had been possible. State television has created new digital channels, introducing more comedies and even a Persian version of Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dParliament, free of domination by hard-liners for the first time in over a decade, has asked for restrictions on capital punishment, more press freedoms and the reinstatement of a reformist female politician who was barred after appearing in pictures without the obligatory Islamic head scarf.\u201cOver all there is hope, and while we should see how that plays out and how much time it will take, people are looking towards the future more than before,\u201d said Nazanin Daneshvar, the female chief executive of Takhfifan, a discount shopping website.At the same time, Ayatollah Khamenei goes out of his way in public pronouncements to reassure his hard-line supporters that their vision of a conservative Islamic theocracy in opposition to America and the West still holds sway. In a speech last week, for example, he said that \u201cproblems between Iran and the United States will never be resolved.\u201dAyatollah Khamenei also issues frequent warnings about the Islamic State, at its core a violent Sunni insurgency that poses a threat to Shiite Iran. Either fight the militants in Syria, he says, or fight them in the western Iranian cities of Kermanshah and Hamadan.While the country\u2019s military adventures seem far removed from daily life for many Iranians, they do align with the public\u2019s often nationalistic views. \u201cIran should be strong and influential,\u201d said Mohammad Heydari, a former journalist. \u201cJust look at the map, see where we are located and how large our country is, and you\u2019ll understand.\u201dPublicly, Ayatollah Khamenei often criticizes the nuclear agreement, but the most influential hard-liners understand that he was the architect of the pact. He also did not stop discussions between Boeing and the national carrier, Iran Air, even though the deal that is emerging will mean large-scale business relations with the United States.\u201cA lot of things in Iran are said for domestic consumption,\u201d said Amir Kavian, a political analyst close to Iran\u2019s reform movement. \u201cWe should not take everything seriously. Actions speak louder than words.\u201dBoth Iran\u2019s partial opening up to the West and its involvement in Middle East conflicts are directed by Ayatollah Khamenei, analysts say.\u201cAll top foreign and domestic policies are commanded by the leader,\u201d said Mr. Taraghi, the hard-line political analyst. Still, he said, Westerners should not hold out hope of deep and significant changes in Iran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bad Pipes, Worse Service: A Soviet Riviera Jewel Is Reborn and Booking Up", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byGagra JournalGAGRA, Georgia \u2014 Employed for nearly four decades at a sanitarium once so exclusive that only the very well connected or heavily armed could get a booking, Tatyana Gaivoronskaya grew accustomed to freeloading Communist Party big shots and the unruly gunmen who took over their fusty rooms.These days, however, she serves a new and, in these parts, unusual clientele: vacationers who actually pay their own bills.After a long slump that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union and continued through a vicious war of secession along Georgia\u2019s Black Sea coast, the Soviet Riviera, or at least the bits that survived the fighting, is back in business.Unlike the once grand Gagripsh sanitarium just down the road, now abandoned and daubed with graffiti, the colonnaded property where Ms. Gaivoronskaya ladles out cabbage soup for tourists from Russia is enjoying something of a renaissance, albeit a decidedly backward one.The service, even the management admits, is terrible. \u201cWe would not even qualify for two stars,\u201d said Yuri Kurtaba, the sanitarium\u2019s director of maintenance. There is no room service and no Wi-Fi outside a tiny area near the lobby, and the swimming pool has been empty since the war.But its 240 rooms, repainted and cleared of cobwebs, were all booked throughout the summer season this year, and over half \u2014 particularly those with balconies overlooking the sea \u2014 still had guests in October.Ms. Gaivoronskaya \u2019s sanitarium is no longer closed to the public, as it was in the old days, but otherwise everything is left pretty much as it was. It offers a pebbly beach on the Black Sea, a statue of Lenin in the lobby, high-ceilinged rooms with chandeliers, bad plumbing and rotary telephones, as well as glorious sunshine well into late fall.Avtandil Gartskiya, the minister of resorts and tourism in Sukhumi, the capital of Abkhazia, a quasi country whose existence only Russia and three other nations recognize, described the money generated by foreign visitors as \u201cthe driver, the locomotive\u201d of Abkhazia\u2019s survival as a viable state in the future.He acknowledged that luring tourists from anywhere else but Russia was going to be a hard sell, especially as Abkhazia\u2019s only civilian airport closed more than 20 years ago and the only way to enter the territory is on foot across border crossings staffed by officious Russian border guards. Russians do not need a visa, but nearly everyone else does.Georgia, which insists that Abkhazia is part of its own territory, has thrown up further obstacles by threatening criminal prosecution of anyone who visits the \u201coccupied territory\u201d by way of Russia, the easiest route in, instead of through a remote border crossing in the far west of Georgia. Nonetheless, Mr. Gartskiya said, the number of foreign visitors is soaring, with around 1.5 million expected this year, compared with 92,000 a decade ago. More than 90 percent of these are from Russia, with nearly all the rest coming from former Soviet states like Kazakhstan and Ukraine.This lopsided reliance on a single country to fill hotel beds shows just how dependent Abkhazia is on Russia. Yet, unlike South Ossetia, a second and even smaller breakaway enclave of Georgia, Abkhazia has shown no desire to be annexed by Moscow and wants to make a serious stab at being its own country.This is not an easy task when most of the world insists it does not exist, when more than half the prewar population of half a million has fled, often at gunpoint, and when the tea and tobacco plantations that sustained the economy in the Soviet era now mostly produce nothing but weeds.Otar Ashba, director of the Solnechny Resort, a vast 1970s complex near Stalin\u2019s old dacha, said he would like to get more non-Russian guests but scoffed at the idea of countries like Nauru, one of three other states that recognizes Abkhazia, ever providing any guests.\u201cThey have fewer people than we do, and they are sinking into the sea,\u201d he said of the Pacific island nation, whose population is about 10,000.Russian tourists, even if they are mostly on a budget and elderly Soviet nostalgia buffs, are already breathing some new life into the economy and onto streets left eerily empty after the war by the flight of ethnic Georgians, Greeks and others unexcited by Abkhaz nationalism.Starved of investment to build enough new hotels and upgrade old ones, Abkhazia also offers Russians a time-warped wonderland of Soviet architecture, largely untouched by development.\u201cComing here is like going to Cuba,\u201d said Maxim Gundjia, Abkhazia\u2019s former foreign minister. \u201cIt is a retreat into childhood.\u201dAbkhazia, he added, is made for \u201cmelancholic tourism,\u201d its aged but still grand sanitariums short on comfort but rich in reminders of a vanished world.Svetlana Kalinskaya, a 70-year-old Russian retiree from Rostov-on-Don, said she first visited Abkhazia as a child and, after vacationing in recent years in Egypt and Turkey, decided to return to the sanitariums of the Black Sea.\u201cCompared with Turkey, the service here is zero,\u201d she said, strolling with an elderly friend under the stone entry arch of the former 17th Party Congress Sanitarium. \u201cBut it is paradise.\u201dAsked whether she minded Lenin looming over the lobby, Ms. Kalinskaya said the statue only brought back happy memories of a \u201ctime when we all lived together in one big country.\u201dSome younger Russians also come for the experience of being back in the Soviet Union, even though they are often too young to remember the real thing.Sergey Rogulov, a 39-year-old driver from St. Petersburg, said he liked the shabby Stalin-era interiors \u2014 \u201cit is like time travel back to the U.S.S.R.\u201d \u2014 but he mostly came for the weather and budget prices, which are lower than in foreign resorts and even those in nearby Sochi or Russian-ruled Crimea.Ms. Gaivoronskaya , the veteran sanitarium worker, said she missed the old days, when guests tended not to complain much because the state was paying.Then, as the sun-kissed lands of Abkhazia turned into a bloody war zone in the 1990s, the officials all fled and separatist fighters checked in. They commandeered the sanitarium as a barracks and command post during their victorious war with Georgia.The only other guests at the time were gunmen from the Russian region of Chechnya, like Shamil Basayev, who fought alongside the Abkhaz with Russian support and later went on to become Russia\u2019s most-wanted terrorist. He married a local woman in the sanitarium\u2019s restaurant, she said.Ms. Gaivoronskaya credits the presence of so many armed men with saving the sanitarium from the plunder and mayhem that wrecked so much else along the Black Sea coast. They frightened away all the unarmed guests but, in need of food and a bed in between battles, they protected the premises and respected the staff, she said.The new paying guests, particularly the younger ones, are more demanding, she said. But their money has allowed her to keep working and the sanitarium to stay open \u2014 and to preserve for a new generation a \u201csmall taste of what life was like before everything fell apart.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theodore Anderson, Mathematician Who Advanced Data Analysis, Dies at 98", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byTheodore W. Anderson, a statistician whose work brought a new mathematical rigor to economics and social science in the postwar years and helped pave the way for modern econometrics and data analysis, died on Sept. 17 in Stanford, Calif. He was 98.The cause was heart failure, his son, Robert, said.Professor Anderson, the son of a Minnesota minister, had a distinguished academic career. He studied at Northwestern and Princeton, did research at the University of Chicago and taught at Columbia and, for more than two decades, at Stanford University.During World War II, at Princeton, he did war research work on long-range weather forecasting, gunfire strategies for battleships and explosives testing.But his signal work began immediately after the war, when he joined pioneering efforts at the University of Chicago to help shape postwar economic policy decisions.The work involved developing systems of mathematical equations that would reveal underlying structures in the economy. Those systems evolved into econometric models widely used today by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.Professor Anderson also made advances in the analysis of data in psychology and the social sciences.His talent for reducing complicated systems to their mathematical essence helped him strengthen tools for dealing with the sorts of large data sets common in the social sciences, in which researchers look for patterns within a broad swath of information collected on individuals.In one instance, in 1961, psychologists applied these methods to data derived from detailed personality questionnaires and concluded that individual personalities could be summed up by an overarching \u201cbig five\u201d traits.Professor Anderson\u2019s contributions lay the groundwork for an advanced analysis of data sets containing not just dozens but thousands of variables.Professor Anderson\u2019s book \u201cAn Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis\u201d (1958) remains a classic in the field, educating generations of statisticians in the conceptual underpinnings of a particularly challenging kind of data analysis.In multivariate data, many variables are considered simultaneously rather than one at a time. Using this type of analysis in medicine, a person\u2019s health is gauged not just by blood pressure, for example, but by blood pressure in tandem with weight, cholesterol levels and heart rate.Translated into Russian in 1964 and appearing in a third edition in 2003, the book has inspired thousands of technical papers. Michael Perlman, a professor of statistics at the University of Washington, said that the book is remarkable in that it can lead a reader with very little mathematical background through a clear and logical progression of the entire field.\u201cI believe that science progresses more if the communication is made easier,\u201d Professor Anderson told an interviewer in 1986. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to the reader, as well as the editor, to put out papers which are difficult to read, not because of the difficulty of the material but because of the sloppiness of the work and the carelessness in exposition.\u201dHe also brought mathematical rigor to the study of sets of measurements taken over time \u2014 of unemployment numbers, for example, which depend strongly on the previous year\u2019s numbers, which in turn depend on those of the year before. In the 1960s, economists were struggling with these mathematically complex \u201ctime series,\u201d which were vital for capturing the dynamic nature of the economy.Professor Anderson\u2019s work, including his book \u201cThe Statistical Analysis of Time Series\u201d (1971), was at the forefront of this new field, John Taylor, an economics professor at Stanford and a former doctoral student of Professor Anderson\u2019s, said in an interview.Time series analyses are now \u201cvery commonplace in economics,\u201d he said, \u201cand Ted\u2019s work helped move that forward.\u201dProfessor Anderson\u2019s early interest in economics and social science applications stemmed from his goal of \u201cdoing some good,\u201d he said in the 1986 interview.\u201cWhile I find intellectual interest in mathematical statistical problems,\u201d he said, \u201cI think a final objective is to have an effect on analyzing data and decision making under uncertainty.\u201dTheodore Wilbur Anderson was born in Minneapolis on June 5, 1918, the oldest of three children of Theodore Anderson Sr., a minister and educator, and the former Evelynn Johnson. He was inspired by a high school teacher to study chemistry, first at North Park College in Chicago and then at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., until he realized he was, as he later said, \u201cterrible in the laboratory.\u201dHe switched to mathematics and took all his required math courses in one year, graduating in 1939. He then worked with Samuel Wilks, a leading mathematical statistician, at Princeton, where he obtained both a master\u2019s and a Ph.D. in mathematics.At Princeton he was exposed to the application of mathematics and statistics to other fields, including the military. His war research work on weather forecasting and armaments was done under the auspices of the Applied Mathematics Panel of the National Defense Research Committee.At Princeton he came under the influence of leading statisticians like William Cochran, Will Dixon, John Tukey and Charles Winsor and took mathematical economics seminars with Oskar Morgenstern, who was at the time writing a book with John von Neumann on game theory and economic behavior.After leaving Princeton in 1945 he joined the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics at the University of Chicago, which was suffused, he said, by an \u201calmost missionary zeal\u201d to develop new approaches to economics through probability, statistics and mathematics. He worked with top scholars, many of whom would later receive the Nobel in economic science, among them Lawrence Klein, Leo Hurwicz and Tjalling Koopmans.At Cowles he worked on tricky systems of economic equations that attempted to disentangle cause and effect by considering several related factors simultaneously.Cowles researchers used these systems, for example, to analyze the postwar agricultural economy by looking at consumers\u2019 demand for food, household incomes and available food supply from farmers.After a year in Chicago, Professor Anderson was enticed by the mathematician Abraham Wald to join the faculty in the new department of mathematical statistics at Columbia.

{"Headline": "Outrage Over Fish Kill in Vietnam Simmers 6 Months Later", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byIn the latest sign of this festering outrage, thousands of demonstrators swarmed a steel factory in the central province of Ha Tinh on Sunday, echoing the street protests that erupted in the country\u2019s major cities in April when photographs of piled-up fish corpses were widely shared on social media.Formosa Steel admitted responsibility and agreed to pay $500 million in damages for what many Vietnamese consider one of the worst environmental disasters in the country\u2019s modern history.But residents of coastal villages and towns, where fishing drives the economies, have continued to hold boisterous rallies against the government and the company.Demonstrators said in telephone interviews on Monday that they had attended the rally to demand that Formosa Steel close the factory and compensate them for damages. Hundreds of people from Ha Tinh have sued the company in recent weeks, many with assistance from the Catholic Church.\u201cThe government tried to hide information and protect Formosa,\u201d said Tran Viet Hoa, a fisherman who said his income had fallen more than 70 percent because of the fish kill. \u201cIf Formosa remains in Vietnam and doesn\u2019t give us our clean environment back, we will continue to protest.\u201dAnother protester, Hoang Kim, said that he had seen more than 4,000 people at the rally and that many were Catholics. He said the protesters could have easily entered the factory compound but chose not to because they wanted only to make a point, not to vandalize property.Online reports about the protest in the state-controlled news media were quickly removed by the Vietnamese authorities, activists said, but the rally was widely discussed on Facebook. Neither the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry nor senior Formosa Steel officials responded to requests for comment on Monday.The fish kill, which has primarily affected Ha Tinh and three other central provinces, was not the first environmental problem to incite public outrage in Vietnam. Last year, hundreds of people staged weekly protests in Hanoi, the capital, over a government plan to chop down 6,700 trees from the city\u2019s boulevards. The protests, coupled with indignation on social media, prompted city officials to postpone the plan indefinitely.But the fish kill has had a broader national impact than the Hanoi tree protests, analysts say, in part because it has damaged the image of the seafood industry and caused many in the country to reconsider eating what is a staple of their diet.There is no indication of any involvement by Beijing in the project, but some Vietnamese have focused on the presence of mainland Chinese workers there and have blurred the distinction between China and Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as Chinese territory.After four of the Chinese workers were killed, the Chinese government evacuated about 3,000 workers from the factory by ship.This past June, after months of refusing to say definitively what had caused the fish kill, the Vietnamese government said it had occurred after Formosa Steel leaked phenol, cyanide and iron hydroxide into the sea from its steel plant.But officials did not release any detailed scientific evidence to support their conclusion, raising questions about whether other contaminants had been detected but not publicly reported, said Nguyen Duc Hiep, an environmental scientist in Australia and a visiting researcher at Ton Duc Thang University in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\u201cIf there are heavy metals \u2014 for example, lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic \u2014 then it will stay in the environment for a very long time, and it\u2019s very toxic because it can go up the food chain and cause a lot of damage,\u201d Professor Hiep said, adding that the three chemicals that were publicly disclosed were not necessarily toxic to fish in the long term.\u201cA lot of people suspect the reason the scientific report didn\u2019t come out is because there were a lot of heavy metals,\u201d he added.The state news media has reported that the fish kill resulted in tens of thousands of lost jobs in the affected provinces, and protesters are questioning the government\u2019s suggestions that the problem has largely been resolved.Nguyen Viet Thanh, a professor of environmental economics at Vietnam National University in Hanoi, said it was difficult to separate the effects of the toxic spill from the impact of overfishing and other problems that have long affected Vietnam\u2019s coastal waters.But he said a general lack of trust in the government, along with the factory\u2019s associations with mainland China and Taiwan, had damaged consumer confidence in the domestic seafood industry and made it difficult for many fishermen on the central coast to make a living.Conflicting accounts about the fish kill by several ministries in the weeks after the event only added to the suspicions, said Le Quang Binh, former director of the Hanoi-based Institute for Studies of Society, Economics and Environment. And because so many Vietnamese were debating the issue on social media, he added, they were able to spot inconsistencies and demand more public accountability. \u201cIn Vietnam, traditionally people avoid politics because it\u2019s sensitive,\u201d Mr. Binh said. \u201cBut now, more people understand that they cannot avoid politics because politics and policy can affect their lives.\u201dJonathan D. London, a Vietnam expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said the intense public interest in the fish kill presented an acute problem for Vietnam\u2019s top leaders, who took office in the spring.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to do something that no leaders have had to do in the past,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is essentially address public outrage that is being freely expressed on a daily basis.\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi, Vietnam, and Richard C.

{"Headline": "Guiding Refugees in Europe on a Rocky Path to Assimilation", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byAMSTERDAM \u2014 Mahmoud al-Omar leaned over a sewing machine in the basement of a former prison being used to house refugees and began stitching jeans for a popular clothing line. With more than 15 years experience as a tailor in Syria, he zipped through one pair and moved on to another, methodically filling a small order.The job, set up by a Dutch organization that matches refugees with work opportunities, is only temporary. Yet after Mr. Omar fled his war-torn hometown, Aleppo, two years ago, just having a place to go each day felt like a salvation.\u201cWorking is completely necessary to speed up integration,\u201d said Mr. Omar, 28, who still struggles to speak Dutch, hindering his chances of a full-time job. \u201cI want to become independent as soon as possible, so I can start giving back to the country that took me in.\u201dWhen more than one million men, women and children streamed into Europe last year to seek a haven from conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa, governments viewed the labor market as the quickest path to absorb newcomers. The sooner people started working, the thinking went, the faster they could get off government aid and start contributing to the economy.Yet permanent jobs have proven elusive. The lack of language is a big barrier, as is a skills mismatch. Some refugees do not have the right experience, while others cannot get their professional qualifications or degrees recognized.\u201cThe best thing is to try to get people close to work from Day 1, because there\u2019s a long waiting period from the beginning that\u2019s wasted time,\u201d said Jihad Asad, an energetic entrepreneur from Syria who is a co-director at the Refugee Company.\u201cAs a refugee, once you see that your talent is useful and needed, you get a sense that you can keep going,\u201d added Mr. Asad, who received asylum in the Netherlands last summer. \u201cThere\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201dThe adjustment has been harder than expected.The Netherlands, Germany and other countries amended laws to ease access to the labor market, allowing newcomers to work almost immediately instead of waiting months or sometimes years. European businesses began to take on tens of thousands of qualified refugees.But many of those positions are part of internships or vocational programs that have yet to turn into long-term employment.In Germany, most of the 30,000 refugees working are in temporary positions or menial jobs arranged by the government paying 1 euro ($1.10) an hour. Such jobs help them interact with German society, but they are not a path to permanent employment.Although hundreds of German companies pledged to employ refugees, only a small fraction have done so in the last two years, according to a recent survey by the Center for Economic Studies in Munich. To date, around 60 refugees have found full-time jobs at Germany\u2019s 30 largest companies, a separate survey showed.Among that group, 50 went to a single company, DeutschePost, the large courier company. Another 100 refugees are still in temporary work there.\u201cMany of those who came to Europe took tremendous risks, they have an entrepreneurial spirit and want to aim high,\u201d said Christof Ehrhart, a DeutschePost spokesman who helps oversee the company\u2019s efforts to hire refugees.But when some start interning in a package warehouse, he added, it was not always a good fit. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t like the job,\u201d he said. \u201cOr other circumstances make it hard for them to fulfill the needs of the job.\u201dLanguage is still the biggest issue. Mr. Omar had long experience working as a tailor since age 13. But his lack of proficiency in Dutch and English posed a challenge to would-be employers.European companies often do not recognize professional certificates or academic degrees acquired in Syria and countries with different educational standards, putting candidates on an awkward footing with competitors. Others arrived without employable skills and required intensive training.Fleur Bakker, an activist, started the Refugee Company with the view that people assimilate more quickly if they can start working immediately, rather than waiting months for paperwork to clear or until a real job materializes.In the Netherlands, which received 47,600 asylum seekers last year, newcomers are not permitted to work for six months. Many were growing isolated and even suicidal as they idled in shelters, Ms. Bakker said.Ms. Bakker found about 40 Dutch companies that agreed to mentor refugees and tap them for temporary work that, ideally, would lead to permanent jobs matching their talent. She collaborated with the City of Amsterdam to make it possible for refugees to get work experience shortly after arrival.For those lucky enough to land a job, assimilation can come quickly. Dr. Muaz Swaid, 27, a Syrian dentist who fled conflict in 2014, found work in the spring through the Refugee Company at Rechte Tanden, an orthodontist clinic that had trouble finding qualified Dutch workers. He languished in shelters for a year before that, at one point sharing space with 400 asylum seekers in a large tent.\u201cIn those conditions, you can\u2019t think about the future,\u201d said Mr. Swaid, an energetic man. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to make a new beginning, but in the shelter, you\u2019re just hoping to stay alive.\u201dHis main goal on arriving, he said, was to find work and stop living on government subsidies for refugees. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make my own life,\u201d he said, smiling at colleagues who bustled around the sterile, white clinic. \u201cThis country helped me, so I must do something \u2014 it\u2019s paying them back.\u201dAfter signing a work contract, he stopped receiving a \u20ac950 monthly stipend from the government to help pay living expenses and rent on a small apartment. Now, he pays the government around \u20ac700 a month in taxes from the salary he earns at the clinic and from a second job at a local bar. As he becomes more established, he expects his salary, and his tax contributions, to keep rising.This month, the Refugee Company opened a facility in a mothballed prison that the city had converted to refugee housing. Inside is a glassed-in office and a spacious meeting room where refugees gather regularly to discuss employment strategies and forge business connections to help others with assimilation.Dutch restaurant and hotel owners are working on an internal cafe and plan to convert some of the former prison cells into eclectic luxury hotel rooms. The businesses would be run by refugees to give them experience and jobs and to help the restaurants and hotels to identify the best talent for eventual work in their companies.Near the office, a row of sewing machines was installed to fill orders from Dutch clothing cooperatives and even fashion designers preparing collections for Paris fashion week. When the Refugee Company put out a notice seeking skilled refugee tailors, Mr. Omar was one of 20 people to answer the call.\u201cJust being in a workplace and interacting with Dutch people makes you feel like you\u2019re a part of the society,\u201d said Mr. Omar, as a group of other newly minted Dutch citizens buzzed around him.\u201cYou start to feel comfortable and gain confidence that you will eventually get a job and be independent.\u201dKatarina Johannsen contributed reporting from Munich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Galaxy Note 7 Recall Dismays South Korea, the \u2018Republic of Samsung\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byMr. Kim, 58, said he had felt humiliated, as if the non-Koreans in the airport lounge were looking at him.Though he does not own a Galaxy Note 7, his reaction was typical of the intense feelings South Koreans hold toward Samsung, the most dramatic corporate success story to emerge from the country\u2019s transformation from a war-torn agrarian nation to a global economic powerhouse.\u201cWhether we like it or not, Samsung is to the global market what our national team is in the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Kim said.Calling Samsung this country\u2019s biggest and most profitable company hardly describes its special (but not always favorable) place in minds here. Some South Koreans say they live in the \u201cRepublic of Samsung.\u201dLife can literally begin and end with Samsung: One can be born in a Samsung hospital; attend a Samsung university; honeymoon in a Samsung hotel; stock a Samsung-built apartment with Samsung appliances bought with a Samsung credit card; take children to Samsung amusement parks; and have one\u2019s body, upon death, taken to a Samsung funeral center.\u201cThis is not just Samsung\u2019s trouble. It\u2019s trouble for the entire economy,\u201d the opposition leader Moon Jae-in, a potential contender in next year\u2019s presidential election, said this month, referring to the Note 7 crisis. \u201cBecause people take pride in Samsung as a brand representing South Korea, it is their trouble, too.\u201dHaving already overtaken Sony and other Japanese companies it once mimicked, Samsung has grown powerful enough to challenge Apple, an icon of American innovation.\u201cAll manufacturing companies, including the American and Japanese, make mistakes,\u201d said Park Bo-yeon, 29, who was recently browsing in a handset shop in downtown Seoul where a notice urged customers to hand in Note 7s. \u201cWhat matters is whether you can learn from them and move on. Samsung always has.\u201dMs. Park suspected that the Note 7 fiasco had been overblown by the American news media, which she said looked down on Samsung. She said she was disappointed that Samsung had failed to explain why some Note 7s heated up and caught fire. But she was equally impressed by Samsung\u2019s \u201ccourageous decision to terminate the Note 7 before anyone died.\u201dAmong South Koreans, though, the name Samsung also evokes greed and secrecy. They often describe the company as a predator that makes profits not so much through innovation as by ruthlessly squeezing its numerous domestic parts suppliers.The Note 7 disaster raised more doubt about Samsung\u2019s reputation. It also reminded South Koreans that their export-driven economy depended so heavily on Samsung and a handful of other family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebol, that they often feel it is held hostage to them.\u201cThe saying that Samsung\u2019s good and bad luck is our country\u2019s good and bad luck is propaganda manufactured by Samsung and media and politicians beholden to it,\u201d said Kim Sang-gyun, 32, who was visiting the same shop as Ms. Park. \u201cWhy should I worry about Samsung\u2019s trouble unless I owned a Samsung share or Note 7? And I don\u2019t.\u201dSamsung is the most successful among the chaebol, which spearheaded South Korea\u2019s industrialization by copying foreign competitors\u2019 products but making them cheaper, better and faster.China is now using the same model to threaten South Korea in the industries it has dominated through the \u201cfast follower\u201d strategy: shipbuilding, semiconductor and smartphones. South Korea sees itself as in a constant race to catch up with innovators like Apple while struggling to keep a step ahead of Chinese rivals.The Note 7 humiliation left many South Koreans wondering whether Samsung \u2014 and South Korea in general \u2014 is stumbling in that race.\u201cThey say Samsung is the strongest among our country\u2019s businesses,\u201d said Mr. Kim, the former teacher. \u201cThat\u2019s why its Note 7 failure worries me.

{"Headline": "Brace Yourself for a Busy Holiday Season at Airports", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byItinerariesWith Thanksgiving less than a month away, airlines and airports \u2014 not to mention savvy travelers \u2014 are bracing for what could be a record-setting year-end holiday travel season in the United States.Capping a year in which lower fuel prices kept airline ticket prices down, and a more robust economy spurred an increase in passengers, the coming holiday season could make airports more crowded than ever. That\u2019s why it pays to start planning ahead to navigate crowded check-in and security lines.Jessica Tipton, a lawyer in San Francisco who flies frequently for work and leisure, said she planned to give herself three hours to get checked in and through security when traveling this holiday season.\u201cThat\u2019s kind of my minimum for holiday travel, even for a domestic flight,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to a wedding in mid-August, and it took me almost three hours to get through security \u2014 in the middle of a day on a Wednesday.\u201dAnd even as the road warriors are already devising their game plans, airport staff members know that some of the biggest bottlenecks will be caused by the less-experienced travelers whose once-a-year airplane trips come around the holidays.Those are the passengers most likely to turn security checkpoints into chokepoints by trying to tote wrapped gifts in their carry-on luggage or bring items containing more than the allowable 3.4 ounces of liquid. (Snow globes can be big yuletide troublemakers.)And that is despite continued efforts by the federal Transportation Security Administration to educate travelers about the rules.\u201cAwareness of prohibited items is something we constantly have media days on,\u201d said Gary Rasicot, chief of operations for the T.S.A. \u201cWe try to maintain an efficient flow through the checkpoint, but it\u2019s hard to predict.\u201dThe airline industry\u2019s trade group, Airlines for America, has not yet issued projections on passenger numbers for the holiday season. But airport operators are already preparing to accommodate a bigger-than-usual surge.At Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world\u2019s busiest, officials expect 4 to 6 percent more passengers in November and December than during last year\u2019s holiday season, when 16.6 million travelers passed through.\u201cThose are going to be record-high numbers,\u201d said Balram Bheodari, the airport\u2019s deputy general manager.To manage the surge, the Atlanta airport is adding more advanced security screening lanes that automate the movement of carry-on baggage \u2014 five by Christmas, up from two now \u2014 and plans to increase overall hours worked by 20 percent, through overtime and seasonal hires. \u201cIt\u2019s equivalent to about five to seven additional employees per shift during peak time,\u201d Mr. Bheodari said.Many other major airports are taking similar steps.\u201cWhat we have started to see is most airports are putting into place customer service functions; you\u2019ll often see roving workers now to try to manage pinch points and bottlenecks,\u201d said Dan McKone, a managing director and partner at L.E.K. Consulting, whose specialties include aviation and travel.\u201cOne of the things that contributed to profitability in the U.S. airline industry in particular is we\u2019ve been operating at high loads for the past number of years,\u201d Mr. McKone said.The full planes have helped airlines\u2019 balance sheets improve over the last few years. But they also mean there are fewer empty seats to rebook passengers after a delay or a cancellation, which can happen for any number of reasons.Bad weather is always a potential hazard, especially in the northern part of the country and along the busy Eastern Seaboard, where a snow or ice storm in one city can trigger a chain reaction of delays.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a variety of systems across the industry that are quite old,\u201d Mr. McKone said. Despite the risk that the aging technology poses, upgrading would be a considerable expense and would also come with the risk of a malfunction or even a crash during the transition. \u201cThere\u2019s some trepidation about moving away from them,\u201d he said.\u201cThe T.S.A.\u2019s objective is totally different from the objective of airports and airlines,\u201d said Bijan Vasigh, a business professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. \u201cThey want to ensure that the passengers are traveling safely,\u201d he said, even if that means that timeliness takes a back seat.But Mr. Rasicot at the T.S.A. said the controversy over long delays had prompted the agency to re-evaluate its role within the air transportation system.\u201cI think what changed is that T.S.A. used to sort of view ourselves outside the transportation system, as security monitors, and now we\u2019ve integrated ourselves,\u201d Mr. Rasicot said. Now, he said, T.S.A. has a centralized hub where it can oversee the nation\u2019s busiest airports in real time to get updates on staffing, open lanes and passenger wait times.\u201cWe have the ability now to more rapidly adjust our staffing at the airports,\u201d Mr. Rasicot said. If the agency sees a logjam building, it can send in more workers before those on duty get overwhelmed. \u201cWe monitor every major airport hourly for their wait times,\u201d he said, \u201cso we know things more quickly than we used to.\u201dBut seasoned travelers have spent enough time in airports this year to know that the holiday surge will inevitably involve long lines.\u201cThe biggest thing I\u2019m changing is preparing myself to be patient and go a little earlier,\u201d said Heather Hernandez, a clinical operations manager for a pharmaceutical company based in the San Francisco area and a frequent traveler.Ms. Hernandez is planning multiple trips during the period from Thanksgiving to Christmas, and intends to give herself an extra 90 minutes beyond the hour she usually budgets for checking a bag and getting through security.\u201cIt\u2019s so fun as a frequent traveler to be incredibly efficient,\u201d she said. But over the holidays, \u201cit\u2019s just not going to be that way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With City of Towers, China Puts Its Economic Stamp on Caucasus", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byTBILISI, Georgia \u2014 Scott Mi, a businessman from western China, stood on a balcony on one of the nine completed towers of 27 that his company plans to build and gestured toward the distant hilltop boundary of his improbable domain \u2014 a new, Chinese-built city rising atop one of the most volatile geopolitical fault lines left by the collapse of the Soviet Union.\u201cEverything you can see is ours,\u201d said Mr. Mi, the 32-year-old head of Hualing Group Georgia, a privately owned but mostly state-funded company in the vanguard of an effort by China to extend its economic reach into the rocky and often treacherous ground of the Caucasus.At the center of this push stands the Tbilisi Sea New City, a huge property development outside the Georgian capital. It is nearly 200 miles from the nearest sea, but it does sit next to a Soviet-era reservoir, a body of water that adds a splash of color to the growing parade of concrete towers, a huge five-star hotel with the region\u2019s biggest ballroom and, just down the road, a newly built shopping center as long as five football fields.The rebranding of a man-made reservoir as a sea is all part of an outsize project that defies conventional, or at least Western, business thinking.It is introducing Chinese-style economics to a country that, depending on your perspective, is either a critical link in a \u201cnew Silk Road\u201d between Asia and Europe or a cockpit of unresolved and potentially explosive rivalry between Moscow and the West.But what had been a noisy two-way struggle for influence and profit between Moscow and Washington has quietly expanded into a three-ring event that has left China with the most visible role.Mr. Mi\u2019s new city has done nothing less than transplant a patch of China lock, stock and barrel onto previously barren land. Down to its ornamental rock gardens, rigidly geometric street plan and high perimeter wall, it is a nearly exact replica of the property projects that transformed China\u2019s urban landscape before a recent downturn began to curb a flood of funding for construction.This is hardly surprising since most of the design and building work at the Tbilisi Sea New City has been done by workers from China, even though wages in Georgia are often lower than in much of China.\u201cYou can\u2019t make any money here,\u201d complained Liu Peiyun, a construction worker from the central Chinese region of Henan, slapping plaster on an entryway to the new city\u2019s expanding residential section. He said he had hoped to get work in Britain but had been sent to Georgia instead. He wished he had stayed at home.The use of Chinese workers initially stirred anger and even small protests. Those feelings have since faded amid dismay and also delight that, unlike many other grand plans in Georgia, the Chinese project is really happening and is now providing management and other jobs to Georgians.In contrast to the crumbling, Soviet-style apartment blocks in a nearby suburb of Tbilisi \u2014 buildings that look as if they began falling down before they were even fully built \u2014 the Chinese company offers clean if basic modern towers with elevators that work and corridors that do not smell of urine.\u201cWe are Chinese, so we build like in China,\u201d Mr. Mi said, sitting in the shiny marble-clad lobby of his company\u2019s luxury hotel.Aside from absent Communist Party slogan boards, an essential part of all such developments in China, the only missing element is the people.Nearly all the apartments of the residential towers built so far have been sold, many of them to the Georgian government to house refugees from territory seized by Russian-backed rebels.But the whole place is often eerily empty. The only noise on a recent afternoon was the distant clatter of construction and the bustle of security guards preparing for the arrival of the Chinese ambassador and Georgian leaders at a celebration of China\u2019s national day in the hotel\u2019s expansive ballroom.The economic calculus behind the project, like that of many ventures financed by Chinese state banks, is something of a mystery.Georgia\u2019s prime minister, Giorgi Kvirikashvili, a former banker, said he had not done a detailed study of its \u201cinternal rate of return\u201d \u2014 bankers\u2019 jargon for profitability \u2014 but assumed \u201cthere has to be an economic rationale.\u201dMr. Mi, who is the son of the founder and president of Hualing\u2019s parent company back in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, first came to Georgia right after the 2008 war with Russia. He acknowledged that there were initially doubts about the wisdom of sinking money into such a troubled land.\u201cOf course, some people thought this was crazy,\u201d he said.But he said the company, while not yet making a profit, liked Georgia\u2019s low taxes and business environment, and so would keep expanding. It has already built nine tower blocks under a deal with the Georgian government that gave it more than 1,000 acres around the Tbilisi reservoir in return for the construction of housing for athletes who took part in a sporting event last year.Hualing has now started work on six more towers and has plans for the remaining 12. The company also wants to set up a school, a medical clinic and other facilities to create a self-contained, Chinese-style gated community.Mr. Mi said the venture should start making money within five years. In the meantime, he added, the company is serving China\u2019s flagship economic and foreign policy program \u2014 a multibillion-dollar plan launched in 2013 by the Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping, to develop sea and land transport corridors through which China can export its goods to the world, particularly to Europe.Officially called the Belt and Road Initiative but better known as the New Silk Road, the plan involves not only developing railways, ports and other infrastructure but also increasing China\u2019s economic presence in a string of countries stretching from Central Asia to the Caucasus and then into Eastern Europe.In a sign of the Chinese government\u2019s interest despite Georgia\u2019s small size, tumultuous past and population of only 3.7 million, it recently signed a preliminary free-trade pact with the country.Last year, China sent teams of officials and businessmen to Tbilisi for a so-called Silk Road Forum, a conference focused on Georgia\u2019s role as \u201cone of the key hubs of Eurasian trade and commerce.\u201dNonetheless, Georgia and many other countries along the new Silk Road \u2014 an ever expanding concept that includes a multiplicity of different routes \u2014 have been lobbying to get a piece of what Chinese officials have said will be at least a trillion dollars in investment.Unlike Russia and the United States, however, China has so far shown little interest in remaking local politics in its own image or turning Georgia into a platform for its own geopolitical agenda.\u201cAll we want is stability,\u201d said Mr. Mi, whose company has invested half a billion dollars to become Georgia\u2019s biggest single private investor outside energy-related projects like pipelines from neighboring Azerbaijan, a major oil and gas producer.In addition to its property project outside Tbilisi, Hualing runs an industrial zone in western Georgia, a mining venture, a wood processing plant and other businesses.The United States, while Georgia\u2019s most important geopolitical patron, invested just $18.4 million in the country last year. America\u2019s most visible commercial presence in Georgia is through the franchising of fast food chains like Wendy\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s, as well as some hotels.Expectations that China would pour in money willy-nilly, however, have sometimes fallen flat. China is in negotiations to buy a small Georgian Black Sea port at Batumi but pulled out of bidding for a role in the construction of a much bigger new port at Anaklia, also on Georgia\u2019s Black Sea coast.\u201cChinese money is not as free as many imagined,\u201d said Levan Akhvlediani, the chief executive of the Anaklia Development Consortium, which is responsible for building and managing the new port. He spent months negotiating with Chinese companies to get them involved in the Anaklia project but found their demands unreasonable.\u201cThey don\u2019t just pour money in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey usually want control, and if they don\u2019t get control they are not interested.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xi Jinping Is China\u2019s \u2018Core\u2019 Leader: Here\u2019s What It Means", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byIs it a big deal for Mr. Xi to be called \u201ccore leader\u201d?It is. The title doesn\u2019t come with particular powers, but it gives Mr. Xi special stature and sends an intimidating signal that he should not be crossed. By giving Mr. Xi the honor in a formal document, senior Communist Party officials have shown that, willingly or not, they\u2019ve bowed to his dominance.Mr. Xi had already built up a lot of power since he became the national leader in 2012. But he says he is in the middle of a hard, long-term struggle to transform China\u2019s economy, streamline the military and clean up the Communist Party. Mr. Xi\u2019s new title is meant to reinforce his authority to push through policies in the face of doubts and foot dragging.Does this mean that Mr. Xi is as powerful as Mao or Deng?Why do it now?Officials and the state news media have said China is facing daunting economic challenges and foreign policy tensions, and needs a singularly strong core leader to steer the country through difficult changes. They also say the status is meant to help Mr. Xi\u2019s fight against corruption.Those arguments have some sway in China. Before Mr. Xi came to power in 2012, there was pent-up frustration that corrupt bureaucratic fiefs had grabbed and abused power at the expense of effective leadership.But another reason, unmentioned by the officials, is the coming leadership changes. Mr. Xi is near the end of his first five years in power, and a party congress next year must appoint a new lineup to serve under him in his next five years.Mr. Xi\u2019s elevation to core leader is a chip that he can use when negotiating the makeup of the next leadership. It does not mean that Mr. Xi will get everything he wants, but it adds to his bargaining power.What should we look out for?Look for signs that Mr. Xi is extending his power or being held in check.First, how will the campaign to acclaim him as core leader play out? How enthusiastically will provincial leaders join the campaign? Two officials recently promoted by Mr. Xi were among the most avid public supporters of making him a core leader. Other officials hoping to rise will feel pressure to join the adulation.Also, pay attention to who is promoted leading up to the party congress next year. Which officials will be assigned to cities and provinces that give them a good shot at joining the elite Politburo and its Standing Committee? The pattern of who rises will tell us something about the balance of forces inside the elite.Finally, will Mr. Xi\u2019s power provoke opposition in the elite? Some officials and businesspeople complain about Mr. Xi\u2019s hard-line ideology and policies against corruption, which make life harder even for clean officials. But so far, there are no signs of that frustration\u2019s coalescing into high-level opposition. Mr. Xi has the upper hand. There are no challengers in the elite in sight.Advertisement"}
