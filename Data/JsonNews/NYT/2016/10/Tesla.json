Unknown to the police officers who were called to deal with the situation, the person was also a patient in the city\u2019s public health system.\u201cWe could have at that point had one of the providers who knew this person help with the consultation with the police,\u201d Ms. Garcia said.In Los Angeles County, law enforcement agencies have for years paired clinicians with police officers. Mark Gale, the criminal justice chairman for the Los Angeles County Council of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said the programs had saved lives.No matter how much a police officer is trained, he said, only a clinician has the depth of education and experience to talk to people in crisis the right way.\u201cSo, that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Mr. Gale added. \u201cYou want somebody that can defuse the situation so nobody gets hurt.\u201dNeed an escape?But make no mistake, the old guys can still rock.

After 11 years in a two-bedroom condo in Boerum Hill, they wanted more room and outdoor space. They sold their apartment for nearly $1.2 million and bought the three-story Red Hook house for almost $1.7 million.Red Hook lacks subway service, so Ms. Sengupta catches a B61 bus to Borough Hall and then a train to the financial district. Mr. Datta hops on a Citi Bike to connect to a train that takes him to his Midtown job at a wealth management firm.Both say it\u2019s worth it.

{"Headline": "Range Is All the Rage in Paris, as Electric Cars Steal the Show", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byWheelsPARIS \u2014 For perhaps the first time at a major international auto salon, the stars of the Paris Motor Show are electric cars.The 2016 show, open to the public through Oct. 16, also has the usual sampling of futuristic designs and prototypes. And of course there are some conventional new models soon to hit dealer showrooms.But this show may end up being best remembered as a tipping point for an electric car revolution poised to challenge the automobile industry\u2019s internal-combustion status quo \u2014 although some of the excitement is still speculative, of course.VW already sells the all-electric e-Golf, but its limited range between charges is a big drawback. The e-Golf is considered a \u201ccity electric\u201d for short commutes, not a long-distance road warrior.The new e-Golf, to be sold in more locations than the current model, will serve as a \u201cbridge vehicle,\u201d the company says, to the new all-electric based on the I.D., whose debut is planned for 2020. Volkswagen says it will have an electric self-driving car by 2025, which is why the I.D. on display here features a steering wheel that retracts into the dashboard when the car is in autonomous mode.Almost every other manufacturer in attendance is offering at least one new model with full electric operation or a hybrid combination of gas and electric.The five-passenger subcompact Ampera-e promised the trifecta of electric car must-haves: considerable utility for a car its size, a mass-market price and an all-electric range of more than 500 kilometers, or 310 miles. (The Chevrolet version has a stated range of 238 miles, based on E.P.A. standards, which are tougher than their European counterparts.)Four years ago, Tesla pulled ahead as the new standard-bearer, with electric cars that could go up to 265 miles on a charge. The company said here that its new Model S P100D was rated at 315 miles. But its $135,000 price puts the car well out of the reach of mainstream buyers.But G.M. claims to have solved the problem. As evidence, the company announced here that its engineers had driven the Ampera-e 417 kilometers, or 260 miles, from London to the Paris show via the Channel Tunnel.\u201cWhen we arrived, we still had a further 80 kilometers of range left,\u201d said Pam Fletcher, the project\u2019s executive chief engineer. \u201cThat is substantially more than we just announced for this car two weeks ago.\u201dWhile she did not detail the exact methodology, route or road conditions of that drive, \u201cany careful driver, on a national road, could have driven this car 500 kilometers,\u201d Ms. Fletcher said. \u201cWe are presenting a real production car, not something that is two to three years away.\u201dThe Ampera-e\u2019s price was not announced here. But its nearly identical cousin in America, the Chevrolet Bolt, has a base price of $37,495. And a range of possible tax credits and incentives offered in the United States could lower the final cost by more than $7,000.\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d Chris Paine, writer and director of the 2006 documentary film \u201cWho Killed the Electric Car?\u201d wrote in an email about the Ampera-e. \u201cThe real question is when it will hit showrooms for us to drive, or have Lyft pick us up in one.\u201dThe Ampera-e will go on sale in Europe next spring, the company said.But the Zoe, the first generation of which made its debut in 2012, has been offered for about $27,000 without a battery, less expensive than the Bolt. Buyers then lease a battery pack from the manufacturer for about $100 a month. Renault said the new Zoe would probably have a battery purchase option.Mercedes-Benz built the largest stage here and rigged it for a huge light show with pulsating sound to introduce its Generation EQ vehicles. \u201cWe\u2019re now flipping the switch,\u201d said Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s parent company. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for the launch of an electric product offensive that will cover all vehicle segments, from the compact to the luxury class.\u201dThe attention devoted to electric cars at the Paris show stole the spotlight from diesel-powered cars, once a staple of the European automobile market and past stars of this show.Diesel\u2019s inherently dirtier emissions are not welcome in Paris these days. To address the city\u2019s notoriously bad air quality, the municipal government has since July 1 prohibited cars that were registered before 1997 from operating on the streets on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. By 2020, environmental activists predict, all diesels might be banned in Paris.And the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has proposed expanding car-free areas. One just approved will transform a major thoroughfare along the Seine into a pedestrian zone.But this city, where the electric-car-sharing service Autolib\u2019 has been operating for nearly five years, would presumably be hospitable to more e-cars \u2014 as the electric revolution at the Paris Motor Show may have foreshadowed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Three Strong-Performing Funds Pick Stocks", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byMany stock-picking styles have sizzled lately, with growth and value and domestic and international investing all toting up gains. Three of the better-performing mutual funds of recent months found their winners among small- and large-cap growth stocks and Chinese shares.\u201cOur typical company might have only six analysts following it, compared to maybe 50 for Apple,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. The Hood River managers say there is a \u201cresearch gap\u201d that they can fill, thanks to their 20 years of work with small caps.The three met in the 1990s while working at what was then Columbia Management in Portland, Ore. In the early 2000s, Mr. Smoluch and Mr. Marvin created a predecessor to their fund at Roxbury Capital Management. A few years later, they recruited Mr. Swank, and, in 2013, the three started Hood River Capital Management, also in Portland.As stock pickers, they\u2019re generalists, surveying all parts of the market. They will scoop up several companies in a field if they see growing companies benefiting from a broader trend. They have done that in fiber optics, with holdings like Oclaro, Fabrinet and Finisar, all recent double-digit gainers.\u201cFor a while, there was a huge overcapacity of components for fiber networks,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve had a major industry consolidation combined with accelerating demand,\u201d as networks upgrade to meet the bandwidth needs of smartphones, cloud computing and video streaming.In researching a promising company, they talk with its competitors, customers and suppliers. They estimate they make about 1,000 calls a year. Talks with pharmaceutical and biotech executives led them to a holding in PRA Health Sciences.\u201cIt\u2019s a contract research organization that manages clinical trials,\u201d Mr. Swank said. \u201cBased on our conversations, we believe it\u2019s gaining market share, and the entire industry is being helped along by the high level of biotech financing that happened in 2015.\u201dThe institutional shares of the Hood River fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 15.01 percent in the third quarter, compared with 3.85 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Baker builds his portfolio around themes that he sees shaping technology and the economy, like the emergence of artificial intelligence, and seeks stocks with strategies that will play out over three to seven years. Market attention tends to be short-term, creating opportunities for people who can be more patient, he said.He has long held Amazon shares, for example, even as other investors have said they are overvalued, based on the price-earnings ratio.\u201cAmazon has gone, over the last 15 years, from $5 to $840,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019d think people would wear down and realize that looking at it on current-period earnings isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.\u201d\u201cMore than a million people die every year driving,\u201d he said. \u201cSelf-driving cars will never drive drunk or high or distracted. They won\u2019t be texting and driving.\u201dArtificial intelligence favors the biggest tech companies, he said, because it demands lots of data and cheap, powerful computing, both of which they have in abundance.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009, and over the last five years, it has been one of the top performers among large-cap growth funds, returning an annualized average of 18.53 percent. In the third quarter, it returned 11.89 percent. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.91 percent.The fund holds only 36 stocks, a deliberately focused selection, he said. \u201cYou have to choose between the last two to get down to the one you really like,\u201d he said.For several years, worrisome economic news has streamed from China \u2014 reports of a slowing economy, overheated real estate markets and banks fat with problem loans. Mr. Mattock said such macro scares have buffeted China portfolios, on and off, for the roughly 15 years he has been investing in the country.But the \u201cobsession with macro,\u201d he said, has overshadowed a continued maturation of Chinese companies that offers opportunities for committed investors. \u201cWe have a lot of the big industry leaders in the portfolio, and these macro stories meant I could pick them up at a very good price,\u201d he said.In insurance, for example, the fund owns Ping An and China Life, two of the country\u2019s biggest insurers. In e-commerce, it holds Alibaba and Vipshop Holdings. Alibaba and Vipshop are leading e-commerce companies.The Matthews fund, with an expense ratio of 1.14 percent, returned 14.95 percent in the third quarter.An article in the special Mutual Fund Quarterly section last Sunday about the strongest-performing mutual funds misstated the expense ratio for the institutional shares of the Hood River Small-Cap Growth Fund. It was 1.09 percent, a net figure that accounts for fee waivers and expense reimbursements by the fund company, not 1.49 percent, which is the gross expense ratio.Advertisement"}

What You Can Do.", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The drought is not going away.While the situation has improved since last year, meteorologists say we are a long way from replenishing our groundwater supplies and reservoirs. And the drought shows no sign of ending.What does this all mean for Californians?\u2022 What should individual Californians be doing right now to help relieve the drought?Two things: replace inefficient appliances in our homes, businesses and farms, and change our water-using behaviors. The first option results in permanent improvements in water-use efficiency. The second offers temporary savings. For example, letting your lawn go brown is a temporary savings, but replacing your water-hogging lawn with a beautiful garden of drought-tolerant plants is a permanent improvement.\u2022 Is this a typical cyclical drought?No. Its length and severity are, in many ways, unprecedented, but perhaps the most significant new factor is the growing influence of human-caused climate change in the form of rising temperatures and changing storm patterns. The fingerprints of climate change are evident now and are forcing water managers to rethink old assumptions about how to tackle California\u2019s water problems.\u2022 What\u2019s the worst that can happen if things don\u2019t turn around?We already face a real risk that a wide range of fish species will go extinct. A continuing drought will lead to a reduction in the acreage we can reliably irrigate. And we may see rising numbers of people, especially in disadvantaged communities in the Central Valley, without access to safe and affordable water.\u2022 What\u2019s the most important step the state can take to mitigate the drought?Three critical steps: Improve water conservation and efficiency; expand the use of nontraditional sources of water, especially storm water and treatment and reuse of wastewater, and communicate to the public about the need to play a role in improving our water use.\u2022 How long can I take shower for without feeling guilty?Ha. A 10-minute shower with an old five-gallons-per-minute shower head uses 50 gallons. A 10-minute shower with a modern two-gallons-per-minute shower head uses 20. So the first step toward a guilt-free shower is replace your old shower head. After that, just don\u2019t linger!\u201cIt\u2019s everything that\u2019s amazing about San Francisco and everything unique about tech and where they clash,\u201d said Pat Blute, the show\u2019s producer and writer.The musical revolves around Riley, a founder of a fictional start-up who is in crisis because at almost 30 he hasn\u2019t made a single \u201c30 under 30\u201d list. His co-founder, Delia, is dealing with the frustrations of being a woman in a male-dominated industry.One recurring joke \u2013 and a common complaint among women in the tech industry \u2013 is that Riley can bloviate about strategy and use impenetrable jargon, but whenever Delia makes a statement it instantly gets challenged by the various men in the room.Mr. Blute is poking fun with love. He lives in San Francisco and does marketing and event promotion for a stable of tech company clients. The cast has a number of people who work at companies like Dropbox and Yammer.The show runs from Thursday to Sunday, and is itself a kind of start-up.

{"Headline": "For AT&T Chief, Time Warner Deal Is the Peak of an Ambitious Climb", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byRandall L. Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, could easily be pigeonholed as just another empire-building executive with a white-bread r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He is a 56-year-old Republican from Oklahoma atop a 140-year-old company, whose extracurricular highlights include serving as president of the Boy Scouts of America and shaping professional golf as a policy board member for the PGA Tour.Just five weeks ago, in the midst of the negotiations to acquire Time Warner, he ducked away to a hotel ballroom in Dallas to address 2,000 members of various AT&T employee resource groups \u2014 clubs for veterans, millennials, African-Americans and more.Typically this would be an occasion to spotlight the company\u2019s successes and hand out awards. But unbeknown to most executives in the company, he had scrapped the speech prepared for him and written his own remarks. \u201cOur communities are being destroyed by racial tension,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re too polite to talk about it.\u201dWith a Southern drawl, a vestige from his childhood in Moore, Okla., he reflected on racial tensions in America. He said his best friend, who is black, had recently spoken to him about the racism he had faced over the years. And Mr. Stephenson addressed the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 becoming the rare chief executive to touch what has become a divisive social and political subject. When someone says, \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said, \u201cwe should not say, \u2018All lives matter,\u2019 to justify ignoring the real need for change.\u201dHe closed with a call to action. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to be tolerant of each other,\u201d he said. \u201cTolerance is for cowards. Understand each other.\u201dTo many AT&T employees in the room, it was a surprise. The boss had emerged as an advocate for social justice. He got a standing ovation.But several people who have known Mr. Stephenson for years said the moment reflected the people skills \u2014 and the willingness to go out on a limb \u2014 that have helped drive his career. \u201cI wish everyone at his level would make the same kind of commitment,\u201d said Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, who has worked with Mr. Stephenson on early childhood education and health initiatives.\u201cThe scouts, the education, helping improve an entire neighborhood in D.C. \u2014 he\u2019s not just doing it out of the goodness of his heart. They could also be future customers,\u201d Mr. Powell added. It\u2019s something other corporate leaders should learn from, he said.Mr. Stephenson grew up in suburban Oklahoma. His family ran a cattle feed business and he studied accounting at the University of Central Oklahoma. But in 1982, while still in college, Mr. Stephenson joined Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, and soon he was working the night shift in a data center, changing out tapes on mainframe computers.At the time, Southwestern Bell was part of the old AT&T, the sprawling network of telephone systems that connected much of the United States known as Ma Bell. Then antitrust regulators broke up AT&T, shattering the company into seven \u201cBaby Bells\u201d in 1984.After bouncing around the tax and finance departments for a few years, Mr. Stephenson moved to Mexico in 1992 to help oversee a joint venture in the country for Southwestern Bell, known as SBC. It was a long way from Oklahoma, but Mr. Stephenson adapted quickly. He immersed himself in the culture and sent his children to Mexican schools \u2014 and took up intensive Spanish lessons.\u201cUsually we speak English to Americans,\u201d said Jaime Chico Pardo, a senior Mexican telecom executive involved in the joint venture who later served on AT&T\u2019s board. \u201cBut he said, \u2018Talk to me in Spanish, or otherwise I\u2019ll never learn.\u2019\u201dAT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Mr. Stephenson\u2019s time in Mexico also gave him a crash course in empire building.Among the habits he learned: keeping an up-to-date list of potential acquisition targets, and being ambitious in striving to make his company bigger and more influential.In 1996, he moved back to the United States. By 2005, he was a member of SBC\u2019s board \u2014 and that same year, SBC and AT&T were reunited in a merger. Two years later, Mr. Stephenson became chief executive.Upon assuming the role, Mr. Stephenson did something unexpected: He moved the company headquarters about 300 miles north, to Dallas from San Antonio, a decision he called in a recent interview \u201cthe hardest I\u2019ve made as C.E.O.\u201dBut the reasons were simple. \u201cFirst and foremost, to get our people access to great airports,\u201d he said. (Dallas has two international airports.) Also, he said, Dallas had one of the best labor markets in the country for engineers, sales personnel and managers.Less than a decade later, AT&T has made a big impact on the city. AT&T is the lead sponsor of the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 futuristic football stadium, and has its name on the city\u2019s main performing arts center.\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing for Dallas,\u201d Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, said in an email. \u201cThe jobs. The improvement downtown.\u201dAmong Mr. Stephenson\u2019s favored new projects is the development of the Trinity Forest Golf Club, which is designed to lure a big golf tournament back to Dallas.He professes to be bad at the game himself \u2014 \u201cI stink,\u201d he said recently \u2014 although he has a 13 handicap, according to the United States Golf Association. But it\u2019s a \u201cthinking man\u2019s game,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you spend three or four hours walking 18 holes, you get to know somebody.\u201dSince the federal government broke up AT&T more than three decades ago, the company has been deliberately reassembling itself as a media powerhouse. Over the last 15 years, AT&T has struck more than $200 billion of deals. Mr. Stephenson was involved in them all, and has presided over some 44 acquisitions as chief executive.But until this month, his most ambitious deal was the one that got away. In March 2011, as word spread that Sprint was closing in on a takeover of T-Mobile USA, a rival wireless provider, AT&T and its advisers stayed quiet as they labored on what they had code-named \u201cProject Auto.\u201d To help keep their work secret, AT&T was code-named \u201cTesla\u201d; T-Mobile \u201cMercury\u201d; and T-Mobile\u2019s majority owner, Deutsche Telekom of Germany, \u201cDaimler.\u201dAnd then, on a Sunday, AT&T announced an audacious $39 billion takeover of its smaller rival \u2014 a move that would have made it the nation\u2019s biggest carrier and reduced the number of major American service providers to three from four.Critics emerged quickly, and vociferously. AT&T believed it could get the deal through the thicket of regulatory approval. \u201cWhen you get to the facts, this is a deal that gets approved,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said at the time.Yet the T-Mobile case proved to be one of overweening ambition and an inability to read the political terrain.In the view of Gene Kimmelman, then a senior official in the Justice Department Antitrust Division, Mr. Stephenson and his lieutenants were willing to compromise and find ways to placate the government. But the problem was that the government was opposed to the very idea of AT&T\u2019s buying T-Mobile in the first place.\u201cIt was obvious from the get-go that they were willing to spin off assets and accept certain conditions on their deal,\u201d said Mr. Kimmelman, who is now chief executive of Public Knowledge, an antitrust public advocacy group. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand that this was a situation where antitrust officials thought the deal was dangerous.\u201dBy year\u2019s end, Mr. Stephenson was forced to walk away, paying T-Mobile $3 billion in cash and valuable wireless spectrum. But the AT&T chief learned some lessons from the defeat, according to people who know him. Mr. Stephenson was soon more engaged in Washington, becoming chairman of the Business Roundtable, a pro-business advocacy group. It reflected a realization, friends say, of the significance of politics in business at that level.\u201cHe learned from that,\u201d said W. James McNerney Jr., who until last year was chief executive of Boeing, and has worked closely with Mr. Stephenson.The first sign that Mr. Stephenson\u2019s ambitions had not been tempered came in 2014, when AT&T agreed to a $49 billion takeover of DirecTV. This added some 38 million satellite TV subscribers to the empire, giving the company more clout to negotiate with content providers \u2014 companies like CBS, Fox and even Time Warner, which produce the television shows and movies that AT&T funnels to customers\u2019 screens.Yet while AT&T is best known for its wireless phone plans, its operations encompass more areas: broadband internet for consumers and businesses; DirecTV subscriptions in the United States and Latin America; and, more recently, a joint venture focused on online video, Otter Media.Expansion has cost Mr. Stephenson some allies. Though AT&T has flirted with the idea of an international empire in other ways \u2014 it weighed a bid for Vodafone, the European wireless giant, several years ago \u2014 Mr. Stephenson has instead kept his cross-border ambitions closer to home. Around the time of the DirecTV deal, AT&T also bought a Mexican service provider, Grupo Iusacell S.A., and Nextel Mexico. Along with the acquisition of DirecTV\u2019s Latin American business, this put Mr. Stephenson in direct competition with his former mentor, Mr. Slim.\u201cCarlos and I have spoken, and he\u2019s a very dear friend,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said at the time of the deal. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s going to be a competitor, and we recognize that, and off we go.\u201d\u201cHe had an understanding that his business was already being dominated by video,\u201d Mr. Chernin said.And then he turned to his Carlos Slim-inspired spreadsheet. Buying Time Warner is the final step in what AT&T calls a \u201cvertically integrated\u201d conglomerate: One part of the company would produce \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Batman movies and CNN, and then make them available on satellite TV, smartphones and tablets. All the while, the same company would also collect copious amounts of data on its customers, helping advertisers more perfectly target audiences while collecting more money to pay for content.\u201cWe did this with one thing in mind,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to change the game. This is an environment just begging for innovation.\u201dSkeptics of Mr. Stephenson\u2019s strategy instead see more dangers in having one company own both the \u201cpipes\u201d of the internet and some of the most valuable content to flow through them. \u201cWhat\u2019s most clear is that the new AT&T is like the old Ma Bell, in that it intends to be the dominant player,\u201d said Mr. Kimmelman of Public Knowledge. \u201cIt\u2019s not a monopoly \u2014 but certainly a dominant force in the market.\u201dAs was the case when AT&T bid for T-Mobile, criticism of the Time Warner deal has come swiftly from both sides of the aisle. Hillary Clinton urged a thorough review, while Donald J. Trump called for an outright rejection of the takeover.Mr. Stephenson professed no surprise at the response. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve done large-scale deals, that first day there\u2019s always a lot of commentary on it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been calling for a thorough review \u2014 it\u2019s just the volume level.\u201dHe also discounts the warnings that merging AT&T and Time Warner will be a repeat of the disastrous union of AOL and Time Warner, considered the worst deal of all time. \u201cAOL was just bought for $4 billion,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is going to buy AT&T for $4 billion.\u201d (AT&T has a market value of more than $220 billion, though its stock has dropped about 7 percent since news emerged of its plans to buy Time Warner.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Motors Profit Surprises Investors Ahead of Merger Vote", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byThe electric carmaker Tesla Motors said on Wednesday that it earned $22 million in the third quarter, its first profitable period since 2013, raising expectations for the success of its expansion plans.The company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said in a letter to investors that the results reflected improvements in vehicle production, the addition of new stores and a steady increase in market share for its luxury models.\u201cWe were able to have our best quarter ever, and we are heading toward a great fourth quarter as well,\u201d Mr. Musk said in a conference call with analysts.Tesla reported revenues for the quarter of $2.3 billion, more than double the results in the comparable period last year. The company said it delivered nearly 25,000 vehicles to customers in the quarter.Mr. Musk has been pushing for efficiencies throughout the company, particularly in its quality levels and rate of production.\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the team for executing so well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of the best moments in Tesla history.\u201dInvestors were looking for Tesla to break its string of unprofitable quarters before a Nov. 17 shareholder vote on its proposed merger with the solar-panel company SolarCity to form a diversified alternative energy conglomerate.\u201cFinally Tesla has achieved a milestone that investors long awaited \u2014 a profitable quarter, and a surprise one at that,\u201d said the analyst Michelle Krebs of AutoTrader.com.Tesla, with its core business of making and selling electric cars, has consistently posted losses over the last five years, as it has accelerated the expansion of its product line and its lone auto assembly plant in California.In the second quarter of this year, the company lost $293 million on revenue of $1.27 billion and missed its target of delivering 17,000 new vehicles to customers.But Mr. Musk affirmed on Wednesday that Tesla was on track to build 50,000 vehicles in the second half of this year, and to reach an annual production goal of 500,000 by 2018.Mr. Musk \u2014 who helped found SolarCity and is its largest stockholder \u2014 is under pressure to prove that Tesla can be a profitable foundation for the success of the combined companies.\u201cFor investors, it\u2019s crucial to treat Tesla just like any other company,\u201d the analyst Clement Thibault of Investing.com wrote. \u201cThis means demanding deadlines be kept and promised targets achieved.\u201dIn the past, Mr. Musk has been granted latitude by investors who have backed his long-term vision of a full lineup of zero-emission vehicles. That includes the coming Model 3 sedan, which will sell for a more mainstream price of about $35,000, less than half the cost of Tesla\u2019s more expensive sedans.Enthusiasm peaked this year when Tesla received more than 300,000 pre-orders \u2014 and $1,000 deposits \u2014 for the Model 3. Mr. Musk has promised the car will be on the market by late next year.The investigation of the Autopilot system, which was engaged in the vehicle when it collided with a tractor-trailer, has raised doubts about Tesla\u2019s decision to install an unproven \u201cbeta\u201d version of the feature that drivers may not know how to use properly.Mr. Musk, however, has hardly dialed back his promises for the future. In a blog post in July, he pledged to eventually broaden Tesla\u2019s lineup beyond electric cars into battery-powered pickups, semi-trucks and buses.The solar company \u2014 which, like Tesla, has also consistently lost money \u2014 is intent on providing panels and other equipment that create self-sustaining, solar-powered homes and businesses, with the capability of storing excess energy in large batteries for later use.Tesla has said the merger will help it cut costs and will open its electric-car showrooms to marketing solar energy equipment.Advertisement"}

Morning or night?I prefer to read at night. When I\u2019m traveling I pack as light as possible and read on my iPad. But at home I like to sit and turn the pages by hand and have a physical relationship to the book as an object. It\u2019s more old-school.How do you organize your books?I organize my books by subject.

Three brilliant minds that had never met, all writing sonnets and passionate letters to each other for four years, eventually falling in love with each other through this correspondence. Seeing this love triangle unfold through actual letters was very exciting for me as a young girl. Later in life, I met Susan Sontag, and she told me she wanted to give me a new edition of a book for which she had recently written the foreword. You can understand my surprise when I discovered it was this very same book. She was always giving me books over the course of our friendship, but this one is the most precious to me, especially since she is no longer with us.Which writers \u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 working today do you admire most?The historian and biographer Tom Reiss.

While reading it, I was so nostalgic about the simplicity and innocence of the art scene in the \u201970s, which I think she portrayed really well.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?An autobiography of Gandhi. I would hope the president would be inspired to run the country with a nonviolent attitude and to learn from the example of his life.You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?Kafka, Hemingway and Beckett. It would either be a great success or complete disaster, but definitely an eventful evening.If you could befriend any author, dead or alive, who would it be?I have always wanted to meet Paul Auster.

{"Headline": "One Day, Cars Will Connect With Your Fridge and Your Heartbeat", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byWheelsWHEN Bruce Wayne rolled up to his Bat Cave, a roadblock dropped automatically, the camouflaged garage door swung open, the lights flickered on and Alfred was already standing by.\u201cThe car is going to become another node in the internet of things,\u201d said Kamyar Moinzadeh, chief executive of Airbiquity, a Seattle software and engineering company specializing in vehicle tracking and telematics.But cars more fully integrated into the so-called internet of things \u2014 everyday devices able both to send and receive data \u2014 could become more of a seamless piece of the daily digital fabric of people\u2019s lives.BMW announced this month that its Connected services would enable Alexa owners to lock the car doors and check car battery levels from the comfort of their sofas.Ford Motor plans to introduce Alexa integration into vehicles, including the Escape and Fusion, before the end of this year, said James A. Buczkowski, who oversees advanced engineering at Ford.\u201cYour spouse could add things to the shopping list, which your car would alert you to,\u201d Mr. Buczkowski said. The updated list could then automatically tip off the car\u2019s navigation system about where to pick up the last-minute items.The first generation of connected systems like G.M.\u2019s OnStar were focused on helping drivers when they were lost or their cars broke down, and the second generation has been about connecting the dashboard to smartphones for streaming live traffic information or audio services like Pandora, said Mr. Moinzadeh at Airbiquity.The next generation, he said, will focus on managing our entire digital lives, aided by semiautonomous systems that assume more responsibility for actual driving tasks.\u201cOnce we get to the world of autonomous driving, these cars are not going to be about horsepower but about the in-vehicle experience and how it\u2019s connected to your lifestyle,\u201d Mr. Moinzadeh said. \u201cThe car will talk to all your connected things, whether it\u2019s your refrigerator or your home security system.\u201dMercedes-Benz is among the automakers intent on integrating cars more fully into the mobile communications network, without waiting to peg it to autonomous driving.\u201cThe car is developing into a quality-time machine,\u201d Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of Daimler, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, said last month at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin.Next year, Mr. Zetsche said, the company\u2019s In Car Office services will automatically connect drivers to scheduled conference calls and navigate to appointments based on calendar entries.Other industry executives see potential health and safety applications.\u201cIn health care, it\u2019s about monitoring people and how they are behaving,\u201d said Bret Greenstein, vice president for the Watson internet-of-things artificial intelligence division at IBM.Driver attentiveness can be assessed by a combination of sensors in the car, including acoustic monitors, eye trackers and wearable devices, Mr. Greenstein said.\u201cEven how fast or safely you drive tells us about your mood and well-being,\u201d he said.Brain waves and heart rates can indicate stress, according to Mr. Buczkowski of Ford. Such signals might then tell the car to block incoming calls or switch the audio system from AC/DC to Yanni.The welter of onboard sensors, Mr. Buczkowski said, could turn the car into a four-wheeled digital stethoscope that compiles a continuous record of your condition, generating a more accurate assessment of your health compared with the snapshot of a once-a-year checkup.Between the digital dreams and the on-road reality, though, there are technological challenges, according to Chris Penrose, who oversees the internet-of-things group at AT&T. The company, he said, is working on such efforts with nearly 20 different auto brands around the world.But right now, for example, there is no single networking standard for internet-of-things devices, even in the so-called smart home segment. There are multiple wireless systems, including ZigBee and Z-Wave, and no single software platform has taken hold.\u201cThere are multiple gateways into the house now,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive technology for the Silicon Valley company Nvidia.Onboard car systems must have access to the vast amount of information accumulating from all these devices to take advantage fully of the internet of things, Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut if there is no standard,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes it very difficult.\u201dMr. Buczkowski acknowledges the hurdles. Separate and incompatible systems from Google and Amazon might be able to compete or coexist in the home market. But cars operate in the public sphere and will need to share information with traffic systems, parking meters and other cars.\u201cVehicles from Ford, G.M., Honda, etc., will all have to talk to each other,\u201d Mr. Buczkowski said. \u201cHow do we manage it \u2014 and who manages it?\u201d\u201cIn automotive, it\u2019s a unique situation because the device is traveling at 60 or 70 miles per hour,\u201d Mr. Moinzadeh said.There is also the sheer ubiquity of automobiles. Everything around us will be connected, including people and cities, said Mohamad Nasser, general manager of the internet-of-things business at Sprint, the mobile communications company.\u201cYou don\u2019t want people messing around with the streetlights,\u201d Mr. Nasser said.While being constantly online may have its drawbacks, it also makes vehicles more resilient, experts say. More and more, as Tesla has already demonstrated, our cars will be upgradable over the air, making them easier to update and repair. And if cars are communicating with their surroundings and one another, the benefits will outweigh the risks, many predict.But the risks cannot be ignored. Tim VanGoethem, a vice president at the telematics firm Harman International, which has been focusing on automotive security, said the threat from hackers was one aspect of an inevitable evolution automakers would have to confront.\u201cOnline shopping and mobile banking,\u201d he pointed out, \u201chave had to go through this already.\u201dAdvertisement"}
