{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Is Being Hypocritical", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe Supreme Court\u2019s motto may be \u201cequal justice under law.\u201d But sometimes it seems more like \u201cdo as we say, not as we do.\u201dConsider Williams v. Pennsylvania, a case the court heard in February concerning whether a state judge should have recused himself from a capital case in which he had an earlier involvement. At one point during the hearing, Justice Elena Kagan, who participated in both Supreme Court lawsuits concerning the Affordable Care Act despite having served as solicitor general in the Obama administration, asked what would constitute \u201csignificant involvement\u201d in a case \u2014 i.e., enough to require a recusal.The answer to that question may not be obvious. But surely Justice Kagan\u2019s experience in the Obama administration constituted \u201csignificant involvement\u201d in the Affordable Care Act cases. In the end, a majority of justices, including Justice Kagan, ruled in Williams v. Pennsylvania that the judge who refused to recuse himself should have stepped aside.So went another case in what I call the court\u2019s self-referential docket. Each year, the justices hear a handful of suits that have parallels with how they act as stewards of their institution. But instead of changing their own practices in light of their holdings in these cases, the justices too often carry on as before, as if they can play by their own rules when it comes to transparency and accountability.In recent years there have been a number of such cases concerning money and the potential for judicial corruption. In 2015, for example, the court ruled that the Florida Bar was within its rights to discipline a judge for personally soliciting campaign contributions. The majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., held that there was a \u201cvital state interest in safeguarding public confidence in the fairness and integrity\u201d of the nation\u2019s judges.But if there is a vital interest in the integrity of the court, why was Justice Stephen G. Breyer allowed to rule on a case last fall in which his wife held about $33,000 worth of stock in a company whose subsidiary was one of the litigants? Or how about the $400,000 worth of shares that Chief Justice Roberts owned in Intel, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, which all signed amicus briefs supporting Walmart in a 2011 class-action lawsuit before the court? (Chief Justice Roberts voted in favor of Walmart in that case.)Other cases have concerned the First Amendment\u2019s protection of speech. In May, the Supreme Court considered whether to review a circuit court\u2019s decision that upheld the conviction of a Maryland man for carrying a placard in protest in the middle of the Supreme Court\u2019s plaza. A lower court had deemed unconstitutional part of the 1949 law under which the man was prosecuted, which had banned protests in that plaza, but the circuit court overruled the decision. The justices decided not to hear the case, effectively condoning an anti-protest buffer zone in front of their courthouse \u2014 even though the Supreme Court has deemed anti-protest buffer zones around abortion clinics unconstitutional.Another ruling, from 1991, still looms over the court. In that case, Gregory v. Ashcroft, the court upheld a provision of Missouri\u2019s Constitution requiring state judges to retire at 70. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, writing for a majority that included Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, offered the following observation: \u201cIt is an unfortunate fact of life that physical and mental capacity sometimes diminish with age.\u201d Of course, Justice Scalia remained on the bench nearly a decade past his 70th birthday, and Justice Kennedy, who began his 30th term on the court this month, turned 80 over the summer.Just a week into the current term, there has already been a self-referential case. In Salman v. United States, argued on Oct. 5, the justices looked to reconcile two appeals courts\u2019 differing standards for what constitutes insider trading. Though the justices presumably don\u2019t give any thought to their investment portfolios when hearing cases, ample research has shown that their decisions do affect financial markets. Yet three justices \u2014 Justices Roberts, Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2014 maintain holdings in individual stocks and apparently do not place them in the types of investment accounts or blended funds that would shield them from any appearance of benefiting financially from their legal decisions.If the court wants to regain some of the respect it has lost in recent years, the justices should consider how, by acting more consistently with their own rulings, they could help build a more open and accountable institution.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paying $15 Billion for Twitter Will Be Hard for Anyone to Justify", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTwitter\u2019s openness to being sold has set off a tweetstorm with a direct message: It will be hard for a new owner to make buying the $15 billion social network stack up.All the excitement has shaken up investors. Twitter shares soared as much as 35 percent in the days after a Sept. 23 report on CNBC that said the company was moving closer to a sale. They tumbled 20 percent on Thursday after the news reports that Google and others had lost interest.In the meantime, the stock of Salesforce.com has fallen more than 5 percent in a day on two occasions after being linked to the auction \u2014 and rebounded again after remarks by its chief executive, Marc Benioff, suggested that he might not be that eager. Salesforce, a $50 billion business-software maker, is short on cash, and investors probably aren\u2019t thrilled about the idea of being diluted for Twitter. More generally, though, there is no way conventional financial analysis can help any company rationalize an acquisition of the purveyor of 140-character messages.Twitter is expected to lose about $270 million next year. Add back around $100 million of interest, then cut in half the roughly $1.7 billion of research and development and marketing costs, as a buyer might do. Twitter\u2019s operating profit would then be about $700 million. According to Morningstar, Twitter\u2019s weighted average cost of capital is roughly 9 percent. To generate an equivalent return on investment, even generously assuming a zero tax rate, would mean paying no more than $7.7 billion for the company, about half its current market value.Silicon Valley often prefers its own oddball math. Twitter may look cheap next to what Microsoft is paying for LinkedIn if the chosen metric is price per monthly active user. Or a company like Alphabet, the parent of Google, might think it can wring more value from Twitter\u2019s ample data. The topic that seems to be trending, though, is that it will be hard for anyone to justify buying Twitter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Twitter Has an Old Media Problem. Here\u2019s a Solution.", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Twitter is a communications marvel, with 317 million active users who instantaneously convey a collective reaction to news.But a business based primarily on advertising needs advertisers. Twitter has not figured out how to attract enough of them to eke out regular quarterly profits. A few potential buyers, including the Walt Disney Company and Salesforce.com, have kicked the tires but decided not to buy the company.I have a solution: Larry Page, a founder of Google, should buy Twitter. Pull out his own wallet and buy it. Personally.It doesn\u2019t literally have to be Larry Page; it could be any civic-minded billionaire who sees Twitter for what it is: a primary source for news and information, not the next Google or Facebook.When Jeff Bezos purchased The Washington Post, it wasn\u2019t because the newspaper was a compelling business opportunity. It was, and remains, a hallowed institution of journalism.The country\u2019s pre-eminent newspapers, including this one, have long been controlled by families who have understood that the press is not just an ordinary industry, but a civic calling. Twitter is not yet treated as hallowed, but it has the makings of an institution that could be.Twitter puts no intermediary between speaker and listener. When public figures do the actual composing \u2014 and, oh, what a difference between Donald J. Trump\u2019s own tweet eruptions and those prepared by his staff \u2014 we get not just information but also a glimpse of the candidate\u2019s unguarded self that we don\u2019t get in other media outlets. For that alone, we should thank the heavens for Twitter.This election has also highlighted Twitter\u2019s capacity to augment coverage of civic events like the three presidential debates as they are happening. Instead of waiting for the predictable reactions of network anchors, guests and pundits, we can use Twitter to see reactions, smart and snarky alike, from hundreds of personally chosen observers while the debate is still on.Put another away, if journalism is the first draft of history, Twitter is the first draft of journalism.The nation\u2019s founders recognized the importance of speedy dissemination of news when they provided for low postal rates for newspaper subscribers and allowed newspaper printers to mail one another newspapers without charge. The content of many newspapers consisted mostly of reprints of articles obtained from these exchanges. In the same way, links in tweets serve as an indispensable guide to the best of journalism that originates outside of Twitter.So who better to rescue Twitter than Mr. Page, a founder of the company dedicated to organizing the world\u2019s information? Twitter takes the first cut of doing that organizing, in real time.Mr. Page also commands an empire built on algorithms. And Twitter has a pressing need for better algorithms to keep the platform free of the sludge discharged by racists, anti-Semites and other trolls.The Anti-Defamation League, in a recent study, counted 2.6 million tweets with anti-Semitic language in a year, but despite Twitter\u2019s disavowal of \u201chateful conduct,\u201d the league found, only 21 percent of the anti-Semitic accounts were suspended. Twitter relies on humans, not software, for enforcement, and they are overwhelmed.This computer-science problem \u2014 filtering out trolls \u2014 remains as difficult as any of the moonshots being tackled in Alphabet\u2019s Google X division. If Mr. Page developed a way to help Twitter keep the hate speech out, that technology would not only win back the advertisers who are fleeing because of trolls, but also, if shared, enable newspapers to reopen their comments\u2019 sections at their own websites, promoting the airing of differing views in public space. What service to the public could surpass that?While I\u2019m offering Mr. Page unsolicited advice about what he should do with his money, I\u2019ll also note that Twitter\u2019s current market capitalization, of around $12 billion, is a triumph of hope over reality. If Twitter\u2019s revenue and user growth fail to surge, the asking price will fall. Look at Yahoo: Eight years ago, the company spurned an acquisition offer from Microsoft for more than $45 billion. This year, it accepted an offer from Verizon for about a tenth of that.In 2011, Mr. Page had an exploratory conversation with one of Twitter\u2019s founders, Jack Dorsey, about Google\u2019s acquiring the company, but Mr. Page\u2019s interest then was in using tweets in search results. Google subsequently struck a deal to gain access to tweets that allows it to enjoy the milk without buying the cow.As Twitter\u2019s prospective suitors have one by one turned away, Twitter\u2019s board surely has come to the realization, at last, that the company has less to do with the sexy, endlessly expanding world of \u201csocial media\u201d \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat \u2014 than with the seemingly duller world of old-school newspapers, limited circulation and less-than-stratospheric profit margins.Mr. Page does not have a Twitter account and is a famously reticent chief executive. But a stray remark he once made suggests he is well suited temperamentally to be Twitter\u2019s white knight. Mr. Page told a friend that our laws would be much improved if their length, in characters or words, was capped to keep them brief. This would ensure that lawmakers would actually read the drafts in their entirety before voting on them.William Randolph Hearst built a newspaper empire on sensationalism when that\u2019s what the audience demanded. Today, consumers are, above all else, impatient, preferring a news snack rather than a feast. Mr. Page, a connoisseur of brevity, would seem to be the perfect billionaire rescuer for Twitter, the highest-circulation short-form \u201cnewspaper\u201d on earth.Randall Stross, a professor of business at San Jose State University, is working on a book about Stanford University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York to Pick Start-Up Over the Industry Leader for Police Body Cameras", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byWhen the New York Police Department announced recently that it had picked a start-up company to supply body cameras for its officers, the choice jolted the fast-growing market for high-tech policing tools.Bypassing Taser International, the industry leader, the department selected Vievu, L.L.C., a company based in Seattle, despite questions about its performance in other cities.A public hearing on a proposed five-year contract with Vievu, worth $6.4 million, is scheduled for Thursday, the latest step in what has been a halting effort to outfit New York City officers with body cameras.Vievu was awarded the New York contract 15 months after being acquired by the Safariland Group, a company from Jacksonville, Fla., that provides the department\u2019s holsters and is seeking a bigger share of the police-equipment market.Taser said on Wednesday it had sent the Police Department a protest letter, asserting that the selection of Vievu was \u201ca grave error that will endanger officers and members of the public.\u201dThe department has faced questions about its proposed protocols for storing, safeguarding and using the video, which may arise at the hearing on Thursday.Taser says its body cameras are used by more than 3,500 law enforcement agencies, including in 34 major cities across the country, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles among them. A spokeswoman for Vievu could not say how many agencies in the United States use its equipment, but the company has recently gained footholds in some sizable cities, with contracts in Miami-Dade County, Fla.; Phoenix and Seattle.Benjamin B. Tucker, the Police Department\u2019s first deputy commissioner, said officials in New York hope to finalize the contract with Vievu by year\u2019s end and to deploy the first 1,000 cameras next year in 20 precincts.According to the contract, an LE4 can record up to 12 hours of standard-definition video on a single charge. That, officials said, would allow a camera to capture a police officer\u2019s perspective over a typical shift, which lasts 8 hours and 35 minutes.The cameras automatically add 30 seconds of buffer video when switched on or off, a feature that Vievu says provides a sense of why an officer is interacting with a civilian. Officers will be able to gain access to videos through either a computer or a custom app on their department smartphones, but will not be able to edit or delete videos, which will be encrypted and logged to prevent tampering and unauthorized access.The New York Police Department, in its request for proposals, required potential vendors to provide a \u201cdetailed continuity of operations plan\u201d guaranteeing that no data would be permanently lost, including when a camera has a low battery charge or becomes disconnected from a cable.Addressing concerns about the reliability of a Vievu system, Jessica Tisch, the Police Department\u2019s deputy commissioner for information technology, said at a news conference this month that the department had consulted with other law enforcement agencies that do business with the company about their experience.\u201cWe would not move forward if we weren\u2019t comfortable that the Vievu cameras were going to provide good coverage and that we were going to store the video in a responsible way,\u201d she said.It was not clear if New York police officials had consulted with their counterparts in Cincinnati, who chose Taser over Vievu after testing both systems this year. In a report in March, a police official there described the Vievu cameras\u2019 limited field of view and lower video and audio quality. Vievu videos, he said, had been difficult to upload and the company\u2019s software repeatedly crashed and required restarting. Cincinnati officials later concluded that Taser\u2019s \u201chardware and software systems were clearly the most advantageous option.\u201dOfficials in New York and elsewhere have said that body cameras can help build public trust in the police. But civil liberties advocates say that the Police Department\u2019s draft policies for using the cameras may undermine the program\u2019s benefits.But the group was critical of other provisions, including one that would allow police officers to review video before making a statement to investigators, including after incidents involving deadly force.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Troubles and Snap\u2019s Appeal: It\u2019s All About the Mojo", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorMomentum can mean everything when it comes to the fortunes of social media giants. Just look at Twitter and the company formerly known as Snapchat.In Silicon Valley, if you are not a hero, you are a loser. And this all-or-nothing narrative is driving the fates of companies beyond all reasonable expectations.For one, the reports of the Salesforce negotiations come on the heels of reports that others, including Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; the Walt Disney Company; and possibly even Microsoft had taken a look at Twitter and decided to pass. All of this reduces whatever leverage the micromessaging service, which has a market value of more than $12 billion, might have possessed before the frenzy of deal speculation began.Salesforce, meanwhile, is stuck in a situation similar to the one Microsoft found itself in when it tried to acquire Yahoo in 2008, with its bidding conducted more or less on a public stage and its own shareholders protesting.As a result, Salesforce will have to show its shareholders that any deal is a good one for the company, and this will come at the expense of Twitter. And if Salesforce subsequently walks away from the discussions, a broken deal will leave Twitter with the label of damaged goods.Any way you look at it, it\u2019s not a great place to be for Twitter.Revenue growth may be on track, increasing about 20 percent in the quarter ending June 30 over the same period of last year, but it is the user growth numbers that have put Twitter into the loser category.It\u2019s the secret sauce of internet valuations. Revenue and earnings are forgiven if you can show growth in users. Whether that makes sense, of course, is another matter.It does explain the puzzle of why Twitter struggles to sell itself and LinkedIn goes for a huge premium. In short, the story line isn\u2019t clean at Twitter, and the growth is not phenomenal. Even though by some metrics Twitter is worth more, it has failed to adequately find a way to make money from its user base. Other Twitter properties like Vine are also struggling with no or low growth.Still, the gloom around Twitter seems overblown. Twitter is an important part of the internet, and even Yahoo found a buyer willing to pay $4.8 billion despite being in slow-motion collapse. A figure twice that high for Twitter would seem to be a bargain. And remember that Facebook faced issues after its initial public offering, but was able to find solid footing in mobile.Sharp leadership \u2014 whether that is from its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, or new blood \u2014 could certainly help Twitter exploit its huge user base.But the problem is that in the eyes of the Valley, Twitter has lost its mojo.A $25 billion valuation would be about 25 times its projected 2017 revenue. In comparison, Facebook went public in 2012 at 19 times revenue, which at the time was considered a rich valuation.It\u2019s easy to be skeptical about such a rock star valuation. Snap lives and dies on the fickle under-30 crowd. At any time, the youth of the world may turn to another product. (WhatsApp appears to be increasingly popular among the tween crowd, for example.) And Snap has no pretensions of being useful or changing the world. It is simply about having fun. So Snap has quite a few risk factors beyond those of Facebook.There are, however, only a few big social media companies left. The rest have been bought up by Google, Microsoft and the like. And Snap has the growth.The question is whether Snap can sustain its messaging business and turn into another Facebook or Google, justifying that $25 billion valuation. So far, Snap has worked hard to keep its product nimble and updated, and it has retained users.The start-up might have just gotten lucky with its messaging product, but there is a clearly a belief at the moment that its co-founder and chief executive, Evan Spiegel, can be a visionary like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and push successfully into new products.Momentum can mint money in Silicon Valley, but you have to sustain it. Snap, if it manages the public offering process right and isn\u2019t too headstrong with the markets, may get the valuation it seeks.Yet the fickle gods of Silicon Valley will turn if the company can\u2019t sustain its growth story. You can debate whether maybe it might be better to question that potential at the public offering stage, but then people will point to Google and Facebook as success stories. How could you not invest in Snap?Once again we have a case in which Silicon Valley\u2019s overreliance on momentum creates an unrealistic proxy for valuation. Snap will reap billions as a result, while Twitter will struggle to salvage what it can from what was once a valuation of more than $40 billion. It is a story that will have real consequences.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

{"Headline": "Google Pixel Review: Assessing the New Smartphone", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe absence of a major competing Android device works out especially well for Google because the Pixel is, relatively speaking, mediocre. It is slower than Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung\u2019s smaller flagship phone. Photos shot with Pixel\u2019s camera don\u2019t look as good as the iPhone\u2019s. And Google\u2019s built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb.Google said that it had optimized Pixel to be speedy, with real-world applications that consumers could perceive, like making the touch screen feel very responsive. It also said that it would improve its virtual assistant over time and that photos taken with the Pixel look more natural.Here\u2019s what stood out in my tests of Pixel:Google\u2019s Still-Annoying AssistantAnd so it was with Google\u2019s supposedly new-and-improved virtual assistant, called Assistant, on the Pixel. The search giant says the difference with Assistant is that it is capable of \u201ctwo-way conversations.\u201d In plain English, what Google means is you can make requests to Assistant and ask follow-up questions, and Assistant might understand the context to respond appropriately.Google offers this example: You can ask, \u201cWhere is the Taj Mahal?\u201d and then ask, \u201cHow old is it?\u201dWhile that sounds compelling in theory, Assistant failed at responding fully to many requests made with natural language. When I asked, \u201cWhat time is \u2018Westworld\u2019 on TV?\u201d Assistant displayed a web search result containing the synopsis for the new sci-fi show. When I followed up with, \u201cSo what time is it on?\u201d Assistant told me the current time, which was 9:35 p.m.From there on, Assistant continued to hit foul balls. When I said, \u201cbook me a table nearby,\u201d Assistant would try to book a table only at a restaurant called Rich Table, and didn\u2019t list other options.On the plus side, Assistant can handle a conversation about the weather. When I asked for the weather and it said it was raining, I asked whether it would stop raining this week. \u201cRain is not expected this week in San Francisco,\u201d it said. Better.In its current state, attempting to accomplish complex tasks with Assistant on Pixel will waste more time than it saves.A Mediocre Camera Like pretty much every handset maker, Google proclaims Pixel\u2019s camera to be the best on the market. Its rear camera has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, similar to the iPhone 7\u2019s 12-megapixel sensor. So I took photos with the Pixel and compared them with shots taken with the iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7.All the cameras took clear, visually appealing photographs with rich details, but there were major differences in color, even without any filters applied. The photos taken with the Pixel looked colder \u2014 they appeared to exaggerate cyans and magentas. The ones taken with the iPhone looked more vivid, though they appeared to slightly bump up yellows to make photos look warmer. The color in pictures taken with the Samsung phone looked oversaturated and unnatural.I decided to let a blind jury weigh in. My partner, a professional photographer, took photos with each camera of a plant in a colorful vase in natural lighting. She labeled each photograph A, B and C, and I sent the photos out to 30 people and, without revealing which phone each letter corresponded with, asked them to vote for their favorite. (Before reading the results below, take a look and make your own vote.)Photo A was taken with the Samsung phone, photo B with Google\u2019s Pixel, and photo C with an iPhone 7. Out of 30 votes, 19 voted for the iPhone, eight voted for the Pixel, and three voted for the Samsung phone. People seemed to gravitate toward the warmer color profiles produced by the iPhone.Comparisons With the CompetitionBased on features alone, the Pixel is decent compared with Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7. Here are some highlights:\u25a0 What sets Pixel apart is its compatibility with Project Fi, Google\u2019s experimental wireless service. You pay at least $30 a month for a package that includes unlimited minutes and messages and 1 gigabyte of cellular data. You can pay $10 more for each extra gigabyte of data or get reimbursed for the cellular data you don\u2019t use.\u25a0 The Pixel\u2019s fingerprint sensor, for unlocking the phone, is annoyingly on the back of the device rather than on the face. So when you\u2019re on the go, you will probably be using two hands \u2014 one to hold the phone and the other to place your fingerprint on the back \u2014 to unlock the Pixel.\u25a0 In speed tests run with the mobile app Geekbench, the Pixel was about 20 percent slower than both the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7.\u25a0 The Pixel wasn\u2019t designed to be water-resistant though Google says it is resistant to water sprays. The Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 survived a dive into a pitcher of water.\u25a0 It\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel still has a headphone jack, which Apple eliminated from its iPhones this year (though it turns out the iPhone\u2019s omission of the jack was not a big deal).The Bottom LineLargely because Samsung, the king of Android phones, is in the penalty box, now is a good time to consider trying something new, be it a different phone service or a different operating system altogether.Using Pixel with Project Fi may also end up saving you money: If you picked, for example, a plan with two gigabytes of data, you\u2019d pay $40 a month for cellphone and data service that works all over the world. In contrast, Verizon charges $55 a month for a similar plan that doesn\u2019t include free international roaming.If you are uninterested in Project Fi and are not deeply invested in Google\u2019s ecosystem, there is another route: Try an iPhone. Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus outperformed the Pixel in every way in terms of hardware features.And so far, to my knowledge, Apple phones haven\u2019t blown up.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article rendered incorrectly the name of a Google product shown.

{"Headline": "In Rare New Jersey Swing District, House Race Becomes a Brawl", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byRIDGEWOOD, N.J. \u2014 With a barrage of negative ads and copious outside spending, the congressional race in a crescent of Norman Rockwell-style suburbs and tidy rural villages in northern New Jersey represents one of the region\u2019s most bare-knuckle political fights.The Fifth Congressional District, extending across North Jersey from the Delaware River to the Hudson River, is the state\u2019s one potential swing district, with roughly the same number of voters registered in each party, making it a tempting target for Democrats hoping to cut into or even overcome the Republican majority in the House of Representatives in a topsy-turvy political year.In the past, Mr. Garrett, who wields considerable influence as a member of the Financial Services Committee and the chairman of its Subcommittee on Capital Markets, has handily dispatched Democratic challengers, repelling their attacks on his conservative positions and mores.But he has never faced a rival as well financed as Mr. Gottheimer, who has been helped by his deep connections within the Clinton circle and his experience in the corporate and technology worlds.Through the end of September, Mr. Gottheimer had received contributions of almost $4 million, roughly double the nearly $1.9 million in contributions to Mr. Garrett\u2019s campaign.And perhaps more than in other years, Mr. Garrett has provided plenty of ammunition to his opponent.Last year, Politico reported that Mr. Garrett had irked fellow Republicans when he refused to pass on donations to the National Republican Congressional Committee because of its support for gay candidates.Mr. Garrett, a conservative Christian, is also a longtime opponent of same-sex marriage, and takes a strict stand against abortion.Mr. Gottheimer has hammered him over those positions and a series of seemingly ideologically motivated votes in Congress, many of them reflecting a strong fiscal conservatism.He points to, among others, Mr. Garrett\u2019s vote against an enormous spending bill that contained funding to assist emergency medical workers who fell ill after the Sept. 11 attack at the World Trade Center.The charges have resonated and forced Mr. Garrett onto the defensive.In a telephone interview, Mr. Garrett said that he supported assistance to the emergency medical workers but objected to other elements of the huge spending bill it was included in, leaving him the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote against it.And he called the reports that he had opposed gay candidates \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u201cI support anyone\u2019s right to run for public office,\u201d he said. \u201cI support my fellow Republican candidates.\u201dHe faulted Mr. Gottheimer for raising the issue, saying it distracted from other topics important to voters, including job creation, the economy and security issues.\u201cThis is something that came up over a year ago and my opponent has used it just to lie,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cThis lie and other lies and they just continue to be spread, whether he advertises on TV or billboards or hires an airplane to spread his lies. It\u2019s really outrageous.\u201dMr. Gottheimer said that his opponent\u2019s votes and positions are fair game.\u201cThe Tea Party extremism does not reflect the values of our district,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said. \u201cIf you want to get things done we\u2019ve got to get rid of the obstructionists.\u201dMr. Gottheimer has benefited from hefty spending by super PACs, fueled partly by reaction to Mr. Garrett\u2019s conservative positions. They include the Democratic Party-aligned House Majority PAC and the National Association of Realtors Political Action Committee. Mr. Garrett has pushed to end the federal government\u2019s role in supporting the mortgage market through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants, a stand opposed by the Realtors group.Voters have been bombarded by ads, mailings and campaign phone calls.\u201cAt least 50 percent of the time my phone rings it\u2019s something related to the election. Gottheimer. Garrett. And I get Trump calls all the time,\u201d said Karen Abraham, who was watching her two children play in a school playground in this suburb. Most of the television ads were negative, Ms. Abraham said, adding, \u201cIt makes you glaze over after a while.\u201dThe harshest salvo has come from Mr. Garrett, in a television ad that resurrects a 2007 lawsuit, filed by a woman in Washington, who claimed she was mistreated in the condominium building where she lived, and where Mr. Gottheimer was on the board.The ad accuses Mr. Gottheimer of assaulting the woman, harassing her and forcing her to move.Court papers and interviews with two of the lawyers involved in the case tell a different story. The lawsuit, which was eventually withdrawn without a settlement, describes an episode in the building\u2019s lobby in which Mr. Gottheimer allegedly raised his voice and wagged his finger in the woman\u2019s face, an encounter described as an \u201cassault.\u201d\u201cThere was nothing to any of these allegations,\u201d said Richard F. Silber, a lawyer who represented another person named in the lawsuit. \u201cThe allegations were that he wagged his finger at her. Who brings a lawsuit about that?\u201dThe district is the only one in the state with relative parity between the two political parties. It has roughly the same number of registered Democrats and Republicans among voters, about 140,000 in each party, according to the New Jersey Division of Elections. About 216,000 registered voters in the district do not have a party affiliation. Here, as elsewhere, the outcome of the undercard may depend in part on how voters react to the bitter presidential contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.While some Republican leaders have rejected Mr. Trump, Mr. Garrett has not wavered; he has said he will vote for him, including after hearing Mr. Trump\u2019s recorded statements about groping women\u2019s genitals.\u201cAs a father, as a husband, I said at the time that I\u2019m outraged by the statements and disagree with him vehemently,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cAt this point in time, though, we have to look at the issues and we cannot have a continuation of failed foreign policy and failed economic policy and that\u2019s what Hillary Clinton will bring about.\u201dMr. Gottheimer has received some surprising endorsements.Meg Whitman, a Hewlett-Packard executive and Republican fund-raiser who has been outspoken in her opposition to Mr. Trump, endorsed Mr. Gottheimer. Ms. Whitman backed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey for president before he dropped out of the Republican nomination contest and endorsed Mr. Trump.Mr. Gottheimer has also received the endorsement of the New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association, a response to Mr. Garrett\u2019s vote against the budget that included aid for World Trade Center emergency medical workers.Mayor Harry Shortway of Vernon Township, a Republican, said that he had previously voted for Mr. Garrett, but that after meeting with both candidates he had decided to endorse Mr. Gottheimer, who seemed to him more responsive to the township\u2019s needs. It was turned down when it sought a federal grant to pay for a new fire truck, he said, and Mr. Gottheimer had pledged to help get the financing.\u201cI don\u2019t see the federal tax dollars coming back into the area,\u201d Mr. Shortway said.Advertisement"}

Red Flags", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byAt the same time, Twitter is moving forward as if it will remain an independent company, people involved in the negotiations said.This strategy reflects the challenges Twitter faces.It is trying to clarify the company\u2019s mission and focus, all while handling deal talks, the potential threat of an activist shareholder lawsuit and a declining stock price.Perhaps unsurprisingly, interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees reveal frustration among the rank-and-file. A handful of employees have even stopped showing up for work entirely, several people said.Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, has sent two companywide memos to shore up employees\u2019 spirits, one in mid-September and one last week, but he did not shed light on the rumors about a sale of the company, leading to more grumbling by employees.As it focuses on becoming profitable, Twitter is also looking to sell Vine, the six-second video sharing app, and Fabric, a mobile developer platform.Twitter had talked to Microsoft about acquiring Fabric, according to four people involved in the matter, but those talks stalled when Salesforce, one of Microsoft\u2019s competitors, was rumored to be interested in Twitter.And in a move that is unlikely to help morale at Twitter, the company is also considering additional layoffs, after announcing a cut of more than 300 jobs last year.\u201cMy 2015 return shows adjusted gross income of $11,563,931,\u201d he revealed. \u201cMy deductions totaled $5,477,694.\u201dAbout two-thirds of those represented charitable contributions, he said.

{"Headline": "Next Big Tech Corridor? Between Seattle and Vancouver, Planners Hope", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Seattle and Vancouver are like fraternal twins separated at birth. Both are bustling Pacific Northwest coastal cities with eco-conscious populations that have accepted the bargain of dispiriting weather for much of the year in exchange for nearby ski slopes and kayaking and glorious summers.Yet 140 miles of traffic-choked roads and an international border divide the two cities, keeping them farther apart than their geographic and cultural identities would suggest.Now the political, academic and tech elite of both cities are looking for ways to bring them closer together, with the aim of continuing the growth of two of the most vibrant economies in North America.\u201cVancouver has a lot more in common with Seattle than we do with Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, anywhere else in our country,\u201d Christy Clark, the premier of British Columbia, said in an interview. \u201cWe should make the most of those cultural commonalities.\u201dWhether their grand vision of a \u201cCascadia innovation corridor\u201d \u2014 which borrows its name from the region\u2019s Cascade mountain range \u2014 ever materializes, leaders on both sides of the border have motives for getting cozier immediately. American tech icons like Microsoft, with voracious needs for global engineering talent, are expanding their Vancouver offices, partly because of Canada\u2019s smoother immigration process.For its part, Vancouver wants to bring more American technology companies to the city in hopes of spinning out future entrepreneurs who will expand its comparatively small base of technology companies.\u201cWe have San Francisco real estate prices with the incomes of somewhere between Reno and Nashville,\u201d said Andy Yan, acting director of the city program at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.On the thrumming streets of downtown Vancouver, signs of the Seattle region\u2019s growing economic ties to the city are hard to miss. A rectangular glass and steel office building with a large Microsoft sign occupies nearly an entire city block, sitting atop a large Nordstrom store (another Seattle brand).Microsoft says it invested $120 million in its new offices in Vancouver, which opened in June, and expects to spend $90 million more annually on wages and other operating costs. It plans to employ nearly 750 people in the city.Microsoft is hiring Canadians for the facility, but the country\u2019s more open immigration policies were an important factor in its investment, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in an interview. Microsoft and other tech companies have long complained that the United States education system does not produce enough computer science graduates, forcing them to rely on immigrants from India, China and elsewhere.Foreign workers in the United States can wait about three times as long for a work visa as those in Canada do, the Boston Consulting Group estimates. And the prospect of Donald J. Trump winning the presidency has raised concerns among tech companies, because of the Republican candidate\u2019s comments about further restricting immigration to the United States.\u201cRight now, there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty about open immigration,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Last month, officials and executives from both cities huddled in a Vancouver hotel to discuss how to enable people, ideas and capital to flow more freely between them, as heedless of the international border separating the cities as a pod of orcas swimming in the sea.At the Cascadia conference, Ms. Clark and Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, signed an agreement to deepen the ties between Vancouver and Seattle, including more research collaboration between the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and Satya Nadella, its current chief executive, talked about globalization and education.One proposal to deal with traffic between Vancouver and Seattle was for a high-speed rail line that would whisk travelers at more than 200 miles an hour between the cities in 57 minutes (it can take four hours or more by car). The details on financing the project \u2014 which could cost an estimated $30 billion or more \u2014 have not been worked out.With roots in timber and shipping, Vancouver\u2019s economy has diversified in recent decades with the growth of film and video game production. The city claims a tech \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 a start-up valued at over $1 billion \u2014 in Hootsuite, which makes social media tools.But Vancouver remains a relative small fry in tech, with about $1.78 billion in venture capital flowing into local tech start-ups in the last decade, compared with about $8.9 billion in Seattle, the research firm Pitchbook estimates.The housing market is showing signs of cooling off, though it is not yet clear how much of that is because of the tax. The total number of homes sold in the area in August dropped 26 percent from a year earlier and price growth has slowed, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.Dennis Pilarinos, chief executive of Buddybuild, a Vancouver maker of developer tools for mobile apps, says affordability has been less of a problem for young tech workers, who may be willing to rent smaller apartments and live with roommates. But when start-ups get bigger, many struggle to recruit senior executives with families, said Mr. Pilarinos, who previously worked for Microsoft and Amazon in Vancouver.\u201cCompanies tend to run into scaling issues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou end up with fewer Microsofts or Amazons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The voice on the other end of the phone call just sounds deceptively like her.It is actually a computer-synthesized voice, a tour-de-force of artificial intelligence technology that has been crafted to make it possible for someone to masquerade via the telephone.Such a situation is still science fiction \u2014 but just barely. It is also the future of crime.The irony, of course, is that this year the computer security industry, with $75 billion in annual revenue, has started to talk about how machine learning and pattern recognition techniques will improve the woeful state of computer security.But there is a downside.\u201cThe thing people don\u2019t get is that cybercrime is becoming automated and it is scaling exponentially,\u201d said Marc Goodman, a law enforcement agency adviser and the author of \u201cFuture Crimes.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is not about Matthew Broderick hacking from his basement,\u201d a reference to the 1983 movie \u201cWar Games.\u201dThe alarm about malevolent use of advanced artificial intelligence technologies was sounded earlier this year by James R. Clapper, the director of National Intelligence. In his annual review of security, Mr. Clapper underscored the point that while A.I. systems would make some things easier, they would also expand the vulnerabilities of the online world.The growing sophistication of computer criminals can be seen in the evolution of attack tools like the widely used malicious program known as Blackshades, according to Mr. Goodman. The author of the program, a Swedish national, was convicted last year in the United States.The system, which was sold widely in the computer underground, functioned as a \u201ccriminal franchise in a box,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. It allowed users without technical skills to deploy computer ransomware or perform video or audio eavesdropping with a mouse click.The next generation of these tools will add machine learning capabilities that have been pioneered by artificial intelligence researchers to improve the quality of machine vision, speech understanding, speech synthesis and natural language understanding. Some computer security researchers believe that digital criminals have been experimenting with the use of A.I. technologies for more than half a decade.That can be seen in efforts to subvert the internet\u2019s omnipresent Captcha \u2014 Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart \u2014 the challenge-and-response puzzle invented in 2003 by Carnegie Mellon University researchers to block automated programs from stealing online accounts.Both \u201cwhite hat\u201d artificial intelligence researchers and \u201cblack hat\u201d criminals have been deploying machine vision software to subvert Captchas for more than half a decade, said Stefan Savage, a computer security researcher at the University of California, San Diego.\u201cIf you don\u2019t change your Captcha for two years, you will be owned by some machine vision algorithm,\u201d he said.Surprisingly, one thing that has slowed the development of malicious A.I. has been the ready availability of either low-cost or free human labor. For example, some cybercriminals have farmed out Captcha-breaking schemes to electronic sweatshops where humans are used to decode the puzzles for a tiny fee.Even more inventive computer crooks have used online pornography as a reward for human web surfers who break the Captcha, Mr. Goodman said. Free labor is a commodity that A.I. software won\u2019t be able to compete with any time soon.So what\u2019s next?Criminals, for starters, can piggyback on new tech developments. Voice-recognition technology like Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are now used extensively to interact with computers. And Amazon\u2019s Echo voice-controlled speaker and Facebook\u2019s Messenger chatbot platform are rapidly becoming conduits for online commerce and customer support. As is often the case, whenever a communication advancement like voice recognition starts to go mainstream, criminals looking to take advantage of it aren\u2019t far behind.Social engineering, which refers to the practice of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging information, is widely seen as the weakest link in the computer security chain. Cybercriminals already exploit the best qualities in humans \u2014 trust and willingness to help others \u2014 to steal and spy. The ability to create artificial intelligence avatars that can fool people online will only make the problem worse.This can already be seen in efforts by state governments and political campaigns who are using chatbot technology widely for political propaganda.Researchers have coined the term \u201ccomputational propaganda\u201d to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like Facebook and Twitter.It is only a matter of time before such software is put to criminal use.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cleverness in designing social engineering attacks, but as far as I know, nobody has yet started using machine learning to find the highest quality suckers,\u201d said Mark Seiden, an independent computer security specialist. He paused and added, \u201cI should have replied: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Dave, I can\u2019t answer that question right now.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banks Bet on the Next Big Thing: Financial Chatbots", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byYour bank really wants to chat.This week Bank of America, MasterCard and several financial start-ups announced new tools \u2014 known as chatbots \u2014 that will allow customers to ask questions about their financial accounts, initiate transactions and get financial advice via text messages or services like Facebook Messenger and Amazon\u2019s Echo tower.The early versions of the financial chatbots generally do little more than answer basic queries about recent transactions and spending limits.But companies are aiming to build the chatbots into full-service automated financial assistants that can make payments and keep track of your budget for you.\u201cWhat will banking be in two, three or four years? It\u2019s going to be this,\u201d Michelle Moore, the head of digital banking at Bank of America, said in describing the bank\u2019s new offering, which it has named Erica.These bots are generally powered by artificial intelligence software that lets them pull in data and turn it into comprehensible answers, in the way that Apple\u2019s Siri attempts to do.Many companies are betting that automated bots \u2014 both in text messaging and voice-activated form \u2014 could become the dominant interface of the future, surpassing phone apps and websites as the way to reach consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the tech industry thinks this is the next big thing,\u201d said Tom Poole, the managing vice president of digital at Capital One.Mr. Poole\u2019s firm rolled out its first voice-activated bot on Amazon\u2019s Echo personal assistant system earlier this year, and it is planning advanced capabilities in the coming months: \u201cIt\u2019s just scratching the surface right now.\u201dA few start-ups have already found success \u2014 and attracted attention from the banks \u2014 by creating chatbots that do particular financial tasks.Digit, a San Francisco-based start-up, offers an iOS and Android mobile app that can monitor a customer\u2019s spending habits and pull small amounts of money from a bank checking account into a Digit savings account several times a month \u2014 with all interactions channeled through text messages. The company has raised $36 million from venture capitalists and saved $230 million for its customers since starting in 2015.Saving is one of the features being built into Bank of America\u2019s offering, Erica. The early version that the bank debuted this week can also track your credit score, look at your spending habits and offer advice on how to pay off bills, along with moving money.A day after Erica was unveiled at the financial technology conference Money 2020, MasterCard revealed its Kai offering, which it will make available to the banks that issue its cards. Neither Erica nor Kai is available to customers yet, and the companies did not provide firm release dates.Among the Silicon Valley start-ups working in the same realm, there is a common argument that the new digital financial assistants should come from outside the financial firms, so that they can link to any account a customer may have and bestow unbiased advice.Bank of America, for instance, would have little incentive to suggest that its customers sign up for a credit card with another bank, even if it is offering a lower rate.Several venture capital firms have provided backing to a start-up, Clarity Money, which was released last week and offers a range of services similar to Erica\u2019s.\u201cConsumers should have an unbiased advocate helping them navigate their financial lives,\u201d said Adam Dell, the founder of Clarity and the brother of Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell.Critics of chatbots have said that even with artificial intelligence, bots will continue to lack the intuitive and empathetic understanding that humans need when dealing with difficult problems, such as financial decisions.\u201cWe all know the technology is not there yet,\u201d said Josh Reich, the co-founder of Simple, an online bank that has not released any bot features. \u201cIt\u2019s just people picking up on a hype cycle.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Halts Galaxy Note 7 Production as Battery Problems Linger", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byIn 1995, furious over quality problems with one of his company\u2019s mobile phones, Lee Kun-hee, the chairman of Samsung and arguably the most famous businessman in South Korea, set a pile of 150,000 defective phones on fire outside a factory.The phone bonfire became a turning point for Samsung\u2019s two-decade rise from an electronics maker associated with inexpensive knockoffs to one considered a leader in product quality, design and sales. But to the company\u2019s critics, that employee motivational moment has also served as a wry historical foreshadowing of safety problems with one of Samsung\u2019s top-selling smartphones.The company has temporarily halted production of its Galaxy Note 7, a high-end answer to the latest iPhones from Apple, a person familiar with the decision said on Monday. In a statement, the company also asked retailers and telecommunication carriers to stop selling the phones until the problem is fixed, and said \u201cconsumers with either an original Galaxy Note 7 or replacement Galaxy Note 7 device should power down and stop using the device.\u201dThree of Australia\u2019s biggest telecom companies \u2014 Telstra, Optus and Vodafone Australia \u2014 said they had stopped shipping Galaxy Note 7 phones to customers after reports that the replacement model had caught fire in the United States.The company said it hoped to provide an update within a month. The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission praised Samsung\u2019s move and urged consumers to stop using the phone.The missteps by Samsung, the world\u2019s top seller of smartphones, have given a rare opportunity to competitors like Apple to close the gap with the South Korean giant as the holiday shopping season approaches.\u201cWe believe this incident has destroyed billions of dollars of Samsung brand value,\u201d said Laura Martin, a technology analyst with Needham & Company. \u201cThe consumer says, \u2018Which one blows up? I\u2019m just going to stay away from Samsung.\u2019\u201dThe Galaxy Note 7 featured a higher-capacity battery to help its increasingly sophisticated features, like an iris scanner for added security. It also supported fast wireless charging technologies. It was the most expensive phone offered by Samsung, putting it in direct competition with Apple\u2019s iPhone.\u201cDefinitely, Apple is the biggest beneficiary\u201d of Samsung\u2019s problems, said Linda Sui, a director at research firm Strategy Analytics.What\u2019s more, Google, the company whose Android software runs on nearly all of Samsung\u2019s smartphones, is now pushing harder to sell its own phones. Last week, Google unveiled the Pixel \u2014 the first smartphone that it designed and manufactured. At the same time, aggressive smartphone manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi are looking for ways to expand beyond their footholds in China to compete with Samsung all over the world.It is difficult to say what the impact of the phone problems will be on the company\u2019s overall sales. Before the recall, the research firm Strategy Analytics had estimated that Samsung would sell 15 million Note 7 units in 2016. But now, the firm is estimating that Samsung, with about $180 billion in annual revenue, could lose more than $10 billion from the ongoing troubles.Samsung\u2019s reputation is already taking a big hit online, according to an analysis by Spredfast, a social media marketing firm that helps businesses analyze chatter on Twitter and other social networks.Since the Note 7\u2019s problems began to receive widespread attention, negative Twitter messages about the device rose 450 percent compared to the previous five and a half weeks, the company said.\u201cWhile this is itself a huge problem for Samsung, we also found a steep 186 percent rise in negative sentiment about Samsung itself,\u201d Chris Kerns, Spredfast\u2019s vice president of research and insights said in a statement. \u201cDigging deeper, it\u2019s clear that this is not just an isolated issue with one product, but is, in fact, a full-blown brand crisis.\u201dLike many Asian companies, Samsung struggled for years to establish a strong reputation in the West. Shortly after Apple introduced the iPhone, Samsung went headlong into the smartphone market.Samsung had been gaining some ground in high-end smartphones with its latest Galaxy S phones, which have curved edges and offer a premium feel over the company\u2019s budget phones. When it released the Galaxy Note 7 in August \u2014 with its 5.7-inch screen and a price tag exceeding $800 \u2014 it was supposed to add to that momentum.The recurring problem has led industry experts to wonder whether the problem went beyond sloppy production and resulted from a faulty battery or software design.Technology companies are hardly immune to manufacturing issues. In 1994, Intel was forced to recall its flagship Pentium chip because of a mathematical mistake built into it. Dell recalled more than 4 million laptop computers in 2006 because of exploding lithium ion batteries produced by Sony. And companies like Fitibit and Microsoft have had manufacturing problems over the years.Companies with strong brands can withstand product quality problems. Over a two-year span starting in 2009, Toyota recalled about 9 million cars because of issues related to sudden, unintended acceleration. Its chief executive appeared before Congress, and Toyota paid a $1.2 billion fine to the Justice Department for concealing information about defects from consumers and government officials. In 2015, Toyota was the world\u2019s largest automaker.Samsung is counting on customers like Justin Brooke of Cooper City, Fla., whose family owns three Note 7 phones as well as Samsung televisions and tablets, to stay loyal to the brand.Mr. Brooke said he thinks the fire risk has been overblown. He loves the Note 7\u2019s big screen and pen feature, which he uses to critique websites for his advertising training business, DMBI Online. \u201cFor me as a business owner, it\u2019s the most productive phone on the market,\u201d he said.Still, he admitted to some apprehension. He said his family never charges the batteries on their phones to 100 percent to reduce the risk of overheating. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re in denial,\u201d he said.He said his father asked him for a phone recommendation on Sunday night, and he recommended another Samsung model, the S7, which has not been implicated in the fires, or a Google Pixel phone.Daisuke Wakabayashi and Vindu Goel reported from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s New MacBook Pro Gets More Touchy", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byCUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 Apple\u2019s high-end laptop, the MacBook Pro, which hasn\u2019t had a major overhaul in four years, is getting a little more like the iPhone.Apple on Thursday showed off new MacBook Pros that feature the Touch Bar, a touch-screen strip at the top of the keyboard that changes to display functions specific to the app being used.The company also added its Touch ID function to the power button of the computers, allowing users to unlock the device or buy something with Apple Pay with the touch of a finger.Both features are adapted from the iPhone, continuing Apple\u2019s pattern of adding the features that make its smartphones so popular to its laptops. Last month, Apple released a software update that put its Siri voice assistant on the Mac.\u201cMobile has focused us on simplicity,\u201d said Julie Ask, a technology analyst at the Forrester research firm.The company is hoping that its new iPhones and other products, like the updated MacBooks, will return it to growth during the holidays.The new MacBooks, which are thinner, lighter and faster than previous models, are primarily aimed at business customers and others who spend a lot of time on their computers, said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting stuff done,\u201d he said.The cheapest model with the new Touch Bar, a 13-inch machine, is $1,800, and the 15-inch version starts at $2,400. Apple\u2019s least expensive laptop, the ultralight Air, is unchanged and costs $1,000, while competitors\u2019 machines running Microsoft\u2019s Windows typically cost $500 or less. The models with the Touch Bar can be ordered now and will ship within the next few weeks.The Touch Bar replaces the function keys at the top of the current laptop keyboards and pops up customized functions depending on the app. In Apple\u2019s Photos app, for example, it allows users to perform simple editing and play videos. In the Mail app, the Touch Bar shows reply options, automatically suggests words and phrases and shows a menu of the user\u2019s commonly used emoji.\u201cI do think it\u2019s worth a moment for a requiem for the function key,\u201d Philip W. Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for worldwide marketing, said after unveiling the Touch Bar.The new laptops immediately drew some complaints from current Apple laptop users because they use a newer type of port, USB-C, that requires adapters to work with older accessories.Apple also previewed a new app for its Apple TV set-top box as well as iPhones and iPads. Called simply TV, the app, which will be released in December, will allow users to see in one place their favorite shows from the other video apps on their device. The app will also feature suggestions of new video content to watch, curated by Apple editors.\u201cWe want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said at the event.The service is not quite there, since Apple has not yet signed on key streaming services such as Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, and live television shows are still difficult to get access to on Apple TV.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Three Strong-Performing Funds Pick Stocks", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byMany stock-picking styles have sizzled lately, with growth and value and domestic and international investing all toting up gains. Three of the better-performing mutual funds of recent months found their winners among small- and large-cap growth stocks and Chinese shares.\u201cOur typical company might have only six analysts following it, compared to maybe 50 for Apple,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. The Hood River managers say there is a \u201cresearch gap\u201d that they can fill, thanks to their 20 years of work with small caps.The three met in the 1990s while working at what was then Columbia Management in Portland, Ore. In the early 2000s, Mr. Smoluch and Mr. Marvin created a predecessor to their fund at Roxbury Capital Management. A few years later, they recruited Mr. Swank, and, in 2013, the three started Hood River Capital Management, also in Portland.As stock pickers, they\u2019re generalists, surveying all parts of the market. They will scoop up several companies in a field if they see growing companies benefiting from a broader trend. They have done that in fiber optics, with holdings like Oclaro, Fabrinet and Finisar, all recent double-digit gainers.\u201cFor a while, there was a huge overcapacity of components for fiber networks,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve had a major industry consolidation combined with accelerating demand,\u201d as networks upgrade to meet the bandwidth needs of smartphones, cloud computing and video streaming.In researching a promising company, they talk with its competitors, customers and suppliers. They estimate they make about 1,000 calls a year. Talks with pharmaceutical and biotech executives led them to a holding in PRA Health Sciences.\u201cIt\u2019s a contract research organization that manages clinical trials,\u201d Mr. Swank said. \u201cBased on our conversations, we believe it\u2019s gaining market share, and the entire industry is being helped along by the high level of biotech financing that happened in 2015.\u201dThe institutional shares of the Hood River fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 15.01 percent in the third quarter, compared with 3.85 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Baker builds his portfolio around themes that he sees shaping technology and the economy, like the emergence of artificial intelligence, and seeks stocks with strategies that will play out over three to seven years. Market attention tends to be short-term, creating opportunities for people who can be more patient, he said.He has long held Amazon shares, for example, even as other investors have said they are overvalued, based on the price-earnings ratio.\u201cAmazon has gone, over the last 15 years, from $5 to $840,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019d think people would wear down and realize that looking at it on current-period earnings isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.\u201d\u201cMore than a million people die every year driving,\u201d he said. \u201cSelf-driving cars will never drive drunk or high or distracted. They won\u2019t be texting and driving.\u201dArtificial intelligence favors the biggest tech companies, he said, because it demands lots of data and cheap, powerful computing, both of which they have in abundance.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009, and over the last five years, it has been one of the top performers among large-cap growth funds, returning an annualized average of 18.53 percent. In the third quarter, it returned 11.89 percent. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.91 percent.The fund holds only 36 stocks, a deliberately focused selection, he said. \u201cYou have to choose between the last two to get down to the one you really like,\u201d he said.For several years, worrisome economic news has streamed from China \u2014 reports of a slowing economy, overheated real estate markets and banks fat with problem loans. Mr. Mattock said such macro scares have buffeted China portfolios, on and off, for the roughly 15 years he has been investing in the country.But the \u201cobsession with macro,\u201d he said, has overshadowed a continued maturation of Chinese companies that offers opportunities for committed investors. \u201cWe have a lot of the big industry leaders in the portfolio, and these macro stories meant I could pick them up at a very good price,\u201d he said.In insurance, for example, the fund owns Ping An and China Life, two of the country\u2019s biggest insurers. In e-commerce, it holds Alibaba and Vipshop Holdings. Alibaba and Vipshop are leading e-commerce companies.The Matthews fund, with an expense ratio of 1.14 percent, returned 14.95 percent in the third quarter.An article in the special Mutual Fund Quarterly section last Sunday about the strongest-performing mutual funds misstated the expense ratio for the institutional shares of the Hood River Small-Cap Growth Fund. It was 1.09 percent, a net figure that accounts for fee waivers and expense reimbursements by the fund company, not 1.49 percent, which is the gross expense ratio.Advertisement"}

Properly inflated footballs? Nope. He was talking, of course, about the scourge of the N.F.L.: tablet computers. The Microsoft Surface tablets that the league uses on the sideline to provide images of plays are an I.T. nightmare, Belichick said.\u201cI\u2019m going to stick with pictures, which several of our other coaches do as well, because there just isn\u2019t enough consistency in the performance of the tablets,\u201d he said at a news conference that sounded more like a CNET review.\u201cAs you have probably noticed, I\u2019m done with the tablets,\u201d he said.After taking some shots at other sideline technology, he concluded by saying: \u201cI\u2019ll use the paper pictures from here on because I just have given it my best shot. I\u2019ve tried to work through the process. But it just doesn\u2019t work for me, and that\u2019s because there\u2019s no consistency to it. Long answer to a short question, sorry.\u201dIn 2014, Belichick noted that the system had crashed, but seemed mostly cool with it. \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s all kind of part of the game,\u201d he said.Belichick was also unhappy with the other communications systems at the game, like the ones between the press box and the sideline and between the coach and the quarterback. \u201cThose fail on a regular basis,\u201d he said.He noted that the league does not supply the equipment to the teams until a few hours before the game, making troubleshooting difficult.\u201cSo I would just say there are problems in every game,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were problems last week, but there were problems the week before that, too.

{"Headline": "David Bunnell, Whose Magazines Were Tech World Must-Reads, Dies at 69", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byDavid Bunnell, a journalist and publisher who helped create PC Magazine, Macworld and other consumer publications that chronicled and contributed to the explosive growth of the personal computer industry, died on Tuesday at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 69.The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Jacqueline Poitier, said.The power and influence of the PC industry press has largely been forgotten in the internet era, but at the time, in the 1970s and \u201980s, the magazines Mr. Bunnell published were as authoritative and read as eagerly as Vogue or Women\u2019s Wear Daily were in the fashion world.Mr. Bunnell was riding a rocket ship. The first issue of PC Magazine was 100 pages, substantial enough by any measure. But the second issue weighed in like a phone book, at 400 pages.\u201cGetting ads was so easy,\u201d Mr. Bunnell told Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine in the book \u201cFire in the Valley: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer.\u201d \u201cAll you had to do was answer the phone.\u201dMr. Bunnell charted the growth of the personal computer from its hobbyist roots to its becoming the engine of what the venture capitalist John Doerr later described as the \u201clargest legal accumulation of wealth in history.\u201dThe business was shaped by self-taught computer hackers and young men like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, who early on saw that personal computers would become ubiquitous. They were passionate about PCs and intensely competitive.At a conference in 1976, Mr. Bunnell, a brash young technical writer at Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, or MITS, the maker of the first popular PC, stormed into the lobby of a hotel and tore down a sign posted by a rival manufacturer.It was a portent. Dozens of larger-than-life rivalries would develop as the personal computer industry went on to transcend its hobbyist roots and transform the world, with giants like IBM, Compaq and Apple sweeping away small companies like MITS.Mr. Bunnell arrived at MITS in 1973 without a technical background. But his ability to write clearly and accessibly about the industry and its wares earned him a job, and he began chronicling what would become known as the \u201cPC revolution\u201d \u2014 one of the first to do so for a mass readership.Mr. Bunnell had been at MITS several years when two other ambitious young men, Paul Allen and Mr. Gates, arrived there with a version of the Basic programming language. Mr. Allen and Mr. Gates would soon leave MITS to found Microsoft.Mr. Bunnell started a company newsletter, Computer Notes, focusing on the pioneering Altair personal computer. It was in that newsletter, in February 1976, that Mr. Gates first complained publicly about software piracy, firing the opening shots in a war that would divide the industry and its users for decades.Mr. Bunnell played a founding role in a string of magazines. He started Personal Computing and was a co-founder of PC Magazine, PC World and Macworld, and in doing so became a kingmaker in his own right. His magazines would shape the perceptions of millions about a continuing tide of ever more sophisticated machines that were spreading to homes and businesses around the world.\u201cAt a time when a lot of people still doubted the potential of personal computers, David Bunnell gave voice to the PC revolution,\u201d Mr. Allen said in an email.Yet Mr. Bunnell\u2019s role in shaping the industry was relatively unsung, said John C. Dvorak, a computer columnist who worked for Mr. Bunnell at PC World.\u201cI believe that David never got the credit he deserved for inventing the computer magazine industry, the first personal computer trade show and much of the landscape of the industry,\u201d he said.The computer trade publishing business proved to be a brutal one. Mr. Bunnell left Personal Computing when the publisher refused to give him an ownership share. Later, when PC Magazine was sold to Ziff-Davis without his knowledge, he departed with most of the staff to form PC World for a rival publisher, the International Data Group.A number of his ventures were not successful. Upside magazine, which chronicled the rise of the internet, succumbed to the dot-com bubble collapse of the late 1990s and early 2000s, going into bankruptcy. Mr. Bunnell was forced out of the company.Through it all, he worked as an editor, publisher and writer at the leading edge of the computing world. Mr. Jobs, one of Apple\u2019s founders, chose Mr. Bunnell over a variety of competitors when he sought a consumer magazine to help propel the Macintosh computer in 1984.David Hugh Bunnell was born in Alliance, Neb., on July 25, 1947. His father, Hugh, was the editor of the local paper, The Alliance Daily Times-Herald. David began working at the paper when he was 12.

And it may take a long time to go away.With all these complaints, only Apple seems ensnared in a traditional argument with regulators. The others, because they are intrinsically tied to new kinds of business, require creative thinking about the meaning and importance of data, privacy, competition and the like.No European company has a comprehensive leading position in the new tech world, which combines cloud computing, mobility, data and artificial intelligence. But that\u2019s probably not why the regulators are preoccupied with Americans.It\u2019s the nature of big online businesses to seek as much data as possible, and often engage with consumers in such a way that the users share a lot about themselves in the name of fun (Facebook) and professional advantage (LinkedIn).Creating effective methods for searching for information, for using smartphones or for building applications seems to enable companies to acquire dominance more rapidly than ever. Some of that may be because of noncompetitive behavior, but it is also because of the strong network effects that benefit these companies. It\u2019s cheap and easy to distribute software online, and if people love your product, they will share and publicize it for you.Software developers using these applications may choose among other cloud providers, but having so many popular tools in A.W.S. gives it an edge; it is also known and trusted.It\u2019s a strong model. And it quite possibly provides years of work for European regulators, until they can integrate the new businesses that technology creates into old customs and laws.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Shares Hit a High With Promise of the Cloud\u2019s Profit Margins", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft has staked its future on cloud computing, the next big technology wave for companies, and is now telling investors more about how much money it\u2019s making from the business.It appears they like what they hear so far: Microsoft\u2019s share price hit a high on Thursday \u2014 up 6 percent to more than $60 a share in after-hours trading \u2014 after the company released the financial results of its most recent quarter.The last time Microsoft\u2019s stock was this valuable was back in 1999, when Bill Clinton was still president, Mark Zuckerberg was in high school and the company was heading toward an antitrust showdown with the Department of Justice.Cloud computing represents a big change in the way businesses get access to and purchase software and computing resources because it lets customers rent what they need as they go.For outfits like Microsoft, the method is not as profitable as the old-fashioned way of selling copies of software, a business with gross profit margins above 90 percent \u2014 that\u2019s the total profit a company can make off a product once the cost of making and selling it is subtracted.But the cloud has other advantages, including more dependable flows of revenue. Tech companies like Microsoft also believe cloud computing will help make the overall technology market far bigger over time.On Thursday, Microsoft said its gross profit margin from its commercial cloud business was 49 percent, much lower than its traditional software business, but still attractive and growing quickly. Microsoft has shared gross profit margins for its cloud business on occasion before, but recently said it would do so more explicitly in its earnings statements.\u201cThe more details you get, the better,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. \u201cIt also shows the business is coming of age.\u201dMany products make up Microsoft\u2019s cloud offerings, but revenue from one, Azure, jumped 116 percent during the quarter compared with a year earlier. Azure lets customers rent online storage and other computing infrastructure from Microsoft.Microsoft was initially slow to recognize the importance of cloud computing, while its crosstown rival, Amazon, built a large business serving start-ups and big corporate customers. But after spending billions on data centers, Microsoft is finally recognized as a credible No. 2 in the market.Microsoft said net income for the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, which ended Sept. 30, was $4.69 billion, or 60 cents a share, compared with $4.9 billion, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $20.45 billion compared with $20.38 billion a year ago.Investors focus on a different set of figures that exclude the effect of large revenue deferrals related to Windows 10, the Microsoft operating system from which the company recognizes revenue over time because of accounting rules governing software delivered as a service.Without those deferrals, Microsoft earned nearly $6 billion, or 76 cents a share, compared with $5.66 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue of $22.33 billion was up from revenue of $21.66 billion a year ago. The results were well ahead of the 68 cents a share in earnings and $21.71 billion in revenue that represent the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.There were blemishes on Microsoft\u2019s quarter. The revenue it gets from PC makers who put Windows on their systems did not grow, a reflection of the stagnant PC market. Its revenue from selling phones, a market Microsoft has backed away from, fell 72 percent. And its revenue from games declined 5 percent because of falling Xbox game console sales.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Is Said to Be in Continued Talks With Salesforce", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the last week, Twitter\u2019s fate has appeared to be murkier than ever. The troubled social media company, which has been engaged in talks to sell itself, seemed to be running out of potential buyers.At the same time, Twitter\u2019s executives are pressing on as if the company will remain an independent entity, said the people involved in the negotiations. While Twitter executives think they have clarified the social media company\u2019s mission and focus, which now revolves around live events and live commentary, they had feared they were running out of time to achieve their goals given the volatility of its stock and investor skepticism over its prospects.The multipronged strategy gives a glimpse into how Twitter is internally trying to come to grips with its path forward amid a shifting chess match of deal talks and considerations. Even as Twitter is in the spotlight as a go-to discussion forum during this presidential election cycle, the challenges the company faces remain acute.Twitter, which will report its next quarterly earnings on Oct. 27, is still wrestling with questions about its growth in users and revenue. The company, which is based in San Francisco, also faces mounting concerns around the potential threat of an activist shareholder lawsuit, a choppy stock price and a growing internal fear among employees that it is susceptible to forces outside of their control.Mr. Dorsey was in the middle of a major turnaround effort, an attempt to stanch the bleeding of users and reinstall faith in the company with new efforts around live streaming video. Mr. Dorsey, executives and many on the board wanted more time to prove Twitter could work as an independent company, even as they had a fiduciary duty to consider all options.A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment. Salesforce also declined to comment. The internal state of affairs at Twitter and its likely options was described in interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees.Rank-and-file staff members are frustrated about being in the dark on the company\u2019s future, and a handful of employees have stopped showing up for work entirely, several insiders said.Mr. Dorsey has been trying to rally the troops, sending two companywide memos, one in mid-September and one last week, which were obtained by The New York Times. In the September note, Mr. Dorsey struck a consoling tone to employees, and noted the progress around Twitter\u2019s live streaming of a Thursday night N.F.L. game to be broadcast that day. But he did not offer clarity on the rumors surrounding the company\u2019s potential acquisition, leading to further internal speculation and grumbling.Despite the drama, there is a bright spot for Twitter executives: The company\u2019s focus on live efforts, however nascent, are beginning to bear some fruit.One measure that is on the rise is Twitter\u2019s logged-out live stream viewers \u2014 that is, people who watched the live streamed N.F.L. game who do not hold Twitter accounts \u2014 accounting for about 15 percent of total viewership of the company\u2019s first handful of N.F.L. games, according to two people with knowledge of the viewership numbers. That syncs with Twitter\u2019s overall thesis that its platform extends beyond those who hold Twitter accounts.As far as logged-in Twitter accounts are concerned, the company reported three million new users last quarter. People familiar with the company\u2019s metrics expect that growth to continue.Twitter executives are also focused on making Twitter profitable. Since going public in November 2013, the company has yet to turn a profit, particularly because of a large stock-based expenses related to employee compensation and high research and development costs.Twitter earlier held separate talks with Microsoft about a potential acquisition of Fabric, according to four people involved in the matter. Those preliminary talks stalled when rumors of a possible sale of Twitter to Salesforce spilled out since Microsoft and Salesforce compete with one another, these people said. It is unclear if the talks will resume.I.B.M. was also approached about a deal. Microsoft and I.B.M. declined to comment.Twitter is also considering new layoffs. As of the company\u2019s most recent earnings report, Twitter employs nearly 4,000 staffers in more than 35 offices worldwide.\u201cI empathize with the feelings that come from the constant critique, the constant negativity, and the constant doubt,\u201d Mr. Dorsey wrote in the companywide memo last month. \u201cBut hey, that\u2019s life in the arena. All we control is how we choose to react to it.\u201dKatie Benner contributed reporting from San Francisco and Steve Lohr from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Unveils Its First Desktop PC", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byMicrosoft is trying to light a creative spark under the struggling personal computer industry.On Wednesday, the company, which is based in Redmond, Wash., unveiled a desktop personal computer that turns into a digital drafting table. Surface Studio, as the new device is called, is the company\u2019s first desktop PC, and a reminder of Microsoft\u2019s growing presence in the hardware side of the industry that it once left entirely to its partners.At an event in New York, Microsoft also announced an update to its Windows 10 operating system that is designed to make creating, manipulating and viewing 3-D objects easier.The new Microsoft machine is a handsome specimen of the all-in-one PC category best exemplified by Apple\u2019s iMac. It has a sleek aluminum body with 28-inch screen that rests on top of a stand. Microsoft also showed a new accessory device called the Surface Dial that augments computer mice, giving users a precise way to zoom in images and perform other actions.\u201cThis is a product that we believe truly brings out the creator in all of us,\u201d said Panos Panay, a Microsoft corporate vice president.The new Microsoft PC will not be for everyone though, if only because of its $2,999 price tag. It will go on sale in limited quantities this holiday season, Mr. Panay said. Architects, product designers and engineers are among the likely targets for the product.Surface Studio stands out from others in that its display is touch sensitive, effectively making it a gargantuan tablet that can be manipulated with hands and a stylus. A hinge in its stand allows users to position the screen at an angle so they can write and draw on it more naturally.J.P. Gownder, an analyst at Forrester Research, thinks the new device allows Microsoft to participate in the high end of the PC market, where profit margins tend to be fatter. During its most recently reported quarter, Microsoft said it had $926 million in Surface revenue, up 38 percent from the same period a year earlier.But like previous Surface computers from Microsoft, including a laptop and tablet, Surface Studio is also intended to inspire other PC makers, Mr. Gownder said.Sales in the PC market have been in a long slump. Shipments of new PCs in the third quarter fell 3.9 percent from the previous year, according to IDC, the technology research firm.Microsoft said a new version of its operating system that would be released early next year, Windows 10 Creators Update, is aimed at responding to the interest in 3-D imagery inspired by new technologies like virtual reality. The company demonstrated how a 3-D image of a sand castle can easily be captured on a smartphone and then edited into a greeting card on Windows 10 with a new application that comes with the software.The company\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, said Microsoft\u2019s new products were meant for the people who needed more than a regular consumer\u2019s computer.\u201cWe are the company that stands for the builders, the makers, the creators \u2014 that\u2019s who we are,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cEvery choice we make is about finding that balance between consumption and creative expression.\u201dMicrosoft also said several hardware companies, including HP, Dell, Lenovo and Asus, would release virtual reality headsets next holiday season that work with Windows 10 PCs. The headsets will start at $299, hundreds of dollars less than comparable headsets.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Corporate Confidence of the AT&T-Time Warner Deal", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byBy many measures, this should be a moment of great economic uncertainty for the corporate world.The United States election looms. Interest rates are set to rise soon. Britain plans to leave the European Union. China\u2019s economic growth is slowing. Cyberattacks are on the rise. And Russia is flexing its military muscle in the Middle East.Any one of these factors would usually be enough to give chief executives pause. The men and women who run the world\u2019s largest corporations are nothing if not cautious.Yet across industries, there are surprising signs of confidence, with corporate chieftains and directors signaling their belief that the upswing will continue for months or even years to come. Investors are betting on sustained growth. Companies are hiring. And huge mergers and acquisitions are back in fashion.On Saturday night, AT&T said it planned to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion \u2014 the biggest deal of the year. On Friday, British American Tobacco offered $47 billion for the portion of Reynolds American that it does not already own. And this week, the chip maker Qualcomm is expected to make a $37 billion offer for the rival company NXP Semiconductors.Such megadeals are often postponed during times of political or economic uncertainty. Yet at what feels to many like a tumultuous moment for the global economy, many corporate titans apparently see smooth sailing ahead.The most imminent economic concern may be the outcome of the race for the White House. Though Donald J. Trump has positioned himself as a successful businessman, economists have warned of market upheavals if he is elected.But with Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead over Mr. Trump wide and still growing with less than three weeks until Election Day, chief executives appear to be betting that the race is all but over.\u201cEveryone is expecting a Clinton victory,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cShe represents the status quo. They think nothing is going to change, and they\u2019re comfortable with that.\u2019\u201dAnother major concern among chief executives has been that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates, making it more expensive for companies to borrow. But after the Fed raised short-term interest rates last December for the first time since the financial crisis, the markets took it in stride. Even now, as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, signals that rate increases are coming soon, investors and executives appear unfazed.\u201cThe Federal Reserve is sending very strong signals that, yes, it is going to normalize interest rates, but very, very slowly,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cThat makes deals easier to get done. It\u2019s a very sanguine, propitious environment for deals.\u201dNot everyone is benefiting from that confidence in the C-suite. Millions of Americans are feeling left behind, a sentiment that is driving the rising populism that has shaped this election cycle. And in an era of sweeping consolidation, many smaller companies find themselves struggling to compete against multinational behemoths.But while corporate executives are monitoring a laundry list of political and economic risks, no single factor appears to be a major cause for concern.Instead, there is a growing sense that the combination of slow but steady economic growth, rapid technological innovation and an uncertain geopolitical landscape is here to stay for some time, or what business leaders call \u201cthe new normal.\u201d\u201cYou have a group of business leaders who have come of age only knowing uncertainty and complexity,\u201d said Blair W. Effron, co-founder of Centerview Partners, an investment bank that advises companies on big takeovers. \u201cThey are therefore really good at managing in this environment.\u201dWhen it comes to mergers and acquisitions, that means companies are thinking about how to position themselves for unpredictable swings in consumer preferences and unanticipated changes in global markets, often through deal making.For AT&T, the bet is about expanding beyond its roots as a distribution company. AT&T already offers phone, internet, cable and satellite services, but it has watched as Comcast, the country\u2019s largest cable operator, has expanded into content with its acquisition of NBCUniversal.By buying Time Warner \u2014 one of the most prestigious producers of television and film today, with brands including HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. \u2014 AT&T will suddenly become Comcast\u2019s closest true rival.\u201cAT&T is trying to keep up with the Joneses,\u201d said Robert Salomon, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business.For British American Tobacco, taking full control of Reynolds American means further expanding into the developing world as Americans and Europeans smoke less because of health concerns.For the German company Bayer, which agreed last month to acquire the agricultural giant Monsanto for $56 billion, it is about gaining market share and getting leverage over customers.And because interest rates remain so low, such deals are relatively easy to do these days.\u201cCorporations are still sitting on record levels of cash, and there\u2019s not a lot of organic growth out there,\u201d Mr. Salomon said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t grow organically, it\u2019s growth through acquisitions.\u201dIn other industries, too, the pace of consolidation has quickened. Two big deals had appeared poised to reshape the American health care industry. Anthem has offered $48 billion for Cigna, and Aetna has offered $37 billion for Humana.The Justice Department, however, has sued to block both deals, leaving their fates in jeopardy.That\u2019s not the case in other industries, like technology, where there are few barriers to the big getting bigger. This summer, Microsoft agreed to buy LinkedIn for $26 billion.All in all, the aggressive deal making \u2014 coupled with a steady stock market and an economy that is growing, if modestly \u2014 suggests that in a moment that could easily be fraught with uncertainty, many corporate leaders are surprisingly confident.It has now been more than seven years since the United States economy dipped into recession, making this one of the longest periods of so-called expansion in American history. The longest, at 10 years, occurred during the 1990s, but economists believe that absent any major setbacks, that record could soon be broken.\u201cThere is a growing sense that this expansion has a ways to run,\u201d Mr. Zandi of Moody\u2019s said. \u201cPeople are getting comfortable with the idea that this is going for a while.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vast Group of New Video Games and Hardware Jostle for Holiday Attention", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byFiguring out what to get for your video gamer friends and relatives this holiday season is about to become a lot more complicated.Over the next two months, the game industry is pushing out one of the more crowded product lineups of recent years. What\u2019s different is the sheer amount of stuff: not just blockbuster titles for gaming consoles, but also new hardware, independent games and a bigger emphasis on virtual reality.They are all jostling for attention during the end of the year, which is when around 40 percent of the industry\u2019s sales take place, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.\u201cThe lineup of hardware and software this holiday will look to some to be an evil conspiracy specifically designed to drain the wallets of hard-core gamers,\u201d Mr. Pachter said.The choices might be made even more complicated by the question of whether to buy a game title or just rent it. NPD Group, a research firm that tracks retail sales in the United States, is projecting an increase in spending on rental games from services like GameFly and Redbox, as more people opt to try titles before they purchase.The wealth of options underlines how console makers and game publishers have to work harder to keep people interested in games, especially with more entertainment options than ever. As a result, the game industry has embraced new technology like virtual reality, as well as new approaches to current products.The appearance of new consoles, for example, is notable because the hardware is coming partway through a typical five-to-seven-year cycle for new consoles.Here is more about what gamers can expect this holiday season:Seasoned gamers may opt for the Xbox One S or the PlayStation 4 Pro, both of which promise more power and a better visual experience. Nintendo\u2019s NES Classic Edition seems aimed at those who value nostalgia \u2014 the low price suggests this may be the better option for those who simply want to rediscover the joy of their gaming youth with something easy to plug in and play.So what games are set to be big this holiday season? The answer: Shooter games. Again.That category of games, where people take on the character of someone doing the shooting, has long been popular for its first-person perspective. This month, the video game publisher Electronic Arts released two shooter games, Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. Activision is making its latest Call of Duty war game \u2014 this one is titled Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare \u2014 available in November.Many of these games have long lineages (the Battlefield series has been around since 2002), reflecting how unlikely it is that gamers will ever tire of shooters. Most of the games have multiplayer modes, meaning people can play with their friends. Also, there are essentially no consequences for being killed, since when you die in one of these games, you simply respawn immediately and carry on.Other games that are expected to do well this holiday season also have shooting elements. Those include a third-person shooter game, Gears of War 4 (published by Microsoft); the action adventure game Mafia III (published by Take-Two); and Watch Dogs 2, an open-world adventure game set in a fictionalized version of San Francisco (from Ubisoft).With the increased use, the quality of mobile and independent games is also improving, especially in graphics and design. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more indie titles with greater polish and the feel of a major game title,\u201d said Kate Edwards, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, a trade group.Ms. Edwards said the independent games that are getting buzz for the holiday season are Cuphead, a run-and-gun platform game drawn in the style of 1930s cartoons and inspired by the work of cartoonists like Max Fleischer (made by Studio MDHR for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One); and Overland, a survival strategy game set in post-apocalyptic North America (made by Finji for PC; $20).Others include Gang Beasts, a melee party video game (made by Boneloaf for PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 VR; $20); Hand of Fate 2, an action role-playing game (made by Defiant Development for PC and Xbox One); and Cryptark, a 2-D science-fiction shooter (made by Alientrap for PC, Mac, Linux and PlayStation 4; $15). That\u2019s right, shooter games again.Still, the games will have to work to stand out from the crowd. An average of about 500 gaming apps are released for Apple iOS devices every day, according to Pocket Gamer, a site that tracks apps offered in the App Store.\u201cMajor studios and indies alike are all creating in V.R., which means even the most jaded gamer is likely to be surprised by what comes out later this year and beyond,\u201d said Jason Rubin, head of content at Oculus, which is owned by Facebook.Interest in virtual reality games appears to be increasing, according to Mr. Rubin. Samsung Gear VR, a headset that runs on Oculus software, reported more than a million unique users for the last few months, he said.Some virtual reality games that consumers can look forward to include Rock Band VR by Harmonix, a rhythm game that lets players bust out a guitar solo in front of a bustling crowd; The Unspoken, made by Insomniac Games, which allows people to cast spells at rival magicians; and a game called Wilson\u2019s Heart, from the studio Twisted Pixel, in which players must try to escape an abandoned hospital.There will be more to come. Mr. Rubin said developers would continue to experiment with new types of virtual reality experiences, especially in multiplayer games that will plunge several people at once into the same immersive virtual environments.Advertisement"}

In particular, it\u2019s a good time to check out what\u2019s new in corporate paranoia.This time of year, San Francisco\u2019s streets are blocked off so companies like Oracle and Salesforce can bring in thousands of customers for several days of presentations, coffee and performances by Milli Vanilli-era pop stars. In the next few days, Salesforce expects to host 171,000 people, enough that even seedy hotels in the Tenderloin neighborhood cost $600 a night.At conferences here, or in Atlanta, where last week Microsoft gathered 23,000 people, companies state their visions on the current and future state of tech.These talks are, as they say, buzzword compliant, with the companies praising their capabilities in cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. They are renting computers in remote data centers over the internet and using the tremendous amounts of data we are now collecting from computers, phones and sensors to analyze and predict how to make and sell more stuff.The best part of these talks isn\u2019t viewing the technology; it\u2019s listening to each sponsoring company brag about how much better it is than its competitors. Each presents number-rich charts to prove it.Who a company names as its enemy and how it measures its relative greatness says a lot about how the company sees its own strengths and the overall stakes in the competition for the world\u2019s computing.For Oracle\u2019s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, who used to slam Microsoft or Salesforce at these events, the main antagonist is now Amazon, which has led the migration of business technology to internet-based cloud computing.\u201cAmazon\u2019s lead is over,\u201d Mr. Ellison told his audience in September. \u201cWe\u2019re aggressively moving.\u201d Using select data, he described Oracle as better in speed, security and, most important, price. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to pay less, you can\u2019t place the order,\u201d he said.For Microsoft, which has spent tens of billions of dollars building its global cloud computing system, the most important factor is not money; rather, the company is focused on size, resources and its track record.\u201cThe only comparison to our depth and breadth is Google,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview after his Atlanta keynote.Also on Thursday, Google held a coming-out event for its corporate computing effort, called Google Cloud, with a Google-level array of dizzying statistics about its scale and size. The company has had 339 product releases since January, and it has 10,000 engineers working on corporate computing.The company even showed a photograph of its undersea cable to Japan, which is 9,000 kilometers long and capable of sending 60 terabytes of information a second (one terabyte is roughly the size of 500 hours of video).Alphabet, the parent company of Google Cloud, has a capital expenditure of $9.9 billion a year, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google Cloud\u2019s senior vice president. Almost all of that consists of various forms of computing infrastructure. \u201cThat is just shy of Amazon and Microsoft put together,\u201d he said.Mr. H\u00f6lzle said data that would take Amazon eight hours to sift could take six minutes on Google. In one case, analysis on Google was 29 times as fast as on Amazon Web Services, he said.The velocity itself is the crucial metric, Mr. H\u00f6lzle said in a separate interview, and he said it would decimate most of today\u2019s contenders.\u201cThis is like Android versus the iPhone in 2008,\u201d he said, evoking a comparison with Apple. \u201cThere were older phones, the BlackBerry. Android managed to be relevant even though the first versions weren\u2019t great. It wasn\u2019t that it was free, or it had maps \u2014 it was the velocity that it changed.\u201dThe sole exception to industry enemy-naming is Amazon. At last year\u2019s meeting it cited a couple of specific products from IBM and Oracle. But with revenue expected to hit $11 billion this year, it is the undisputed cloud leader. For Amazon, naming anyone else would be like anointing them.But what fun is competition when you have nothing to beat? Amazon\u2019s designated foe is all of the past, and the 95 percent of old-style corporate computing it still has to take to the cloud. The IBM and Oracle products it named were from that old world.\u201cIn the next five years, we\u2019ll see the vast majority of enterprises doing what our forward-looking enterprise customers are doing now,\u201d said Ariel Kelman, the vice president of worldwide marketing at Amazon Web Services. He named Intuit and Netflix among these pioneers.Since Amazon owns the transformation, it figures, the enemy is a failure to transform.Advertisement"}

But they have social and emotional dimensions never seen with keyboards and screens.Do we, for example, associate the stereotypical voice of an English butler \u2014 think of Jarvis the computer in \u201cIron Man\u201d \u2014 with a helpful and intelligent person? And why do so many people want to hear a voice that sounds like it came from a younger woman with no discernible accent?Choosing a voice has implications for design, branding or interacting with machines. A voice can change or harden how we see each other. Where commerce is concerned, that creates a problem: Is it better to succeed by complying with a stereotype, or risk failure in the market by going against type?For many, the answer is initially clear. Microsoft\u2019s artificially intelligent voice system is Cortana, for example, and it was originally the voice of a female character in the video game \u201cHalo.\u201d\u201cIn our research for Cortana, both men and women prefer a woman, younger, for their personal assistant, by a country mile,\u201d said Derek Connell, senior vice president for search at Microsoft. In other words, a secretary \u2014 a job that is traditionally seen as female.Last week, Google introduced a number of voice-based products, including Google Home, its version of Echo. All of them use Google Assistant, which also speaks in tones associated with a young, educated woman.Google Assistant \u201cis a millennial librarian who understands cultural cues, and can wink at things,\u201d said Ryan Germick, who leads the personality efforts in building Google Assistant. \u201cProducts aren\u2019t about rational design decisions. They are about psychology and how people feel.\u201dThe company has had internal debates about whether to respond differently on questions to the computer about suicide, Mr. Connell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve leaned to providing information about suicide prevention everywhere,\u201d he said, as opposed to offering no advice at all.But sometimes, if you want people to figure out quickly that they are talking to a machine, it can be better to have a man\u2019s voice. For example, IBM\u2019s Watson, when it talks to Bob Dylan in television commercials, has a male voice. When Ashok Goel, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, adapted Watson to have a female voice as an informal experiment in how people relate to conversational machines, his students couldn\u2019t tell it was a computer.But Watson\u2019s maleness is the exception. Amazon\u2019s A.I. technology is another in the comforting female voice camp.\u201cAlexa was always an assistant, and female,\u201d said Peng Shao, who worked at Amazon on the Echo and is now at a Seattle start-up, building another speech-based A.I. system. Amazon would not comment on its product.Gender is just the starting point. Can your A.I. technology understand accents? And can it respond in a way that feels less robotic and at least mimics some sort of human empathy?\u201cYou need a persona,\u201d Mr. Shao said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional thing \u2014 people would get red, even get violent, if it didn\u2019t understand them. When it did understand them, it felt like magic. They sleep next to them. This is heading for hospitals, senior care, a lot of sensitive places.\u201dCapital One developed a banking app on Alexa, and found it had to dial down the computer\u2019s formality to make people comfortable talking about their finances with a computer.\u201cMoney is inextricably linked to emotion, enabling and preventing things in your life,\u201d said Stephanie Hay, the head of content strategy, culture and A.I. design at Capital One. At first the app said, \u201cHello,\u201d but that seemed too tense. \u201c\u2018Hi, there\u2019 worked better,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend, hanging out with me in the kitchen. I need her to be reliable and approachable, but not invasive.\u201dWe don\u2019t just need that computerized voice to meet our expectations, said Justine Cassell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. We need computers to relate to us and put us at ease when performing a task. \u201cWe have to know that the other is enough like us that it will run our program correctly,\u201d she said.That need seems to start young. Ms. Cassell has designed an avatar of indeterminate race and gender for 5-year-olds. \u201cThe girls think it\u2019s a girl, and the boys think it\u2019s a boy,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren of color think it\u2019s of color, Caucasians think it\u2019s Caucasian.\u201dAnother system she built spoke in what she termed \u201cvernacular\u201d to African-American children, achieving better results in teaching scientific concepts than when the computer spoke in standard English.When tutoring the children in a class presentation, however, \u201cwe wanted it to practice with them in \u2018proper English.\u2019 Standard American English is still the code of power, so we needed to develop an agent that would train them in code switching,\u201d she said.And, of course, there are regional issues to consider when creating a robotic voice. For Cortana, Microsoft has had to tweak things like accents, as well as languages, and the jokes Cortana tells for different countries.If a French driver goes into Germany using driving directions voiced by Nuance Communications, the computer will mispronounce the name of a German town with a French accent. The idea is to keep the driver confident by sustaining the illusion that the computer is French.Local accents can be found in various versions of Apple\u2019s Siri. It\u2019s possible to localize the accent on an iPhone for the United States (\u201cSamantha,\u201d on to the phone\u2019s settings), Australia (\u201cKaren\u201d), Ireland (\u201cMoira\u201d), South Africa (\u201cTessa\u201d), and Britain (\u201cDaniel.\u201d) Apple could not say whether the English tradition of male butlers influenced its British choice.Mr. Mars\u2019s company, called Clinc, makes personal financial smartphone software that answers questions like \u201chow much can I spend on a computer?\u201d It relies on a similar Google-created female voice.He is hoping for enough success that he can eventually test and counter stereotypes with unexpected A.I. voices. \u201cYou need to be at a certain size before you can address these questions,\u201d said Mr. Mars, who teaches at the University of Michigan.But maybe not too big. \u201cI think consumers will eventually be open to exploring different voices and types,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies, they\u2019ll probably stay conservative about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subpoenas and Gag Orders Show Government Overreach, Tech Companies Argue", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It has been six months since the Justice Department backed off on demands that Apple help the F.B.I. break the security of a locked iPhone.But the government has not given up the fight with the tech industry. Open Whisper Systems, a maker of a widely used encryption app called Signal, received a subpoena in the first half of the year for subscriber information and other details associated with two phone numbers that came up in a federal grand jury investigation in Virginia.The subpoena arrived with a court order that said Open Whisper Systems was not allowed to tell anyone about the information request for one year.Technology companies contend that court-imposed gag orders are being used too often by law enforcement and that they violate the Bill of Rights. The companies also complain that law enforcement officials are casting a wide net over online communications \u2014 often too wide \u2014 in their investigations.Justice Department officials, for their part, argue that these gag orders are necessary to protect developing cases and to avoid tipping off potential targets. The officials say that they are simply following leads where they take them.Through a spokesman, the Justice Department declined to comment on the case.The information request made of Open Whisper Systems is particularly sensitive, since its encryption app is used around the world, and it is often recommended to journalists and human rights activists.Microsoft also complained that the orders often came without time limits, unlike the Open Whisper Systems order. Dozens of other technology, media and civil liberties groups filed briefs supporting Microsoft last month, and the case is pending.Part of the gag order on Open Whisper Systems was lifted after a court challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union, and redacted versions of documents related to the information request were made public last week. But the small San Francisco company was still not allowed to tell specific account holders about the investigation.The documents made public show that the government asked Open Whisper Systems to turn over data associated with two telephone numbers, including web browsing histories and data stored in the tracking \u201ccookies\u201d of the web browsers attached to those accounts. But one of Signal\u2019s biggest draws is that it does not collect most of that information.\u201cThe Signal service was designed to minimize the data we retain,\u201d said Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems. Mr. Marlinspike said Signal uses a technology called end-to-end encryption that kept the service from gaining access to the contents of its users\u2019 messages. The company also does not store information on those with whom its users are communicating.Civil liberties lawyers argue the Justice Department request fell well outside the bounds of what is typically covered by a subpoena, including basic subscriber information. Additional information, such as computer logs or content, would require a search warrant under the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\u201cThe Justice Department is pushing the envelope,\u201d said Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society. Big companies like Apple and Microsoft have the wherewithal to push back, she said. But smaller companies may cave, rather than risk an expensive fight.The Justice Department came to Open Whisper Systems with a menu of information needs, including subscriber details, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses and method of payment. The request went on to demand information on internet addresses, browsers and internet providers that the account holders could have used, according to court records.One of the phone numbers the government was investigating was not a Signal user after all. For the other phone number, Open Whisper Systems turned over the only pieces of data it could: the time the user\u2019s account had been created and the last time it had connected to the service \u2014 far less than the government sought.The government did not make that request of Open Whisper Systems. \u201cThey need to pick those cases carefully,\u201d Ms. Granick said. \u201cThey are only picking cases where they think they\u2019re going to have the people on their side.\u201dThe Justice Department and F.B.I. tried to force Apple to break its own software security in the case of an iPhone used by a gunman in last year\u2019s San Bernardino terrorist attacks, she said.\u201cGag orders should be used in exceptional cases,\u201d said Brett M. Kaufman, the staff attorney with the A.C.L.U. who represented Open Whisper Systems. \u201cThis one demonstrates that the exception has become the rule in routine proceedings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Companies Expect Free High-Speed Internet for Poorer Americans to Pay Off Later", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There is an axiom in technology: New products typically go to wealthy customers first, before prices eventually fall to reach the masses.With broadband now classified like a utility, telecom and tech companies, including Sprint, Comcast and Facebook, are increasingly working to make high-speed internet accessible to every American, not just a luxury. The companies are among those that have set their sights on bringing free or cheap high-speed internet service to low-income and rural populations in the United States, spurred by philanthropy and, for some, the hope of turning Americans who are not online today into full-paying customers in the future.Those goals were on display Tuesday, when Sprint announced that it planned to give one million low-income high school students a free device and a free high-speed data plan until graduation. Facebook is also working to bring to the United States a service known as Free Basics, which gives people free access to certain websites, including Facebook. Comcast recently loosened requirements for its low-cost broadband service, expanding it to anyone in public housing.\u201cThe private sector has as much responsibility as the public sector to make devices and broadband available to millions of young Americans,\u201d said Broderick Johnson, President Obama\u2019s cabinet secretary and chairman of a White House task force that worked with Sprint on its new program.Free and low-cost broadband programs have been around for a while, with Comcast rolling out one called Internet Essentials in 2011, Google offering free broadband in public housing, and Dell and Microsoft providing free or discounted devices to schools. But the new initiatives could reach much larger populations and are directed toward specific digital divide problems, such as the struggle for children without broadband at home to complete their homework.Yet while telecom and web companies cite altruism as propelling free or low-cost broadband programs, what is often left unsaid are the benefits the services bring to the companies. It\u2019s part of a textbook business strategy known as \u201closs leader,\u201d when a company provides discounted or free goods to get customers to buy more once they are in the store.The strategy is increasingly important for the telecom industry, where growth has slowed and new broadband customers are harder to find.Some of the companies acknowledged the business strategy involved in providing low-income products. But Sprint\u2019s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, said the priority had been to work on a problem that telecom firms are best positioned to help solve. \u201cThe internet is one of the few things that doesn\u2019t discriminate, but the one thing that does discriminate is who can get online and who can\u2019t,\u201d he said.Sprint, the fourth-largest mobile carrier in the United States, typically charges customers about $60 a month for high-speed internet service. In the last six months, Mr. Claure, who emigrated from Bolivia as a college student, has made the digital divide an issue within the firm and assembled tech and nonprofit partners around the effort.The mobile carrier is particularly focused on bridging the \u201chomework gap\u201d that exists for students without broadband, which Mr. Claure said particularly hurts low-income African-American and Hispanic children. \u201cBeing a Hispanic C.E.O., this bothers me,\u201d he said.The program will be rolled out in seven to 10 cities, including Kansas City, Mo., early next year, before becoming more widely available in the 2017-18 school year. Nonprofits including My Brother\u2019s Keeper Alliance and EveryoneOn will recruit students for the nine-year program, and Sprint will use its stores and customer service representatives to sign up and serve the students.The new program\u2019s cost to Sprint is minimal because it doesn\u2019t require additional network upgrades; instead, it would be the equivalent of adding more cars to a highway, the company said. And there is social value for Sprint in doing this.\u201cPeople will look at Sprint as a good guy,\u201d Mr. Claure said. \u201cBrands that create social value by making a meaningful difference in people\u2019s lives are in a stronger position to attract new customers.\u201dDavid L. Cohen, senior executive vice president of Comcast, said in a statement, \u201cThe purpose of the program is not to convert Internet Essentials customers into paying customers.\u201dFacebook did not offer a timeline for a rollout of Free Basics in the United States.\u201cWhile we have nothing to announce, Facebook\u2019s mission is to connect the world, and we\u2019re always exploring ways to do that, including in the United States,\u201d the company said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can You Save London From the Inferno of 1666?", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byFor younger visitors, a popular choice is Minecraft, a computer game of Lego-like blocks and textured cubes that developers used to recreate Pudding Lane, where the fire ignited in a bakery before consuming thousands of homes over three days.\u201cMinecraft is a really engaging tool and platform for children, but also for all sorts of people of all ages to bring in a new community to our museum,\u201d said Joshua Blair, the museum\u2019s digital learning coordinator for the \u201cFire! Fire!\u201d exhibition, which runs through April 17. \u201cWe can interpret things from our gallery in a really engaging way. And we can extend this fire exhibition to many people around the world.\u201dNow some museums are tentatively entering that realm by offering choice objects plucked from their galleries for digital transformation; the development costs range from $13,000 to $75,000 per project.In its traditional exhibition, the London museum chronicles the great fire with oil paintings, diaries and salvaged objects \u2014 among them a seared bible and a fire-blackened sculpture from a tomb in St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. It also displays 1666 versions of hand-held squirt guns, fire hooks and a newly restored 17th-century fire engine with a barrel and a hand pump.Some of those objects also appear in the Minecraft games, which give players a chance to search for tools to smash their way out of burning buildings to the sound of hacking coughs, or to combat rising flames with a blocky squirt gun. (\u201cSuch danger!\u201d warns a little box-headed figure standing among burning buildings. \u201cAll these warehouses are full of brandy, tar and straw, perfect for setting alight.\u201d)Some of the reactions emerge on YouTube. Players post videos with running commentary about their escapades with the dizzying train ride and other elements of the special Tate gallery. \u201cLet\u2019s learn about art,\u201d two Minecraft players named Dave and Toby declare.Since the Museum of London offered its first games over the summer, the first two have been downloaded 15,000 times in more than 100 countries. About 45 percent of the downloads were in Britain, with other top nations including the United States, South Korea, China and France.Game developers used popular YouTube channels about Minecraft to recruit women to lend their voices to animated fairies in the garden for the Minecraft game, which will be released this year.Even the Museum of London has been careful to separate the exhibition physically from the Minecraft game by not placing their own computers in the midst of the \u201cFire! Fire!\u201d show. (Visitors can take their own laptops to play on.) Instead, they offer a children\u2019s area spread with basic wooden blocks for rebuilding London.\u201cFamilies still want low-tech for a visit, because their children are on computers at home all the time,\u201d Laura Jackson, a museum spokeswoman, said as she walked by an area with costumes and equipment that visitors can don for selfies. \u201cMost things here are low-tech so they can touch them.\u201dMr. Clark also sought a critique from his young son, who played The Pool of London game and surprised him with a brief art history lesson: \u201cDaddy, he was a Fauvist.

{"Headline": "Nintendo Switch Console Is Met With Skepticism From Investors", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byWhat is the Nintendo Switch, and what\u2019s riding on it?The Nintendo Switch is an all-in-one gaming machine, essentially a compact processor with removable controllers and a screen, which can be configured for playing at home (with a television) or on the go. It is a big deal for Nintendo, the Japanese game giant, which has fallen behind rivals in hardware. Nintendo reshaped the console market in the mid-2000s with its innovative Wii, whose motion-sensitive controllers and relatively simple games dramatically expanded the audience for gaming, attracting millions of so-called casual players. But Nintendo\u2019s follow-up, the Wii U, has disappointed. Last year, the PlayStation 4, from Sony, outsold the Wii U almost threefold, and the Xbox from Microsoft has also done better.What went wrong?In a word: smartphones. The Wii\u2019s strengths \u2014 simplicity and affordability \u2014 turned into weaknesses once phones became the go-to game platform for casual players. Sony and Microsoft held onto their core audience of hard-core gamers \u2014 people who want big screens, hefty processing power and hyperreal graphics that phones can\u2019t provide \u2014 while Nintendo fans drifted to phone games like Angry Birds. Game developers, too, turned their backs on the Wii, creating a downward spiral. Fewer new games meant even less appeal.So is the Nintendo Switch a strategic, er, switch?Not really. Nintendo faced a choice: fight Sony and Microsoft for hard-core game fans, or try a new way of appealing to casual gamers. It chose the latter. The Nintendo Switch, to judge from the company\u2019s early marketing, is aimed at people who like games enough to want to play them on dedicated hardware (not just a smartphone) but not so much that they will lock themselves in their rooms all day with a PlayStation or an Xbox. The question is whether enough of those people exist. Serkan Toto, a game industry analyst in Tokyo, doubts it. Nintendo \u201cmasterfully captured\u201d casual gamers with the Wii, he wrote on Twitter, but today few are likely to turn away from their phones, especially when it means paying several hundred dollars for a console. \u201cIt will be very, very difficult to get them back.\u201dWhat does Nintendo have to get right?Everything, according to Mr. Toto. \u201cThey absolutely need to hit all the bases this time,\u201d he said. That includes persuading developers to make lots of high-quality games for the machine. It also means getting the price right. Even committed console buyers are willing to jump between brands if it means getting a better deal; with casual gamers, a steep price could \u201cbreak the device\u2019s neck,\u201d Mr. Toto said.What if the Nintendo Switch is a dud?That would be bad for Nintendo, obviously, but the company is about more than just hardware \u2014 especially recently. After years of hostility toward smartphone gaming, it has pivoted to an \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em\u201d approach. And that\u2019s beginning to pay off, as shown by its success in turning its Pok\u00e9mon franchise into a huge smartphone hit. Its future could lie in unlocking similar value from a game catalog that includes Mario Brothers, Zelda and other popular titles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Fate: Marc Benioff of Salesforce Addresses Acquisition Talk", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com, showed up onstage on Wednesday afternoon at his biggest customer event of the year to talk up his business technology company\u2019s products and strategy.But what was arguably the higher-stakes meeting was held later that day. At the plush St. Regis San Francisco Hotel, Mr. Benioff presided over a gathering with Wall Street analysts and investors. His aim: to assuage their concerns about his plan to buy Twitter, the struggling social media company.\u201cWe look at a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Benioff told the room, without directly mentioning Twitter. \u201cThe number we acquire is very few.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cit gives us ideas\u201d to look at companies.At first glance, the two companies could not be more different. Twitter is where celebrities, politicians and countless other individuals broadcast their thoughts in 140-character messages. Salesforce, on the other hand, makes online software for salespeople and marketers.Yet Twitter would fit into a vision that Mr. Benioff has had for Salesforce, which he founded in 1999, as a company that can help enterprises with all of their customer needs. Twitter, in Mr. Benioff\u2019s eyes, is already a powerful customer service tool that airlines, restaurants, banks and many other companies use to field consumer complaints and requests. Companies can also use what people post on Twitter to glean consumer habits.\u201cThis is a huge messaging and communications service,\u201d Mr. Benioff, who turned 52 last month, said on Wednesday in an interview on his way to the St. Regis. He added, \u201cI use mergers and acquisition activity to think about the market.\u201dMr. Benioff faces a battery of challenges in buying Twitter. Skeptical investors have pushed Salesforce stock down about 5 percent since news broke that the company was considering bidding for the social media company. Behind the scenes, investors have been grousing about a potential purchase. Any deal would very likely be Salesforce\u2019s largest, with Twitter valued at about $14 billion. Salesforce, which is unprofitable, has a market capitalization of about $48 billion.Twitter investors appear dubious, too. The company\u2019s stock dropped more than 20 percent on Thursday as speculation about other suitors seemed to dissipate.\u201cThis would be a disaster,\u201d said Joel Fishbein, managing director at BTIG, a financial services firm. \u201cBenioff is a visionary, but this could blow up. Engineers could leave Salesforce, and it would send the stock down 30 or 40 percent.\u201dMr. Benioff acknowledged that Salesforce would face difficulties in taking over Twitter, given that Salesforce sells software to businesses while Twitter is a consumer technology company. The chief executive, who is an activist in areas like gay rights and gender equality, also said he was troubled by the amount of hate speech on Twitter.But it is not unusual for Mr. Benioff to go against the grain. A San Francisco native, he worked at Oracle, the business software company, for years before founding Salesforce as an online software firm in 1999, when online software was still unproven.\u201cMarc wants to be well thought of, to feel like he\u2019s doing things the right way,\u201d said Adam Bosworth, a Salesforce executive who left in August to work at Amazon. Mr. Bosworth recalled once disagreeing with Mr. Benioff on a management issue and sending him an email with the subject line, \u201cYou are not being a mensch.\u201d\u201cIt was the fastest response I ever got from him,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said.Much of the data that Salesforce is gaining through acquisitions can help power artificial intelligence, which Mr. Benioff says will soon be everywhere. \u201cWe\u2019ve bought about a dozen A.I. companies, built whole new teams,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Without LinkedIn, Mr. Benioff turned his sights to Twitter, which has been trying to figure out how to rev up its growth.Mr. Benioff, who is himself a power user of Twitter, said on Wednesday that while it was essential that Salesforce be in A.I., there was more to Twitter than that.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge customer-service platform,\u201d used by companies like Dell, Apple and Bank of America, he said in the interview on the way to the St. Regis. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reason to buy it, but it\u2019s a reason to look at it. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m buying it, but I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not buying it.\u201dLater, at the investor meeting where analysts shied from mentioning the name Twitter, Mr. Benioff tried to explain where he was coming from. \u201cI see things in a different kind of way,\u201d he told them. \u201cI hope someday to sit down and say how I think about that which shall not be named.\u201dEventually, though, Mr. Benioff could not resist a more direct reference to Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey. \u201cI wish Jack well with his company,\u201d Mr. Benioff said at the end of the investor meeting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The AT&T-Time Warner Merger: A Match Built on Hope", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byFair GameThere\u2019s something for all investors in this corporate marriage, AT&T says: Those seeking earnings growth will benefit as well as investors on the hunt for income. For one thing, the company expects the combination to begin adding to earnings the year after it closes \u2014 a quick turnaround by traditional standards. And it also says the takeover will improve its so-called dividend coverage. That\u2019s the measure of how much excess cash AT&T has to cover its 5.3 percent dividend.Company executives always make promises when they announce big deals. But talk is cheap, delivery costly.This holds especially true for telecommunications shareholders. \u201cThe telecom industry has many examples of deals which failed to reach their potential, or destroyed significant value, including investments in content,\u201d Simon Flannery, an industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note published on Monday. After one year, his research shows, the top quartile of telecom deals generated positive returns of around 6 percent; the bottom quartile, meanwhile, showed a roughly 25 percent loss in value.I wanted to ask Mr. Flannery for more details, but a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said he was restricted from commenting because the firm is an adviser on the AT&T-Time Warner deal.AT&T shareholders would surely welcome a lift in earnings if the Time Warner deal were to deliver one. A more immediate concern for investors may be what the merger will mean to the future of AT&T\u2019s beloved dividend. These payouts have been the main reason to own what has otherwise been a lackluster stock.AT&T\u2019s dividend of 5.3 percent per year, well above the 3.6 percent paid by its peers, according to Bloomberg, has been a lure for investors. It also may have lulled them into complacency about the company\u2019s operations over the years.During the last five years, AT&T shares have gained 25 percent versus a 67 percent rise in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, not counting dividends. The company\u2019s operational performance has also disappointed. In 2015, AT&T\u2019s net income was 27 percent below the level of two years earlier. Revenue growth is one area where AT&T has outpaced its peers, but much of the 11 percent increase in 2015 from the year before was attributable to AT&T\u2019s purchase of DirecTV and Mexican wireless operations.Some analysts think the deal for Time Warner could put a dent in the rich AT&T dividend. \u201cInvestors should be cautious because in order to maintain the dividend, AT&T has to take on a huge amount of debt,\u201d said Ginette Rowe Beecherl, an analyst at Greenbrier Partners, a money management firm in Dallas. \u201cTo the extent that their assets decline as their technology is supplanted, will they really be able to support such a high dividend?\u201dBrad Burns, an AT&T spokesman, said the company was confident in its ability not only to sustain the dividend, but also to raise it. He said free cash flow generated by Time Warner would help the combined companies bring down debt ratios by the end of the first year after the deal closes. And four years after, the company will be back to its historical target debt range, he said.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Among the 500 companies in the S.&P. index, AT&T is the fourth-largest dividend payer in aggregate dollars, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Global. This year, AT&T is expected to pay some $12 billion in dividends. Only Exxon Mobil, Apple and Microsoft pay more.In recent years, AT&T\u2019s dividend payouts have accounted for 60 to 70 percent of the company\u2019s free cash flow. This compares with a 40 percent average dividend payout ratio among S.&P. 500 companies currently.To conclude the merger, AT&T\u2019s debt will rise to over $190 billion, from about $126 billion, according to Mr. Flannery at Morgan Stanley. He wrote that this debt load could put the dividend at risk if AT&T\u2019s business deteriorated or its capital expenditures and interest costs rose.Shareholders are not the only ones benefiting from AT&T\u2019s sumptuous dividend. Some of the incentive pay received each year by Mr. Stephenson and his top lieutenants is tied to the total shareholder return of the company\u2019s stock. AT&T\u2019s hefty dividend makes a big contribution to that total return measure.\u201cAT&T is not a technology company, not a services company and not a utility company \u2014 it\u2019s a dividend-paying company.\u201d Ms. Beecherl, the Greenbrier analyst, said. \u201cif it pulls off its latest gamble to remain relevant by acquiring Time Warner, investors will be left with a company with one of the highest levels of debt in the world while its technology is supplanted, and its C.E.O. receives $25 million a year.\u201dMr. Stephenson may well be right about the promise of the Time Warner deal. But judging by the 5 percent loss in AT&T shares since the deal was announced, it seems that quite a few of his shareholders aren\u2019t sticking around to find out.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Salesforce Shareholders Besiege Possible Twitter Deal", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The investor pressure began building on Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, two weeks ago.The investors made their concerns known to Mr. Benioff. In emails and other communications, the shareholders told the chief executive and Salesforce\u2019s investor relations team that they disapproved of a tie-up with Twitter.The effort was led by Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund firm that is Salesforce\u2019s largest shareholder, with about 14 percent of the company. At least one Fidelity portfolio manager emailed Salesforce about the deal being a bad idea, according to people briefed on the correspondence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the communications were private. Other Salesforce investors, including hedge funds, said they would sell the company\u2019s stock, according to two people with knowledge of the communications.\u201cI read all of your notes, you probably know that,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cI also read your emails. And as I digest all of that information, this is actually the No. 1 thing that has been on my mind. In some cases we have been unusually surprised and we have had to do a reset.\u201dThe pushback offers a window into how big investors can exert pressure on would-be deals behind the scenes. Salesforce is particularly vulnerable to what its large institutional investors think because the unprofitable online software company relies heavily on its stock to make acquisitions and pay employee compensation. As a result, the company needs to keep investors happy for its share price to continue going up.Salesforce declined to comment, as did a representative from Fidelity.It is unclear whether or not Mr. Benioff will continue to pursue Twitter. One person involved in the negotiations said that, for now, Salesforce\u2019s shareholders have halted a potential deal.For Twitter, that would mean that its options have narrowed. The social media company had been talking to potential buyers, as well as considering divestitures and layoffs to focus its business. But companies including Google, Apple and Disney are not interested in buying Twitter, people at those companies said, and Salesforce appeared to be one of the last interested parties.Even though Salesforce is a 17-year-old company, in some ways Mr. Benioff still runs it like a start-up, making promises of boundless growth and equity riches for all employees.If shareholders were to sell and drive down the value of Salesforce stock, that would hurt Mr. Benioff\u2019s deal-making capabilities. Salesforce needs to aggressively acquire companies to keep its revenue growing as its core business, customer-management software, slows, said Mark Moerdler, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.The recent investor pushback puts Mr. Benioff, who has long been a shareholder darling, in an unfamiliar position. Salesforce shares have zoomed higher since pricing at $11 in its initial public offering to around $71 now, as investors clamored to own a piece of one of the first companies to successfully convince big enterprises to rent out software that is stored in the cloud, rather than own it and run it themselves.But after the Twitter news broke, investors pushed the stock down by as much as 8 percent over the next 10 days.On Wednesday, during Mr. Benioff\u2019s investor meeting where he sometimes gazed upon his own image projected on an enormous screen above the crowd, he bristled at times over the shareholder reaction.\u201cWell, what about this one deal right here!\u201d Mr. Benioff said, using a shrill and mocking voice to imitate one shareholder email. \u201cI mean the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails are so extreme I am like, Jesus, do they really think that we would do a deal at that level?\u201dMr. Benioff emphasized that he is a careful deal maker who is sensitive to what any acquisition might mean for Salesforce\u2019s shareholders, which include large, influential institutions like T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Sands Capital Management and Harbor Funds. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in running the company like a lone wolf,\u201d he said, pointing to his board members who sat in the front row.But he still left the door open, ever so slightly, for future acquisitions. \u201cWe believe innovation happens not just in Salesforce, but in other companies,\u201d he said.Katie Benner reported from San Francisco and Leslie Picker from New York.

{"Headline": "Yahoo Said to Have Aided U.S. Email Surveillance by Adapting Spam Filter", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byA system intended to scan emails for child pornography and spam helped Yahoo satisfy a secret court order requiring it to search for messages containing a computer \u201csignature\u201d tied to the communications of a state-sponsored terrorist organization, several people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Two government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Justice Department obtained an individualized order from a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court last year. Yahoo was barred from disclosing the matter.To comply, Yahoo customized an existing scanning system for all incoming email traffic, which also looks for malware, according to one of the officials and to a third person familiar with Yahoo\u2019s response, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.With some modifications, the system stored and made available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation a copy of any messages it found that contained the digital signature. The collection is no longer taking place, those two people said.The order was unusual because it involved the systematic scanning of all Yahoo users\u2019 emails rather than individual accounts; several other tech companies said they had not encountered such a demand.News of the order has opened a new chapter in a public debate over the trade-offs between security needs and privacy rights that has cast a spotlight on the sometimes cooperative, sometimes antagonistic relationship between Silicon Valley companies and the United States government.By contrast, Yahoo cooperated with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order, although the technical burden on the company appears to have been significantly lighter than the one the F.B.I. placed on Apple.The two government officials familiar with the matter said the digital signature Yahoo was ordered to look for last year was individually approved in an order issued by a judge, who was persuaded that there was probable cause to believe that it was uniquely used by a foreign power.Investigators had learned that agents of the foreign terrorist organization were communicating using Yahoo\u2019s email service and with a method that involved a \u201chighly unique\u201d identifier or signature, but the investigators did not know which specific email accounts those agents were using, the officials said.The Reuters article reported that in response to a \u201cbroad demand\u201d from the government, Yahoo had \u201csecretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers\u2019 incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials.\u201dAccording to the government officials, Yahoo was served with an individualized court order to look only for code uniquely used by the foreign terrorist organization. Two sources, including one of the officials, portrayed it as adapting the scanning systems that it already had in place to comply with that order rather than building a brand-new capability. The other official did not comment on the technology. The officials did not name the terrorist organization.Asked on Wednesday about the information obtained by The New York Times, Suzanne Philion, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said the company had nothing further to say. Earlier in the day, the company said in a statement that the Reuters article was \u201cmisleading.\u201d\u201cWe narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure,\u201d the Yahoo statement said. \u201cThe mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems.\u201dRichard Kolko, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, declined in a statement to discuss specific foreign intelligence collection techniques, but referred to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.\u201cUnder FISA, activity is narrowly focused on specific foreign intelligence targets and does not involve bulk collection or use generic key words or phrases,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States only uses signals intelligence for national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary people.\u201dThere is no engineering limitation preventing technology companies from using their spam and child pornography filtering systems to search email traffic for other sorts of digital signatures, said Hany Farid, chairman of the computer science department at Dartmouth, who helped develop the child pornography scanning system with Microsoft.But the use of that technology to carry out an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to search for a digital signature used by a foreign power is rare, and one of the officials portrayed it as innovative.\u201cThis is another example of how the government is pushing secretly novel or innovative interpretations of surveillance law\u201d to conduct wiretapping in broader ways than the public realizes, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society.The government has not released any intelligence court opinion explaining how the judge interpreted FISA to authorize such surveillance. Although Congress in June 2015 enacted a law that required the government to make public novel and significant rulings by the court, the order to Yahoo appears to have predated that legislation, the USA Freedom Act, by several months.Yahoo has an inconsistent record with meeting government data demands. In 2007, the company settled a lawsuit related to allegations that it helped the Chinese government crack down on journalists by passing along their Yahoo emails.But that year, the firm fought a legal battle, then secret, before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, challenging a mandate that it turn over, without a warrant, emails from user accounts the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency said belonged to noncitizens abroad who had been targeted for surveillance.Yahoo was not able to clarify details of the Reuters article on Tuesday because orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are secret by law, and an increasing number of other government requests come with gag orders that prohibit tech companies from even acknowledging they exist.Dozens of other companies have filed briefs in support of Microsoft. In its brief, Apple said it had received about 590 gag orders, of unlimited or indefinite durations, in the first eight months of 2016.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Follow Charlie Savage and Nicole Perlroth on Twitter @charlie_savage and @nicoleperlroth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should We See Everything a Cop Sees?", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "FeatureBody cameras have been promoted as a solution to police misconduct. But the strange two-year saga of Seattle shows just how complicated total transparency can be.Supported byO\u2019Toole\u2019s eighth-floor conference room, which has views of City Hall and Elliott Bay and the snow-capped Olympic Mountains, was packed with top police and city officials. All eyes were on a lawyer from the city attorney\u2019s office named Mary Perry. A former naval officer in her 60s, Perry was small and soft-spoken and favored pearls, and she was the city\u2019s unrivaled expert in the seemingly mundane intricacies of the state\u2019s Public Records Act. She was briefing the room on the potential fallout from a landmark case she had just argued and lost before the Washington State Supreme Court. The case stemmed from a series of public-records requests by a reporter for the local television station KOMO, Tracy Vedder, who began filing them after the same high-profile incidents that would lead to the consent decree. She asked for user manuals to the department\u2019s new system of in-car dashboard cameras, then for lists of dashcam recordings, then for some of the recordings themselves. After the department denied every one of them, Vedder sued it for violating the Public Records Act.The act, which dates to 1972, when governments ran on paper and our modern torrent of electronic data was unimaginable, is one of the strongest in the country. Washington State agencies cannot deny requests for records because the requester is anonymous or the request is too broad, nor can they deny requests simply in order to protect an individual\u2019s privacy; instead, agencies must redact only the details deemed sensitive under state code \u2014 for example, some addresses, sometimes the face of a minor \u2014 and disclose the rest. Before the court, Perry had argued that a different law, the state\u2019s Privacy Act, which allows departments to withhold recordings until related criminal or civil cases are resolved, should take precedent and the Seattle Police should be allowed to broadly deny Vedder\u2019s requests until the relevant statute of limitations ran out. The court disagreed.As Perry now told Wagers and the officials gathered in the chief\u2019s conference room, Seattle and other departments across the state were operating in a new reality. Only in cases under actual, pending litigation could the police withhold video footage from the people. This presented several problems. The first was logistical and financial: Seattle Police were sitting on more than 1.5 million individual dashcam and surveillance videos, or about 300,000 hours and 350 terabytes total. Before releasing any footage, someone in the department had to review and redact it in accordance with the specific privacy exemptions the state code did have. The process was manual, a painstaking, frame-by-frame ordeal. By one estimate, 169 people would have to work for a year just to fulfill the department\u2019s existing video requests, and the department added 2,000 new video clips daily. Perry feared that the new flood of data, especially but not exclusively video, could bankrupt Seattle if someone requested it all. \u201cIt\u2019s like being on the Titanic,\u201d she later told me, \u201cand you\u2019ve got a teaspoon to bail.\u201dThe second problem was privacy. Dashcam videos were already a concern, but Seattle had also been considering using body cameras. In fact, the Police Department was now preparing a small pilot program involving a dozen officers from a single precinct to test the hardware. Any footage that bodycams gathered, Perry warned, would also be subject to the Public Records Act. The department would have even more video to manage and release, but most worrisome was how fundamentally different, and more intrusive, this video would be. Unlike dashcams, bodycams, which are attached to an officer\u2019s uniform or purpose-built glasses, can go into homes and hotel rooms. Unlike dashcams, their default view during an arrest, or during a simple conversation with a victim or witness or informant, is an intimate close-up. Many people think of body cameras as a tool for police accountability, but the primary subject of their surveillance isn\u2019t the police \u2014 it\u2019s the public.\u201cI believe in open government, I really do,\u201d Perry told me, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think people have really wrapped their heads around all the implications.\u201d If the bodycam pilot was deemed a success, and the city expanded the program to the rest of its 850 front-line officers, all of them now walking surveillance cameras, what then?Wagers left the meeting stunned. \u201cI like to think I can walk into a room, take a complex problem and break it down into its component parts,\u201d he says. \u201cThis meeting, I walked out thinking: Wow, this is complicated. This is messy.\u201dClemans lived with his parents in a small, suburban house south of Seattle, sleeping in a bedroom decorated with a picture of the Space Shuttle and a free calendar from a local Chinese buffet. His bed was a mattress on the floor, and his electronic devices \u2014 computers, radios, keyboards \u2014 dominated the room. Clemans, who has sandy blond hair and wide blue eyes and walks with the stooped gait of someone who spends a lot of time in front of a computer, taught himself to code HTML at age 8. Home-schooled as a teenager to escape bullying, he was editing web pages for a hospital, where a friend from his parents\u2019 church worked, by 14. He taught himself basic JavaScript and CSS, and he learned the programming language Python after he showed up at a mathematics lab at the University of Washington and offered to volunteer in exchange for high-school credit. \u201cI just went there,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m very impulsive, and I don\u2019t like rules.\u201dDay 1 of his record attempt was a fluke. He was in the vicinity of the Space Needle and bored, so he took the elevator to the top. Something about being able to see the whole city at once captivated him. The next day, Clemans bought a $50 season pass. He learned of the previous record \u2014 60 consecutive days \u2014 and vowed to beat it. He came daily by bus and foot, an hourlong commute, often arriving early and staying late into the night.The Space Needle blooms out of the grounds of the 1962 World\u2019s Fair, a site north of downtown that is now known as Seattle Center. It is 605 feet tall. You enter through a plaza choked with Korean tourists and Andean flute musicians and Marine marching bands, then shuffle up a ramp to the east, above the gift shop and not far from a lineup of idling tour buses. Before handing over your ticket, you are asked to pose for a photo, then board one of three external elevators. When the elevator starts its ascent and the city comes into view, the people inside either fall silent or gasp out loud.From the observation deck, you can see mountains in four directions, water in two and, just to the south, a forest of skyscrapers. You also see a tangle of cranes; a city increasingly built by the likes of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates is booming. There are parks, markets, hidden gardens, tiny houses, tiny cars. Bulk carriers glide into port. Seaplanes land and take off. Helicopters float by. The lights of the radio towers on adjacent Queen Anne Hill, a seeming stone\u2019s throw away, blink on and off. Inside, a giant digital wall displays a shifting collage of visitor selfies, along with tourists\u2019 names and cities of origins. A joystick controls a high-definition camera mounted somewhere on the tower, allowing anyone to pan and zoom in on the unsuspecting people below, like a drone operator.The Space Needle became Clemans\u2019s office and his sanctuary. He brought his laptop, stuffing it into his backpack along with a toothbrush and toothpaste and self-help and business books, and got online with a wireless card. He exercised by walking laps around the outer deck. He offered to take tourists\u2019 photos, posed with them and answered their questions. He wrote code and blog entries. He stared at the city. It made sense from up there. It had patterns. Even its famously chaotic traffic had a predictable ebb and flow.\u201cThe sun is shining!\u201d reads one blog entry. \u201cI can see Rainier. People are happy. It doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d When he claimed the record on Day 61, he appeared on the evening news. He said he would keep going for a full year, then announced on his blog that he would go for even longer \u2014 1,825 days in a row. He began wearing a black jacket emblazoned with the words \u201cRecord Holder\u201d in block letters and spending more of his time talking to tourists, meeting people from all over the world. \u201cIt was an enjoyable eight-hour visit,\u201d he wrote in another entry. \u201cI finished reading \u2018Personal MBA\u2019 and memorized the five parts of a business and the 12 ways to create value.\u201dSome days he wrote about his attempts to stick to a routine. Others he dreamed up fanciful lists. \u201cWhen I own the Space Needle in 2034,\u201d he wrote on Day 107, \u201cI will do the following twenty things.\u201d One: \u201cI will sell tickets for $200 to the very top ... for $600 you can also hang off the side.\u201d Two: \u201cEach day the Space Needle will fly a flag. Most days the flag will be the photo of a random lucky guest.\u201d Four: \u201cFor $500 you and your spouse can sleep in an elevator.\u201d Sixteen: \u201cI will pay French Spider Man Alain Robert $10 million to climb a leg of the Space Needle once every day for a year.\u201d Eighteen: \u201cI will give the security bag checkers X-ray vision glasses.\u201d Nineteen: \u201cI will personally lead a walking tour for people struggling with suicidal thoughts.\u201d\u201cThis post is for me,\u201d reads the next day\u2019s entry. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to meet my goals like reading and writing computer code four hours a day. However, I\u2019m really good at meeting this one particular goal, going to the Space Needle every day. I\u2019ve been able to do so for 108 days straight for one simple reason: Going to the Space Needle everyday is more important than anything else. I have to do it. So when I\u2019m trying to achieve a goal, I just have to remember it\u2019s more important than anything else.\u201dAfter almost 160 days, Clemans had an altercation with a Space Needle employee. Before he could get on the elevator, she asked him to pose for a photo in the booth at the top of the ramp, just like the tourists. He had been asked to do it a hundred times. It was senseless, and it enraged him. \u201cI blew up at her,\u201d he says. Just like that, the world-record holder was banned from the Space Needle for life.Adrift, he disappeared from public view. He worked on code, dabbled in robotics and considered a career as a paramedic. He was pulled over for reckless driving and hired a lawyer known for his successful dashcam requests and, he claims, the video didn\u2019t entirely match the police report, so the court reduced the charges. He met a woman on OKCupid, getting her attention by suggesting that they go build sand castles together.One day in September 2014, Clemans was with his girlfriend when he read on his laptop that KOMO had prevailed over Seattle in the state\u2019s Supreme Court in June: Police video had to be released on demand. The Justice Department had just started its investigation of Ferguson, but Clemans\u2019s concerns were closer to home. KOMO posted only snippets. \u201cI was just mad that they were getting all this video but not making it all available,\u201d he recalls. He turned to his girlfriend and told her, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do police data as a hobby.\u201dSome police departments started sending videos immediately, some proposed installment plans and some announced they were delaying their bodycam programs. In Poulsbo, a town of 9,500 people across the Puget Sound from Seattle, the mayor desperately emailed her local state legislator and asked him to do something about the cameras and the Public Records Act.Unlike its smaller counterparts, the Seattle department did not give its unknown nemesis any footage. Clemans responded by programming a bot. It scraped the department\u2019s website for new case numbers, then automatically requested the corresponding police reports, firing off emails 10 times a day. The more the authorities denied him, the more his appetite grew. He asked the University of Washington for all its records dating back to \u201cthe formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.\u201d He filed requests with another 60 state agencies, demanding every email they had ever sent \u2014 600 million messages in all, according to a state estimate. The Department of Agriculture informed Clemans it would need 132 years to complete the job.Wagers decided to try a different approach. At Rutgers, he had been schooled in the reformist ideals of community policing. Like the longtime New York City police commissioner William J. Bratton \u2014 whose work when he led the Los Angeles Police Department was the subject of Wagers\u2019s Ph.D. dissertation and who, as it happened, was Chief O\u2019Toole\u2019s boss when he led the Massachusetts Metropolitan District Commission Police \u2014 Wagers liked to quote Sir Robert Peel, the founder of London\u2019s bobbies, who in the early 19th century established an Anglo-Saxon tradition of policing distinct from the militaristic us-versus-them Continental model. Peel taught that good policing was about building and holding public trust. \u201cIt\u2019s about engagement,\u201d Wagers told me. \u201cWe respond. We engage. It sounds kind of trite, but it\u2019s a different way of thinking.\u201d His new plan for dealing with Clemans, he says, \u201cwas like any other response to the community: We engage.\u201dOn Twitter, Wagers followed @PoliceVideo, an account that then belonged to the still-anonymous requester. The next day, the account tweeted at Wagers, asking him why the department was giving PowerPoint presentations to city leaders about the coming bodycam pilot program but not sharing the slides with the public. \u201cScrew it,\u201d @PoliceVideo tweeted when Wagers was too slow to respond. \u201cPutting in the request now. Wish you guys would just publish this stuff.\u201dBut Wagers offered to \u201cdo you one better,\u201d and he tweeted a phone number. \u201cHere\u2019s my cell,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI give it out to everyone. Call me & happy to answer questions.\u201d It was 6:57 p.m. One minute later, Wagers\u2019s phone rang. It was Clemans. He still didn\u2019t give his real name \u2014 he had been overwhelmed by media interest in his transparency fight \u2014 but readily accepted when Wagers invited him to lunch.The next day, Clemans met Wagers and Mary Perry at Police Headquarters. They ordered a pizza. Perry tried to explain that it was technically impossible for the department to release all its archived video anytime soon. Clemans countered with an idea he had. He called it \u201coverredaction.\u201d If the system was paralyzed by the need for frame-by-frame redactions, he wondered, why not automatically redact everything? That is, instead of jockeying with requesters, painstakingly reviewing each video, blurring out the protected parts and burning the results onto DVD after DVD, the department could just use software to lightly blur everything, then proactively publish each blurred video online. Push, not pull. Viewers would be able to make out enough to know if footage merited a specific records request and a more precise manual redaction, and they would presumably ask for only the segments they thought they needed; and no longer would the department be buried under its own video. He agreed to drop his mass requests if the department would try it out.In fact, Clemans said, he had stayed up all night writing a very rough version of the overredaction code and printed it out. He showed them what he had done.The cameras that Seattle planned to use in its pilot program \u2014 which would be worn on patrol by a dozen officers in its East Precinct, their video uploaded to a server at the end of every shift \u2014 were from two local companies: Vievu, which was founded by a former Seattle SWAT officer, Steve Ward, in 2007, and its main rival, Axon, a division of Taser that is responsible for the reliable spike in the parent company\u2019s stock after major police shootings. Together the two companies dominate a market that analysts believe will soon be worth a billion dollars a year, with much of the value coming from software and storage. Both Vievu and Axon offered bundles that paired their cameras with editing programs that ran in the cloud, processing them on computers maintained by Amazon Web Services or Microsoft\u2019s Azure, which are also Seattle-area companies.But neither bundle came cheap. The millions of dollars that major police departments were beginning to spend on bodycam contracts were millions they weren\u2019t spending on better training or new officers, and neither company had come close to perfecting automated redaction, without which Seattle Police would simply be collecting more footage without any better way to share it with requesters. Seattle needed an end-to-end software fix, Wagers realized, and Seattle was also a city full of programmers. So the day before the pilot program started, he also tried another experiment: With help from Clemans, he held the department\u2019s first-ever hackathon.The overflow crowd of 80 people was \u201cstraight out of central casting,\u201d Wagers says. \u201cSkinny jeans. Hoodies. People who had sued the department. People I know I\u2019d seen on the protest line the previous week.\u201d Clemans demonstrated his overredaction program: the world as if filmed through a beer glass, fuzzy but familiar, in which it was still possible (too possible, some worried) to tell who was tall and who was short and who was male and who was female and who was black and who was white and who was running and who was chasing. It was well received, and several programmers in the room offered to help Clemans improve the algorithm. But Clemans, volunteering his time and his skills, would be the linchpin. The pilot would run for six months, and if it went well, 12 officers would soon become 850.The next day, on Dec. 20, as TV stations aired reports on the department\u2019s innovative approach to transparency, the bodycam pilot began. Clemans and the department soon developed a rhythm: Some of the videos coming in from the East Precinct were saved to U.S.B. sticks, and Clemans, unpaid and on food stamps at the time, came downtown by bus to pick them up. He processed them on his bedroom computer, tweaking the overredaction program as he went, trying to code in the right balance of concealment and transparency.I watched more than a dozen hours of the video. There were no shootings. Most of it was routine police work, which may be why it was so disturbing to see online. In one set of videos that Clemans posted, a well-dressed white mother of two is pulled over late on a Friday night. She is composed until she fails a sobriety test. Then she pleads for a chance to call the babysitter \u2014 according to Facebook, where I found her because the video also revealed her name, she has a young daughter and younger son \u2014 before breaking down in loud screams and sobs in the back of a patrol car.Elsewhere in the state, also on YouTube, a body camera captures the inside of a woman\u2019s home as she explains how her accused stalker has been ignoring a restraining order. A father pleads with two officers to check in on his adult daughter, who he says has intellectual disabilities and has become involved with a man he believes is dangerous. Two college roommates accuse each other of theft and intimidation in their living room. A white woman apparently overdosing on meth, who cries out that she\u2019s pregnant, is restrained and given medical attention. A middle-aged black man opens his apartment door for a group of officers who inform him that he has been screaming all night. Slurring his words, he admits he\u2019s suffering from PTSD and that he has a history of heroin use. He refuses to let them take him to the hospital. He refuses even when an officer reminds him that he has been screaming like this off and on for a month. But now you can hear the fear in his voice. \u201cAm I screaming right now?\u201d he wonders.One of the first bodycam videos that Clemans uploaded shows a young black woman sitting on a bed in a hotel room. The officer wearing the camera is a disembodied voice but for a fleeting glimpse of his face and torso in a mirror. His manner is professional and sympathetic, and he says he doesn\u2019t want to arrest her. \u201cWill I be charged?\u201d she asks. \u201cLet\u2019s get to that later,\u201d he says. He asks her if she would be willing to talk to a counselor. \u201cSo you can get some other kind of job so you don\u2019t have to do this anymore, O.K.?\u201d he says. \u201cOur ultimate goal is that there is no prostitution, O.K.?\u201dHe begins filling out a form \u2014 Escort Face Sheet \u2014 on a clipboard. She answers every question, sharing the intimate details of her life. She tells him about her relationship with her boyfriend, her clashes with her strict father, her time as a runaway, her drift from strip clubs to Backpage.com escort ads, her few regular johns. She claims she\u2019s new to this work. She explains that she charges per hour or half-hour. She has a dog, she says. She can rely on her parents in times of need, she says. She gives him their street address. She gives him her full name. She shares her private email address and phone number. She shares all this with the camera too.When the interview is done, she asks about it. Is the image clear? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear, yeah,\u201d the officer says, but \u201cif the press wanted it, we can redact faces \u2014 can blur out the faces and whatnot.\u201d Body cameras are new to his city, and he doesn\u2019t know that what he just told her isn\u2019t entirely true. A lawyer will decide that the video is in no part exempt from the Public Records Act, and the officer will later be shocked to see it on YouTube. He will try and fail to have it taken down. The woman in the video is easy to find in her other internet life. She\u2019s on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, where she chats with friends and posts images of dresses and animals and nail polish. You can visit her parents\u2019 house on Google Street View.Body cameras can be knocked loose when the police rush a suspect, as the world learned in July when Alton Sterling was killed in Baton Rouge, La. Officers can likewise forget or claim to forget to turn the cameras on in time to record an incident in full, as protesters saw after they forced the police to release the inconclusive, partial bodycam footage of Keith Lamont Scott\u2019s shooting in Charlotte, N.C. But for slow-moving scenes like this one, in the hotel room with the young woman who seems to trust the officer with her privacy, the technology works almost too well. Bryce Newell, an information-science researcher now at Tilburg University in the Netherlands who did his fieldwork in Washington, interviewing Clemans and Wagers and riding along with officers as they tested their new bodycams, gave a clever name to the problem they posed in a society demanding transparency: \u201ccollateral visibility.\u201dOne of the first people revealed to the public by Clemans\u2019s transparency quest was Clemans himself. His mass records requests had drawn the interest of local reporters, who started filing requests of their own to the Police Department, seeking his identity. After they got his phone number, Clemans pre-emptively outed himself, embracing the role of tech seer. He published a letter in January 2015 explaining his mission on the website of the Seattle Privacy Coalition. \u201cI pushed the envelope,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso we as a society can once and for all address accurately recording of the truth, who should have access to the truth and what we are to do with the truth.\u201d He told the local news site Crosscut that the Public Records Act did need to be amended. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change until it becomes a massive problem,\u201d he said. He told Seattle Weekly that his experience with police videos had convinced him that certain things shouldn\u2019t be made public. He left the footage on YouTube precisely to make that point. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are going to deal with this until they have an emotional reaction,\u201d he said.Wagers stood before the crowd, about a hundred people in all, and gave a brief technical overview of the pilot program. Then an officer from East Precinct demonstrated how the bodycam worked, briefly filming the crowd as he did so. After that, one commissioner, David Keenan, a local lawyer, asked a group of waiting panelists to state, one after the other, when, exactly, the cameras should be on, and to answer a simple question about the evidence they create: Why do we want it? That is, whom does it serve? \u201cShould it only be used if there\u2019s an accusation against a police officer?\u201d he asked. \u201cShould it be used by criminal investigators and by defendants and by prosecutors?\u201dThe growing national welter of contradictory state laws and department policies signals that there is no settled answer. Some allow officers to view it before writing their reports. (That was the central issue earlier this month in Portland, Ore., that caused protesters to storm its City Hall, where police officers met them with bursts of pepper spray.) Some do not. Some treat all bodycam videos as public records; some limit their release. Some mandate a quick deletion of police video; some have no requirements to delete it at all. Some restrict the use of facial recognition software; most allow it. A technology meant for one purpose, once unleashed, is soon used for many others.One commissioner, Jay Hollingsworth of the Mohegan tribe, the chairman of the John T. Williams Organizing Committee, named for a hard-of-hearing Native American whose 2010 shooting was partly captured on dashcam, answered Keenan\u2019s \u201cwhen\u201d question simply: Bodycams should always be on. To his right, another commissioner, Jennifer Shaw, the deputy director of the A.C.L.U. of Washington, said that she agreed in theory but that her organization supported the cameras only if they were used exclusively for police accountability. Next, Ron Smith, a detective who then headed the Seattle Police Officers\u2019 Guild, said that he was also in favor of bodycams because he believed they would exonerate officers from complaints. But the cameras went into homes and on lunch and bathroom breaks, and officers absolutely had to be able to switch them on and off.At the end of the table were two activists, Marissa Johnson and Dan Bash. Johnson later became nationally known for leaping onstage at a Bernie Sanders rally, claiming the candidate\u2019s microphone and telling him he needed to do more to acknowledge the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThis conversation about bodycams is a complete and utter farce,\u201d she said. Forget the policy details. She did not consent to being recorded at all. She did not trust the police to do the right thing with the footage. Most of all, she did not trust prosecutors to use it to prosecute officers. \u201cWhy do I need a home video of my abuse that\u2019s going to be filmed by my oppressor?\u201d she asked.An uncomfortable silence filled the room. Then Hollingsworth announced that the other panelists had made him change his mind, leaving the two employees of the Police Department, Wagers and Smith, two white men, the only people onstage who clearly supported bodycams. The mood became tense, and members of the crowd interrupted the next speaker and soon assumed control of the room, taking turns denouncing police brutality and glaring at Smith, who was eventually escorted to his car by another officer.Three weeks later, the commission, the voice of the people, called for Seattle to delay full deployment of bodycams until the state law could be rewritten. \u201cThis is a new technology,\u201d the commission said in a news release, \u201cwhich may have unintended consequences.\u201dIn an essay published shortly after the White House announced its $75 million in bodycam funding in 2014, two authors of the study, Barak Ariel and Alex Sutherland, hypothesized that it was not cameras alone that drove the positive results; it was the fact that before every interaction with a citizen, officers in the trial were required to announce that they were recording. There may have been a \u201cself-awareness effect\u201d: Both parties were reminded at the moment of contact that they were under surveillance and that they should behave accordingly. One question was whether the effect would hold up if officers did not announce the cameras\u2019 presence. Another was whether it would hold up when the cameras lost their novelty.Ariel and Sutherland also worried about anyone basing decisions on a single study, which, no matter how rigorous, could well be a fluke, \u201cthe statistical equivalent of \u2018luck,\u2019\u2009\u201d they wrote. The Rialto sample was small. The notable drop in citizen complaints, for instance, was from 28 in the yearlong period before the study to 3 while it was underway. At least 40 reasonably scientific studies have followed Rialto, but many, according to a recent survey carried out by George Mason University, have yet to be published.Rialto suggests a drop in the use of force. A study from Arizona suggests a drop in arrests but a rise in citations. A separate Arizona study, along with one from London, suggests a rise in arrests. When Temple University researchers recently sifted through a Washington Post database of 986 deadly shootings of civilians by police in 2015, they found that when officers wore body cameras, civilians were 3.64 percent more likely to die. The increase was more pronounced, 3.75 percent, in the deaths of African-Americans and Hispanics and a barely measurable 0.67 percent in the deaths of Caucasians and Asians. They hypothesized that a different kind of self-awareness was at work: Officers, aware of their bodycams and more certain their use of deadly force would be seen as justified, were less likely to hesitate.After Rialto, Ariel and Sutherland set out to replicate their influential study on a much larger scale, collaborating with eight large and small police departments covering two million citizens in the United States and Britain. Their resulting analysis of 2.2 million officer hours, published this May, seems to validate their concerns that Rialto offered an incomplete picture. It found that police use of force actually went up by an astonishing 71 percent when officers could turn their cameras on and off at will and went down (by 37 percent) only when they recorded nearly every interaction with the public from start to finish. A second analysis of the same data, published late last month, supports Rialto\u2019s finding that citizen complaints drop significantly, almost to zero, when bodycams are present, while underscoring the authors\u2019 warning that more research is needed to understand how and why and under what conditions. \u201cIt may be that in some places it\u2019s a bad idea to use body-worn cameras,\u201d Ariel said in announcing the May results, \u201cand the only way you can find that out is to keep doing these tests in different kinds of places.\u201dThe videos didn\u2019t shake the local opposition to bodycams, and they didn\u2019t meet the standards of the state Public Records Act \u2014 if asked, Seattle would have to provide more precisely redacted versions \u2014 but they met a national need for positive news about the police. The YouTube channel was featured on the \u201cToday Show,\u201d and the department\u2019s innovation was the subject of coverage, some skeptical and some not, by The Guardian, Vice News, \u201cMarketplace,\u201d \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d and The New York Times. The tech press couldn\u2019t get enough. One well-reported article in the online publication Backchannel called Clemans \u201cthe body-cam hacker who schooled the police.\u201dWagers began receiving calls and email from departments around the country. The future of policing, he saw, was now more than ever reliant on what technology the police could afford to buy from companies like those that built modern Seattle. He pledged that Clemans\u2019s code, once completed, would be open-source and freely shared so that smaller agencies, which didn\u2019t have the staff to handle video-records requests, let alone the money for bundled bodycam contracts, could stay on the cutting edge. In one overredaction test, the department processed 2,400 videos in three hours on rented Amazon Web Services computers in the cloud, a task that would have gummed up the public-disclosure unit of the Seattle Police for weeks had the files been redacted manually. The computer rental cost the department $1.20 \u2014 40 cents an hour \u2014 Wagers marveled. To meet the demands of the Public Records Act, all Clemans needed to do was get his algorithm to redact only faces and other private details, rather than the full frame.Clemans was now an employee: The department had offered him a six-month contract at $22.60 an hour. But when the pilot program ended in July, and the question of whether to expand it loomed, he still had not perfected his code. He was trying to solve a problem, mostly by himself, that teams of professional engineers at Taser and its rivals have yet to fully crack. Distracted, he noticed other inefficiencies at Police Headquarters and he felt increasingly compelled to fix them. After visiting the understaffed 911 center, then in the news for its slow response times, he came up with a new idea: a program that automatically highlighted the most pressing calls, allowing dispatchers to be more efficient. But the captain in charge of the 911 center didn\u2019t welcome his intrusion, and he belittled the idea at a tense late-August meeting brokered by their superiors. Clemans, by his own admission, \u201cgot really mad.\u201d He swore at the captain. He yelled until he had to be escorted from the building. And just like that, in an echo of his Space Needle blowup, he was exiled from headquarters. He made a threat on his way out: \u201cI\u2019m going to P.D.R.\u201d \u2014 public-disclosure request \u2014 \u201cthe [expletive] out of you,\u201d he shouted.In September 2015, when Seattle won a $600,000 Justice Department grant to expand the bodycam program to the rest of the police force, which the mayor pledged to more than match, Clemans wasn\u2019t there to help celebrate. He was working remotely, back in his bedroom or hunched over a laptop at the Starbucks he now frequented on the 40th floor of Columbia Center, the tallest building in town, where the views were stunning and free.Days after the grant announcement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch came to Seattle to declare it a national model for police reform. The federal monitor overseeing the consent decree, who had previously lauded the overredaction experiment when calling for rapid deployment of bodycams, now praised the department\u2019s systematic approach to investigating any use of force \u2014 a significant change from the cursory reporting of the past. Wagers, meanwhile, was helping Chief O\u2019Toole to select his replacement. He had by then been in Seattle and away from his wife and children for more than a year.On Oct. 29, 2015, a week after Wagers announced he was leaving the department, Clemans texted in his own resignation. He no longer believed the department could ever truly be transparent on its own, he told me. His time inside the department, far from co-opting him, had weaponized him after his blowup with the 911 captain: He knew even better which records to request. He wrote a new bot capable of sending the department up to 10,000 requests in 24 hours. He asked for 911 records, \u201ctables & columns of all databases,\u201d all front-facing dashcam video from 2014 and \u201call computer codes written by Tim Clemans.\u201d Over the next few days, he piled on, requesting \u201call roll-call notes,\u201d text records from the department\u2019s license-plate scanners, the source codes of key department software and \u201call Outlook calendars of supervisors, managers & command staff.\u201d He also started building a website where he would publish it all, which he called the People\u2019s NSA. He expanded his demands to include every public record in every format \u2014 paper, tape or digital \u2014 the City of Seattle had. He soon asked 39 neighboring cities for the same. By the end of 2015, according to a study on public-records requests he obtained via a public-records request, Clemans had filed 2,272 requests to the Seattle Police Department alone, making him again its No. 1 antagonist. One day at her office, Mary Perry showed me a printout of the latest ones, five pages long. \u201cWe\u2019re being crippled,\u201d she said. Wagers was on his way home, Clemans was making more demands than ever and she was back where she started.Searching for blurred video of a crime down your block may someday be as easy as searching for a restaurant on Google Maps. But a new state law making footage harder to request in bulk \u2014 the Tim Clemans Act, his friends called it \u2014 had just gone into effect thanks to the efforts of Poulsbo, the small town that had contacted its state representative. Clemans had also been studying YouTube\u2019s privacy policy, and he would soon decide to remove the videos he posted there from public view. For now, though, he wore his own D.I.Y. bodycam, a cellphone strapped to a chest harness, and was streaming live to the internet as he followed the protesters and the police on a borrowed bicycle.The protesters gathered outside the department\u2019s East Precinct. An old man, homeless, busking below a mural, quickly collected his things before any violence could break out. But none did. According to the judge who would preside over the latest consent-decree hearing a few weeks later, notably saying the words \u201cblack lives matter\u201d from the bench, the department was making steady strides toward an exit from federal oversight: Its de-escalation tactics were a national model, he said, and its use of force was substantially down. He never mentioned bodycams.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When You Hear the Margin of Error Is Plus or Minus 3 Percent, Think 7 Instead", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported bySurvey Says?If 54 percent of people support Hillary Clinton, the survey estimate might be as high as 57 percent or as low as 51 percent, but it is unlikely to be 49 percent. This truism of modern polling, heralded as one of the great success stories of statistics, is included in textbooks and taught in college classes, including our own.But the real-world margin of error of election polls is not three percentage points. It is about twice as big.The implication? Even if you see a poll in early November that has Donald J. Trump up by three points or Mrs. Clinton up by five, you should still not be so sure who is going to win the election.What explains this big gap between the stated and observed error rates? All the polls we analyzed were conducted during the final three weeks of the campaign, by which time any changes in aggregate public opinion were very small, so the disparity is not simply driven by changes in sentiment as an election progresses.Let\u2019s start with the stated margin of error, which captures sampling variation: error that occurs because surveys are based on only a subset of the full population of likely voters. Even if this sample of respondents is selected randomly from the full population, it is not a perfect representation of attitudes in the full population. That\u2019s where the usual 3 percent error rate comes from.But the stated margin of error misses other important forms of error. Frame error occurs when there is a mismatch between the people who are possibly included in the poll (the sampling frame) and the true target population.For example, for phone-based surveys, people without phones would never be included in any sample. Of particular import for election surveys, the sampling frame includes many adults who are not likely to vote. Pollsters try to correct for this by using likely-voter screens \u2014 typically asking respondents if they will vote \u2014 but this screen itself can introduce error that can at times be larger than the bias it was intended to correct.Other errors, which we believe are less important in United States election surveys, include effects of survey wording and interviewer bias.All these nonsampling errors show up in two ways. First, polls within a race vary from one another slightly more than one would expect from classical textbook explanations. Second, and most markedly, polls tend to systematically overestimate or underestimate the true answer. Thus, even when many polls are averaged together, the result is biased in favor of one candidate or the other.The accompanying graph shows, for each race, how much the average of all polls in that race differs from the final election outcome. If sampling variation were the only source of error, the polling average would be quite close to the election outcome. Standard theory says the average of this many polls should be within about half a percentage point of the true answer, and that this difference shrinks to zero as more polls are conducted.But, in reality, we find that the polling average can easily be two points off from the final vote share. For any given race, the polls are consistently too high for one of the candidates and too low for the other.One explanation for this nonsampling error, which persists even after averaging many polls, is that most survey organizations make similar assumptions about who will vote, and so Election Day surprises (such as an unexpectedly high turnout of minority or young voters) affect all polls similarly. Likewise, if there is nonresponse bias (for instance, Trump or Clinton supporters being more or less likely to participate in a survey), this too will happen with all polls together.We can measure this error after the fact, but during the campaign it\u2019s hard to identify which candidate has the inflated lead. We do not observe any systematic bias in favor of Democratic or Republican candidates. This makes sense. If we saw this, pollsters would correct for it.Over all, neither party has consistently outperformed the polls, but within a given year the errors are correlated between states. Even if a candidate appears to be trailing slightly in all the swing states, he or she could conceivably end up winning them all.This November, we would not be at all surprised to see Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump beat the state-by-state polling averages by about two percentage points. We just don\u2019t know which one would do it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Daily Report: Microsoft, Ahead in the Cloud", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byBitsQuick: What did you pay last month for your cable, phone, internet, mobile apps or online automobile subscription services? If you flew, what did you pay for that premium boarding, premium seating, premium Wi-Fi/pillow/suitcase status?If you can answer all of those questions with anything like accuracy, stop reading \u2014 you have a firm grip on all the extra costs that are now added to so many purchases.If not, congratulations! You are well on your way to understanding Microsoft\u2019s new business model.Here, as elsewhere, things were not exactly what they seemed, in good ways and bad. Adjusting for inflation, Microsoft shares, about $60.60 apiece in after-hours trading Thursday, will have to rise above $85.09 to be worth more than they were at the peak of the internet bubble.In addition, it\u2019s still hard to say exactly what to make of cloud-computing revenue at Microsoft: Is a customer really paying for access to the kind of advanced hardware and software that is in Microsoft\u2019s cloud, called Azure?Or is the business buying standard Microsoft software applications, like Office, which are now sold in jazzed-up versions that are sold via Azure, as a subscription? To some, that kind of revenue matters less, since people buy Office anyway \u2014 it\u2019s not like Microsoft really did anything new to get this money, the argument runs.Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, speaking after the earnings came out, talked about all the ways he is adding new functions, like artificial intelligence, to those mundane services.A.I. can put the most important emails at the top of the heap, or manage calendar obligations. In other areas, like sales software, cloud-based applications can find the best prospects or help schedule sales calls.Mr. Nadella noted that companies that buy one Azure service frequently take another. As they add them, they also add data, and with more frequent use enable the associated A.I. to do more things, and better (A.I. is basically statistical projection, and with more and varied data, it can do more things.)That means Microsoft can probably start doing any number of clever things, either free or for unseen charges \u2014 extra data storage, more networking or other A.I. services.Pretty soon a piece of software Microsoft sold one time, with some fairly straightforward servicing contracts, will look a lot like those cable bills and airline charges. Only instead of happening in sales to individual consumers, it will happen in a big, widely dispersed corporation.Is that hoodwinking customers? Not really. Companies may actually see more value for their dollars, if the A.I. can make work processes more efficient. And, after all, with some other A.I. it may be possible to audit all these charges.As businesses go, however, it may even be something to admire.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "IBM Is Counting on Its Bet on Watson, and Paying Big Money for It", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byWatson, can you grow into a multibillion-dollar business and become the engine of IBM\u2019s resurgence?IBM is betting its future that the answer is yes. Its campaign to commercialize Watson, the company\u2019s version of artificial intelligence technology, stands out, even during the current A.I. frenzy in the tech industry.Yet industry experts question how quickly IBM can build a business around Watson. \u201cIBM has pursued big, bespoke moonshot initiatives that can take years and are extremely expensive,\u201d said Tom Austin, a research fellow at Gartner. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re swimming upstream with that.\u201dAdapting Watson technology to industries like health care and manufacturing, IBM insists, was always going to be a long-term commitment \u2014 and one that began shortly after Watson beat human champions on the quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d in 2011.But the years of investment and applied-science projects, IBM executives say, are increasingly turning into moneymaking opportunities in sizable markets.\u201cThis is the broad commercialization of Watson in oncology,\u201d said John E. Kelly, a senior vice president who oversees IBM\u2019s research labs and the Watson business.The new genomics service, IBM executives say, is one step in the company\u2019s march to build a so-called ecosystem of corporate partners and software developers that use Watson technology.For a programmer, Watson can provide code that allows a start-up\u2019s software to read and interpret legal documents more easily, for example. For a big company, Watson can provide not just software but also IBM consultants helping a retailer, for example, use the technology to customize marketing and improve customer service.The artificial intelligence marketplace, analysts agree, is primed to grow rapidly. A.I. is also the new arena of high-stakes competition in computing, fueled by big data and innovations in software algorithms.The market \u2014 defined as A.I.-related hardware, software and services \u2014 will surge from $8 billion this year to $47 billion by 2020, predicts IDC, a research firm.Today, the A.I. business, experts say, resembles the internet in the mid-1990s: a thing on its own that eventually will be built into all kinds of products and services. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re headed \u2014 A.I. everywhere,\u201d said Frank Gens, IDC\u2019s chief analyst.All the major technology companies are investing aggressively in A.I. software, including companies beyond IBM like Salesforce, SAP and Oracle that focus on business customers.But consumer internet companies with large cloud computing businesses, analysts say, are most likely to build the equivalent of operating systems for A.I. \u2014 the so-called platforms on which most developers write applications. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are the front-runners.IBM may have a chance to join that group. By 2020, IDC predicts, 60 percent of the A.I. applications will run on the platform of four companies: Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM.IBM needs A.I.-fueled growth more than the others. When the company reports its third-quarter financial results on Monday, analysts expect the recent pattern to continue; its new businesses like Watson, data analytics and cloud computing are growing but not fast enough to outpace the erosion in its traditional hardware, software and services lines. Revenue has declined for 17 consecutive quarters.IBM does not report financial results for Watson separately. But the securities research arm of the Swiss bank UBS estimates that Watson may generate $500 million in revenue this year and could grow rapidly in the years ahead, possibly hitting nearly $6 billion by 2020 and almost $17 billion by 2022.IBM has acquired industry expertise and proprietary data sources, in addition to supplying A.I. platform tools and technology. \u201cIBM has taken a very different approach from Google, Amazon and Microsoft,\u201d said Judith Hurwitz, an independent analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s leveraging data and the knowledge of experts.\u201dIBM first focused on health care, and that business now accounts for two-thirds of the Watson unit\u2019s employment. Three years ago, IBM experts began working with leading medical centers. And it has spent more than $4 billion buying a handful of companies with vast stores of medical data like billing records, patient histories, and X-ray and M.R.I. images. \u201cA.I. machines are only as smart as the data you give them,\u201d Mr. Kelly noted.Watson\u2019s core strength, dating back to the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d competition, is its ability to read and interpret words, known as natural-language processing. Once trained, Watson can digest thousands of documents in minutes.At the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Watson was tested on 1,000 cancer diagnoses made by human experts. In 99 percent of them, Watson recommended the same treatment as the oncologists.In 30 percent of the cases, Watson also found a treatment option the human doctors missed. Some treatments were based on research papers that the doctors had not read \u2014 more than 160,000 cancer research papers are published a year. Other treatment options might have surfaced in a new clinical trial the oncologists had not yet seen announced on the web.But Watson read it all. \u201cHumans enabled by A.I. is the way to go with genomics,\u201d said Dr. Norman E. Sharpless, head of the school\u2019s cancer center.The byline for an article on Monday about IBM\u2019s efforts to commercialize Watson, its artificial intelligence technology, was omitted.

{"Headline": "Fast Times on the Campaign Trail in \u2018Embeds\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byThis month, a group of 20-somethings assembled in Des Moines to sustain themselves on gas station pizza; cover the Faith, Freedom, Family and Fudge Pops Forum; chase a long-shot presidential candidate who irons his own bluejeans; and huddle at a rotating cast of hotel bars each night.But unlike their real-life counterparts, these campaign reporters (\u201cembeds,\u201d in political parlance) were part of a fictional comedy set to debut in January with a six-episode run.At its core, the 30-minute show promises a coming-of-age tale set against the high-pressure backdrop of covering a presidential campaign, all through the eyes of sleep-addled, overly ambitious, sex-hungry reporters whose first job just happens to be helping to the determine the next leader of the free world.Or, \u201cFive young reporters in way over their heads find themselves shaping the future of the country through raucous adventures in an unexpected world of sex, drugs and swing states on the presidential campaign trail,\u201d as the show\u2019s tag line puts it.The average news consumer, she added, doesn\u2019t know just \u201chow salacious some of the behind-the-scenes stories can be.\u201dMr. Conroy recently left his job at Vice News to focus full time on the show as an executive producer and writer, and Mr. Hamby is now head of news at Snapchat, and will not have a formal role on the show going forward.But Mr. Conroy first had the idea for the show in 2010. The two men initially worked in Microsoft Word, and Mr. Conroy bought a book about how to make a television show, which helpfully advised, he recalled, \u201cYour show will never get made.\u201dThe original conceit was focused on an unlikely candidate and his staff as they struggled to appeal to the peculiar mix of social and religious conservatives, as well as earnest farmers and anti-government renegades, who can determine a victory in the Iowa caucus.\u201cAt the time we sort of based it on Chris Christie,\u201d Mr. Conroy said. \u201cWe thought it would be funny if Christie ran for president and had to stump around Iowa.\u201dMr. Conroy paused for a beat, then added with a giggle, \u201cWhich, it turned out, was funny.\u201dUltimately, the duo decided to write what they know. The show focuses on the five young television embeds (three men, two women), a slightly awkward and stilted Republican candidate (the fictional governor of Rhode Island, who certainly seems to resemble Mitt Romney) and the candidate\u2019s Iowa and national press secretaries.As for the (real-life) raucous adventures in sex, drugs and swing states, however? Upon learning about \u201cEmbeds,\u201d Matt Nussbaum, a 24-year-old embed for Politico traveling the country with Donald J. Trump\u2019s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, said, \u201cMy time on the trail has included swing states.\u201dAnd, indeed, this particular election cycle has often felt more like a grim, if surreal, slog (Did that Trump supporter just bare her teeth at me?) than an ecstatic, booze-fueled romp (Wheels up, rings off!).In its own way, however, the 2016 election poses a separate set of challenges for the show: How to deliver compelling fiction when the reality playing out on Twitter and on television screens across the nation often already feels like a scripted political farce.Ms. Kelly, for instance, has covered the election up close as her own network faced a scandal; Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman, was forced to resign in the wake of a sexual harassment lawsuit, and began informally advising Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019ve said many times, if only people knew the real behind-the-scenes stories at any news organization, and not just Fox, let me make that clear, they would be shocked,\u201d Ms. Kelly said.Instead, \u201cEmbeds\u201d hopes to bring a knowing authenticity to the lives of young people, struggling earnestly and mightily, in situations they may not necessarily be equipped to handle. The show will flick at themes including what Mr. Conroy views as the \u201cfair\u201d criticism of the media and the Stockholm syndrome, to which young reporters sometimes succumb.On the news media, Mr. Conroy said, \u201cIndividual reporters are just trying to do their jobs and they\u2019re trying to do it really well and they\u2019re trying to inform the public,\u201d adding that, \u201cit\u2019s all the big decisions being made off the trail that disappoint people.\u201dOn the quandary embedded reporters can face, Mr. Conroy said, \u201cYou want to be a good journalist, and be antagonistic, but you also know that as soon as the candidate loses, you lose, too.\u201dMike De Luca, who was a producer of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d and is an executive producer of \u201cEmbeds,\u201d said he was struck by young reporters making such hefty decisions. \u201cI was a Gen X-er in the movie business, where the only consequence of a bad decision is the loss of money and a bad movie,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to affect elections with the next tweet, it\u2019s a tremendous responsibility.\u201dThen there are the more quotidian details, like consuming only cookies for an entire day, or making rookie mistakes. For that, Mr. Conroy has been able to draw on his experiences. He recalled a moment early in 2007, when Mr. Romney approached Barack Obama, then a senator, at a Labor Day picnic in New Hampshire to say hello, the sort of footage that a television network would have loved to own four years later, when the two men battled each other for the White House.Mr. Conroy dutifully shot it all. \u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Conroy said, \u201cwas I left the time stamp on my camera,\u201d covering over the meeting.\u201cI sent the video back, and everyone was like, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it wouldn\u2019t actually appear. I thought it was just in my viewfinder.\u201dAnd then, there is the sex. The pilot opens with the aftermath of a three-way sexual tryst involving an embed; the politerati are already buzzing about just which real-life reporter may have inspired the juicy scene. (Mr. Conroy says the opening love triangle is not based on any one person or incident.)Ms. Kelly, asked if the threesome scene seemed plausible when she first read the script, laughed and said, \u201cI was never an embed nor ever in a threesome, so it wasn\u2019t that I could relate to anything in particular in that scene, but it did not strike me as impossible.\u201dTaylor Zakhar, a 24-year-old actor who plays one of the embeds, reached out to several campaign reporters, past and present, to learn more about the gig. \u201cWhat surprised me most with the actual embeds was they had personal lives and they had time for \u2014 let\u2019s be real \u2014 sex,\u201d Mr. Zakhar said.Between waking up at 6 a.m., the three- and four-city days, editorial responsibilities and late nights at the hotel bar, Mr. Zakhar asked, just how did they fit in a romantic life? \u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018Believe me, we fit it in,\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re all staying in the same hotel, we have call times at 5 a.m., we\u2019re working until 7 p.m., then we\u2019re learning our six scenes for the next day, which is our version of sending our editorial notes into our desk,\u201d Mr. Zakhar said. \u201cSo we\u2019re sort of living our versions of the embed life.\u201dSo, has anyone started hooking up yet? \u201cNo, no!\u201d the actor protested.Then, like a good skeptical young embed, he added: \u201cNot that I know of. No one has hooked up yet that I know of.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.\u201cCountries like Germany are well aware of data privacy, and it has made them more wary of where data is kept,\u201d said Gregor Petri, a cloud computing analyst at the technology research firm Gartner in Veghel, the Netherlands. \u201cLocal data sovereignty has become important, and American companies are now aware of that.\u201dThere is also a more basic explanation for American companies\u2019 expansion into European cloud computing: a growing amount of money to be made.Europe\u2019s market for so-called cloud application services, or software that is run virtually across the internet, is expected to more than double, to $16.1 billion, by the end of the decade, according to Gartner. That will still correspond to just one-third of the North American market, whose value is expected to reach $47 billion over the same period.Despite that relatively small size, Europe\u2019s market remains one of the largest for American cloud providers, many of which are increasing investments worldwide as companies and individuals increasingly rely on cloud-based services \u2014 such as iCloud, from Apple, and Dropbox, the online storage company \u2014 in their daily lives.In an interview, Rainer Strassner, manager of Microsoft\u2019s cloud program in Germany, said the country\u2019s law protected data stored on the servers there from information requests by foreign governments, including the United States.While such investments have focused primarily on business customers, other American tech companies have made similarly large investments aimed at speeding up digital services for everyday users across the 28-member European Union.Facebook is also working on its own Irish cloud computing center, while expanding an existing site in Sweden.Advertisement"}

The temperature rises. The Blue Angels buzz overhead for Fleet Week as tens of thousands of business technology types descend on the city for Salesforce.com\u2019s annual conference.This year\u2019s Salesforce shindig comes with a little extra noise: For weeks now, there have been reports that the company, which makes online software to help users manage tasks like sales and marketing, is looking to buy Twitter.It is not a stretch to say that this would be a puzzling move. Salesforce has become a staple of San Francisco. It is arguably the city\u2019s biggest tech employer, and the soon-to-be tallest building in town will carry the company\u2019s name. While it has never had big profits, the Salesforce business appears stable and growing.Just a few miles down the road from Salesforce\u2019s main office is the home of Twitter, a company with a much-better-known brand but a far less successful business. Twitter is a giant of social media, of course, used by celebrities, athletes and presidential candidates. But it is struggling with growth and its problem with trolls, a term for those who torment others online, and various sorts of hateful content have proved hard to fix.How the two companies would jell is not clear. Could Salesforce absorb all of Twitter\u2019s content to improve its artificial intelligence projects? Could Salesforce help its customers gain a better understanding of their brands by having close access to the world\u2019s Twitter feeds? And would any of that justify putting up with Twitter\u2019s problems?\u201cThis would be a disaster,\u201d said Joel Fishbein, managing director at BTIG, a financial services firm. \u201cBenioff is a visionary, but this could blow up.

EBay and Skype didn\u2019t work, before eBay sold Skype to a group of investors. Cisco Systems, the networking technology company, tried to get into the consumer electronics business with acquisitions like Pure Digital, but it eventually shut down the whole consumer effort.

{"Headline": "Nintendo Switch Reaches for a New Market With Home-and-Mobile Console", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byThe Japanese game giant provided the first look at a new console it is developing that will do double-duty as a portable game system outside the home and one that will serve in the traditional role, connected to television sets.Other game companies have toyed around with similar approaches in the past with limited success, but the Nintendo Switch, as the device is called, is the first from a marquee games company to so assertively seek to erase the boundaries between home and mobile gaming.\u201cNintendo Switch allows gamers the freedom to play however they like,\u201d Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9, the president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America, said in a statement. \u201cIt gives game developers new abilities to bring their creative visions to life by opening up the concept of gaming without boundaries.\u201dThe device is another example of how Nintendo often zigs while its rivals zag. Sony and Microsoft have both designed high-end consoles that have appealed to hard-core gamers with the best graphics, and both have either released or are developing hardware to enable virtual reality experiences through their consoles.Nintendo, in contrast, has been more concerned with giving gamers novel ways of playing games, rather than creating the most immersive experiences possible. It struck gold with the motion controllers of the Wii and has one of the most powerful stables of game franchises under its control, including Mario and Zelda. It later stumbled with a successor console, the Wii U, that used a tablet-like controller as a secondary screen to televisions.With its new system, Nintendo seems focused on giving gamers more flexibility about where to play. While the company did not provide details on price and many features, it published a YouTube video on Thursday showing how Nintendo Switch is based on a hand-held device that resembles a tablet computer.When a player is on the go, two controllers can be slid into slots on either side of the device, giving players more traditional controllers than are normally used for games on tablets. When a player is at home, the device can be inserted into a dock connected to a television. The controllers are removed from the Nintendo Switch and held in each hand, or connected together into a single controller with an optional accessory.Nintendo will also sell an optional controller that more closely resembles those used to play games on Sony and Microsoft consoles. The console will be released in March, Nintendo said.The video shows people playing games on Nintendo Switch while sitting in their living rooms, flying on planes and riding in vehicles. It shows them competing in a multiplayer game on one screen at a party and on multiple devices sitting in public. It suggests Nintendo Switch will be good for e-sports, the growing field of organized competitive gaming.\u201cNintendo always surprises,\u201d said John Taylor, an analyst at Arcadia Investment Corp., a stock research firm. \u201cI think they checked off an awful lot of boxes with this.\u201dMr. Taylor believes the timing of Nintendo\u2019s announcement, ahead of the holiday season, is telling, as Sony and Microsoft will be wooing more casual gamers to their consoles. He said the appetite for a converged gaming device that works equally well on televisions and on the go is unproven.\u201cThere\u2019s no large, demonstrable market, from my perspective, that shows the popularity of that kind of game play pattern,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could get established if Nintendo introduced a game that really made that kind of play-pattern super fun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
